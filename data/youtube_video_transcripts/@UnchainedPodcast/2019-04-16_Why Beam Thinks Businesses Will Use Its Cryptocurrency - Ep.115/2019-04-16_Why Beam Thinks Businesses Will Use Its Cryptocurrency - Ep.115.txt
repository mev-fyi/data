hi all Laure here just a quick note before we get started today I love doing this podcast but the conversation is pretty one-way it would be great to have more of a dialogue and there's a fantastic opportunity coming up meltem two mirrors of coin shares and shailaja bond Putra of future perfect ventures and i are all teaching a crypto workshop at Omega Institute in Rhinebeck New York from September 20th to the 22nd it'll be weakened of yes talking crypto but also of doing yoga eating healthy food and enjoying the outdoors on omegas 250 acre campus from my days as a yoga instructor I remember many of the yoga and meditation teachers I Revere with lead workshops here so I'm so honored to be teaching my own even if it's on a very different topic check out the show notes for the link

relationships cipher trace is helping you grow the crypto economy by keeping it safe and secure my guest today is Alexander zidle s'en CEO of Bheem a cryptocurrency based on the member Wimble protocol welcome Alexander thanks for really excited to be here love your podcast and I expect a very interesting conversation last week I had on core members of the grin team listeners should definitely check that episode out if you haven't yet it was fascinating and they described the minimal protocol but since this is complex technology and it's always useful to hear different explanations can you describe the member Wimble protocol yeah absolutely so remember when the protocol is a very nice invention allows for full confidentiality on a blockchain without any scalability penalty now the protocol works very differently from all the previous families of protocols especially you know Bitcoin and all the related profiles so the key thing I would say is that remember Wimble there's no such thing as an address instead every user holds a set of keys and each one of those keys looks a coin or a UTX all right well we we I like to mention that as a safe deposit box with coins unspent transaction output for people who don't know what that is unspent transaction output this that's correct so the blockchain if you look at it actually holds a set of all those safe deposit boxes all the same deposit boxes look exactly the same from the outside like exactly like same kind of gibberish train you can't tell anything to see then there is a lot of those safe deposit boxes and each box has an owner but only the owner knows which one is theirs right so when a transaction happens the owner of the input boxes opens them the recipient creates a new deposit box that would be an output and the sender puts the change into output for herself if needed and this construction of the input safe-deposit boxes and the outputs and deposit boxes is signed by both parties and then is sent to the blockchain for validation of the miners the validators they don't know neither who sent who is the sender nor who is the recipient and we also don't know the values the only thing that you need to validate is that the sum of all the inputs equals the sum of all the outputs and also that all the values are positive this is very important and by validating that they actually pronounce this transaction as legitimate and this eventually this new state the blockchain becomes known to everyone right so the transaction is actually transition from one set of safe-deposit boxes to another one so that's what we will and when you said that it's important that all the values are positive can you just walk us through like why that is and if yeah one was negative absolutely so so as I mentioned if me Alex I once sent to you or let's say 50 beam I would take a safe deposit box of 80 for example that's let's say that's what I had because I just mined it so I would divide it we would in this transaction our input would be aging and one out of 50 and the other one the change for myself would be 30 and then you know we validate yeah whatever the inputs are equal the outputs rights of h e equals 30 plus 50 all good but we could do a neat trick like that I could take a Z give you 180 and give myself minus 100 write the sum of the inputs would still equal the sum of the outputs right because 80 equals 180 plus minus hundred right it's age in both sides but here we would actually print money right you would get we would take 80 create 180 for you and then I would get a negative amount of money which actually would create an overflow and might even create like it's huge number and that's that's obviously legal so that's why the validators need to make sure that all the values are positive and for that we're using a flavor of zero knowledge proof hopeful approves that actually validate that both offers are in a certain range between zero range between zero and a very large number again without the validator seeing the actual values how did you come to hear about the min bow and bull protocol and then launch beam so the team heard about the protocol somewhere in the end of 2017 and back then you know there was already some development going on by the Grimm team and it was decided that it can be good to create an alternative implementation we had a good development team and started working on that we all a Mateen we all share an understanding that a currency must be confidential right if we really want something to be used as a monetary instrument confidentiality is of paramount importance because nobody actually likes their finances to be exposed not the private people and definitely not businesses so if we hope to realize that crypto dream of cryptocurrencies being used and meaningfully as money whether whether its store of value means of exchange or combination of that that means conscience failing and the middle window protocol actually is the first protocol that the first architecture that allows confidentiality has built in from the ground up and has also no scalability penalty right other implementation of privacy coins like sea cash on arrow and others they do provide privacy but at the price of a very large block chain the transaction sizes are much bigger because you have to hide stuff while I'm in one ball all the protocols look in such a way that you don't have anything actually to hide and it's much more scalable so so realize that it was the path to the future and thus the project was born and how much lighter do you project it will be than those block chains like maybe per transaction or person unit yeah so our calculations suggest that it should be like 1/3 to 1/10 of Bitcoin per transaction it's still somewhat early to say because the the size of the blockchain is actually dependent on the number of you th souls most see and it depends on the usage right so if we all use a lot of different I mean if we were to make a lot of very very very small transactions you know breaking down each of the UT EXO's into like millions of pieces then blockchain would grow in in one way but if we use you know larger amounts then it would be it would be smaller so so we're doing some analysis so right now I think the blockchain per transaction is somewhat smaller than Bitcoin but not much but again right now you know the blocks are still not full so we cannot say that the you know it's been just three four months so it'll be continuing to monitor to monitor that and eventually will become much smaller in size and then compared to Monaro and z cash do you have a projection so in our research we saw and we did some calculations and we published an article in our medium post just looking in at officially published his stats of blocking sizes and transaction counts so Z cash was like nine times or ten times bigger for transactions in Bitcoin and Mon arrow before the latest upgrade was like was I think 25 times bigger than a Bitcoin and now it's just five times bigger than Bitcoin per transaction after the new operate so infer Z cash were those numbers based on the shielded transactions or donations like including everyone okay everyone so probably a shielded transaction is you know even much bigger okay and what were you doing before you launched meme so myself I have a background in software development entrepreneurship and I started my first company in 2005 I co-found company called Marius and we're doing a lot of things in peer-to-peer fresh peer-to-peer file-sharing networks that were super popular back then you might remember Amelie donkey so we were doing now I'm excited some kind of civil attacks of those networks trying to push legitimate content into those networks to monitor those networks we also did peer-to-peer file sharing on the mobile so it was was pretty exciting back then and you know now when I'm looking at the blocking them seeing that blocking solved some of the technology problems that were inherent in those p2p file sharing networks where as I mentioned you know an actor that was you know whose purpose was not exactly to share free content but say to monitor the network could you know easily do that or even push content that was you know paid which came looking looking back there was kind of a stupid idea because obviously very few people wanted to pay us to buy songs on an emu but you know we did that as well we did you know so kind of social networking file sharing on on the mobile back in the Symbian days you're a member of the operating system was very nice technology by Nokia after that I had another startup where I actually almost single-handedly created the piece of software those a desktop dictionary you could click like any word on your screen either in the browser or your words off the matter anywhere and get instant translations to like multiple languages and definition from Wikipedia Wiktionary you know videos or pictures describing the notion that was like a very very nice little startup which was eventually acquired by largest rayleigh conglomerate then I did a lot of product management work for a company called we find we're doing big data analytics of networking traffic and then of application usage worked with carriers and cable companies in the States and then I spent about two years in a venture fund here in Israel investing in late stage growth leases companies in various areas from you know semiconductors and conductors to software to 3d printing and such so a pretty diverse background and to add to that my like my MA is an applied linguistics so so I and I think it's it's in a better you know I like to think that it's good to have like a broader view on different technologies and you know different things in general I saw on your FAQ that some people asked why if you like the member when well technology you didn't just join the grin team since they had started working on an implementation of the memo memo protocol back in the fall of 2016 and you guys got started in March 2018 so why did why not just join grin so you know we we believe in this funded startup mentality and we believe that a dedicated team that gets paid can do much more than a team that is not incentivized and that's that's why we actually builds beam and I think we've proven that you know our execution is really fast and pretty high-quality and we plan to continue into it doing doing more in and delivering more stuff really quickly so we thought that again a much better way a much faster way and hopefully our quality way to create a project like that is to have funding and that actually enables you to do a lot of different things you know starting from you know traveling to conferences to hiring a very good development team and paying salaries and a lot of other stuff so most from what you know from my experience and I mean if you look around most of the startups in the world are funded and also get some benefit in the success from the success of what they're building so we thought it was great technology and a great opportunity to build something very valuable for community and do it and you know in the past way all right yeah we'll come back to that topic a little later because I want to ask a bit more about that but first let's kind of draw out some more of you know what beam is about so who are the customers you're targeting with beam so right now the customers are you know Bemis let's exhibit so beam is a confidential cryptocurrency trying to be best-in-class confidential cryptocurrency both in terms of performance privacy usability everything so right now our customers are crypto enthusiasts miners traders who are you know doing doing stuff with beam we really want to push beam as a means of payment for various service services you know starting from privacy oriented stuff like begins and eventually more so we're not not working on integrations with payment processors so that merchants can start accepting beam right now crypto is unfortunately not used that much as means of payment you know I'm not talking just about our currency with crypto in general so it will it will take time but we want to be there once once this starts happening we want to have all the pull the pieces in place now later down the road we also want to enable businesses to access confidential currency and eventually be able to pass AML tests for the currency if they desire to do so so the bigger long-term vision is to create a layer that is the best confidential crypto currency but then add more layers that would allow people who want that to create some sort of history that can be used to also pass AML and also present audit yeah can you walk through what that would look like then so maybe there's a business and I you gave that example of a VPN and I wasn't sure by that do you mean a customer using a VPN could pay using a privacy coin yeah that's a use case that that is very valid today right there there are a lot of places where people don't want to expose their internet traffic to the government or or to other people they use VPNs but if we think of it now I use at the end with usually have to pay for that so the same government can actually know that I paid for this vdn if I'm not using a confidential means of payment and beam is such a means payment that can be used for acquiring those services it kind of is a perfect it's a perfect match but there other stuff as well of course other stuff as well and with the van when you were talking about kyc like what's an example of a company that would do that or with auditing etc so the KYC is much later down the road and the division is that you know imagine a department store or an online merchant that is like Amazon right or another country's mentioned a web web store that sells you know books or or stuff or you know what let's just imagine a regulated exchange right like I think the sponsors of this show or exactly talking about email so so an exchange in some places when you bring a bunch of points to the exchange thing they want to do some tests right they want to make sure that they won't be attacked by the government for for you know failing those email tests so what we want to enable in the future is to enable the user of the coin to prepare in advance and store some sort of a history that would prove that the money was acquired in illegitimate way or in other words to pass the m/l tests place by while still being fully confidential right because today you know with Bitcoin you can pass those tests but the prices that everybody sees everything right with the confidential currency today it's very hard to pass those tests because there is no trace at all but a mention situation where you could create such a trace which will be confidential but you could show it to somebody you trust or kind of have to trust and then they would they would check this history and say okaythis those funds are legit and we can accept them so how do you persuade businesses to use Beam is it going to be done with a typical sales team who got pitching this cryptocurrency to businesses and how will that work when both both a merchant and then who are their supplier whoever you know when both sides need to agree to use beam like how are you gonna convince you convince both sides or how does that part work well so first of all businesses do realize and will realize more that using a non confidential cryptocurrencies problem right we don't need to be go door-to-door and try to sell them on that will do the through partnerships you know with with payment integrators and so on so our goal is just to enable that so so first businesses will realize that they need confidential currency because as a business you can't just expose all your books to everyone right and then they will also need to realize that some of them at least need to do some sort of recording right and pass some sort of tests and so we are you know playing to develop the technology that would allow both and when businesses will start looking for cryptocurrency to use that will be the cryptocurrency they will be able to use actually because others would let either confidentiality or this opt-in audit functionality and one other thing is we've kind of seen that one of the issues with a number of these cryptocurrencies where people have attempted to get merchants or banks to use them is that the price is not stable compared to you know a more traditional currency that we transaction such as the dollar so how are you going to get businesses to use this currency that may have a fluctuating price why not make beam a private scalable stable coin so that's a great question that's one of the bigger problems in the crypt is one of the things that's hurting adoption so be right now is a cryptocurrency but the next step in the development is turning beam into a platform by enabling people to issue other kinds of tokens on the platform and some of those tokens can be stable points right so what we're now actually thinking about building bridges to aetherium so people could lock certain assets on aetherium for example stable point and issue is exact for presentation on beam and then trade in full confidentiality right and this is true for other tokens as well we can think about sto tokens with other stuff because for any kind of transfer of value in most cases he wants confidentiality right you don't want your value transferred in public weights not I didn't follow so you're saying now that weight like businesses won't actually use beam that beam will be used to issue other coins so businesses will use both both possibilities right so in time cryptocurrencies might become more stable in terms of their value or you know you even know if we think if you look at the Bitcoin or even being for that matter but you know we don't have such long history and then compare it to some fiat currencies in you know places like Venezuela or others so our currencies are much more stable than that and hopefully in the future they will become more stable so they will be more usable by businesses in the same way by the way even today some of the businesses not many but some of the businesses do use Bitcoin right especially in our ecosystem so some people accept Bitcoin and you know either converted to Fiat or or some even don't do that so just keep it that way it will give people the options of using beam as as a currency for the confidential weight or use you know stable coins issued on the beam network not by us most likely we'll just create those bridges and allow confidential trading of stable coins on be you've said that the work on beam in 2019 we'll move along two tracks beam core and beam compliance can you describe each track and what work is entailed in each of those so actually most of the work in 2019 will be based on beam core and being poor is just building the best-in-class privacy coin and an echo system around it right so and then includes wallets you know where we have a very nice desktop wallets very easy to use now we've just released an Android mannitol it will soon be releasing an iOS wallet so all integrations with different you know other wallets merchants and adding whatever stuff that is required for the functionality above blockchain researching may be additional consensus methods improving privacy as we can so all this is beam core and beam compliance is a longer-term project where we're now researching the ways of making it possible for a confidential point to also be opted in compliant and know from what I've read you've said that this will enable or that there will be like a compliance suite that you've described as quote a complex piece of software incorporating various use cases integrated with third-party services and conforming to country specific regulations can you give some examples of who or what kinds of companies those third-party services would be and how your the software would function so I'll give you an example imagine a company that wants to accept beam as four payments of for its services but they want to make sure that they are they have a way to report their transactions and the and we also want to say kyc their clients or be able to check their history so they will have this very specific piece of software let's call it the business wallet that will allow them to may keep the history of all their transactions be attached specific documents to each transaction or require specific documents from the counterparty for each transaction and then store a reference to those documents on the blockchain after the transaction is completed so for example a business page for supplier in beam they would initiate a transaction and you know the wallet will actually request the supplier to us to attach an invoice to the transaction and the invoice will be reviewed by the payer and agreed and then you know once they click OK this transaction will be sent to the blockchain and it will also include a reference to all the document package which can create you know invoices contracts it might might also the business might demand kyc from the sender or the receive and of the funds so those third-party providers can be kyc providers it can also be auditors that will need to interface with the blockchain and with this off change storage of documents to be able to validate the full transaction list of this particular wallet we're gonna discuss the consensus algorithm and they're raised and venture capital after the break but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors did you know that if money laundering were an economy its GDP would be the size of Canada's large volumes of tainted crypto assets move through financial networks often below the radar of banks cyber criminals use unregulated crypto exchanges to avoid detection no wonder governments around the world are rolling out tough new anti money laundering laws for crypto currencies complying with those laws isn't easy banks and exchanges need the best crypto currency intelligence available to avoid penalties now you can use the same powerful AML and compliance monitoring tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy to learn more visit cipher trace comm slash uncheck gained back to my conversation about being with Alexander's Idol s'en so for we discussed this briefly you know the differences between BM and other existing privacy coins such as Z Cashman arrow and you talked about how this you know you perceived to be more scalable but those are already kind of like in use so why at this point would someone choose use beam versus one of the other privacy coins better usability and better scalability right better scalability allows more people to use it and better usability as you know we're building now all those wallets you know the user friendly features just makes it easy to use and I think our all space is very Nessun is very small so there are so many people who will be coming into the crypto space in the coming years that you know they will choose the best technology that they think will best fit their their use cases and also something that will be the most convenient to use and be will be there and also again our long-term vision of making the currency business friendly will attract eventually more people and when you talk about how it's more scalable is that something that is apparent to the user do you know what I'm saying like like I I get from a technological perspective why that's an advantage but is that something that they would be aware of and and have some experience with that would make them you know choose something else that is newer at this point very much so for example when you in Seoul you know a big point node you have to download like 200 gigs and it takes like you know depending on your setup it might take several days just to get the thing up and running so and that's that's where people or Montero's is aching 20 gigs and it also takes like tons of time to download it and set it up and write write with with a much more scalable dwarf chain it takes much less time to set it up and you can also run it on smaller devices and even mobile device you can run your own note potentially on a mobile phone which older so you're you're saying that businesses that will use this for payments they'll also run their own notes I think so I think eventually most of the people choose to run their own notes because it's much more secure we don't have to trust anyone and that's what you know crypt is all about right being your own bank and the way to do that is to run your own note all right and so um we talked a little bit earlier about the differences between beam and grin which as I mentioned was featured on last week's episode so why would someone choose to use beam as opposed to grinning so because you know that has the same properties of scalability in privacy that's right a scalability is privacy is arguably the same although we have some you know we have a little bit better implementation I'll Bend aligned with a little bit more detail decoys so a better privacy there we are more usable right now so you know for ridding you you know the UI wallets are just starting to pop up but so far it's mostly CLI which is very very hard to use for a non-technical person we've an online interface yes command-line interface that's correct that you know most unciekin do people just have no idea what what to do with and we right now are completing set up wallets for all the platforms out there we are also doing a lot of innovation and one of the limitation of mobile Wimble is that the two wallets have to talk right in order to set up a transaction meaning that you have to be online you know with beam we are solving we're actually hiding all this complexity using a messaging subsystem that we call this BBS secure bulletin board system where which is distributed and run by all the nodes which actually allows the two wallets to communicate without the user needing to you know even know that these things have them but this will have to be online we're soon at something we call one-sided payments where it will be possible to publish some sort of presets collection of UT EXO's and then let everybody know how to reference it and then people will be able to pay to this sets or to this page of those UTS those without the recipient wallet being online at all so it will be much more convenient and we're working again on the mention of other stuff lightning is something we're also looking at so our friendly competition with grin is on usability on innovation and eventually on business friendliness as well on being able to fit the financial ecosystem in the first five years of block rewards on beam what percentage goes to the Treasury because I read in a few places online that it was 20% but in the blog post about that allocation I calculated it to 25% so which one is it it's 20 20 percent exactly because the blog post it was about the emission schedule and it said when the block reward is 80 than 20 sorry when the block reward is 80 beams per block then 20 coins will go to the Treasury and then when it then 10 25% 20/4 every block 20 out of 100 yeah wait it's 20 out of 100 not 20 out of 80 yeah of course yeah of course it's 2,100 right so for every block 80 coins go to the miner and 20 go to the Treasury oh no right right okay yeah okay good no wonder was like why is it say 20 everywhere else yeah I understand where yeah so you've got the impression that the 20 were taking out of the 80 yeah yeah right so I'll need to revisit that article and maybe made it make it clear there because yeah I understand okay okay yeah I think I was confusing the minor reward with like the coin base yeah emission yeah yeah okay so and then also how much did you raise in venture capital a little bit over five million dollars I'm sorry you said five million yeah okay so back to this question about Bheem versus grin so obviously you know we talked about how at least at the base layer they're similar technology wise and then you know you talked about how you're differentiating like on usability and other things but overall I would say the philosophies between the two coins are pretty different um you may have heard in my conversation with the core developers there that they would call the allocation to the Treasury a dev tax and you know you're you're kind of dispensing that amongst the foundation the investor is the core team and the advisors and then of course you've raised venture capital and grins developers rely mostly on donations so you know is that like another area in which you feel like you're trying to differentiate or that people might prefer to work with you with Bheem rather than grin like how do you because I I think for them they would say well this is more like a community effort it's a coin for everybody it's more like Bitcoin in that regard like it's not about us what's your response to that I think of the day you know the philosophy of the project is also important but what's not less or even more important is the actual quality the speed of delivery and the stuff that the team is developing and and giving the community right so I think that and and the quality of the usability would probably be a very important factor for people and as long as the probe the project team is honest and clear about what they're doing you know and we see today right people are mining it by beam and they're mining and by mining it by grin you know in a similar fashion it's you know two projects are you know not not too far from each other in terms of you know the price of the mining power Green is leading but it's not like beam is too much smaller than that so so I think the main factors are the honesty of the team and the quality of the product of team is developing rather than you know how exactly it is funded or not and we've been always very transparent about that and you know so far we're seeing a lot of interest and a lot of positive feedback from the market definitely some people would prefer grin because they feel it's better and it's fine other people would prefer being because they would feel that there is fun a team here that will develop the protocol more and more and more will not need to ask for donation and rely on you know benevolence of some donors and also that the project the tragedy can set aside funds for the foundation that will continue the support of the project and that will be will ensure that you know people are incentivized to build on top of the on top of the protocol even when the initial funds are out a few days after launch beam discovered a critical vulnerability and it's wallet how did you discover it and fix it and was there any no negative impact so there were there was no negative impact whatsoever it was just a you know a beginning of a feature that was not eventually developed that was kind of left left hanging by our developers you know we just discovered that during some routine you know review of the code fix it pretty quickly unfortunately because it's allowed potentially in a certain scenario this thing allowed stealing the funds we couldn't we didn't want to like immediately disclose it and and we had to release like close source wineries and ask everyone to update and wait for several days before we actually release the source code with a fix and that was like I think that created some sort of confusion in the community but you know eventually it was all result and we're fine and shortly after that your blockchain also experienced a stoppage of about two and a half hours what happened there so what happened there was an interesting case of collision of two UT EXO's there were cases where people were running and still are running like the same wallet with the same seed right waltz with the same seed on two different machines right and in this in certain scenario created like a combination of two you TXO from that same wallet same but different and those two UT exomes kind of stuck together and created a block that could not be validated or processed and it just created this this Holt okay and it took us some time to find the situation and then we just issued a fix it was actually in that case we were very transparent to the community and it was fixed I think in like yes I said two and a half hours and it was like a moment of you know a testing of our communication and technical skills as well and we went through that you started' beam in March 2018 and launched in January 2019 grynn started development in fall 2016 and you referenced earlier how you felt that going with a VC funded company that had the incentives built in you know enabled you to come up with a better project and to move faster but do you feel that the speed with which you launched as part of the reason that these two issues cropped up almost immediately after the launch regardless how much you write - how much you test it we see projects like Z cash discovering bugs years after the release so it's hard to say I think software inherently whether you do it quickly or Ori take a little time and apparently his bugs and this is like an inevitable fact of life I I hope we don't encounter such situation in the future but you never know the main thing is that if we do we fix them and continue in the case of Z cash the bug your right was found quite a bit later but in this case these happened like right after launch and so the wallet vulnerability presumably could have been found a little bit you know if you would wait it maybe a little bit longer to to launch and seem perhaps with the blockchain stoppage wouldn't you say so that you know it's it's one like in a way maybe those are more they should have been perhaps more obvious problems if they happen so soon after launch probably yes I don't think any amount of you know waiting can guarantee that there are no puss so yeah you know you you might be right but you know if we had waited for several more months maybe we we wouldn't have those maybe not because until you launch something there are some things that you just cannot test in the lab right so it's it's kind of hard to answer here how has being being governed beam is to be governed by the team so we have like the core team of the project and we are creating our roadmaps we're having you know developer discussions all the time inside the team it's going very similar to the startup where there are several key stakeholders the team is relatively small so it's not just you know myself or our CTO or somebody else that just makes all the decision all the decisions everything is being discussed with you know development team the business team and then you know we decide what's the next thing we want to build and then we're just going with it let's talk about the beam foundation how will that function so that foundation will have be point set aside it's 20% of the treasury right is set aside for the foundation the foundation will be run by a board of directors which will will you know once we have it set up we'll start going out and looking and offering people to join the board of directors and the board will just issue grants either for something the foundation thinks needs to be developed or for things that people suggest that they want to develop in a similar way like zkh foundation does and maybe some others and where will it be based hopefully twitter lose we're working to set up in Switzerland okay when do you expect it to be to be launched well it should be like in a couple of months from now we started the proces already it just not very transparent unfortunately with the authorities things take time so we are working on that that's what I can say and you plan not to have anyone from the company on the foundation board correct no there may be somebody from the company at least in the beginning because you know we have to set it up but later on we'll probably fade out or maybe happily one seeps out of a larger number of five or seven okay yeah I was gonna ask if after once seeing what happened with Tasos where they didn't have any of the creators on the Foundation Board and they ended up in a power struggle with their board members if that was something that you know was giving you pause about not putting any company team members on the board but it sounds like you plan to do that no we're still not we're not try person sure yet so so when we set it up it will be run by then the original team members they because you have to have some people in the beginning to just set up the structure and then we'll attract more people from the outside and then we'll see you know it depends but again the goal is not to be full we might still want to have somebody from the original team because you know these are the people who understand the project arguably best at the moment apiece all right let's talk about your mining algorithm you chose the equi house minding algorithm why it was pretty well known back then so we didn't want to innovate too much in that area and we just took something that was well-known memory intensive so actually hash was there so we modified the parameters and started using it and for listeners who are familiar with proof-of-work and proof of steak but maybe not egg wash can you describe how that works so it is solving what's called a birthday problem so it's about finding collisions in large sets sets of numbers that's probably as much as I can explain in you know in this format I'm not not an expert in how exactly Henry Nash works but basically that is to say it's like meaningless cryptographic puzzles that are being solved by going through huge amounts of numbers and just trying each of them one by one in recent months a number of coins using the egg wash mining algorithm were 51% attacked such as n cash now called horizon and Bitcoin gold why did you choose egg wash anyway despite us seeming vulnerability I think that would be true for any GPU mind algorithm we hatch or not the algorithm itself is not does not have anything specific that makes it easier or more difficult to attack okay despite the track record yeah I think the track record is not because of the algorithm but because it's just popular on GPUs so the probability of this 51% attack you know the possibility of this attack is because people can take order to be use and just you know turn them on to a specific protocol and try to monster kind of an attack and it doesn't matter which algorithm which specific algorithms being used it's not like a green hash is more vulnerable than any other algorithmic runs on GPUs and so are you aiming to move off GPU mining eventually yes so we plan to do two hard Forks one somewhere in July and another one somewhere in December meaning that until then it won't make sense for anyone to start work on an ASIC but once we announce the second one and we not the exact algorithm that will be used if you will be able to start preparing the races and meaning that's our in the middle of 2020 there will be a six on the market and that that will be used for mining rather than the GPS and basically you don't want to announce what the what the future changes are because you want to kind of what get as broad a swath of miners as possible and then later to introduce more security to the network then you'll have more Asics as that the thinking there yeah I mean the whole point to announce the part Forks and not to announce what exactly they will be is to to signal to the market that it doesn't make sense to start building a six now okay because if I were to say the exact algorithm that will be there in December you know people will start spending money probably I mean oh at least something they would have like this they would be able to start you know developing an ASIC to mine but right now we don't want that we want to keep the mining more democratized to allow like every person who has a GPU at home to mine some clean points and we also want the network to grow a little bit to make it to make it worthwhile for people to develop Asics right because we don't want to be in a situation where we're you know there's a very very small number of a six because the network is small so it only makes sense to people to buy like a small number of those Asics and then you end up with like very very few people controlling the whole networks with a bunch of Asics so you want to grow first and then let people develop Asus yeah I think that's one way in which actually you your philosophy is similar to grins because they're doing something yeah where they're also trying I mean I guess a lot of these projects are doing that so let's talk a little bit more about the friendly competition between you and grin beam funded a security audit for grin why well first of all you know we are with them and specific help out you know just sort of you know being friends but also we both both both projects are doing nimble limbo right and if there is like a big security hole in limbo limbo then it's not good for either of us right so that's what we felt it was like it made perfect sense you know to to donate money to this particular purpose and you know and I think it was well very well received yeah I wonder what you know I don't think you asked them about that but I think they would I mean they were grateful and and I think we understood that it kind of makes sense because you know we're both doing the same horrible yeah yeah I'm sure I mean and as you know we've been talking about they are a protocol where they're primarily donation funded so um you know whether it comes from you or from somebody else it it's a donation so throughout the show you've talked about some of the new features that you plan to launch on grin can you talk more about anything sorry unbe mccann you talk more about any that you haven't mentioned yet or maybe further elaborate on certain ones that you might have mentioned briefly okay so we just released something the cold payment confirmation which is an important feature and in some way maybe a first step to this possibility of undergoing audit so this is something that allows me to send you some funds and then be able to prove with a reference of the blockchain that I did send you this exact amount it's an important thing because in theory you know I could send you a thousand beam but then you could deny that you know you could say well I only received a hundred right we would we would have a transaction kernel I mean I could prove that there was a transaction but I couldn't prove the amount so this feature allows us both to sign some sort of confirmation which nobody else can see and it's kept in the wards but if there is a disagreement later down the road then I can prove that I did send this particular amount and that you actually saw that and signed it or your wallet did so that's that's one important thing another feature that we talked about briefly is one-sided payments right so this allows a merchant or a you know somebody who's seen donations to create something off chain you know some something some set of recipient to TXO is actually and allow other people to send money to that place without the need for the recipient wallet to be online at all that's that's also very important other exciting stuff I mentioned the mobile wallet so this is pretty cool and you know we have android/ios is on its way now we have a test net version but we'll have the maintenance person soon and we're looking at ways to to see how full milk can run on the mobile as well it's it's a long way but there is some development there pretty exciting well yeah and that's where scalability comes in right so in theory is possible and that this would be like more more security right and more and more democratized networks right because if I today in most bubble wallets just talk to a specific to to some random or not run a node and it means that somebody else is kind of securing your funds if you if you have your own though then it's it's much better more secure another thing is like me we're looking into that on how to implement payment channels on beam because there's a lot of talk about lighting and how it can really improve the payment speed and improve usability of crypto in general so want to be there so looking at that as well also doing some research into privacy of the blockchain there are some claims about potential link ability I'll be take Souls and member limbo so we want to do something along those lines as well atomic swaps in the coming days we'll be demoing an atomic swap between Bitcoin and beam and hopefully during April we'll be releasing that and and then there are next steps like creating it distributed bulletin board for people to start trading without any trusted third party so this is also a big a big thing and you know we just did a survey of our community and this is like the most desired feature to turn in turn turned out to be the most as our feature creating this Atomics wall because people want to be able to you know buy and sell being for Bitcoin without even you know registering on an exchange or doing business with with any exchange and then what about when you said the bulletin board how are you finding bulletin board and how is that different from like an exchange or a Dex so it's sort of a Dex but we're right now we're not going to building a full-fledged ex I think just a board where people post okay I want to buy 500 beam 4 or whatever bitcoins yeah yeah something like that that's that's distributed right but but we'll see but we'll see how exactly we work with the ideas to provide a place for people to post those buy and sell borders right not in a full-fledged ways like you have it on exchanges but in a simpler fashion at least in the beginning later on we'll be looking to add decks as well now in terms of building the platform that I mentioned a couple of times and extending from just using one coin to you know having just one beam point on our blog change of having more assets more confidential assets we're now looking at how we can build bridges to etherium and then enable people to lock stuff on a theorem and then confidentially trade it on beam and then being able to go back to theorem at any moment so what would that look like exactly I don't know if I fully follow that like you have some kind of E or C 20 token and then when you say a bridge so let's say you let's say yeah so let's say you have a die points right and you want to and you realize that whatever you do with them on aetherium is visible to everyone and you don't like that so you would go you would send them to a special place called this bridge which probably be a smart contract with some other software from on our side this month contract locks locks your die coins and issues their representation let's call them B die beam die to your beam wallet and then you have those point on the beam block Taylor you can trade them with anyone you want and it will all work exactly the same confidentiality as the native being talking but will be a different token and then when he wants out you will go to the same bridge and burn your be die and take the necessary amount or the corresponding amount of die from a smart wallet to aetherium wallet all right well sounds really interesting I guess we'll wait to see what the further developments are it's been so great having you an Unchained where can people learn more about you and bheem so our main place
