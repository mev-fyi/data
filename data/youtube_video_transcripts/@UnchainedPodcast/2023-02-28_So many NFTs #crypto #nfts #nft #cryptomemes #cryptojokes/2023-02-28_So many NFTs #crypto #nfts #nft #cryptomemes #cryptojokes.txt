nft industry is panicking and this time it's not because of a weird asset trip it all started when Jeffrey Huang AKA Machi Big Brother a well-known crypto whale sold over a thousand nfts I know what you're thinking I would anyone own over a thousand nfts well he did but he got rid of them he sold board AIDS mutant Apes azuki's he even tried to sell off his own virginity but I don't think that one took some are speculating that this was the largest nft sale of all time which does make sense I mean why would anyone want to sell off their nfts me personally I've just used them to decorate my wall he sold them on blur which is now the largest nft Marketplace by volume here's where it gets weird action his fellow whale Franklin is Bored have been trading nfts back and forth for weeks they're trying to boost trading volume for blur's airdrop which is a multi-month process wherein blur airdrops tokens to large Traders so in essence these whales are just trying to get free stuff it's relatable I mean I spent six hours on Saturday answering surveys online to get one free gift card to Denny's
