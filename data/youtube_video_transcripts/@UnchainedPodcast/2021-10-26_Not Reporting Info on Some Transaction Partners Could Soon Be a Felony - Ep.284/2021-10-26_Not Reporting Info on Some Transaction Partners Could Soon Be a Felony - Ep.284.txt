stake alliance and adjunct professor at the university of virginia law school welcome abe thanks thanks laura today we'll be discussing a provision in the infrastructure bill that amends tax code section 6050i and we'll be talking about its implications for people transacting in crypto or even nfts but first abe why don't you give us a short history of your professional background and how you came to be involved in crypto and what your current involvement is sure so i'm a lawyer uh but got interested in uh cryptocurrency and its fundamental economics which led me to some tax questions because uh uh tax issues were some of the most practical elements of a proper understanding of how decentralized and cryptocurrencies work that got me interested in substantive tax issues and what we're about to talk about today is actually very very different it's not substantive tax but it came up in the in the context of the tax code and this infrastructure bill and that's what brought my attention to it so let's dive into the meat of the discussion then tell us about this proposed amendment to section 6050i what does it require well the first thing is uh to point out that this is something very different than what a lot of people are familiar with in this infrastructure bill this infrastructure bill was passed by the senate in early august and it's still pending now in the house and what we heard about and what eventually garnered headlines and a lot of attention and including debate on the senate floor was a different section regarding the definition of a broker that would be required to report their customers tax information to the irs this is different this is a separate amendment to that same bill but unfortunately hasn't gotten the uh the attention which is what i've been focusing on this provision as you say it's an amendment to tax code 6050i requires recipients of digital assets in a lot of situations to verify and record and report the personal information the social security number address additional personal information of the person from whom they're they're receiving the digital assets and under the current rules to report that to the irs within 15 days and so why have you been sounding the alarm about this uh primarily because i think it kind of slipped by and didn't get the attention it deserves and we'll we'll talk a little bit about why it might have slipped by but the first reason is this was input into an infrastructure bill a spending bill and it was justified there on the grounds of offsetting some of the cost of of spending in this infrastructure bill it's known as a pay for and generally that's saying hey how we're going to pay for this we're going to say increase taxes or maybe close a loophole or or do something that might increase the amount of taxes collected so this was justified as a tax provision but one of the key points i want to emphasize here is that this really is not a tax provision as we typically think of it this is a criminal statute uh it actually creates a a felony that uh is concerned with the collection of information and then a little deeper than that is concerned with really fundamentally guiding and controlling how transactions are made so this is designed to discourage peer-to-peer transactions and transfers of digital assets and what the statute says is that when a business receives digital assets over a certain threshold and we'll talk about that um it's their duty to verify personal information and to report it right now that's on an irs form 8300 and i mentioned that i encourage people to look it up this is uh an existing law and an existing requirement for another type of transaction which is transactions in physical cash between two people uh who we can presume are transacting face to face so the reason that this provision didn't get the attention immediately that it should have is it uses an old statute this was passed in 1984. it was designed to discourage a large cash transactions as it's basically an anti-crime measure anti-money laundering uh anti-tax evasion and and it governs um transactions between two people face to face and and that's what it says it says if you receive cash in this situation over ten thousand dollars uh you need to fill out this form and promptly file it with the government so let's walk through various examples of what complying with this requirement would even look like for different types of crypto transactions um why don't we just start with the basic payment we can walk through some really clear applications but that's one of the problems here and we're going to explore that too where it's very unclear what it will do and how much discretion it gives to the treasury department and again some of these uh violations can be felonies which is which is unique in the tax code even for reporting provisions other reporting provisions um if there's a violation it might be a misdemeanor but this one stands out uh for a being a felony and b uh most of these reporting provisions don't really affect end users and consumers and businesses they're designed to to utilize middlemen like brokers uh and and employers who have this information and lean on them to report this information to the government to ensure proper taxation this one is very different in that it uh puts that burden on anyone and everyone um so uh in a straightforward situation well you know what let's start with it with the cash example because there we can see where it's clear and then we can start seeing how this leads to impossibilities for enforcement or at least compliance the first thing is to note that the the statute is triggered and the requirement to file a report whenever a person in a business situation receives cash it has nothing to do with the tax consequences it doesn't mean that that's might be taxable income doesn't mean that it might even be revenue you can be in a custody situation right where you're holding somebody hands you fifteen thousand dollars and in some circumstances it's your duty to report that even if you're not going to keep it even if you have no claim to it so um in that situation in the cas cash scenario you are required the regulations are very clear you must inspect an id document and and verify that they are who they are and then collect a bunch of information the statute requires a social security number a name and an address and then there's more information required they want to know the occupation of the person who's paid you uh the the the cash um the nature of the transaction and other details about it when you receive that then you have to fill out this form 8300 and again i encourage people to take a look at it and file it with mail it or file it online with the with the irs within 15 days so that's a straightforward transaction if you go tomorrow and buy a car and pay with cash this is what will happen they will ask to to inspect your id they'll ask you for your social security number and they will fill out this form 8300 and i did see that you wrote somewhere or somebody wrote somewhere that on average it takes 21 minutes to fill up form 8300 yeah that's one of the reasons i encourage people to look at this this form and look at the instructions and look at the manuals it's a lot of detail and that's right the government itself estimates it takes over 20 minutes to fill out one of these and so that was a basic payment what if we're doing more like a a crypto trade peer-to-peer um two different digital assets for each other then then what right so what one thing your your hypo gave of a trade of digital assets is let's pause and focus for a second on the on the definition of digital asset in this statute so what it says is any receipt of a digital asset and this was discussed in connection with the infrastructure bill this this very broad definition and it means any form of digital value uh basically involving distributed ledger technology and it might even be broader than that it gives tremendous discretion to the treasury department to say what exactly that is so what that means is um not only is this you know bitcoin when used for a payment but it could be any form of of a digital asset but certainly including things like nfts that we don't think of as as payment devices and that also makes clear that um you could definitely have a situation where the statute on its face commands both people uh to report on the other because again this is based on receiving a digital asset has nothing to do with you know the tax consequences so a situation where one party ends up with an nft another party ends up with some cryptocurrency on the face of the statute they both have to report the other social security number and what about cases in which someone's transacting with a smart contract does this affect that type of transaction or no well there's in some sense there's a lot of open questions because again and this gets to why uh people haven't really focused on this the statute was absolutely presumed that you're talking about two humans handing over physical objects so you know there's some def there's some details about what it means to be a to receive something but in the context of digital assets yeah it's kind of open up in the air what the what the outer limits of that would be and what happens if it is mediated by a smart contract but we can at least assume that in you know certain cases or or think about multi-stake situations you three people three different parties receive um uh you know in a two of three situation who who who might be committing a felony if they don't report it um so so so those are questions about the nature um of a receipt but we can certainly say that in uh a lot of situations you know if there's assets in an address under your exclusive control that's very likely going to be a receipt but it also means it's hard to imagine in the cash context somebody not knowing right but these are permissionless often payments so what happens if you quote unquote receive digital assets and are not uh aware of it or you didn't invite the transaction because again it's your duty then within 15 days under the current rules uh to have verified and reported the information about the the sender on the other side but thinking about smart contracts maybe you had some i've got more thoughts on that maybe you had something particular in mind about uh not necessarily but obviously there are situations right where for instance let's say that you and i are engaged in some kind of transaction and we decide to use an escrow contract rather than an actual third-party escrow service then would you just report my personal information when you do this reporting or i i don't or maybe it's just something that's not resolved well it's not result but it's worth asking these questions because it exposes how incongruous this statute is with the technology that we're dealing with um and there are but it's a great question and we and we should work through it to kind of speculate on what that would mean if if you put money into an escrow contract and it won't be unlocked and in my possession until a future date that's a good question uh my guess is if i were trying to comply with this tomorrow i would say you know it's not mine until i have you know some intuitive notion of of control over it in terms of what a receipt means but it's a very big open question and again one that you don't really run into in the context of of physical cash because you're both there and you know you know when you got it yeah i guess another one would be a peer-to-peer lending happening in d5 but those assets are pulled so again it's not clear if they would require that somehow um you know it is tracked and then the recipient has to has to report but um okay so let's actually just discuss another issue that you raised earlier which is the threshold which is ten thousand dollars it so is that just whatever the value of the digital assets are on at that moment of the transaction that's the most likely interpretation especially if you're dealing with something well anything other than a dollar denominated coin yeah its value on the time at the time or on the date um but but the issue of the threshold is really important for other reasons and again we have to emphasize why this is just so different than than physical physical cash because with cash you can say oh well if it doesn't if it's not a big transaction it doesn't qualify and you don't need to report it but the rules are actually more complicated than that it's the transaction has to be at over ten thousand dollars and that can include related transactions and it can also include payments over time which which under the rules would be one transaction so uh laura if i lent you know if i lent you 50 000 in some digital asset and you made recurring payments back to me what the rules say is that is that's one transaction so as soon as those payments add up to ten thousand dollars that's what triggers the requirement and the 15 day window to make a report and if you continue to make payments when those add up again to 10 000 it trips it again so number one um you've got this duty to to monitor and these valuation questions which you raised um but also explaining why with digital assets the whole definition of a qualifying transaction um you know can be much much broader and extend over a period of time yeah and another issue of course is that prices change a lot even within the course of a day so if i make a payment to you of 9 500 in bitcoin or you know something that's uh similarly volatile then who knows whether or not the irs might say no no no this was ten thousand dollars based on the closing price of that day so um so yeah so that's another issue so um do you what's your take on how possible it is for the sender and recipient uh to comply with these rules because one other issue was that i saw that they're required to keep these records for five years and just kind of on a security level um i just could imagine this could leave to lead to a lot of identity theft because you wouldn't like you'd have to give your information out to all kinds of people that you were transacting with well i guess it depends on how often you transact in ten thousand dollars or more but still um if they're required to hold it for five years how could she be certain that they were holding it in a way that was secure absolutely so this this puts all kind of uh opens up this typically behind the scenes practice of of certain surveillance usually conducted by entities like banks or employers that kind of already have that information in place and it applies this surveillance and storage and security burden on any business as well as some others that might might want to be involved and so that it's a very big concern so not only um is there a requirement to verify and gather this information the first requirement is at the end of the year you have to send a statement to everybody whom you've reported during the year and then just as you mentioned you must keep these records uh for five years so it really radically expands um kind of the implications of the surveillance efforts that the that the government is looking for um by by uh opening it up to potentially any business um and even broader than that i want to make a point about that so this replies to applies to receipts in the course of your trade or business and and um it's kind of you know we we tend to know it when we see it but it's important to note that that's not defined clearly in um the tax code is actually a test which is applied by courts and it has to do with whether you have gain seeking activity that's suitably continuous uh and regular that means that you're uh doing something in the course of trade or business and and that's important to note because uh even even that definition it could be unclear whether certain activity meets that test if you're a miner if you're a staker if you're doing various lending activity or uh significant trading in some cases that can put you into the category uh of of of trade or business but it's not a clear line and again these are felonies um so so so the the the difference can be really important in terms of your compliance and legality yeah and so i did see that that would then be punishable by up to five years in prison and a 25 000 fine which it just out of curiosity actually why is the penalty for this so much more than for other violations well there's some interesting history on this and how this uh you know this this original law was passed in 1984 um and then periodically over the years it expanded even this provision expanded actually we should go back a little bit further uh and this is really important as well to understand how this fits in with other forms of regulation that again you know some of us in crypto are familiar with uh but it's mostly behind the scenes and that is uh the bank secrecy act dating to 1970. and what's key there is is the provision that began with uh requiring banks but only banks to report uh very large ten thousand dollar transactions and in 1970 that was a big deal uh relative to to now because ten thousand dollars then is you know 65 or 70 000 today um so as uh inflation is eaten away with that these thresholds have not changed so in 1984 um uh as a part of a large tax overhaul this provision was added and then over the succeeding years there were gradually amendments to it which number one turned it into a felony because again this is really not uh so much about tax it's about uh crime fighting so in 1988 as part of an anti-drug bill at the height of the drug war that's when this was escalated uh to to a five-year imprisoned uh felony um as well as other little changes right some people might be familiar with the concept of structuring so when there's a rule that says you can only you know you have to be reported if you do something over ten thousand dollars first thing people do is oh i'll bring five thousand dollars in today and six thousand in tomorrow so that's a crime so so the these different elements were added um including most recently i think with uh the patriot act in 2001 strengthening and kind of closing down loopholes and and increasing the amount of uh punishment here and reminds me of one point that's really important here some people might say well i'm not a business and i'm never going to be a business so i'm never going to have to report if i have a receipt of ten thousand dollars or might add up to that over time um but it's important to see how this th this um creates a felony again five years for people who who transact with others so if you're even a consumer consumer making a a payment of 10 000 or more or unrelated transactions if you interfere with the other uh with that business's duty to report the transaction that also is a felony so if you try to dissuade them or you give them false information or give a false social security number um that too can be a felony yeah but i like this thing about what you're required to give them um when i read the you know what the requirements are which are name birth date address social security number and occupation it just feels like you're giving away all the information that someone would need to like fake your identity and and just you know open a credit card um so i i don't know how many people are going to be willing to do that but anyway one other issue that was interesting was obviously crypto transactions are push transactions in which the recipient you know doesn't have to do anything in order to receive a payment so what would happen if someone unknown to the recipient sends them more than ten thousand dollars worth of crypto well the first thing to note is is if uh uh if that recipient says hey you need to give me this information and and and that party says you know willfully refuses hey that's a felony so what's what's going to happen in practice look there's so many unknowns about how the treasury department is going to try and make this this work but you know thinking kind of commonsensically about what you do in these situations is is is the business will report it with the available information uh right and then and then uh do their best and say hey i've tried my best and then it's up to the irs to use those uh those clues i bought a car a few weeks ago and i paid in cash just to kind of experience this um and i was talking to the guy who sees form 8300 a lot and and he was asking for my social security number and he and he kind of made a joke he's like well if you don't give it to me you know no big deal i'll make a note that i tried to get it and then you know the irs will give you a phone call you know he had he had the rest of my information you know he would have done his duty and then i would have gotten a call from from the irs okay so so maybe then it wouldn't be i mean you know as you say the the penalty for this is considered a felony but it seems like at least when applied for cash transactions people who typically work in this area don't seem to think it's such a big deal if they don't dot all the eyes and cross all the t's no no no it's more look uh actually it's a very good question there's all kinds of different penalties and the truth is and when it's a felony that's a crime and you get a jury and reasonable you know prove it beyond a reasonable doubt and you have questions of intent and so on so but but the fact that it's a felony is really important because it can be used and that's hanging out there but there's a lot of other options for the government to do in enforcement and typically it's it's it's fines and those you set a maximum of twenty five thousand dollars actually in some circumstances twenty five thousand dollars is the minimum fine for a certain type of violation but minor violations can can also result in uh smaller fines so it's not always going to be a felony but the the fines are very high but the fact that it's a felony uh is important and it's important for raising attention to what was done in the course of uh a spending bill right in in a tax provision in a spending bill because it really cuts through and makes it should make really immediate and aware to the to the public what is going on in terms of uh government efforts with regard to digital assets generally um and these tax issues because so much of this uh and you know we lawyers who work in this space are familiar with it and in fact a lot of people are because um these questions about what's going on in washington people do pay a lot of attention to it but this really makes it more immediate and puts it in our face because uh because of the way it affects kind of end users businesses and even us just using digital assets so in general what effect do you think that this provision could have on the effort to move to more decentralized business models okay so to to look at this we got to look at kind of the next level implications of this and that as i mentioned before the bank secrecy act so we have a very confusing uh uh regulatory hodgepodge in the united states with the different agencies involved in this but here i want to focusing on something in particular so this this provision which is now sitting in the house to be passed is ostensibly you know literally a tax code provision but it works together with other regulations under the bank secrecy act and the bank secrecy act generally doesn't regulate you and me it regulates banks and financial institutions and financial institutions is actually a much wider category now than people thought if you're a money transmitter and that means you know cryptocurrency exchanges and others that that turns you into a financial institution that brings you under these bank secrecy act regulations those regulations already require financial institutions to report just like this does uh cash when i say cash now i mean physical cash if you transactions involving uh more than ten thousand dollars worth those regulations and this is complicated but they do not yet today include in the definition of cash these digital assets not yet now uh back in last december there was uh new regulations proposed with the outgoing administration in the treasury department and one of those was to alter the definition in in not in the tax code but in the under the bank secrecy act to include digital assets in that definition thereby requiring financial institutions to require to report certain of these transactions now what's important here is and people remember uh there was a lot of uh response to that there was initially a an expedited period for for public comment got a lot of press and there was some pushback and eventually they extended that period and those regulations are still pending um but at least during that time you know it was open to public review and there were comments and criticisms of this measure in terms of what it would do including for issues of privacy and record keeping right even for financial institutions that suddenly had to perform all of this verification and reporting of certain types of transactions but here's the key thing that new regulation hasn't been passed yet this provision unlike that unlike the bank secrecy x stuff which only applies to financial institutions this applies to everybody all businesses and anybody you know working in the course of their trade of business and unlike even that regulatory process um it was put into a spending bill with no discussion and this creates a a felony for the rest of us if this goes into effect if this 60 50 igo amendment goes into effect without the treasury department's bank secrecy act regulations we've extended to everybody something which met with very serious concerns even when applied to merely financial institutions so that's an important but very complicated point to help explain how how inappropriate this procedure was even if you know uh somebody says hey this is a good idea we need to do this it's worth it to kind of cut down on tax cheats or whatever whatever the ultimate justification is um we should be able to find agreement that this is not kind of procedurally the way to to do something that is is so important the other reason it's so important to talk about the bank secrecy act let's let's assume now that the bank secrecy act catches up with uh this new felony which applies to all of us the only exceptions to this reporting requirement and this this is the case now under the cash one is if that transaction is already being reported by a bank or another financial institution okay why is that well that's the goal we they if they're reporting it that you and i don't have to and this is why in your course of your trade or business you you withdraw 50 000 in cash from a bank that's the reason why you don't have to report the transaction including the information from the bank sounds absurd right why would you have to do that well it's because they're doing it for you so what is the kind of fundamental structure and intent of this provision is to discourage the use of before it was large amounts of cash now is to discourage the use of digital assets why well the government would like to uh uh track and and and observe and be able to uh account for these for these transfers so it inc it discourages the use of peer-to-peer technology uh in two direct ways the first thing is hey i don't want to take down your social security number laura and and be on the hook for for all of this stuff and i want to give it to you you don't want to give it to me so forget it why don't we just use a bank transfer okay that's the first instance like forget you know anything digital to begin with let's just go back to the complete legacy system but the second thing is even if we want to kind of nominally use digital assets there's why not funnel it through your bank why not why not use an existing financial institution and therefore they take the surveillance and reporting responsibilities and we don't now maybe that's a good idea um and maybe digital assets you know it's just too costly in terms of compliance and all these law and order objectives but we need to have that discussion right because that very clearly is designed to eliminate the peer-to-peer feature of of this technology and yeah some people may view that as uh purely something to be avoided but a big decision like that should not be hidden and not analyzed and tucked into an infrastructure spending bill right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the government's kind of intentions here but

and get 25 when using the code laura laura the link is in the description back to my conversation with abe so from the government's perspective what would you say is the purpose of this provision like do you think that they're actually trying to get people to use the banks as opposed to using these digital assets on a peer-to-peer fashion or do you think it's just the tax reason like they just think people are avoiding taxes or what do you think is the real reason for this yeah this it's tough and it's like i don't want to speculate on kind of the mental states of the the people who actually put this in too much and that's one of the reasons why it's a problem right we don't have an explanation we don't have uh uh clarity on what the evil is that this is attempting uh to address so people say well what what would i propose and i said well i don't even know what the problem is it hasn't been stated so that but but it is fair to look at this structure of this 1984 law that's being repurposed to do this and that there it is clear that this is uh a crime-fighting effort and it's an attempt to go after uh starting in the 80s in particular kind of drug money and and money laundering and to discourage the use of cash um and that's that's very clear and another point on kind of how this is used in the past and and present and why this is kind of so odd to treat this as a tax provision these forms 8 300 that we've been talking about um these are uses in in fighting crime they're distributed to federal and state law enforcement agencies to help build cases not about necessarily tax evasion but about anything because hey who who and why would somebody be the um having and holding this much cash and it provides grounds to to go investigate people so we know that much about the history of this provision um beyond that look there are there are absolutely legitimate and very serious questions about kind of peer-to-peer technologies right um and the ability to to to do things without uh but but these just deserve very serious discussion and an understanding of competing values and one thing we haven't talked about yet because and it's important to get clarity on what the law does before we turn to an illegal issues is this is very problematic uh under our legal principles and we have a fourth amendment which protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures and there's a whole history there about how the bank secrecy act was upheld in the face of some of these challenges but there's very serious differences here where um at least with banks it's a third party that's that's in put in this position and is reporting uh people's private financial information to the government for these various tax and and other crime fighting purposes but here we're enlisting our neighbors and our other americans other american businesses and saying it's it's our duty to to to report on them and that's very different right it's different legally um it's different in its impact on people and and it works to kind of uh undermine and intentionally so i think the technology that we're all kind of excited about uh but there are there are very serious concerns about whether it's counterterrorism or uh tax enforcement other other crime fighting but on the other hand we've got uh a fourth amendment and we've got principles of of of privacy and those um those need to be addressed uh in the open and not slid into uh a spending bill yeah and before we get um more into the bank secrecy act issues i did want to just ask i did see marketwatch reported that supporters of this provision say that these reporting requirements are needed so the irs can collect taxes that are owed to government and that this would just put crypto on the same playing field as cash do you agree with that what's your response to that yeah it's important to to point out a few things uh first of all form 8300 you're not reporting income you're not reporting even um revenue or anything it's just yes in some sense it could expose people who are working in the cash economy um who who aren't already um have have their their transactions tracked and traced by going through the banking system but i'd love to see an explanation of how that actually works in light of what we already know about the history of this provision calling it on equal footing there's some something seductive about that you know what's the best case for this scenario if you're if you're a lawmaker and presumably don't understand that much about digital assets and what is enabled by this whole realm of peer-to-peer technology there's one way of looking at this looking at a bitcoin right that you say you know what that bitcoin has something in common with you know drug money can you know wads of hundred dollar bills and that is one person can hand it off to another person and the irs and department of justice might not hear about it right that's the argument if you only see in digital asset technology um the this element of of of what it accomplishes you can see why and you say well wow they've got this 1984 law nobody really knows about because it's it's accomplished its goal right people don't transact why why would we transact in in wads of cash if it involves this legal burden and a risk of fines and so on and me having to get your social security number so it's it's to the extent uh cash wasn't already on its way out yeah of course now it's the case yeah you're probably a criminal if you're using large amounts of cash because who else would do it who else would subject themselves to sharing their information and and all of these uh risks of of getting audited or or even prosecuted under the law so it's accomplished uh its goal in that sense i mean that's the best you can come up with is is uh if if you only see bitcoin as an alternative to uh you know a suitcase full of cash um you can maybe see an argument for uh for extending this but um there's a much bigger picture obviously so going back to um the constitutional issues coin center's director of research peter van valkenberg believes that this provision is not constitutional in its original formulation let alone in this uh provision applied to cryptocurrencies so can you explain why it might not be constitutional and how it's survived the song if it's not right so again we have to start with uh the cases that upheld um the bank secrecy act rules in the 1970s which was really was a big development right and i think it's important to look at this in the big in the sweep of history banks have evolved over hundreds and hundreds of years to facilitate different things and it's only really in 1970 that their uh the the government focused on them as kind of as a middleman and the centerpiece of holding access to information that would serve the government's ends in crime fighting uh money laundering and and tax evasion so starting in 1970 and those were challenged and the supreme court's uh basis for saying that no this doesn't the bank's sharing of this information does not violate people's um kind of standard expectations of privacy is saying hey you've handed this information over to a bank and they're a third party and this is information that they record and you know that they've got it so if they share it with us you can't complain under the fourth amendment what's different uh two things have happened since then there are two themes that are important the first is just to note how 6050i is very different right this is not about a bank this is about you and me right this is a situation where i'm not going to ask you for your social security number and all of this personal information as a normal course of me getting this from you um and the government is uh both demanding that i collect it and then and then share that so in other words the third party doctrine uh which is the basis for uh the supreme court's approval of these other collection techniques imposed on third parties like banks doesn't apply here and the second is that even that doctrine of a third party doctrine um has been getting additional scrutiny as it's expanded over the years and i won't go too far into these more recent cases but uh basically it's saying hey just because people share information with third parties doesn't necessarily mean that they no longer have a reasonable reasonable expectation of privacy so those are the two themes which differentiate this and especially when it's expanded to something like digital assets so if this provision does get passed which it looks like it probably will what do you expect will happen wow well you know it hasn't passed yet and and i'm not a parliamentarian or you know uh expert on kind of how these things go so my first emphasis is hey this law hasn't been passed and once it's passed it needs to be signed by the president and until that's happened people need to uh make their voices heard on it so the first step then if it's passed would be to repeal it but then as as indicated by this discussion the fourth amendment absolutely there will be uh legal challenges yeah i did see coin center saying it would be prepared to make a constitutional challenge so then for that to happen does it just entail finding the right case to take to court that's right that's a uh uh its own complicated endeavor uh bringing a a well-informed uh well-considered legal challenge that that uh allows the courts really to to address the core issue and um just actually going back to kind of the different use cases uh or not use cases but app like ways in which this uh provision might be applied so for something like a purchase of nfts would that i guess i guess like you know i it goes back to what you were saying about how it's not clear for some of these transactions how they're even taxable events so the government is saying that this reporting is necessary to collect all the taxes that they're owed then which of some of the different examples that we discussed are actually taxable events in which they would collect taxes from that transaction well it's important to emphasize again this really is not about that so like in the broker provision right the separate thing that involved this debate one of the things that they want from brokers is information about the your your cost basis right things that are very relevant to to to to calculating tax that's not what's going on in this provision again you might have zero tax consequences it may lead them to say oh here's somebody with a bunch of cash let's investigate and see if they've been hiding more cash but there's no direct connection there's nothing on the face of the form 8300 it's not even among the information there uh for you to to explain what the tax consequences would be so um there's there's really nothing oh that's fascinating so i guess i don't i don't fully understand so the irs requires form 8 300 for cash transactions over 10 000 but do they ever collect taxes based on that information that they're provided i'd have to look more closely but i don't think the form 8300 on its own ever would give information that directly determines a tax liability it will tell you um that uh that business received ten thousand dollars and then if if if that ten thousand dollars isn't accounted for in in the tax returns it would give you some place to look but again you're exactly right laura this is this is an important point it does not lead directly to any tax consequences i mean i guess so like going back to the nft example one you know way in which i could imagine it resulting in a taxable event would be if i create an nft and then i sell it to you for more than ten thousand dollars then that's earnings for me so would that be an example yes so so you you file this uh return as the so so you're the recipient of my digital assets in this example right so you sell to me an nft i end up with an nft you end up with that money yes the irs could use it but i don't think that's really how they do use it again this is another reason why this provision is such an outlier in the tax code it's really less about the recipient which are typically you know businesses than it is about the payers the irs is looking for information about the who are these who are these people showing up and paying 15 000 in cash for a car or buying gold or something or now an nft the fair understanding of the purpose of this is less about the business right and more about the person sending cash or not digital assets to the business okay so what do you think would be a better solution here to achieve the government's goals again i want to kind of stay firm on this i don't know what the government's goals are we don't because they didn't announce it it wasn't discussed there wasn't a committee report they weren't an explanation of what this this evil is and that's important really for for kind of gathering opposition to this even if people are saying hey you know we need to be more careful or we can who cares about the fourth amendment and who cares about financial privacy uh those people could still say well at least we should discuss it we should hear what those those those different concerns are so i don't i don't know what the alleged uh danger really is so i don't want to um develop it too soon except to acknowledge yeah these are some very deep questions which is why the technology is exciting um unlike uh you know 50 years ago the pink secrecy act banks and these and and these financial institutions turned out to be a really useful choke point for the way the world has evolved since then they've become really important in ways that they weren't 100 years ago but starting in 1970 they are and as as this technology opens up new possibilities for for all kinds of things and through peer-to-peer and its other features that threatens um that old order and a a system for maintaining surveillance um that the government's become very comfortable with that's a big issue sure and it needs to be addressed but uh we also have uh expectations of privacy we have principles of autonomy um uh and we have a fourth amendment and we have a general principle which says hey uh in this country at least you're free to do things without asking permission and if the government wants to stop you they need to explain what they're doing and justify it and certainly that's the case if they want to attach a felony crime to something that today is completely legal and which is uh something enabled by uh a new technology all right well what do you think the crypto community should do to address this issue wow i mean that's that's i'm fighting for uh attention at this point and if and if we get it uh that's that's a good question um as we know the the the vote in the house has been postponed several times they're now saying it might happen as soon as the 31st who knows um but um you know i wrote a report on this you've mentioned it for the proof of stake alliance i i urge people to look at it um and i tried to lay out the elements that we've been discussing to to explain what this does but i didn't try to list all of the terrible consequences because there's too many and there's too much uncertainty but it applies you know to straightforward kind of bitcoin trans transactions it has a special importance for this wild new world of of nfts uh and we at least have to spend a minute on d5 for people to appreciate how uh potentially and you know the text of the law could could be effectively criminalizing things in a way that it may be impossible to comply with right because this 1984 law just doesn't make sense so as to what people should do is is read the report read the statute read read the information available on it and ask these questions questions that uh its sponsors in congress did not ask did not ask treasury to explain and start um uh exposing the the the consequences to it in whatever way it works and uh hopefully there's uh look we we definitely are starting to get attention uh on on capitol hill um the fact that the the vote in this in the senate went through so quickly you know kind of made it much more difficult to to to get people to dig into this but i think it's uh starting to happen so 60 50 i that that last digit on the 65 it's not a one it's an i let's let's get it to trend and get people to to to ask why this wasn't uh considered more carefully all right great well where can people learn more about you and 6050i uh well as of this event uh or this issue i'm now on twitter at abe sutherland you can find links there please look up the proof of stake alliance uh look up 6050i download and and read that report um and try and ask those questions about how this will apply and uh uh yeah start start with the report perfect well thank you so much for coming on unchained thanks laura
