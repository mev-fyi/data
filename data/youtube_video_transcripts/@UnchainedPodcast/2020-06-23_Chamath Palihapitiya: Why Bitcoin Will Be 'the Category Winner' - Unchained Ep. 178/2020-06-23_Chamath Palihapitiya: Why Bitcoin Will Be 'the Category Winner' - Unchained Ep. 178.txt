times crypto.com is waiving the 3.5 credit card fee for all crypto purchases for the next three months download the crypto.com app today my guest for today is chamoth polyhapatia founder and ceo of social capital and chairman of virgin galactic welcome to moth hi how are you great nice to have you you were the youngest vice president at aol worked at facebook when it became the dominant social network we're a billionaire at 32 owner of the golden state warriors at 33 and then you found a social capital which has invested in slack survey monkey box wealth front digital currency group among others then in 2018 a number of your partners at social capital left and you made an abrupt switch turning social capital from a venture capital firm to what you were calling a technology holding company at the time there was a lot of talk about it in silicon valley and afterward in early 2019 in a really fabulous interview you gave with karis fisher you talked about how you've been living this lavish lifestyle partying a lot but feeling unfulfilled and said that a lot of these changes were part of an emotional awakening for you and a shift toward understanding what really made you happy and becoming a nicer person and so i was wondering here we are in 2020 and you've made this big metamorphosis and i wondered how you've been weathering the pandemic like mentally or psychologically particularly in terms of social distancing and also dealing with all the economic uncertainty um i definitely think it's been a moment of real growth for me um but it's been really hard um i think for the first time in my life i've gone through periods of um you know just feeling depressed at times having anxiety not being able to sleep as well as i used to sometimes being really detached from the people around me because i think it's been a lot harder than i thought you know it's been really hard to establish a routine i was taking a lot of small things for granted before so something just as simple as being able to drive to the office when you take it away and you know you're in the same place where you you live um and you love but then you also have to work and everything just gets very confusing there are no clear demarcations there's no great way to break up the day um it became um really monotonous the days um didn't have clear demarcations and so a saturday felt like a wednesday um you know i put on a little bit of weight um i didn't exercise as much so these last three months have been um internally um a bit of a gut check and i think it's required me to be more resilient um but i think it's also allowed me to really be even more reflective of my progress um just learning to be kind of kinder to myself and thinking more and and realizing sort of what's important and i'm really proud of the journey i've made and being at home has probably helped me um just appreciate that more because i've been able to uh understand how hard you know sort of the process has been so yeah and i also wanted to ask um you know in another podcast interview that you did with kara swisher early on in the pandemic you were talking about how you expected the credit markets to seize up and thought that this would have a chilling effect on the stock market private equity real estate and so eventually you felt it would also cause the freezing up of venture capital so at this point we're three months in and the stock market is basically up the fed uh just announced it would be buying up to 250 billion dollars in individual corporate bonds and i've wondered given what you've seen so far are there any revisions you'd make in your predictions for how the pandemic will play out economically yeah i mean i i think that the the general premise of what i said is still probably right but the reality is the timing was way way wrong which is as bad as being wrong quite honestly um so you know when i said that i really had a perception that um the fed would be relatively constrained and operate within normal guard rails i think what we've seen is that you know there is nothing they won't do to prop up the stock market and the bond markets almost as a symbol of america's economic resilience even if that doesn't necessarily map to actually how the economy works anymore or how we would measure success or what's actually happening and you know you have to just be okay with that outcome and the fact that you can't fight the fed and that they have literally an unlimited amount of money printing at their disposal um and so just recently when they announced that they were going to buy individual you know bonds as you said um what we know is that now the stock market will go up ratably for every dollar of buying that the fed does in in the um in the bond markets and so you know if you put another quarter trillion dollars of liquidity in you'll probably see another couple hundred basis points of uplift in the equity markets um and so you know probably what i would say is that i um i would revise what i said in the following way which is none of this will end well um but you know a friend of mine says this and i appreciate the saying because it's so simple and true you know when the music's on you got to dance and right now you know being long and frankly when rates are zero being levered long probably isn't going to be punished that much so you kind of just have to own the market i think at this point until further notice and earlier when you said you would also revise your timeline on that um in the interview with kara swisher you said you thought it would be maybe about 36 months before we had fully recovered so how would you revise that timeline you know you have to wait for some uh very important things to happen the the good news is is that there is still a lot of white space for the markets to correct and i'll give you a specific example if we go and look back at the feds so when the fed announced their primary and secondary facilities they published a bunch of rules and if you look at what the rules say there's still a bunch of folks that don't qualify and there's also going to be a bunch of american companies who do qualify for fed assistance but refuse to take it because they don't want oversight on compensation and other things and so you know when you put all of that together there will still be companies in the real world that will not necessarily make enough money to meet their debt obligations and when you see defaults which you will probably in the next you know 12 to 36 months you don't need that many for a lot of market moves so you know specifically when you look back in 2008 all the money was made um on very specific tranches of you know mortgage-backed securities and the credit derivatives that were related to them similarly now i've spent a lot of time looking at the equivalent credit default securities and the credit derivatives around the investment grade index and the high yield index and again you know the loss rates don't have to be that high for there to be cataclysmic consequences and so you know five six seven eight nine percent default rates are possible simply because the number of companies that issue u.s debt but make money in non-us denominated currency and will not be able to pay their debts are going up so this debt crisis is looming um it's only getting exacerbated we're only really pushing the can down the road and the only thing left for the fed to do is just a broad-based you know buying of any security including equities and that's frankly the only tool that they have left and i think if they do that you put a lot of pressure on the us dollar and frankly you put a lot of pressure on the united states as an economic system as the sort of flight to quality bid security because um that's just something that nobody's ever done the worst outcome we don't know the best case outcome is japan you know in japan the boj owns 80 of all um you know of etfs now 80 80 cents of every dollar is owned by their own government which is just round tripping cash and what they've had is 20 years of of you know just kind of morass um and so unfortunately unless we figure out a way out of this that's what the united states will eventually see the question is just when and uh i think that the non-us companies who have us debt will be the ones that sort of push us towards the cliff and you said on cnbc that you felt that the government kind of was doing too much to rescue some of these companies and you were saying things like you didn't care if the hedge funds got wiped out and um i just wondered you know so what would that look like if the government were to do what you recommended and you know what you were saying were things like oh they wouldn't get to somewhere in the hamptons and who would care if they got wiped out but you know i also wondered like that sort of applies to well you tell me maybe it doesn't apply to people like you but but would you be willing to be wiped out um yeah i mean i've never really been defined um by my money i think i was a i was i was an evolutionary person with the same values i may have been a little more douchey when i was younger or harder to deal with but um i was still the same person and i frankly felt that i had the same worth as a human being when i was growing up on welfare when i was in my 20s or 30s are now in my 40s um i think that you know money is a projection that other people use um and i used it on myself for a while and now i use it less and so you know being in a position to actually realize that you know the the school teacher that makes sixty thousand dollars is just as important as i am is the truth um and so yeah you could take it all away i don't i don't really care it's be a fun ride no matter what i think i have a great set of memories that i've created for myself and the journey's been a blast and i hope to have another 50-year of those things you know what i what i was speaking about on cnbc was just my frustration about not wanting to acknowledge where the federal reserve and treasury were not acknowledging how the actual economy works the united states is an economy where the overwhelming majority of the gdp is generated by consumers and the way that you know consumers lift up the american economy is by spending money and when you take revenues away from the american consumer because they're unemployed or because they can't earn wages then they're going to spend less which means that the economy contracts and you have a recession so first principles thinking would tell you that you put money in the hands of consumers and you put enough money in in their hands such that the amount that they have exceeds what they need to live and then the excess spending they will spend and the reason why that's important is then it forces companies to then reopen faster hire people more inev invariably what you'll see is then they'll also have to pay them more because again these consumers have more money but that's actually all a good rebalancing of what's been happening for the last 40 years which is that the pendulum has swung you know in economic theory you say that the pendulum swings between labor and capital and in the last 40 years of trickle-down economics what we've really done is swung the pendulum so far towards capital that people who are the labor class don't really have the earning power that they actually had before and putting a lot more money into their hands where effectively you have to pay them more to come back to work isn't a bad thing it will recalibrate what is a very lopsided distribution of leverage and so getting power into the hands of labor and getting more money into the hands of labor actually sort of subverts and sort of puts an end to trickle-down economic theory and it kind of worked in the 80s but frankly in the 90s and 2000s and you know now it just it's it's a dated economic philosophy that doesn't map to how the world works and you've said that there's room for everyone to have an uncorrelated hedge in their portfolio and you say that bitcoin can serve as that you also have called it schmuck insurance um and i wondered do you think that the corona virus pandemic is sort of like bitcoin's moment not really um i think that um when i talked about it being schmuck insurance um the place that i'm coming from is that uh we want something that frankly will protect our wealth however much that it is that we have in cases where the people in power really get over their ski tips and do something that we can all see is a bad idea but they're driven by short-term political incentives the reality is that you know governments used to be run by a very different kind of person and in some countries today i would say that you know it harkens back to how it used to be so for example if you look at singapore you know the smartest people that that graduate um and you know some of the most capable individuals go into the bureaucracy and work for the singaporean government i don't think that we could all look at ourselves in the eye and honestly say that that's necessarily true in western democracies it's a kind of person that really excels in public relations or you know winning elections it's not necessarily people who excel at governance or legislation and so the reality is that you know we have people that are somewhat mismatched for the job and invariably whenever that happens irrespective of whatever profession that is mistakes happen um you know i mean just to use a stark example it's kind of morbid but you know if you put a pilot who's not a great pilot who actually really wanted to be a school teacher in the cockpit of a plane that person is much more likely to make a mistake um that has huge consequences than a person who lives and breeds wanting to be a pilot um and that's also true of legislators um and so the reality is that you know we have folks that um will focus on short-term window dressing type solutions again you can see it today um in in what the in what the fed and the treasury are doing you know we've massively increased the deficit and the debt um you know the united states is now the united states government is now responsible for more than 50 of the gdp which essentially makes us a you know quasi-communist country socialist country at a minimum except without any of the benefits so you know you still have sky-high healthcare and you know exorbitantly high useless education um so it's kind of like the worst form of socialism uh dummy socialism um and so you know when when those kinds of things are happening and they're not getting fixed and they're only getting exacerbated i just think that if people have been hard-working with their head down um they should have an opportunity to make sure that they don't get wiped out if uh the government itself just continues to make a string of bad decisions that then have rising consequences and bitcoin to me is the only thing that i've seen so far that is really fundamentally uncorrelated to that decision-making process and to that decision-making body because at the end of the day any other asset class equities debt real estate commodities they're all tightly tightly coupled to a legislative framework and an interconnectedness in the financial markets that brings together many of the governments that are sort of behaving this way and so it's almost like a a bet against uh the ruling class in some ways and making sure that you have a small amount of insurance because these insurance again insurance is not something that pays off 50 cents to the dollar insurance is something that pays off you know 1 000 bucks to a buck you want these massive massive asymmetric payoffs because you want to be sure that a small amount of insurance can basically make you whole and that's why i just think that you know you should take one percent of your portfolio put it in bitcoin never look at it don't look at the price don't look at anything and hope that one percent goes to zero then you have 99 um but in the case where that 99 goes to zero that one percent will probably be worth 120 and you'll feel like a genius but i guess what i'm confused about is you know if you feel that the government isn't handling the coronavirus response i mean uh in terms of you know uh handling the stimulus and dealing with the economic fallout in the best way then why is it that you feel that this wouldn't be the moment when that uncorrelated asset would be something that people could turn to um look the government has done you know uh depending on how technical you want to get six or seven forms of quantitative easing since the great financial crisis so we could have picked any one of those moments and said this is bitcoin's moment and what i'm trying to get across to you is that you know it's there there is no seminal event and i think that people waiting for a seminal event um probably create more speculation than is healthy for bitcoin um i think that you know this is a parade of terribles it's uh it's a bunch of small things that eventually add together bring down the entire you know way in which we think the the financial infrastructure of the world works we will lose credibility in it there will not be uh a single thing laura that you will be able to point to this will be the sum of many many bad decisions um and it's the compounding of bad decisions and um you know historians will try to pinpoint an event and i think it it'll be not worth the time i just think that this is in a it's a pattern and um you know when you see the pattern i think you just have to be prepared to hedge it be on the other side of it hope the pattern stops because quite honestly if your bitcoin bet pays off it will be catechismically destructive for the world um and that'll have enormous consequences to many people that we all know and care about who weren't hedged in bitcoin um and so you almost don't want it to happen um but you literally only can see one path to its success you don't see any other reason for it to succeed even in a world where not everything else comes crashing down not really um you know i mean i think that people could claim that it's a more frictionless payment mechanism or payment rails i don't really buy that um i think that there are much easier to use products that eventually will become you know virtual payment mechanisms that connect the world whether it's whatsapp or the cash app or venmo or we pay all of these things will eventually be threaded together in an underlying framework uh that'll allow seamless money transfer uh zero cost instantaneously um you know in a ledger that's that's uh that gives you a sense of security and transparency all of these things i think will eventually happen and so the use cases for bitcoin i think uh become less and less as a product and more and more as an instrument and uh again then you have to think about what the underlying value of the instrument is you know people try to make this case for gold all the time that there is an industrial use for gold and i would say maybe but overwhelmingly folks use it as as an instrument to hedge uh other parts of their assets and other parts of their portfolio similarly we will make the case ad infinitum for the industrial value of bitcoin but the overwhelming use case for the most people will be as a financial hedge and i think that that's good enough um because that's what will get our you know quote unquote the you know the proverbial sort of grandmother grandfather to buy this thing is that concept because they can understand that much more easily than they can understand distributed ledgers and you know seamless payment gateways it's it's all a little gobbledygook at some level right and out of curiosity when you first heard about bitcoin did it take you a while to understand its potential because a lot of people say oh at first i dismissed it and i wondered if you also there's a there's a well-known person in the bitcoin ecosystem his name is wences casares he was the one that introduced it to me in 2010 we were actually going to las vegas for his 40th birthday and that's when he pitched me on it and i remember landing uh three days later and i called my family office and said you know buy a million bitcoin that's how i started and uh it was you know 80 bucks or something at the time um and it just sounded kind of really interesting but then it took me a few years to really understand it you know um i didn't totally understand all the mechanics of it and to be honest with you i've forgotten most of the mechanics now um you know i studied it at the moment i made an underwriting decision to buy and then to never think about it again and by and large i've never thought about it again i mean i i remember my family office flipped out when you know bitcoin was 20 000 a coin they're like uh and i was like guys don't tell me i don't want to know this is like just take it off the balance sheet don't ever look at it keep it at the cost and uh you know don't get psychologically affected by this number it doesn't mean anything and then it went back down to 3000 or something then they call me again they're like uh and i was like guys i told you it just doesn't matter what's going on here um and so you know i don't know you know where it is now 9 000 thousand ten thousand whatever um i think yeah i don't uh i couldn't tell you what the price is well i was curious you did say at one point that your funds owned almost five percent of all bitcoins i don't believe that's the case anymore so i was wondering what percentage of bitcoins you owe now i don't i don't actually honestly i couldn't tell you i don't know um but yeah we um you know we were pretty aggressive buyers i think you know we were also sellers of some um in the fund because i bought some in my fund as well um for for my for myself and my lp's i bought for myself personally um you know i have a bunch of coins that i gave to uh dcg so that they could stand up the grayscale etf um and so you know uh i don't know um but um yeah i'm pretty happy with sort of you know what i own i kind of think about it as like i said i should i should be one percent hedged and uh i try to track that um just to make sure that that's still nominally the case like meaning that you rebalance uh i haven't actually actively rebalanced i've gotten distributions from other folks um and so when i get more i just kind of you know give it to grayscale quite honestly just because i don't want to deal with the coins themselves i'd rather just get back shares in the etf because it's just easier for me to manage so i don't i don't want to have access to the bitcoin uh i just think that's a huge administrative and logistical burden i don't want to bear uh level at some level it's also a security thing that i don't want to take on so you know that's grayscale's problem um or coin basis problem uh yeah yeah well one thing i was also going to ask you i know you just said you don't really watch the bitcoin markets but did you hear about how um bitcoin also took a massive hit at the same time that panic about the coronavirus was hitting the stock market and i wondered what that uh if that affected your thesis that this was an uncorrelated hedge well it i mean i think that that more reinforced that for right now people who are day trading or speculating they're the same people that are day trading or speculating other financial markets and so you know it'll suffer the same psychological ebbs and flows and so you know when people were selling off equities um it's because they wanted more liquidity whether it was because of margin pressure or because that they had a directional view on the stock market and i think that's the same thing with bitcoin because a lot of the day-to-day market participants are actively trading the same way they would trade any other stock or bond or or commodity and so it wasn't surprising in my mind that that bitcoin traded off uh when equities traded off it just goes to show you that that there is a portion of people that view it as a hedge and will never look at it and then there's a much larger portion to be honest who view it as a financial instrument that can that you can you know speculate on and make money on in short-term increments and inasmuch as those people um are greater than or equal to the number of people who view it as a hedge it will sort of map to other financial markets when when there's a drawdown in equities you'll probably see a drawdown in bitcoin when there's a rally in equities you'll see a rally in bitcoin and by and large i suspect that that's what we've seen um and that speaks more to the short-term nature of the people in the in the asset class today but that probably will change um over time as well because again you know when you get sort of like the long tail adoption of this um so that when there's i don't know uh hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions of people that own it they will be more like me you know lazy holders um they bought it for a very different reason than speculation and they neither have the time or the inclination to care what it does on a daily basis and that that will be very good for bitcoin and one other thing is you also said in another interview that you disagree with the narrative that bitcoin is digital gold and i wondered why you disagreed with that i don't feel that that's necessarily uh something that's uh incompatible with the idea that it's an uncorrelated hedge yeah i mean i mean i i think that when um the the problem is that that people get very philosophically strict when they talk about gold um you know they they i think some people frankly own it because they believe that at some point will go back to a gold standard or philosophically they believed so strongly in a gold standard other people legitimately do believe that there is some you know industrial use and that there is some portion of the trading value of it that that ebbs and flows based on its industrial value which isn't not untrue um i don't think enough people necessarily view it as like a pure pure pure inflation hedge or you know market hedge um and so that's sort of my comment which is that you know to paint it in the brush of gold just again makes the explanation more complicated and if you want mass market adoption the one thing i've realized in anything in any product is you need true simplicity and this is why you know i would encourage people to really embrace the simplicity of what bitcoin is which is it's basically schmuck insurance in case the people in charge really it up all right in a moment

unchained dot dot back to my conversation with chamath palihapatia so now we're just going to kind of scope out a little bit to talk about crypto in general i wondered what effect you thought the pandemic would have on the entire crypto market not just bitcoin um well i was i was really interested to see how um traditional market participants would react in a moment like this um you know if you're running a hedge fund there are two things that you're supposed to be doing or what one thing you're supposed to be doing in one thing that they do the thing that they do is they typically run very levered because they're trying to take very very small amounts of incremental risk and the way that they do that is that they typically trying to be hedged you know that's that's why it's called the hedged fund the hedge fund um and i thought in that that they would look at bitcoin and add it to their basket of instruments that they would use to run a hedged uh market strategy and by and large to be honest that didn't happen um i think that there was some amount of activity but the infrastructure of bitcoin market infrastructure of bitcoin doesn't really allow market participants to step in at scale um you know get massive turns of leverage you know use their prime broker all the typical things that you know we do when we step into equity markets or bond markets i mean just to give you an example you know i can put you know billions of dollars of credit default swaps on tomorrow um and i can do that on you know tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of notional i have the infrastructure set up i have the you know is the setup i have all of this infrastructure that's made available to me as a market participant to be able to trade at scale or to take directional views at scale um that's still a little bit haphazard and so the for for for market participants like that so for hedge funds to step in it's still hard it's still too difficult there's not enough people there's not enough liquidity there's not enough leverage there's not enough underwriting there's not enough understanding by the traditional banks and the primes prime brokers um and so all of this stuff um slows the natural progress of bitcoin um and so i was hoping that it would be a moment where out of a necessity uh people would go and figure these things out um but unfortunately back to the earlier comment what unfortunately happened instead was you know bitcoin was basically you know tick for tick correlated with the s p 500 and so you know you can't look at it as a hedge product people who were long the s p and had to sell you know couldn't look at bitcoin and say wow that would have been better they would have just gotten punched in the face twice as hard um so well i was also curious so do you see merit and any of the other crypto assets uh in particular ethereum no and why not um you know it's kind of like when you have a bellwether instrument um the gains typically go to the winner so i'll use an equity example to make the case when obamacare passed there was going to be a clear tailwind to health insurance and you know you could have bought a basket of health insurers or you could have just bought united healthcare and the basket would have performed okay united healthcare 10x in the last 10 years if you believed in smartphones you could have bought a basket of things in 2010 when or 2008 or 9 when the iphone first got released you could have bought you know nokia and motorola and samsung and htc um or you could have just bought apple and apple frankly just crushed everybody else the point is that in any market when there is a clear winner it's not that these other things can't win but there's a weird psychological effect that almost drives these second and third tier winners which is a desire by people almost out of this sense of insecurity to not want to admit that there's a winner simply because they weren't the one to pick it first and so what they do is they create these convoluted narratives and theses to basically anoint other winners and yeah can they win sure but do they ever win like the category killer no i mean do you really want to be long lycos and duck duck go or did you just want to be on google um just there has been not a single market where you've been rewarded as handsomely for being long the number two three and four player as you are for being long the number one player and again it goes back to when things tip and go mass market the average buyer makes the simple decision and the simple decision is to go to the category defining winner and then set it and forget it and so if you really want to make the money my view has always been you find the one that's about to win facebook microsoft apple google amazon and you buy it but what you don't do is try to do some convoluted spread trade or you know long the number two three four five person hope that it's just really honestly just you can make a little bit of money but there's so much brain damage and pressure and complication it's just never working so you don't view you essentially view all the crypto assets as kind of like one category like you don't break them out into separate categories because a lot of people would say like bitcoin is a currency and ethereum is you know this platform just for decentralized applications and they they don't view them necessarily as competitive i mean there are of course people who do view them as competitive but a lot of people just see them as fundamentally different things but you i'll give you a different example you could look at mercado libre as an incredibly complicated you know invaluable uh delivery platform for central and south america and you could look at wayfair as an unbelievable example of uh you know uh furniture uh bought purchased and designed over the internet i look at it and i'm like spanish amazon and furniture amazon and so i'm like okay i'll just be i'll just buy amazon you know i honestly love this goes back to a philosophy of mine which is what i've learned over time is that you know i've really made my life much harder than it's needed to be um you know and i've over complicated a lot of decision making in my life and as i've gotten older what i realize is that the best decisions are the ones that are really instinctive and the most simple and you can use enormous amounts of data and you can find all kinds of clever ways of slicing and dissecting things um but at the end of the day you know the simple decision tends to be the best and the most defensible and the most enduring decision and one of the simplest decisions that you can make is to buy the category winner and wish that the whole category does well because if it does as long as the category winner stays on top of the category they will get the disproportionate amount of the gains and that's just been completely true in markets you know since uh time in memoriam and i was also curious have you been watching what's been going on in d5 i don't even know what that is oh okay well then bitcoin all right well we will move on i also wanted to ask you because in a way we already started to go there in an interview with jason kalakanis in 2017 after the ico boom was uh pretty well underway you refer to icos as doing nonsense at the edges and you said that people really needed to get back to core fundamental business principles and you said things like hard-working people with pensions or people working at hospitals didn't need a cryptocurrency and a digital wallet and you've probably heard about this investment thesis that many crypto funds have where they say that the services and products that are currently offered by tech giants could be fundamentally remade and offered as decentralized services that are offered over crypto networks and the users could be user owners where they like own a piece of the network through the token and they call this kind of like the web 3 investment thesis so i wondered what you thought of it do you think this has merit or would you continue to call this nonsense at the edges because i didn't know when you said that if you just meant like the method of fundraising or if you meant like even this whole idea of user i think the i think that idea has merit um i think that the the specific way in which it's framed though is over intellectualized and over complicated again i think that you know the products that i've been involved in helping to build that have gotten to real massive scale um you know facebook slack just being a couple of examples aim when i ran that business at aol um when amp before that which was a predecessor to itunes all these businesses i've helped kind of get over you know 100 million uh users and what i'll tell you in my experiences there and then some obviously you know billions of users in case of facebook simplicity in design but also simplicity of ambition and simplicity of ambition doesn't mean that you don't have a grandiose ambition but it just allows you to frame and filter decisions in a more basic framework and so then you don't get these you know convoluted product features or implementation paths etc you know one thing to realize is that product development cycles on the internet also tend to move in a pendulum and uh you know like i said in the previous example of economic cycles you know the economic cycle the pendulum is between labor and capital in the internet the the product iteration pendulum is between um highly highly aggregated and highly highly fragmented and right now we're in a very aggregated part of the cycle you have a few companies doing many and most things for consumers but it will break apart it'll break apart because consumers get tired of the swiss army knife and they want more excellent simple products for very specific use cases and companies come and fill that gap part of what will enable that is that the standards of product development are becoming more open and more standardized and so you know apps speak nicely to each other and all of that enables a much more open collaborative product process which benefits consumers and then the other part is just that governments will become much more aggressive and trust busting and so they'll break some of these big gigantic products apart so in all of that i think we are going to become much more decentralized and i think that the next 15 to 20 years of a product iteration will be that it'll be a lot of disaggregated services um working nicely and neatly together it'll also mean that companies themselves won't be nearly as big but that's also a good thing you know it's much better i think for people to have ambition to just build a you know five or ten million dollar company where they employ people and you know they make you know a couple hundred thousand dollars a profit and they live in a place that they want where they can have a you know humane life and raise a family and be connected to their community i think that kicks more ass than trying to build the next half a trillion dollar mega behemoth company uh because a lot of that is just situational luck and timing that you can't replicate no matter how smart you are so long convoluted way of saying i think the idea has merit in the broad strokes i think the details of having to then you know try to apply it and put it on blockchain and this and that again it's a lot of over complexifying things that uh i just don't think yields and successful products you know what that answer betrays is a desire to work backwards from the solution you want versus being customer obsessive and asking what do the customers want and i don't think if you ask a customer they'll want or say ever blockchain anything they'll describe a use case and however you get there and the better way you get there and the faster you get there you'll win and if it includes blockchain great but if you start with the premise that it has to include it or this or that i just think that it's not the right starting point and it'll fail and i actually want to ask you um quite a bit more about this but first before we move on to all that um i wanted to dive a little bit more into your view on icos because you have been trying to kind of reinvent the ipo or at least just address some existing problems with the ipo process uh through this um through social capital how to sofia holdings corp and you can correct me if i said that incorrectly which basically executes specs which are special purpose acquisition companies so why do you think that's the better way to ipo and yet you know icos which also kind of similarly offer easy liquidity you know obviously you didn't think that was the way to go so you know do you see any way in which blockchain technology could be used or is it just again like you said like the technology doesn't matter and specs maybe just solve the the problems that you see the technology doesn't matter the outcome matters in this case what the outcome is that matters is the following there are eight thousand or nine thousand public companies in two thousand they're about four thousand now um two thirds of the s p 500 have no r d budgets um now you can say well this is a stock market problem but i actually think that this is a u.s economic problem which is that we don't have capital markets that can support young high-growing fast companies in a way that really builds for the future of america the resiliency of america and so we need thousands of companies to go public and so we need to frame the capital markets in a way that they understand why they should be buying future growth and product iteration in r d versus current cash flow it's this obsession with current cash flow that has driven the private equity boom that has driven the debt boom that has driven 8 000 companies to shrink to 4 000 and that has driven a lot of unnecessary volatility in the public equity markets so by uh building this platform this ipo 2.0 platform uh what i would really like to do with my partners is sort of pioneer away for young high growth companies who can invest lots of money over the next five to ten years to go public and the way that i do it is we pre-wire the ipo we go and we curate investors we explain what we're trying to do we explain the dynamics of the market then we go and find a target company and then we break the business model down for these folks we price it in a way that's fair and we eliminate a lot of the overhang in the stock like things like lockups and whatnot so there's benefits to the ceo and founder which is that they get a better they get better understood in the public markets so then there's more long-term support they get to go public in 90 days versus you know 18 months and it's just a much lighter weight process and then for the public markets what's really important is we and i'm using sort of you know my accumulated quote unquote social capital and credibility um to say let me explain to you why you want to own this thing for five to ten years and look i can only do this one company at a time although in this current case you know the first one was virgin galactic it's been a real success you know i raised two more spacks and so we'll see what happens i'd like to raise you know uh some more after that um but by doing this incrementally i think that i'll help educate the smartest hedge funds and mutual funds to want more of these younger businesses and then younger businesses will be less afraid of going public sooner and that'll start to turn the capital markets momentum in favor of long-term growth and that has huge ramifications because then hedge funds will tell companies invest more in r d you know and that actually has huge implications for the u.s economy so to me it's it's all about that icos i felt and i still feel are arbitraging something um in a very shady gray marker and you know a poorly understood part of the financial ecosystem for the gain of a few i don't think that many of these things will stand the test of time and i think that they'll be you know non-trivial amounts of fraud and stealing essentially and lying and you know these things underlie nothing they don't really represent real businesses um and so i just uh it's kind of like penny stocks do they exist sure would i tell any reasonable smart investor to focus on them no would i tell my grandparents to go buy them now and so one other thing i wanted to ask was to just sort of bring together two strands we've been discussing uh because you've been saying that the way out of the coronavirus pandemic is to turn to resilience and how you um feel that this will probably drive more nationalism because it's exposed how fragile our supply chains can be um but as we've just been talking about you know when i asked you the question about web3 you did also say that you felt that there would would be a drive toward decentralization um but you know generally at least in my world that means these like borderless crypto networks which is obviously quite different from uh something more along the nationalist line so i just wondered how you thought those two trends would intersect i think that um you know governments will basically push um businesses to be more resilient which really means that they'll have to in source a lot more work and they'll have to do a lot of things onshore because they'll want to to view things through a lens of national security and economic incentives will probably motivate people to behave that way i think separately people will put a lot of pressure on china um at every single part of the of the sort of economic value chain in which china plays an enormous role and there are many and too innumerable to count and all of that will force um companies to do the the more resilient less profitable thing um and so you know that's sort of where the that's sort of where the world is going um on top of that though there will be a handful of folks that do build multinational products because they are you know to your point which is very accurate and true borderless these are online products mostly but i think what will happen is the economics of those products will converge to zero and the economic value associated with them will converge to zero and they will become highly transparent and monitored by governments and they will behave no different than the payment rails and other networks that we have today it's it's it it is the case that you know when you make a wire buying between two parties or between two countries the doj can figure that out in a nanosecond uh and the fbi and everybody else and they can figure out who it is and uh and government institutions work together to basically provide transparency and i think i think all of these sort of you know borderless user-based networks will end up doing that not necessarily because they want to but because they'll be forced to and i think all governments will align on that well speaking of china um there's been a kind of a little space race going on with central bank digital currencies um china is sort of you know out front uh with already piloting its digital currency they also have this very comprehensive blockchain initiative which has more than 500 enterprise blockchain projects in all kinds of areas of finance and i wondered when you look at what china is doing um do you feel like that gives them a leg up on the u.s in terms of getting other countries to use their own blockchain-based systems and their central bank digital currency and do you think that's a problem for the us all of that is uh china has one goal which is basically to uh overthrow the united states as a reserve currency um and that has an enormous number of implications positive mostly for china um and so you know blockchain is a great way for them to push the transparency theoretical transparency and viability of chinese authorities their digital currency is a way of them becoming lighter weight and you know easier to use so to speak but it's all in the service not of their desire to pioneer digital currencies or blockchain frankly it's singularly in the pursuit of of overthrowing the united states as the as the reserve currency of the world um and so you just have to view it in that light and so you know uh will the united states respond possibly but if they do it'll be against this backdrop of what they'll have to do to preserve uh the unitary value of the dollar and what do you think of libra [Music] the facebook the zodiac sign facebook uh stablecoin project i don't know oh okay you haven't been following that it's like the is it like is it like the microsoft zoom i'm online it's so funny you say that because i had a friend who worked at microsoft at that time and i remember she had a zoon and like trying to talk me up on it um i mean but you don't even know you always knew that zoons existed right or like a rio player but you never saw it and then you know you've always seen one oh no my friend has one and but but that's never true all you'd ever see are iphones and ipods and so i don't know what libra is i am a libra i was born in september uh that i understand that's for real wait so wait are you but i just need to know are you even saying that you haven't been following what facebook's been doing in the oh wow your former employer which you know it's been a decade ago i mean like it's kind of like i mean like do you remember who you dated 10 years ago i mean it's a do you remember what you ate a decade ago you know things happen lots of things happen everybody moves on oh my goodness i love it okay um well i uh let's let's talk about recent news um so there's been a wave of protests around the world against systemic racism and your company had launched something called capital as a service can you describe what that is for the audience and describe how the investments made through that were different demographically from traditional venture investments um capital as a service you know well it built on something else before so i i this is a topic that's very sensitive to me um i've kind of always believed that bias existed um i've also kind of believed that i overcame it because um you know maybe i was more articulate or frankly smarter faster better um than my white counterparts and so i kind of always excelled um but but actually shimat can you just flesh out what you mean by that because i i don't know if every one of my listeners will know um your personal story uh i mean you know look i i uh i was born in sri lanka and uh at the age of six i moved to canada um there was a civil war in my country um my parents filed for refugee status and then i stayed i grew up on welfare my mother was a housekeeper my father was you know in and out of uh jobs couldn't really keep jobs um you know suffered from some depression suffered from some alcoholism it was just a really tough shitty way to grow up in some ways but you know they were good people and they tried their best i was a byproduct of a lot of social uh safety nets healthcare education being the principal too and uh i went to college for a few thousand dollars a year in canada uh i was able to emigrate to the united states um and i was kind of able to pull myself up for my bootstraps that came from nothing and i've you know reasonably accomplished a lot but there are so many people in the same boundary conditions that i grew up that didn't make anywhere near as much progress and it's not because they weren't as talented and this is what i mean by there are i've i've been very lucky so one very telling example i remember that we had to face an immigration judge when i was 10 or 11 years old um and this is like my father's final appeal like you know where it's like we need to you know you need to let us stay in canada because we can't go back you know we'll you know our lives are at risk and i just remember like you know this mid 40s or early 50s white judge and this guy sitting on a bench and he decides my entire fate and i bring it up because it's such a it's seared into my memory and i just sat beside my father and it's kind of like a courtroom setting if you can imagine a courtroom setting and i was just crying from beginning to end of the whole thing just bawling inconsolably just this fear and uh an insecurity because you feel so illegitimate you know you just feel like you don't belong and it's at the benevolence of this one person in that moment the entire you know course of your life is set he allowed us to stay um and he you know believed that it was more important for us to stay and you know those things define you as an example um so we stay and you know we try our best and um you know i would say that you know we've given back uh you know i've paid billions of dollars in taxes uh i've donated you know tens of millions of dollars back to canada i feel like i i really have honored his decision but it still kind of leaves you know this taste in my mouth which is like wow that's a coin flip that could have gone the other way and i wouldn't be here um you know 9 11 happens and um for five years i would get these uh it would literally say on my boarding pass sss and uh you know you get security screened a secondary security screen but like you know they take everything out they ask you the million trillion questions and then i finally realized that i was just being racially profiled after 9 11 because maybe they thought i was you know some muslim extremist and i thought i mean do you have to walk around with a sign that says you don't have to be afraid of me i'm not you know i'm just here to get from washington dc to new york uh to go to a meeting um you know when i lived in dc and i worked for aol i got pulled over by the cops so many times um when i was in california i got pulled over by the cops so many times and everything that i've gone through is like a one and my black friends what they've gone through is like a thousand um and they go through these even more extreme scenarios of when things happen to them you know um so you know look my my world view is is just kind of framed in the sense that there's just a lot of things that have not been set right um and one of the things that we have not done a good job of is acknowledging and confronting sort of the systemic combination of fear and ignorance and racism that just exist when i started social capital the first thing that i did one of the first projects that i did outside of the investing business was i partnered with jessica lesson at the information and i said we're going to decompose the demographic and racial makeup of every single investor in venture capital and we published it and people were so upset and i remember writing this article called bros funding bros uh and they hated it uh but they hated it because it was the truth and they were getting called out and they felt uncomfortable and what's you know and i think that they've kept it up since then um then you know i took it to the next level which was we started this thing called capital as a service and that was this idea that you know entrepreneurs exist in all shades colors genders sexual orientations and instead of allowing you know a bunch of guys with unconscious bias to make this decision why don't we just let the numbers speak and you found incredible businesses run by all kinds of people all over the world because we would allow them to just provide us their data and we would make automatic funding decisions with an algorithm and that algorithm couldn't care what your first or last name was or your gender was or where you were from it just looked at the quality of your business and made some reasonable forecasts about what the future could look like and would give you capital so i kind of believe that you know a lot of folks want to do the right thing white folks they don't necessarily know how this is a moment where people have started to really have some hard conversations and live in the discomfort for the first time you know amongst my white friends what i would tell you is like they're they listen to things in a way that they hadn't before i don't know what happens from here um but i think things like capital as a service i think things like you know publishing the demographic profile of the venture community forcing change is probably what's needed um and uh money flow is a really critical part of writing and making things more balanced because money is lubricant and you know when you have access to it you can do a lot more things than when you don't have access to it and i've been on both sides of this so i can tell you this yeah and uh just to make it clear for the audience under capital as a service the demographics of the funded companies have been 30 female-led instead of 4 in traditional vc and they're 80 non-white as opposed to 77 white in traditional vc so um quite different numbers uh when it's the algorithm investing um so i actually also wanted to ask about something else that's been quite topical in recent weeks in your 2017 interview at the stanford graduate school of business you talked about how you felt that social media tools were ripping apart the fabric of our society and this was after the 2016 election and by this point uh when you did the interview it was already known about you know russia using fake news on facebook to kind of interfere with the election and this time around obviously there's been a lot of controversy around facebook saying that it will not fact-check politicians it won't remove or flag posts by politicians that promote violence and i wondered if you agreed or disagreed with mark zuckerberg's decision to leave these posts alone i think that uh it was a business decision he made um and he's the ceo of that company and so he's allowed to make those decisions um and he controls the company those decisions if you had been in charge um i would probably have viewed the problem differently but again i don't know what he's going through and i don't know what the pressures are in his seat because clearly he did something knowing that a bunch of his employees would have been really upset and whatnot and so he still made the decision so you know on balance um i think that his decision was reasonable because it's a for-profit company and at the end of the day his real stakeholders you know quite honestly uh are folks that expect investment returns um the usability of the product if you were to prioritize it it's also complicated because it's not clear to me that facebook is uh as much used and relied upon by progressive elites in cities as they are in other demographics and so it may be the case that you know you're seeing sort of this political bifurcation where there's more democratic intent on twitter and more sort of republican usage on facebook and that wouldn't surprise me because it kind of reinforces this idea that people have said for a while which is that you know these online sites uh over time at the limit approach sort of the next generation form of broadcast media and we know for a fact that in broadcast media that there's a political distribution of of broadcast media outlets and so it does stand to reason that the that the online products that have some of this you know editorial user driven content would eventually veer in one direction or another it's it's almost near impossible to stay neutral and you know there is no there is no conception of neutral anymore when you're talking about ugc so he's kind of in an impossible situation he has to either decide to basically like you know cater to one audience over another or he has to decide to implement some form of like algorithmic neutrality the latter is next to impossible i think it would it would make people feel better but the product would become much worse and so i think his decision is probably framed best in that in that context um so the the reality is i just think you're just gonna see a bifurcation of usage uh you know meaning that products will get again the pendulum is swinging away from aggregation there will be some number of people who are really upset with twitter and go to facebook there are some number of people that are really upset with facebook and go to tick tock there are some number of people who will stay and grow up with tick tock and some will go to snap and vice versa and in all of these things the content is by and large going to increasingly converge and be the same what's going to be different is the narrative that people layer on top of it and what gets accentuated and what gets profiled and you can see that today because if you go to the third party media sites you know it's a lot of the same content that appears on all these distribution networks um it's just that the packaging is different the interpretation is different um and that's not what you know that's that's basically exactly what happens in broadcast media today abc nbc cbs fox hbo they all behave differently and cater to different subsets of the audience and i think that's what's happening to these large networks and one last question before we go which is that you did earlier mention that you thought that we would need to trust bus the big tech companies but what you just described it sort of felt like you were describing some kind of process of self-selection amongst the customers um so you know do you think that we will see government step in and do you think we should see government step in or is that not necessary uh i i really don't have a view on whether they um should or not um i think that they will and the reason that they will is because of money meaning that you know the first thing that i think happens is really a view on taxation the reality is that these companies make just an enormous amount of money and they do it in every single country of the world now and so it's just too tantalizing for a a state or local or federal government in any one of the random countries in which these you know six or seven huge tech companies operate to not look at that revenue and just pass a law and say you know tax treaties be damned but from now on if you're gonna make money off of my citizens you're gonna pay me a tax and uh i think that that's how it starts and so when you can imagine that happening across 180 you know countries of the world what you're going to see is diminished long-term profitability which impacts the market cap and investor sentiment and whatnot it's also what causes then some amount of employees to leave start their own things go to smaller companies and that's what starts the dismantling of it the next i think form of trust busting is really around uh you know distribution controls and and the the risks and the culpability that these big distribution networks take right now you know they can protect themselves behind um internet laws that don't treat them like broadcasters but i think increasingly governments around the world and you're seeing this already you know australia is doing it now europe is looking at it now they're going to attack those protections and they're going to treat uh the online you know media companies in the same light and then the last thing they're going to do is they're going to create more competition uh on the distribution side uh because of the advertising monopoly that a few folks have so these are kind of just like and you don't have to predict these because these are actually happening so you know this is not like a a grand vision of mine this is just reading the newspaper every day um and you know when folks start what happens is it it emboldens the next politician to have a little bit more courage and a little bit more courage and eventually it tips and you know in 10 years from now we'll look back and it'll seem like oh yeah obviously this was going to happen uh but it's it's impossible to put this genie back in a bottle once politicians smell blood and um when you write your 2020 investor letter what do you think you'll be saying in it um i have a couple of themes that i've been spending a lot of time thinking about one will be about racism and racism viewed through the lens uh of really in my opinion what it is which is um a public health issue and an economic salvation issue i think that you know a healthy diverse community of people creates the most thriving ecosystem of companies and economies and creates the most thriving communities and so if you just want to be happier and you want to live in a society that's that's frankly richer and more humane and more successful um [Music] this solving this problem actually goes a long way so that's one issue another one will be on credit uh i've been spending a lot of time in the credit markets actually much more so than i have on the equity markets and um there's a lot of interesting things that i'll be able to say about that i don't know whether i will have made any money uh but uh um i'll definitely have some more stories by the end of this year um and then uh you know i i'm really trying to uh write more about these secrets hidden in plain sight these are just these more philosophical things that i notice um that frankly just helped me mature as a person and you know uh be more focused and be more connected to who i am and who i want to be uh so i'll write more about that uh and then obviously the connection to berkshire um you know we're we're having a pretty decent year this year um you know i'm not sure that i can say that you know we'll make another couple billion like we did in 2019 uh or we'll lift our you know inception today performance by 200 basis points to you know we're in the we're in the we were coming into this year were doing about 33 a year which is pretty hard on four billion dollars um but uh you know i'm learning a lot so i just got to keep grinding and you know we'll see great well where can people learn more about you and your work uh chamath on
