blockchain association and board member of hotel pack welcome kristen thanks for having me laura this week the whole world has been watching the us presidential election it was it or it is still currently uh probably one of the more momentous ones in recent memory if not the most momentous and that's you know due to many reasons among which are the pandemic uh historic levels of civic unrest and intense levels of polarization in the country and i should just let the viewers know because events are sort of changing in the moment that we are recording this at around 3 p.m eastern time on thursday and at this moment it looks most likely that former vice president joe biden will be elected our 46th president and so i thought it would be good to check in with you on how advocating for the crypto industry will change but before we actually get to that question let's just talk about what it is that both the blockchain association and huddlepack are and what they do yes the blockchain association is a trade association based in washington dc we have 24 member companies and the goal of the organization is to change public policy uh to benefit the crypto industry um so we work with regulators we work with lawmakers sometimes we participate in the court process if needed but we want better public policy hotel pack which i am a board member of is a different organization it's it's a political action committee that is designed to um bring together donations um small and large across the crypto industry and in turn donate those money to congressional candidates that have good stances on crypto issues another part of hotel pack is um helping to educate the community about what's going on and um we're working towards building out more grassroots functionalities so that we can have people who want to take action and participate have a kind of a constructive meaningful organized way for them to do so so um blockchain association is for crypto companies hotel pack is for crypto individuals and so to the question i'm sure everybody's wondering about yes um as we're advocating on behalf of the industry or the community how will that change and to describe that why don't you sort of set the baseline by describing how or what that strategy was under the trump administration and how you think that will change under a potential biden administration yes you have to remember the biggest barrier to getting better policy in washington is an education barrier this is a really new um emerging fast emerging space it's complicated it's difficult for policy makers to find the time to to learn the ins and outs of how it works um another challenge we have is that most of you know your everyday average consumers don't really do much with crypto yet and um so it's not top of mind for most policymakers but our strategy over the past couple years has been to grow the base of champions on these issues and work with them to put forth what we think are thoughtful good solutions another important piece of what we do is we try to stop bad things from happening which we've succeeded at a couple times on the legislative side because it's just as important to stop bad things than it is to get good things going forward and what would be an example of that well there have been a couple bills that have been floated um or introduced like the very early version of the managed stable coins or securities act for example you know that would have defined stable coins in a way that it wasn't intended to so you know the spirit of the legislation might might um not have actually been that terrible but the way it was drafted was was um uh would have been very harmful to the industry and so we were able to work with that office get some of those definitions changed but ultimately it it stalled and so we were able to sort of prevent that from going forward the um the because these are such niche issues for policymakers we've really had to rely heavily on those who um have a personal passion for this space so you know hester purse who i know you've interviewed multiple times brian brooks they've been fantastic allies and champions to have and having them in those spots has you know not only have they been able to put forth their own ideas but they've been able to educate their peers their regulatory regulator peers on on crypto so so that that's positive um and in congress we have you know some good champions that are continuing to put ideas forward but the reality is it's a long way towards actually getting you know a big comprehensive legislative package across the finish line so as we look to the biden administration if that is indeed what we're dealing with i mean who knows and anything could change um i actually think the combination of a biden administration with the republican senate which i think is where we're going but again that could change too um uh but those that that is really really good for crypto and and there are a couple of reasons for that um you know the the the trump administration is a little bit mixed right like as i mentioned we have hester we have brian they're great um but we also have secretary mnuchin who's not a big fan of this space we have trump himself um we have jade clayton who um has been a skeptic um those are you know minutiae and clayton are appointed by trump um and they they've been standing in the way of getting something done so as we look to the biden administration we're hoping to be able to get educated crypto educated regulators in key positions at the sec the cftc and the occ and doing what we can to try to influence those choices um and and so by them will play an important role in picking who those people are but because we have a republican senate those choices i think are going to be much more moderate than they would have if that if the democrats take the senate under a democrat-controlled senate then the progressives um have a little bit more of a say in who those those people are but and if if the senate banking committee is controlled by pat toomey and mitch mcconnell is running the senate floor those guys are not going to approve of somebody that's too left-wing and they're going to need to get some republican votes for those positions so i think that's good for crypto because the support we've had from democrats tends to be those that are a little bit more open to business that are open to um you know private sector innovation and i think that that is actually a winning combination and there's potential to get some great some great regulators in in those key slots and so for this next administration what are the main issues that are at the top of both the blockchain association and hotel packs agendas so on the defensive side and this is for the blockchain association you know we are very concerned about any unnecessary regulation of self-hosted wallets or for transfers um into and out of self-hosted wallets there are not specific proposals out there on that right now but because fat f has has highlighted this and because what we've been hearing out of some of the senior folks from treasury we think that this is going to be an issue that we have to watch like a hawk because it goes at the core of what crypto is and so being being ready to be on the defense for that is is really important and we're working on a report right now that we hope to get out the door um in a couple weeks um on that issue um i also think securities law clarity continues to be an issue that we would like to have addressed it's um i don't think it's as urgent as it was when we spoke you know i guess was that a year and a half ago on on this subject something like that yes time flies but the um but that is something that that i think finding a pathway for projects to raise money on the front end to give them a period of time like hester purse has proposed and then to be able to go and and um freely trade that token as a commodity is is still a really important um issue that needs to be addressed and so that that's on our list um there's been a lot of activity on stable coins um i think that's good for the industry but more importantly that is what policymakers are interested in right now and part of that's driven by china and cbdc's and and i think getting an appropriate you know fiat back stable coin policy in place is going to be important and we've already seen some good good steps um by the occ on that front and then um i do think there are some outstanding tax policy issues that need to be addressed and so you know those would be maybe our top four there's also europe right now is doing quite a bit with spot market regulation so the us may decide to jump in on that and what we saw with the digital commodity exchange act a couple months ago is that there are starting to be some ideas about how to do that here so there's definitely a lot going on and a lot of those decisions um in in the next couple years i think are going to be regulator level decisions um but congress is still a useful tool because they can put pressure on the regulators they can signal to the regulators what they would want and what they would do and so i don't anticipate getting a new bill signed into law but i do anticipate getting some great bills introduced and debated um and hopefully that will influence action um at the regulatory level oh it's so fascinating and there's so much to unpack there but um first uh we'll take a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that

coins once in the app you can apply for the crypto.com metal card which pays you up to eight percent cashback instantly reserve yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with kristin smith so you mentioned that stablecoins is pretty much at the top of the regulator's agenda what do you why would you say that and what exactly are they looking to do there i think that it's at the top of their agenda because it's something that they can understand um which is you know when you look at the universe of what you can do with crypto networks um you know minting a digital dollar um you know on a blockchain is something they can wrap their heads around it is really difficult um to go in and talk about you know orchid being a decentralized vpn or um you know file coin being a decentralized storage system i mean there's just so many different pieces there that they don't um they're able to fully wrap their heads around it but i think because there's so much attention to what's happening in china um i think because of um uh you know john carlo's initiative on the digital dollar project is is you know sort of forcing some of these conversations that when we look at sort of the pure crypto world i think having having um you know something like usdc is a really good sort of private sector driven effort to get all of the benefits that we would have with the cbdc but that's available here and now and is starting to be more widely adopted for different uses and so i think you know for us we've been able to pivot the cbdc conversation into a conversation about stable coins and getting the right framework around there because the reality is the fed takes a really long time to do things if you look at their faster payments initiative their fed now program that's been years in the making and isn't done yet um and so i think if we can you know use american values and the american way of of private sector innovation to get to some of the same ends that we can still keep the dollar strong um and be competitive with china just to go back to the senate question i do think you're right probably we will end up with a republican controlled senate however um at the moment it does look pretty likely that we'll end up in two runoff elections in january and so those two could potentially change the control the senate to the democrats and i just wondered if you thought that that would change much of the agenda that you mentioned the regulators or congress is interested in at the moment yeah no i do i do think it will change um i mean i think if if the demons take the senate then you know we may have less friendly regulators in key positions not necessarily but um the odds of getting somebody who is more progressive in those spots um you know doesn't necessarily hurt us but there's a higher likelihood that it does and you know in terms of the legislation that they that congress could consider is um you know going to be much more significant i mean i think that they will have a pretty strong agenda that could include you know getting more people on the supreme court um getting new states into in in seats in the senate um right now i don't think hercules is gonna be first on their list oh oh so you okay i meant the crypto agenda but you feel like basically their attention will just be elsewhere yeah i think their attention will be elsewhere um now we do we do see some um proposals that are sort of coming up in the house um rashida talib's office is looking at a bill that um i i think is is well intended but at the moment as as defined would really limit um the type of entity who could issue a dollar back stable coin something like that um would not be good for crypto um at least in its current form and so what we don't want are these ideas that are sort of um maybe driven by modern modern monetary theory uh and you know sort of the uh taking banking and making it more public i think is going to have ramaki vacations for crypto as well but i don't think that's going to be the top thing on our list and i don't think that's something that can happen in two years and and so i think that um i think that crypto will will be um you know much lower down down the agenda item the agenda but if something does go we we don't have the ability to stop it like we would with a republican senate and there is one new senator who is a fan of bitcoin so at least or at least one new one there might be others cynthia loomis from wyoming apparently is i guess the first senator to own bitcoin i did see some people tweeting which i also thought like oh we thought that kelly lafleur would have some bitcoin yeah i don't know no i um no i i think cynthia lumpus is fantastic i actually haven't spoken with her in a long time but she was the congresswoman from wyoming when i worked for the lone congresswoman or congressman from montana and so on occasion our our offices would get together and she would come over with what she called a wyoming five pack which was basically a six pack of beer with one missing and to bring it to the congressman i worked for so she is down to earth she is really smart and she is a huge fan of bitcoin and having somebody like that in the senate is great um i'm eager to see what committee's assignments she would get um you know she you know sometimes uh states like wyoming are interested in the agriculture committee which would be great because the agriculture committee has jurisdiction over the cftc and so there are a lot of good things we could work with her there on um if she goes to the finance committee which typically freshmen don't get assigned to the finance committee that's kind of an a-level committee but that would have jurisdiction over tax policy um and then the senate banking committee you know wyoming is very innovative on that front and um you know that might be a desirable position for her as well so senators typically get anywhere between three and five committees and so i'm super eager to see where she lands because i've got a lot of ideas for her when she shows up and recently we have seen um some anti-trust action from congress uh such as with google and i wondered do legislators have an awareness of how something like web 3 could potentially address these monopoly type issues or do they tend to lump crim to crypto in with big tech they don't lump crypto in with big tech but there is still a disconnect between seeing crypto as sort of a solution to big big tech um we've early on in particular this was um kind of the core of our messaging was that hey crypto's gonna come along and it's gonna fix everything you hate about the internet where we started to run into problems was with libra um because when facebook came in all of a sudden big tech was affiliated with with crypto and we i think did a pretty good job of separating the two but um i think there's still some confusion on how we could have these crypto networks that are you know these sort of organic competitors to to what we see in that space that you know maybe treat privacy differently than big tech does that are more secure i mean there are a lot of like wonderful wonderful sort of theoretical or not theoretical in the case of like file coin um um alternatives to big tech but it's there is a disconnect um del rahim who is the uh the the man in charge of antitrust policy at doj gave a speech on it recently and i think he is starting to see that there are some opportunities there but this kind of goes back to our earlier conversation most members of congress um and maybe sort of average regulators aren't yet wrapping their head around that piece of it it's just a little bit too it requires a little bit too much imagination and too much background for them to to make that connection but i think that over time that that will start to shift and and we can see um you know crypto as part as a solution um and and not a problem the crypto industry also maybe is not even fully aligned with itself or within itself about how to approach compliance and regulation for instance after by nancy west joined the blockchain association coinbase left and forbes recently wrote an article saying that perhaps binance u.s might have been set up as a decoy for u.s regulators and of course as i'm sure you're well aware coinbase has this long-standing reputation for being one of the most compliant exchanges although of course it also does push back against overreach such as when the us the irs tried to make a broad request on all its users transactions over a three-year period um but i wondered what are the main divisive issues within the crypto industry that need to be resolved when it comes to how it approaches regulators yeah i know that that's a great question um i i think that for most companies operating in the us that at least the ones that i have dealt with in in in my universe they do want to comply um and and part of why they work with blockchain association is they want to get more clarity on when they need to comply right i mean i think that you know if you don't want to deal with that you don't operate in the u.s which is i think what most people do um it's really hard to get all the key people in a room i'll put it that way um you know i think that there are a lot of rivalries that you know whether it be you know primarily i think with the exchanges but um you know their rivalries competitive rivalries that are getting in the way of having substantive policy conversations i think that's starting to shift um i think that as um you know some of these companies are building out their teams and bringing in um you know sort of seasoned general counsels um there's this understanding that that they're going to have to to work together i i don't think it's as closely coordinated as it needs to be to win and the reality is we're not going to get anything super positive until there is agreement on a strategy and whether that be um hey like we all want to be regulated as banks under some sort of special bank charter or we want to expand the cftc jurisdiction to play a greater role or we need to create a self-regulatory organization that is kind of you know running point on on regulating the space i think there's still disagreement on that and um but i'm hopeful in the months ahead that we can get the key people sitting down um you know they don't have to be a member of the blockchain association to do this so i'm always accepting you know applications for new members for me to pass along to the board um because the board decides membership not me but um the the i think that that it's really important to work together because we are so small compared to most industries that are operating in washington that that the nuances of of you know the rivalries are just really like lost on those policy makers like they just want to see kind of a unified position and so it's incumbent upon us to to develop that um and push that forward so we still have a ways to go on that and last question with the news about paypal integrating cryptocurrencies there's been increased noise about the need for a de minimis tax exemption and i wondered if that was something that the blockchain association or hotel pack is advocating for and what you thought the odds were that such a thing would be passed yeah no i think that um that is something that the blockchain association supports we got legislation worked very closely with coincenter to get that introduced last year i think that it looks like dave schweikert is probably going to get reelected who's the lead republican on that bill and the lead democrat susan delbenet was also elected so i think getting that reintroduced is important um the problem with tax policy is um it tends to get done in packages and so there needs to be some sort of tax bill moving to attach something like that too it would also be helpful to get something introduced on the senate side so that there's kind of agreement between both chambers when they get to negotiations around a tax package so there's more groundwork to be done there i think it would um i think it i think it's an important step i think there's some other tax issues that need to be addressed as well um around crypto lending around treatment of staking rewards um and you know those are other issues that we're going to be looking at but and you know from the hotel pack perspective um what what's the beauty of huddle pack is that those are individuals and so they um can support and vote for champions um in congress or candidates that have different positions on different issues so hotel pack itself doesn't take positions but the contributions will go towards those candidates that that um have favorable positions so it's it's a very much a very open sort of community governed process there okay interesting maybe it's something where you guys could use like quadratic voting to decide we just quadratic voting actually yeah i didn't know what that was until recently but yeah we um yeah we actually on hotel back we just held our our first community ballot right before the election and um you know people who wanted to participate in determining where the contributions would go would do so by using total votes which um was um you know you would receive a token and then you would vote with their tokens and um you know a few people in the dc world had to download metamasks metamask wallets to like participate for the first time but it was um yeah there's a lot of cool experimentation going around around there but the the idea being that um you know most political action committees have um you know a committee or a single person that sort of determines okay we're gonna you know support these people and you know give them contributions and huddle pack is really opening that up uh to kind of a community vote which is really really cool oh wow wow i love it i love it that you guys are already using this technology in really interesting ways um all right well we will see what happens with the elections yes um i'm sure we'll have you back again to talk about how it's going once um you know whatever the changeover is whatever that happened whatever that is yeah i definitely think there there are definitely going to be some changes um i think we have um some good opportunities and i think we're in a position to play defense when we need to play defense so i think 2021 and 2022 are going to be um exciting years for crypto policy great well thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thanks laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline one billion dollars in silk
