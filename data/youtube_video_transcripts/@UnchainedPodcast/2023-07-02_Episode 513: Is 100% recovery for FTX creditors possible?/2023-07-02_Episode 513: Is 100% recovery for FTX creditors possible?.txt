one of the things John said to me that I thought was quite interesting and again I think this is newsworthy that's what I'm sharing it is you know he said not only does he anticipate getting to 100 recovery by trying to increase the numerator but really it's by decreasing the denominator and and so I think he really means it and one of the things he highlighted was kycaml on the denominator meaning all the claimants like who hasn't been kyc to ml like who's got Funny Money floating around on our exchange and I think that's a big I think it's going to be a big issue with claimants and one of the other things he highlighted was people treasuries with with really all all projects that have treasuries that are with FDX and now have claims instead of dollarizing those claims like you would traditionally do I think he was basically saying to me like I'm just going to get that person back their crappy coins
