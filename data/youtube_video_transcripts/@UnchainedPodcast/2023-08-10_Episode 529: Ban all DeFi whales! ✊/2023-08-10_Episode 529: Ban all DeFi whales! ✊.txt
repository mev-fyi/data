there shouldn't be a situation in which one person has 40 of a token and is borrowing up to pretty much the maximum capacity against 40 of the asset whether it's a token or a stock you know in the traditional markets whatever like there's so many examples of some entity that gets like in a horrible trouble because they borrow against a massive massive massive position and it creates this reflexivity for the asset in general like icon Enterprises recently was in trouble because like he was borrowing against like his entire stock all of all of the Hindenburg research shorts have actually just basically been yeah this is like public equities around the world that where one person owns like a crazy amount of it and is levered to the hilt against that asset this is a fundamentally unsound practice and like I don't know how any system allows it Frank
