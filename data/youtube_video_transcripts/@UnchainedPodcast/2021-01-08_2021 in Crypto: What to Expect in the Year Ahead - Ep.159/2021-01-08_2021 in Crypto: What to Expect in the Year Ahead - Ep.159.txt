at the block welcome frank laura thanks so much for having me i uh just got back from staples to get these new headphones did did bitcoin fall back below 40 i haven't looked at price in a little while where where are we where are we right now well last i checked which maybe was like a half an hour 40 minutes ago it was at 38k okay but i did see that it had dipped to 37 um in the interim oh jeez and god and god only knows what the price will be when this uh gets out to your audience oh oh oh are you gonna drop some no well so that's why i invited you on the show um you are the first guest on unconfirmed in 2021 it's exciting i think we can all safely say that this is gonna be a big year for crypto if the first days of the year are any indication um so okay before so you actually did write what your predictions are for the year but before we even get into that let's just look back at the similarly i think actually really significant year in crypto for 2020. like what would you say were the big stories that year i mean if you look at the data um you have a number of big uh stories for 2020 right the growth of the stablecoin market seeing a supply above 5 billion trading volumes reaching an all-time high monthly high in the month of december we put out a lot of um figures around trading and and stable coins in the past few weeks and so you just saw the growth of the market and the build out of a more robust market structure so i think that's kind of like the high level overview of 2020 and i think that's why investors right now are getting so excited about what 2021 holds because you have this this growth story from the year prior so i think people are really excited and you're right it's going to uh it's going to be interesting to continue to watch that's for sure aside from price just the for the development of the market yeah yeah my two big takeaways i think well so first of all i think um partially because the pandemic bitcoin i think was just like the big story last year you know i mean you know we just saw i feel like kind of a new type of person who was acknowledging what its merits were and getting in and then of course you know the big news with things like paypal and microstrategy and square and massmutual putting bitcoin on their balance sheets like i you know i don't know if those things would have happened even without the pandemic but you know given what the state of the world was i definitely feel like all those forces came together to create the perfect conditions yeah i mean it took a while though it took a little bit of a while you know i remember at the beginning of the pandemic in march when everything was falling um crypto and beyond uh folks were kind of thinking that maybe crypto bitcoin specifically wasn't living up to that safe haven characteristic that so many folks have attributed to it and so you know i think once we had the poultry jones news come out you kind of saw those dominoes fall with more investors more hedge funds and then actual publicly traded companies and in some cases announcing that they'd be allocating to the space and so it's it's been interesting to see that unravel yeah and the other funny thing is that um early on in unchained well oh no i know it was actually the first why bitcoin now episode that i did with mike novogratz and raul pal and i did ask them hey like on black thursday why did bitcoin not um act as a safe haven asset as everybody says it would and they said okay you know maybe that day didn't but we are seeing institutional investors who are viewing it that way and who are getting in and said okay well then why hasn't the price risen and they said well it takes you know these kinds of companies a while and they were right they were like it's gonna happen it's just behind the scenes right now um but one other thing i was gonna say about your comments about kind of like just the um maturation of the space and way what was interesting is like i just feel like it looked quite different from 2017 in the sense that that looked very thin and it was very much based on hype and this time around it feels like it's more based on substance which um you know it's more interesting to me all right so now and i just add i just had one thing to that like the institutions really delivered in 2020 in a way that maybe the retail side of the market didn't like in 2020 we didn't see things like a an etf come to market right which many folks think would you know open up the floodgates to more retail participants or firms like charles schwab or td ameritrade or fidelity offer retail products which many people were hoping that they do but we saw to your point uh a lot of hedge funds and larger firms get in so you kind of had this like tale of two crypto markets in a sense oh yeah yeah and reversed from last time because last time it was reversed the wall of institutional money that you know did not materialize that did not come yeah all right so let's talk about what you think will be the big crypto stories for 2021 i think that you know kind of adding to that point i think we will be disappointed in some respects about uh the entrance of firms like fidelity and charles schwab and td i don't think that we're going to see any type of retail crypto trading products come out of those firms in the next few quarters on the flip side we saw paypal come in which kind of helps to an extent but we're going to see limited activity on the retail brokerage side i think we're also going to see limited activity on on the side of the large investment banks and as much as i don't think that in the next few quarters at least they're going to be trading physical cryptocurrencies themselves even though we have this guidance from the occ that they will they they can uh store crypto custody assets i just don't think given what i know about where these teams are that they're going to be uh trading at themselves anytime soon and the market is still even at a trillion dollars a bit too small for them to do so but we're definitely going to see the market continue to develop on the institutional side with prime brokerage building out and firms like genesis galaxy and there are many other market making firms b2c2 which just got acquired by cb cbi group um all these firms are rapidly expanding their capabilities so we're going to definitely continue to see that we're going to see the headcount of these firms expand in some cases double in some cases triple from what they are currently as they try to offer you know deeper liquidity more white club services for firms that are looking to put on these large hundred million five hundred million positions um in some cases a la micro strategy ala square so we'll see more of that i think we'll see in lockstep what these trading capabilities expand more publicly traded companies look to follow in the footsteps of square microstrategy to allocate a portion of their balance sheet to bitcoin i've spoken with folks like michael moro who runs genesis global trading he anticipates more than 100 companies that are publicly listed will do just that so we're going to see retail brokerage down the sidelines we're going to see probably investment banks continue to sit on the sidelines in terms of crypto trading itself we're going to see still the trading market structure develop and change in many interesting ways i think going into 2021 you're going to have firms like coinbase and other exchanges experiment with new types of liquidity or market making incentive programs so they can bring more liquidity onto the platform that could take the form of something like inverted maker traditionally exchanges provide rebates to folks who are adding liquidity or making markets on their venue you you could see some schemes where they're actually maybe paying takers um which is something that crosstower and upstart exchange does but you're going to see across the board folks just experimenting with these with these fee schedules that they have and as a result potentially you could see those retail fees then then maybe come down and and that could also be expediated by things like payment for order flow becoming more um more of a thing so to speak in the crypto markets basically the way that robin hood and other brokerages and equities make money you could see that continue to seep into cryptocurrency markets which could also uh help with the fees so that that other element would be just the continual maturation and development of of the market structure itself so those are some of the main things that i'm going to be looking for in 2021 and that i'm excited about so we're going to discuss a little bit more about how the crypto exchange business and some other businesses in the crypto space will change in 2021 but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on btc and more than 20 other coins once in the app you can apply for the crypto.com metal card which pays you up to eight percent cashback instantly reserve yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with frank shaparo of the block so earlier when you were talking about how crypto exchanges might change their fee schedule what was what would be the motivation for that i mean basically the idea is to just create a better product and a better market structure for their venue it's something that you know we see in traditional equities and and you know folks that that are working at firms like coinbase you have someone like vishal gupta who's the head of exchange they're trying to bring best practices from the traditional world to the cryptocurrency world to basically make for more efficient markets more efficient pricing and the fee aspect and the the pricing aspect is one element you're also seeing a number of firms try to improve uh the the data capabilities of the market right so you look across bitcoin any observer or market participant knows that it's often difficult to know exactly what the price of bitcoin is at any given moment so you have a number of firms that are looking to remedy that um and are looking to create new index products around the bitcoin market to solve for that s p 500 you have cboe which recently announced at the end of last year that they'd be getting in the market to solve for just that so a lot of what these exchanges and new market participants are looking to do is improve the efficiency of trading and to make the market more robust and you're seeing you're seeing that happen even if you just look at things like spread and volatility volatility relative to 2017 is a lot lower and the spreads between the exchanges the price at which bitcoin trades uh across various exchanges has has tightened as well and so you're kind of we're already reaping some of the benefits of of these initiatives and at the end of the year or really the latter half we started to see a lot of big regulatory actions in the space one of the biggest ones was against ripple by the sec how do you think things like that will affect exchanges so i was talking with the head of an executive at an exchange who is responsible for aspects of the listing process and so my thesis going into this year was that you'd have a number of exchanges think about clamping down on new listings or at least reconsidering the listings process i think there's there's an aspect of that i think exchanges are under pressure from a scaling perspective as it is to you know roll out new products to onboard new clients and so they don't want to get entangled in regulatory dramas related to listings so maybe that would make them a bit more conservative or potentially de-list things which you saw with bittrex right they'd listed a number of privacy coins and so but there's also this other sentiment and and this is the sentiment that was expressed by this one executive that i'm talking about which is you don't want to fall into the trap of every time a regulator says something about a coin that you immediately de-list it or you set the precedent that you know it's kind of like the coin is you know guilty until is is guilty rather than you know innocent until proven guilty um and so that's something that exchanges right now are being highly sensitive about in terms of moving too quickly i think that's why you see kraken moving a little bit slowly and why you saw coinbase which many people you know even though they only took about a week many folks thought they'd they'd um get that done or de-list xrp within a day right um and and they're not taking an approach like that and i don't think many exchanges are i think the ones that kind of got got out there really early on were maybe trying to do it for the marketing but they're they're taking these um decisions very seriously and so i think you have um these two forces a desire to not you know move too quickly and completely bend a knee to the regulators which is very important in crypto which is you know to some degree you know moving against the grain of the regulatory forces but also this this desire of like or or this you know feeling of i don't want additional pressure when volumes are exploding and uh bitcoin is surging towards forty thousand there's just so many other problems i have that i don't wanna bring regular uh regulatory issues in as well well so you referenced how bittrex announced that it it'll be delisting the privacy coins monero z cash and dash do you think that this is just the start of kind of i guess you know d listings or suspensions of privacy coins from exchanges i think that this is definitely going to be something that could spill over into other markets um i think the fact that bittrex did it was was fascinating because they're not necessarily known for being at the forefront of um handling regulatory affairs as well as some other exchanges i think some folks might make that argument so the fact that they got ahead of this early on i think is uh canary in the coal mine perhaps yeah i did see though jesse powell of kraken the ceo there he said that he wondered if it was something specific to their exchange you know facilitated certain types of transactions without doing proper kyc something like that um but i did notice that the timing of it was around the same time that there were like new anti-money laundering initiatives that were passed in congress something like that i actually should have looked up the uh the exact news before i decided to spontaneously mention it on the show um but i remember thinking like oh i wonder if this also like if they're just being extra cautious but yeah this is something i'm watching a lot because obviously with the regulations against um self-hosted wallets and um in general just a lot of um regulatory fire coming the way of privacy yeah yeah it does feel like this fits into a broader narrative as well um and it's really tough right now for exchanges i mean on the regulatory side i hear so many war stories out of you know the legal and compliance department of these exchanges because it's really tough and once you had the the treasury um come out with this you know proposal for rulemaking around non-custodial wallets you just had across the landscape exchange compliance professionals working day in and day out around the clock to just get ahead of anything that could come down the pike and i'm talking you know 15 16-hour days so it's been that's another story you know it'd be interesting to see how that um pans out in 2021 but so far it's something that's really top of mind for a lot of firms yeah yeah i'm i'm really wondering what's going to happen um so one other huge crypto news event that's on the horizon will be the coinbase ipo later this year oh yeah that's very interesting what are you looking for when it comes to that uh there's so many i mean we want to know what what valuation you know we're going to see this kick off there's so many unanswered questions that i'm excited about finding out like who are the other investment bankers involved right we know that goldman sachs is involved but there's going to be quite a number of other ones who kind of assist in this process you could see maybe galaxy i'd like to see a crypto native uh banking firm on the roster um so we'll be looking out for that also interested in like the form of the ipo i i don't think it's been reported um whether or not this will be a direct listing or a traditional ipo or the new uh direct listing mechanism that new york stock exchange just got approved which is effectively a direct listing that allows for um a capital raise in in in addition to the direct listing so we don't have any of those questions answered to my knowledge or whether there will be a coin component or whether there'll be an ethereum based coin component or whether it will list on new york stock exchange or nasdaq um these are all open what i do sense is that it's coming very soon right i uh had reached out for one story and originally the the firm sort of came back and said they were in a quiet period they then sort of came back and said that they weren't in a quiet period so you're approaching this this moment where you know we're going to find out more information about the the degree um or rather what this exactly is going to look like so we're getting close that that we know for sure and when you say soon last i heard was kind of like second half of 2021 but are you saying it could come earlier than that i think that it could come within i think it could come within the first half of the year yeah definitely yeah okay that's the timeline you have um you have the firm just recently hired a head of investor relations from facebook to sort of you know in the early stages of this process you're going to want to do the road show you're going to want to you know build a book of potential investors from the public markets and so that's gonna be fun to watch it's gonna it's gonna be interesting to see how coinbase positions itself as a company to wall street right you know they're kind of many different things they're a brokerage firm they're in exchange they have a silicon valley brand the gentleman whom they hired is from facebook so that kind of maybe gives an indication that they're going to want to position themselves as a tech growth story rather than a sleepy boring brokerage custodian that raises the other question of who's going to cover this stock which is a more wonky pedantic question that may not be super interesting to your listeners but is it going to be the guys who cover brokerage firms or is it going to be the folks that cover exchanges or the folks that cover you know tech firms so that remains to be seen and it remains to be seen how coinbase will shape that narrative obviously there's one very obvious narrative of this being like the crypto company um so if you're uncomfortable getting some sort of exposure to bitcoin directly look no further to coinbase shares um so we'll see if that works yeah yeah and in a way the fact that coinbase isn't easy easily categorized reminds me in a way of how cryptocurrency itself is also not easily categorized so um yeah i feel like there's just this new frontier that we're creating anyway well it's
