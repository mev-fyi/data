discuss are chris burniske partner at placeholder ventures and jordan fish aka kobe co-founder of lido co-founder of up only tv and author of the kobe newsletter welcome chris and kobe aka jordan excited to have you both here all right so let's just start by assessing whether we are officially in a bull market or what's going on as we record this is a week before this goes out the price of bitcoin is at about thirty thousand dollars it's down from its high last fall of sixty seven thousand dollars the price of ether is at two thousand dollars which is down from its high last fall of forty eight hundred dollars what do you think this kind of current state of the market signifies i think we've just reached the point where there is wide consensus on bear market because um it normally takes a while right for people to have the firm consensus together when we're actually in a bear market probably a little while ago you had really bad price action where you had a lot of like i think seven seven to nine weeks after the top you could sort of begin to have a lot of conviction that things were looking worse the the like price action really really changed but i think over the last month it sort of become unanimous even people that would have been annoyed about talking about the bear market before and now sort of accepted it and it sort of flipped the other way where if you have any like sort of bullish or contrarian thoughts on price action they get annoyed with you now um for for having a bullish idea so um yeah i think it's like i think it's pretty messy don't look good though generally better to be a buyer now than six months ago yeah i definitely agree with kobe that sentiment has totally turned and were majority bearish which again like when you zoom out over a long time is generally when you want to be buying counter-intuitive and then you know if you look at the charts and you mentioned the prices laura you know just looking at the majors of btc and eth they currently sit about 60 down from all-time high prior bears btc was pretty standard drawing down 85 percent at least that was the case in 18 and 19 and um 14 and 15 and just for context you have to follow another 50 from 60 down to get to 80 down ethan the last bear which was really the only major bear it's gone through so this was 2018-19 eth fell 95 so once you're at 80 percent down you actually have to fall 50 again to get 90 down and once you're at 90 down you have to fall 50 again to get 95 down and so i think this is where like the nuances of what is a bear market emerge i toggle between log and linear scales if i look on linear scales the parabolas have clearly been broken like the bull market of last year's broken i just mentioned the majors a lot of long tail is down 80 plus seeing some things down 95 percent so now it's really just a question of like how bad a bear market is this going to get but for me it's very clear we're already in the bear market yeah it's so fascinating what you just said be about bitcoin especially about how if it were to go down 80 total it'd have to be 50 from now which would mean 15 000 which then would be below the high from the 2017-2018 cycle um but one thing i just have to ask about is because of course as we're recording we're still in this like fallout phase of the tara luna debacle and at this moment in time it's sort of unclear whether tara is going to find a new path forward after tens of billions of dollars in value was wiped out so you know how much of kind of this current moment do you think is just the ripple effects of the terra luna fiasco or how much do you think you know regardless of that that that was going to be baked in i don't want to sound uh cocky or conceited but i expected ust to blow up i just didn't expect it to blow up so quickly um is the truth it was like one of the things i was looking at is like a major liquidation event and i put out some stuff on twitter like okay this could make the btc bottom a lot worse if they have to sell all this btc at a point their accumulation of btc was um giving btc a brief respite i think into the 40 40 thousands but so what what surprised me is how quickly it happened and how vicious the unwind was last week like you know monday tuesday wednesday um you know in communication with the different otc desks there really weren't that many buyers very skewed sellers major panic and you know people are talking about like btc is now like the seventh straight week down and this has never happened so like certainly that was a precipitating event that made things very bad very quickly i believe that if that hadn't have happened there would have been some other kind of event that could have caused you know similar falls but you know our bottoms like that tend to be liquidation induced or leverage unwinds of some kind that then like trigger all these auto cells trigger all this panic and then everyone just goes into cell so we've had one of those i don't think it's our last um of this bear i think we need at least one more um and i'll pause there yeah i think that's right i like i don't think like this caused the bear of course um it probably made those few days worse than those few days uh would have been i was impressed at how um like they sold a lot of bitcoin and i'm sure there was a lot of other um large sellers too that either knew about this event had an inside information on it or something and things seemed to go okay like i i we're not a zero but surprising um which is uh which is a shock um so so yeah but i i mean like this like this price action was gonna happen anyway roughly like global uh financial markets are in a bit of a collapse netflix is down what like 90 or something um a lot of tech stocks are completely ruined and bitcoin's previous bear markets have never really existed through that kind of a a scenario before so if you think if you go to a christmas question about how bad can the bear market be i think we were i think people don't really know yet because previous bitcoin bear markets have still been in reasonably favorable uh conditions it's always been a equities bull market um while uh bitcoins had its bear markets so this will be the first time that that's not true if the stock market also continues to uh to struggle yeah i actually want to unpack the macro stuff a little bit more but i want to just touch on the stable coins a little bit more before we do that so a couple of things so chris you said that you expected usc to blow do you feel that an under collateralized algo stable coin will never work or do you feel that it's just that terrace design was not i have a hard time saying anything will never work because you're basically betting against human ingenuity um and so there's lots of experiments out there to date most of them have lost their peg right um so it's uh it's a known hard problem that a lot of people are trying to solve the tricky thing is like there's a few things here one like trying to operate an algorithmic stablecoin is basically like trying to be a central bank before 1971 where you have limited reserves to defend your peg and and those reserves are actually they tend to be even more transparent so people know when you're tapped out central banks learned the lesson in 71 and you know they switched to a new regime of infinite balance sheets to be able to defend their currencies and that in some ways has given birth to bitcoin and there's a lot of downsides to that switch in 1971 but it has also prevented some collapses that we might have had otherwise or very prolonged depressions like for example i don't think i don't anticipate we get a 1929 style great depression because the form of monetary and fiscal policy is now very different and evolved so that's one thing and then you know specific to tara i remember alex evans myself and joel monegaro met with the tara team and luna was sub a dollar and i want to say it was at devcon in osaka and i just had this one question i didn't understand the system in a full in full but my one question was does luna either have to stay stable or go up for this system to work and the answer was yes and for me when i was like when you are requiring a very volatile asset to either stay stable or go up permanently in the crypto market that is eventually going to get severely tested and so it's not like i had like you know all these models and proofs of like okay ust is probably going to fail it was more like ust had gotten severely tested before the you know some basics of the design were suspect and there were you know other very smart people that were doing deep research to prove how this wasn't gonna gonna hold i think that maybe an argo stable could work like i i don't wanna be the person that says no it'll never work and then like five years from now there's like a perfect cargo stable and everyone's dunking on me um i'm very skeptical like as to how i think the main difference is it needs like extremely large demand for some reason like the they're basically confidence dollars right it's like confidence that the system can hold up and you're happy to sit in those dollars as long as as long as you believe and if everyone believes and there isn't enough people i want to exit so the system can the system has equilibrium of people wanting to enter and wanting to exit at the same time but if an algo stable has that equilibrium broken and more people than the system can handle leaving want to leave the system then the peg breaks and then in luna's case it's programmed to go to zero because you can you you can arb luna in order to try and pump uh ust back to one if like the the exit is sufficiently large then obviously that programmed to zero thing actually happens but if there is sufficient demand maybe based on like real world demand like you can use this currency everywhere perhaps that equilibrium is like so uh large on both sides that it's hard to break or it's so it's hard to for it to become one-sided or something so i don't know i think if this like usa launches a cbdc and it's an argo stable like i think it like the thing they've probably got a better chance because the the confidence um they've already got confidence dollars right like it's already just backed by nothing um so it being backed by nothing but an algorithm also makes sense to me that's the exact right answer it'll be the us government that launches you know the effective algo stable yeah exactly um so so yeah i i don't expect to see one um anytime soon in some ways it's surprising that ust managed to get so big and there were a lot of like extremely smart people that were you know it wasn't a big connect type situation where lots of people were saying like this is going to end badly and it was sort of unanimous that it would end badly and a few people were suckered in instead lots of like you know people like top crypto funds are now net worth negative from those of uh events like even if they weren't in luna they were using anchor um in in some way and had things liquidated so uh yeah i don't expect it to work soon probably the us government that makes it work if if anyone um they can prop it back up again yeah matt levine had a great column in bloomberg where he kind of broke down the elements of an algo stable coin and he said the key ingredient is that you have to have faith in the system and and then said like that's why you know when people lose faith it just crashes and then of course i saw people tweeting like oh you installer basically is that system and then i was like oh right like i was like this is why the us dollar is similar to an algo stable coin and like you i don't want to say it's never going to work because like all the people who said like a plane will never exist like you know you'll never create a thing that flies like you know they were all right up until that moment when suddenly they were wrong and yeah but lucky for them they didn't have twitter so there was no record of it they didn't get dunked on we'd get dunked on we've got to stay open-minded um yeah well that's precisely why as a reporter i like never i mean also i try not to have opinions because i don't want to miss a story um so yeah i keep my mind open to the fact that yes an alcostablecoin could could work at some point but generally like do you feel that now this incident has caused any worries about a general stablecoin contagion or do you think that in general this is like kind of pulling out other ways the system might be over leveraged and that we might see contagion elsewhere in crypto over the next few weeks i think if we do see contagion that like it's a good thing i think a lot of people you know when when the usd thing started happening a lot of people were saying it's an attack and then were you know they were sighting or citadel or blackrock or whatever and i think there was even a statement from one of them or both of them saying like we can't trade stable coins exactly um but even if this was an attack and even if it was citadel and or whoever you know you're putting the the thumbtack of evil onto her um the fact that an attack is possible means like the attack is going to happen one day no matter what you can't say oh there was an attack on a stable coin that's why it's down it means the system was unsound and the system was able to be attacked and if a system is able to be attacked then like all the critics are right basically so i think these bear markets and like this any contagion from ust testing where there's liquidity you know uh problems testing where there's leverage problems every i don't know if you you saw but there were a couple of things where a d5 product on like bsc was using ust but they'd hard coded it to one so that got rugged and then there was some contagion from those things that were like imagining that their stable coins were also pegged to one as well and there was just like a a mini sort of domino effect of places that assumed ust would always be one dollar that also collapsed and those are just weak points in the ecosystem and these bear markets are very good at washing out everything that is weak and is not fundamentally sound in order so that the entire system can end up a little bit stronger afterwards like you know every time bitcoin's been through a bear market i feel like the ecosystem the participants always come out like a little bit more sure of what's next where they're going and it's a little bit more resilient for some reason i'll go stables that hasn't been true people just create another one every year or two because we've got another algo stable it collapses but maybe this event is so sufficiently large that that might not be the case but i do think any contagion from this kind of stuff is good like you saw us a usdt tether d pegged very briefly went down like six percent or or something and a tether collapse would be terrible for the for the space it's i don't know what its market cap is but it's pretty big so that had that being tested and then i think they had the largest redemptions they've ever had i think they had 10 billion or so redemptions um go through and that happening i think that's a very good thing because now that is also slightly de-risked still tether could blow up one day i personally don't believe that it will but you have to test these things otherwise you you can just be building on the sand or whatever the old fable is yeah and i totally agree that um you know these these tests are key and the analogy that's elegant is it's just a fire burning through the forest um and it clears out you know all the scruff and then the really solid trunks and trees and whatever you know they stand the test of time and they actually grow stronger and then you clear space for new saplings to sprout usdt is is a tree trunk right kobe just talked about you know how like if it was 10 billion of redemptions or even just in the billions that's that is a lot of liquidity that is flowing to and from the system that they're able to meet dye and maker dow is also i think a tree trunk um of of the forest and um it has proven resilient like dye occasionally faces liquidity issues but the peg is strong right and it has been severely stress tested at this point maker gets some heat for being conservative but i think now the conservative approach is proving prudent right because you you just want to survive and if you continue to survive continue to be integrated if that trust grows then you become you know more and more systemic to the to the system and there are other good teams that are that are working on improving the liquidity of stables while also prioritizing stability and i get some heat for mentioning gyroscope um in the same context as as maker and i understand like maker has been around for a long time and is the king or queen of stables but explain what gyroscope is it's a project we're checking out yeah it's built on balancer and it's basically nested pools of stables and so they use a primary automated market maker for creation against that pool and redemption really it's the i mean the team behind it has done i would say as much diligence as i've ever seen a team do on making sure that the um mechanisms are hardened for mainnet and they've had a test net for a year and you can of course go and check it out if you're listening but i think the the experimentation with stable coins is not going to end right that's going to continue it's a huge market and i think specifically as it as it pertains to algorithmic stable coins we're going to see what the action is against dokuan and luna and if it is super severe people might experiment with algorithmic stable coins less most people do not want to go to jail for running experiments so that's another shoe to drop where we just don't know exactly you know what the charges are that's going to be that that are going to be brought against luna yeah i do think one that that will be one bit of contagion um though i think i i don't know about the us but i think the uk have now said they want to regulate stable coins i imagine the like anti-crypto parts of the u.s uh like extremely happy that this collapse happened and it was so large and so retail heavy and on a product that advertises itself more as a savings account than than anything else with anchor so so i think this state like you might get the stable act back or whatever it was called in the in the us and i think that contagion is now inevitable because it was such a large event the regulators will feel like they have to do something yeah it was interesting because i had the author of that rowan gray on my show and i actually thought he made good points uh just on an intellectual level and yeah people were really not happy with that with that episode um because you know my audience is definitely a crypto crowd but you know i actually thought he had important arguments to make okay so we touched on this briefly before but obviously now we're in a really different macro environment than crypto has existed in for pretty much all of its history you know um crypto has pretty much only existed in this sort of zero interest rate environment and so now that that era is ending how do you think that will affect things going forward or how do you think it already is affecting things rates have fluctuated a bit um through uh bitcoin's existence we are getting i believe towards the higher end of the range at least when you look at like 10 years or 10-year t-bills if you look at for example 10-year treasuries over you know 30-40 years so going back to the late 1970s they are very clearly on a downtrend right and we've had a major move in rates but they can't go up all that much because it'll start to put stress on how the us government funds itself right and this is actually the game of chicken that the fed is engaged in where they have to scare markets enough bring down asset prices cause people to stop spending some because there is a wealth effect when people made a lot of money off of assets where they just keep spending so you know i forget who it was at the fed but someone a few weeks or maybe even now a month ago said like we need to bring down asset prices not so candidly but that that was the communication and so the fed wants to scare the market right and bring down asset prices bring down spending and really bring down inflation but there's only so high that they can raise rates in order to do so and so that's where it's more of a game of intimidation i think and so my view is like we're not going to a super high rate environment we're not going back to you know volcker years where you know bonds are yielding 15 i'm not enough of like a macroeconomist to say exactly where rates are going to top out but there are people who think that like you could see 10 years roll over meaning like they stop shooting up in yields here relatively soon so just fundamentally the important thing i i think for people listening to understand is the fed funds rate is the basic rate that that defines the cost of money basically so like if you try and get a loan while rates are moving against you your monthly payment is going to be getting more and more expensive as the rates go up that fed funds rate also feeds into the discount rate which people use to value assets like stocks and bonds and cash flows are basically this is oversimplifying it but cash flows are the numerator and that rate that everyone talks about is in the denominator the discount rate and so the bigger the denominator gets the smaller the the product is going to be because you have a bigger number on the bottom and so this is what caught one of the many things right now causing asset prices to collapse the last thing i want to say is um i think people overly fixate on rates and actually under appreciate liquidity um and so like there's the rate side of what central banks are doing but there's also what they're doing with their balance sheets and when central banks are buying assets they're injecting liquidity into global markets and if you look at the fed right now they're selling assets they're selling bonds into the markets which actually sucks liquidity out of the market and you know there are arguments to be made around how dependent asset prices are in liquidity and so when you're sucking liquidity out of a market it's almost like a boa constrictor just tightening around assets and compressing them and so we're doubly fighting the fed we're fighting the fed on rates right now and on liquidity and it goes beyond just you know the u.s central bank so that's the present state right and then you have to ask yourself like when does this end when does the fed get more accommodative and i'm just going to focus on the fed because there's too much of the world to try and cover in one podcast if you look at the fed my view is basically the fed is much more political than people want to admit um we're going into midterms towards the end of this year the fed has to bring down inflation for midterms so it's getting very tough it's comfortable it's clearly signaled it's comfortable placing pain on asset markets and so it's going to carry through with that at the same time you have to think about your year or year inflation comps and actually towards the end of this year the comparables right so like at the end of 2022 our comparables are going to be the end of 2021 and prices were actually already getting pretty high at the end of 2021 and so what that means is your year over year inflation numbers such as cpi are going to start to mellow out and so i think what you'll start to see is like inflation is gonna i think at this point and towards the back half of the year will surprise a bit to the downside the fed will have gotten max aggressive and then can lighten after midterms and so i think this is what sets up the bottom to happen sometime in the back half of 2022 again the bottom of what the bottom of the bear market for crypto assets and equities because it's basically that bottom will happen in like max fed aggression max liquidity withdrawal max panic and everything i was just saying about like what i basically anticipate for q4 is relief right inflation coming down the fed doesn't have to be as aggressive because we're through midterms and also inflation's starting to come down hopefully by that point we have the eth merge kicking in and there start to be like new green shoot narratives that are moving into place for for crypto and you also have a lot of builders building cool stuff in crypto right now it doesn't happen in a quarter or even half a year but you can start to see some of that within a year or two and so that's where i'm pretty optimistic for 2023 it's going to be volatile because crypt is all always volatile and we could talk about how volatile 2019 was and there are ways i could be wrong here but my working framework right now is that we see like max panic sometime in the back half of 2022. okay yeah kobe what were you going to say yeah honestly i'm not going to pretend to understand how the economy works or i i barely even understand how the coins work if i'm um being honest um toby's calling out that i'm just pretending i i mean i genuinely i genuinely don't know and sometimes i think about like properly learning and then i realize and like play video games or something but um like i i have i've had these two competing ideas in my head where when i got into um crypto was like almost 10 years ago now i really felt maybe naively maybe emotionally who knows but i really felt that this was this had to be the way the world would go for things to get fairer for it to be more transparent for it um you know people to have a lifeboat that is often accessible to very wealthy people but not so much to people from lower or middle class i had this saying that lasted maybe five seven years dunno i really really really believe this had to be the way that the financial system would work in in the future and then you know as crypto happen things get more and more stupid and you start to doubt wait like are we just building like are we just building ponzi schemes is like the the best performing asset of the last year was a picture of a monkey so um what are we doing um but like i that is like one of the ideas like that or the original uh feeling is still there and i still see a lot of what i thought the original mission of crypto was in things that are getting built like you know i know that a lot of d51 tokens are completely wrecked like maker nav and stuff but their products are extremely cool building these you know open permissionless like internet banks type products and i still see that as being fundamentally important to the world but this other competing idea is that maybe the fictional internet coins monkey pitchers dog coins like meme stocks etc were actually just a symptom of broken economic policy that did have too much liquidity there was too much money looking for a return and therefore all of these things went up because there was nowhere else to put money like if you were just sat in cash you were being eroded by uh economic policy and it's been like that way for how long like the equities bull market's like 100 years or something so the economy sort of felt like a a solved game in that like people were calling me like my uncle would call me and be like they're printing so much money all assets are going up forever because they're just printing money like the denominator is worthless and normally when those theories reach like critical mass the alpha's sort of erased from them but people have been saying this about the housing market forever so maybe maybe it's wrong but i have these two competing ideas in my head and like i don't know where i sit anymore to be honest i don't think it matters i'll just wait for additional information because i don't really understand how macroeconomic stuff works and if i try to get it wrong i'll stay in my little corner looking like playing with the coins wait for things to get better so i want to riff off that some more because there's some really interesting points raised in there because i think potentially the um the most painful scenario at least for me as a high growth investor is just a period of like meandering low growth mid inflation and you know if you study what happened to japan after the late 1980s bubble which the the powers that be in japan purposefully collapsed that bubble and then changed monetary and fiscal policy but if you study you know japan following that it's been a very low growth environment and like a pretty dead unexciting market on the whole now there's a bunch of things that make the world as a whole unit very different from japan right like japan struggles with like it's it's demographics and there's some cultural components and like they did go through an insane bubble if you look at like the asset valuations in the late 80s which was still much more severe than the bubble of 2021. that's like a for me worst case scenario actually because what i prefer is like major flush pandemonium chaos but then i kind of as a like in bear markets i'm a basically a distressed asset buyer um like placeholder buys in bear markets and sells in bull markets and it's quite easy if you really like zoom out it's not that i enjoy max payne i also get wrecked but like max payne is huge opportunity especially if then it recovers to the upside pretty quickly and so so that's where like for me personally as a high growth investor this kind of meandering low inflation environment would would suck and that could persist for a few years that's kind of my worst case scenario all right so in a moment we're going to just look at kind of where the crypto markets are and how they're changing um we'll talk about kind of this last bull run and then where crypto's going

the description back to my conversation with chris and kobe so this is from conversations with kathy wood um who runs our convest and kathy's making a super interesting point that people aren't listening enough to right now and i know you know some people are mad but i think kathy is a phenomenal investor kathy's making this point that like and this is on the equity side but if you look at growth equities like the fangs and you look at their valuations now versus you look at their valuations in 2000 everyone's kind of reverting to the knee-jerk reaction from 2000 but in 2000 those companies did not have the fundamentals and growths and revenues that they have in 2022 and so they're actually like phenomenally cheap this is on growth equities like things they're phenomenally cheap right now for what their future growth is and to say that they're not going to recover you're making a bet that like the digital is not going to continue to take over in our lives and then crypto's like the highest beta or like the most volatile version of that that bet right and so this is where even though i mentioned that that scenario that would be painful for me personally of just low growth and mid inflation i really my gut tells me like we go back into a high growth environment these things are like a lot of these growth equities are much more sound than people think people are going into value stocks right now that are kind of a trap because they're getting disintermediated by the growth names and so people are like investing according to old ways to get through bear markets but i think it's going to wreck some people further when we emerge from this and the last thing i want to say is like capitalism is designed to grow capital and that's why the market is up only in a way like tipping my hat to kobe and whatever i think i i have conflicts with the idea of up only it makes me laugh and cry at the same time because like on a long enough time scale it's true but it's super volatile in the up only kind of capitalism is designed to grow capital idea yeah so let's let's look a little bit kind of at the cycles within crypto because i would say and you guys can disagree with me this last crypto bull run was a little bit different from previous bull runs where previously you know i think a lot of people sort of got used to this idea that somewhere in the ballpark of like 18 months after the previous bitcoin having we would see a bubble at least in the bitcoin price that kind of sort of panned out but not really in the same way and i wondered you know why you thought that was i think the the big the major assets were just much much much bigger this time like bitcoin was market cap at the top was huge ethereum also was much bigger and i guess as the assets grow the volatility might just continue to decrease so you you maybe can't send bitcoin like 20x in a year anymore because of the capital required to do so would just be so large but i also think a lot of people have lived through through those cycles and sort of had a had this attitude of well actually if i'm gonna spend my time showing something to like as a career like if i'm gonna like show crypto and bitcoin and ethereum as like as my career and to all my friends and we're going to talk about crypto all the time i may as well pick the one where i have like decent upside and i think a lot of people did that so you saw big exchanges aligning themselves with a particular coin where they could have higher upside than just generally crypto you had a lot of ex bitcoin people um who would only talk about bitcoin for the last sort of seven years or so start their own blockchain they sort of came back like tuned in to see what everyone was doing again after the bear market and i was like okay these are people have all just started their own coins okay cool um i think that some people even sort of like actively acknowledged and said that which was just like if i'm going to spend all my time like talking about a thing i may as well own a significant part of it and i think that really changed the incentive structure quite a lot where prior bull markets everyone was sort of focusing on what bitcoin would do and everything else tangential to bitcoin was acknowledged as like euphoria and froth and inviable and probably a little bit silly so you know litecoin was always the next most viable project that existed and then ethereum came along and ethereum cycle was a bit weird because people didn't really know how to um how to to value it um because it made maybe a little bit more sense than uh a lot of the other like bitcoin clone type altcoins so you had a weird swing in 2017 where people would trade ethereum and they would trade bitcoin and they would like the eth btc chart is very very volatile it's just a lot of up and down and this time around people really really really focused on these like sort of micro ecosystems so you have people who instead of onboarding through bitcoin or onboarding through ethereum and then playing alternative assets and rotating back to the major coins these niche assets had enough liquidity they had enough volume that you could treat them as your sort of major home ecosystem so these alternative layer ones had really full bitcoin-esque previous bitcoin-esque cycles uh whereas bitcoin and ethereum had much more muted cycles at the same time there was a lot of a lot of vc stuff so alternative crypto assets when dissimilar to the ico era all of a sudden where the ico euro was a very retail oriented investing environment where everyone got in on the same terms like icos had tons and tons and tons of problems and most of the products didn't materialize and the majority of them were scams et cetera et cetera but as a funding model it was much fairer to what happens to today for a non-professional investor because you were able to buy on the same terms as everybody else as a retail participant and you were able to get a lot of the tokens flow onto the market at the same time whereas now the model sort of reverted to this insider type structure where um a team will sell coins to professional investors which are locked up for a long time and then do another round and blah blah and all of a sudden 30 of the coin is owned by investors that are locked for four years and all of retail has to fomo into this like one percent float and then they have to deal with like gradual unlocks so that made the investing and trading environment there ex like it was novel it was for the first time that this had really happened in crypto it was more hostile to retail so i think those people focused on things that were a little more simple and it led to this like sort of fractured and different bull market which will hugely impact the bear market but i'll talk about that in a little bit well one question for you so um i saw you wrote about what you call meta runs or meta games in in crypto and you were saying that the metagame for the 2021 cycle was ethereum killer so are you referring to all that when you're talking about the vcs pouring in money and and all that yeah so the ethereum killers was like um it was the same sort of trade as ethereum was in 2017 where ethereum sort of was like a little planet and you and the planet was growing because more people were coming to live on the planet and they were building stuff on the planet right so like the planet's economy got better and the planet's base currency was worth more because more people were using it for stuff really what was happening was people were raising money in ethereum so people had to buy ethereum to buy these speculative investments through icos in 2017 whereas this time around a ethereum was very expensive for people so it like cost a lot if you wanted to go live on this planet so people picked other planets like avalanche or solana or luna or phantom or near or who knows one called harmony i don't think it ever worked but they would go to those planets instead and they had a sort of similar uh trade so that felt like the the one with the most historic comparative reference where if the planet grows and other things are built on the planet and you know you have fundraisers done there defy launched there nfts launched there then that base asset will grow but because these planets became more complex than 2017 2017 it was like the only thing that happened on the planet was fundraising that was it you could go and you could buy an ico token and then you could lose money or make money um and you moved on whereas in 2020 2021 2022 you had different things happening you had fundraisers you had game fire you had nfts you had d5 projects you had farming you had all these things and the capital would sort of rotate around those things without the same desire to sort of move in and move out there were a lot of different things happening in uh liquidity could just sort of flow around the system which again i think changed the the bull market quite a lot too yeah i wondered if it was nfts that changed it but chris what are your thoughts well there's there's so much there i want to start first with kind of the tragic irony of what regulation did to crypto coming out of 17 because kobe's totally right that yeah 17 was crazy and irresponsible in some ways but i think that was really the best year to be a retail participant in crypto not not to crush people now there's still lots of opportunity now but like that free market environment if you were on it was as open access i think as crypto will ever get and it's tragic to me that as regulation comes in it it's it's doing the very thing it is trying to protect against like the regulators will be like we're here to protect the little guy but actually all the rules that come in benefit vcs like me and so i see it very clearly kobe sees it too and it's um i don't know it's just like the folly of man is actually pretty depressing for me because i'd say my goal for getting into crypto is very similar to kobe's just to see all the ways in which we are straying from the original path as is frustrating but then specifically as it pertains to that bull bull market i really think of all the assets and this aligns with what kobe was saying but um i think of assets of just a long risk spectrum and btc is lowest risk eth is next and then you go out on this like longer tail of risk and when things first launch they're at the far right tail of risk like furthest tail but as they survive and grow and grow and grow they migrate and become more like ethan btc and when eath launched right in 15 it was far right tail risk and and then so when you look at the first bull market that a lot of like tail risk crypto assets go through that's typically where you're going to get the 1000x at least historically so that was like you know btc early on like even and and i'm talking like trough of bear to peak of bull so like if i look at 17 right trough of bear for for um eth into the peak of 17 was really a thousand x because he you know the crowd said was 30 cents traded like sub a dollar entering like late 15 into 16 and i i think of like 15 16 17 as one cycle and eth went from just call it roughly a dollar to 1500 so that was thousand x for eth and then btc was one cycle progress it was no longer in its 1000x stage so btc went from 200 in 14 and 15 to 20k so that was 100x and then you look at 21 again btc as a cycle progressed right so it's not even going for the 100x that it got in 17 if you look at 21 b2c was roughly a 20x call it 3k to 60k yeah it was 70k so it was like 23x and then eth was more in that 100x realm eth was only 60x from a bottom of 80 to about 5 000 but then it was the new like say most successful far right risk assets that got the 1000x and seoul was probably the poster child of that and and so then now the question becomes okay soul in a lot of these other ones but i'll just use soul because i think it's a nice like btc ethol so now souls getting sold down horribly but that doesn't mean it dies right that means like you wash a lot of stuff out actually what's what's funny is like what people are doing to seoul right now is what the mac the btc maxis did to eth in 18 and 19. and now it's it's kind of the ethmaxis and i get categorized as an ethmaxy and i love youth but i'm not an ethnoxy it's the ethmaxy's doing to seoul what the btc maxis did to eath and so the hazing cycle continues um but then you know you have to ask yourself you know if if sol gets to something like twenty dollars is there a fifty to a hundred x on the table that would be sold at a thousand to two thousand and if so then it is just repeating what eth has done and btc did before it and there are different economic models here and considerations you have to make and btc and east are are very different but like ethan's soul are are converging on like similar economic models like the capacity constraints and those things are quite different and so there's a lot of debate around the value of the block space of the two chains but like a very simple heuristic i use now is like soul is on the heels of eth and so then you can start to like just zoom out and look at broad patterns um and say okay what can you expect soul or you you can pick your favorite you know alt l1 what can you expect seoul to do in the next expansionary phase based on what we have seen eth do in prior cycles and so when you say that i mean because they sort of compete but you're saying like you you expect that eth will just be a model and that we don't have to think about it being zero sum and like only one will succeed or anything like that yeah it's i think of it a bit like what you've seen play out in public cloud where there's like a handful of major players there's like microsoft public cloud google public cloud amazon public cloud so more like specialty say application specific public cloud providers but i think you'll get a handful of really big winning smart contract protocols btc is independent and kind of its own thing as digital gold and like in some ways much more integrated into the traditional financial system as a new macro asset so you leave that to the side but then you say okay what are going to be the winning permissionless public cloud providers that's one way you could really think of a lot of this infrastructure is it's like community owned and operated digital services or public clouds and so then it's like okay definitely think eath is here to stay what else is here to stay and why and like we spend a lot of time focusing on the developer ecosystems because like right now like everything is bleeding red right but if you keep an eye on where developers are building their asses off and still raising good capital they're all creating cool things which will rise in the next cycle and will bring in another 10x of users and so like you can't just look at like what's happening to users or prices right now in this point in time and be like these things are losing because then i actually think you lose perspective on the opportunity if you try and zoom in instead to the fundamentals of what really matters and what will lay the foundation for the next expansion period and just out of curiosity did placeholder invest in sol or no no we've never been involved in their um private rounds so okay people don't really know this but placeholders got two hats we're a venture arm where we're very hands-on with our teams and we're specifically focused on things that are going to better distribute data wealth and power and really each of the partners myself joel and brad we look at when you take on an entrepreneur you want to really be committed to that person and it can be a three five ten year relationship and so you really want to make sure you're ideologically aligned and you want to work on that problem and solution we also have a public markets practice i can't talk too much about the funds because we are an ria but what i can say is we are looking at things outside of eth and you know we will disclose it on our website at a at a certain point because even though eth is here to stay it will not be the only one there's already like incredible uh escape velocity amongst some high quality layer one smart contract protocols it's interesting i i don't think i knew that um it's more like the block tower model um i guess i would say block tower sits on the pub like if you were to look at the two of us it's like block power block tower is weighted more towards the public markets and we're made it weighted more towards vc but we do have this dual practice we a number of deals are a lot more by vc but actually in capital we're pretty even weighted because we can build very large positions in things that we have high conviction in in in the public markets that is so kobe i wanted to ask you because you also wrote this post and obviously you're you're a co-founder of lido but you wrote recently that you feel like we're seeing the end of staking so can you elaborate on that yeah i don't work on ido anymore um by the way so if you're a regulator please don't sue me for everything but um uh i'm not going to say anything like about lido that i don't know anything what's going on with lido these days i just follow it as a normal person but i wrote a post because i think it was about apecoin if you like are living a happy life with lots of hobbies and you don't follow the depths of crypto you might not know what a point is so the popular monkey picture nft flagship nft of this cycle um they perpetuated an ecosystem wealth effect by dropping additional nfts to their community or doing it like additional sales and if you owned uh one of their nfts you could um participate for sure you didn't have to like participate in the gas wars or whatever and they did this a few times they did the dogs and then the like mutant deformed uh version of the flagship ape and then they created a coin which is i guess the intention is to be the currency of their metaverse or something eight coin was owned you know like 20 by the yugo labs founders 30 by 35 by the ape coin dow a little bit by investors some of it went to charity um who knows but like it was mostly insider owned and then some was air dropped to people that owned the board eight nfts and then you know the air drop goes it's worth 10 20 billion dollars i don't remember how much this coin is is worth in in total and then one of the people on the apecoin board god this is what i mean crypto is so stupid down there these are the things i've gotta like literally know about the apecoin board like the metaverse currency come on but anyway um one of the investors on the apecoin board did this proposal which was like oh we should have staking for apecoin like we like people want a state that stake their apecoin so we should do staking and the staking proposal was just like we'll pay you if you state your clients like it doesn't practically do anything there is no like work done it is like sort of co-opted the name staking so it looks like what a proof-of-stake blockchain does in order to secure the chain where you're paid coins for posting collateral and promising to do good work but the eight point version of staking was just nothing like we'll pay you if you don't sell your coins is basically the version of state the version of staking they were going for i think it's just problematic for a few reasons like first of all it is just paying for people for not selling and you you get paid in the currency that you're also not selling so it's just diluting the overall supply if everyone was taking you own the same amount of you you own the same percentage of the network but more coins but the client's probably worth less and then you've incurred tax obligations for nothing i don't know it seems silly but i also think it's bad that the like the term staking has just been changed to mean something different like originally it did actually mean something important to make a system viable and staking which is being paid for not selling your coins doesn't really do anything within a system i mean it maybe influences the price in a positive positive way and i think repurposing these like cryptocurrency terms that did mean something into something that only impacts the price is sort of a symptom of like how new entrants see the space or how big like non-believing actors see how they can extract like money from the space right and i think regulators are just going to come have a field day with that if like you ask a regular person what is staking and they don't know if there's any risk they don't know if you can lose coins by staking they don't know what it does it could be risk-free it might not be risk-free like that sort of confusion i think regulators like don't want that uh that confusion within like retail participants they want things to be clear for uh everyone to understand so i just think it a lot of these things are quite bad and when they're propagated by like the big funds or the big builders which the apecoin board is just like huge investors and um funds and builders uh in the space it i you have to question whether there's like adverse adversarial incentives here like what is the purpose for this proposal really if the people who are proposing it have their coins locked and the proposals only impact will encourage some people not to sell is it supposed to prop up the price until their coins unlock because there's no other viable real reason for it it's not it's not doing anything um but yeah like i think proof of stake proof of work big debate each have their own place in the world this new form of staking which is just like i don't know it feels more like fraud because it doesn't do anything it encourages people not to sell i i think that is one of the my least favorite things that we've come up with as a community in the last couple of years all right so chris i happen to notice a tweet that you made on november 8th last year in which you said easy to become entitled in this environment for those who haven't seen a bear things are not always so free-flowing being grateful for things you're getting now creates the good will to carry you through a bear okay so you tweeted this on what looking back i can see was bitcoin's all-time high and ethereum's was like the day before and i know that you talk a lot about how you value these assets you use terms like simple moving average or exponential moving average how do you kind of make this analysis and how do you think you were able to call that top so i wouldn't say that on that day i was like this is the top i'm going to tweet this thing to mark the top right we're all human and we look through you know at best very hazy crystal balls the way i work in judging bottoms and tops is really sentiment driven and it's trying to like zoom out and hold myself stable and then just observe what the people around me are doing you start to get very similar markers of tops and bottoms that you see both digitally and physically and so late last year i started to get pretty cautious i had joked much earlier in the year that the algorithm said december 2021 would be the top and and that that's another thing that i can come back to but like specifically q4 last year it it just felt disgusting if i'm honest it was like everything was hyped everything was promotional everyone was foaming at the mouth it was you know not even thinly veiled anymore that it was all about the money um and and that just doesn't sustain right it's like this hot ball of money that's growing growing growing folding over on itself but has no substance and so you could just feel that we were near the end another big marker for me is like when i start hearing crypto conversations all over the place in real life okay like you know this is not normal like i even remember in 2017 like i'd go to different bodegas in new york city i'd be staying the line waiting for my morning bagel and like the guys behind me are talking about eth and i'm just like okay like again we got to be near at the top here and similarly we'll be near the bottom when like no one wants to talk about crypto and crypto twitter is pretty silent and people are pretty depressed and you know whatever those those will be the markers the other thing i just want to say briefly is like the way i work with like looking at these markets and these patterns is to assume that humans aren't that different and that our patterns roughly repeat and so i see a lot of people who want to like make the new call about how things are going to be different and there's a whole book called this time is different which is ironically about how this time is basically never different and so you know crypto has this four-year cadence around btc and i think that will start to like soften as the having events are less impactful when you actually look at the real economics of minors but like thus far that has been the cadence and so that's why i was like okay algorithm says december 2021 top like december was the top of 13 december was the top of 17. like pretty decent odds december could be the top of 2021 is right it's not rocket science and then it's really like prove to me and i'm always asking myself why will this time be different it's not that i'm not going through that exercise but the starting point is to assume that the patterns are roughly the same because we as humans don't change that much and so that's where i'm using the same heuristic to navigate the current bear market um so i wanted to ask both of you this question both of you have been through multiple bull and bear markets what mistakes have you made in past cycles that you have learned from and um if you could impart those lessons to the listeners i'm sure they'd be grateful i don't know who has more mistakes i've made every possible one so for me like i i've done it 10 years i made every possible mistake i didn't really even ever do it professionally so like the fact it was like a hobby for the majority of the first part made it be much more prone to mistakes i guess and i've seen crypto sort of like a survival game because like over the past decade i've seen opportunities for hundreds of hundreds of opportunities for regular people to turn small investments into life-altering fortunes like you know enormous amounts of money but i've also seen hundreds of opportunities for regular people to turn their investments into nothing and the amount of people that kept life-altering fortunes is significantly smaller than the amount of people that had them at any moment in time and i think a lot of people will you know resonate with that given the state of the last few months or this year or something if you see it as a game of survival then you have to like figure out okay what can kill you and what what can be the things that uh like knock you out of the game and the idea is you don't get knocked out of the game because crypto has a lot of promises left to fulfill and if it is going to take the role in society that some of us believe it will then there's a lot of upside left so just being exposed to that um is is like the the goal of the game you just want to maintain an increasing amount if possible but at least um a stable amount of crypto exposure so like what can kill you and then there's like you know i self-custody of assets you can leave stuff on exchanges and exchanges can run away if you do self-custody asset you can lose the key you can lose the password for the key you have to end up brute forcing your key i made like a password dictionary to brute force old keys because i forgot what the specific password was um once i typed it wrong when i signed up i poorly risk managed um investments when i got to the point where i was like i was a i'm over believing in something and not really understanding the the landscape properly but one thing that my main takeaway from all this stuff i stole from ledger my podcast co-host he calls it the horcrux method which i think is a harry potter reference where if you have to survive then you just need to split your soul into however many places that the evil guy in harry potter did it um because if you leave some stuff on an exchange and i exchange rugs or that exchange dies and it was everything then you're out of the game you can't win if you're uh if you're not betting and if you lose all your money you can't bet again so you need us you need to like spread across your exchange you need to spread across self-custody types you need to spread your investments out if you go all in on like luna the lunar ecosystem for example you might think you're diversified because you own luna you own stable coins you own a decks you own uh blah blah blah but if the whole ecosystem blows up then you weren't really um diversified at all so i think it's just about like figuring out what can kill you and then figuring out how you need to like split your soul across entire crypto universe in order to survive no matter what um and then the final thing is like like managing your own emotions in in this like marathon of in like investing i think is increasingly difficult i seen people that were very very very stable five years ago and like the toll of crypto starting to get in them and now they're going insane so figuring out how you can be happy and self-sustaining through that entire time you're not mentally attaching yourself to net worth peaks and thinking about the what could have been if you'd acted differently in the past and instead just trying to like live a happy life have have over hobbies have a way to turn off and really manage to treat this like not the be all and all of of the world i think really really really helps because you can make decisions with a clear mind but yeah i've done everything wrong absolutely everything mount gox to don't want to think about it and he's still a legend well really good advice around the horcrux method and you know diversifying your life i i just jotted some of these down if i go through the years of like professionally focusing on crypto so like 2014 i didn't buy enough bitcoin you know like just didn't put in enough cash and then 2015 when eth launched i noticed this correlation basically negative correlation between btc and eth and i thought i could be a good trader because at the time like the markets were still quite small and like if btc would pump it'd actually draw some liquidity from eth and eth would go down a bit and then it like sees all back and forth and so i was thinking like oh i can like you know stack btc and ethan just really created a huge tax headache for myself that was like marginally worth it way over traded in 2015. 2016 it was kind of all for naught you probably remember this laura but i went through this catastrophic hack where i got sim swapped and then all my accounts got drained and i tweeted on twitter i'm getting hacked and it's actually eamon gunsir now the founder of avalanche who saved me and helped me like build out my perimeter but like and basically lost all my eath not all my btc it took me a long time to get back to that stack of eath because eath had been so cheap up until that point and then that was i think december of 16 that that happened to me and then 17 eth just started running and i was still working at arc and arc was still very much a startup and it's not like i was making tons of cash so that was super painful by the end of 17 i had published crypto assets and started placeholder and i would say i was too cocky that was like my big mistake of 17 and that like led to emotional downfall in 18. i wonder if doe quan is going to listen to this episode anyway i plowed cash into stuff too early in 18 and i had some assets on an institutional scale where like i was like and i i tweeted this kind of warning some people earlier of like you cannot prop up a market that is moving against you it will crush you and if you're arrogant enough to think that you can like you're gonna learn this this lesson and i definitely learned it in 18 where i was basically just you know provided a massive amount of exit liquidity to a bunch of people and you know wore it on the chin for a few years 2019 got horribly whiplashed after being exit liquidity for people in 18 because 19 i think btc went from like 3k to 14k it was like 3k january i think we went back and retested that but then like april we started taking off and i i believe the range was like btc 3k to 14k and eth like you know 80 to like three or four or 500 and then like round tripped right and so like i thought i was having fomo that like the bear was done and you know as a as a at scale money allocator i can't miss right i have to like be disciplined and preserve my capital but i also can't miss so i got caught up in some fomo and whiplash in 19. and so that was six years of heavy mistakes that i think finally like 20 21 and 22 i'm doing better i'm sure i'm gonna get humbled in some way like crypto always humbles you um but yeah i mean like kobe basically made every mistake um in the book you know who i want to get on the show to do the same exact rundown as arthur hayes yeah yeah i mean yeah he was very early and at scale you know like because early crypto was very different from now like we don't go through as many exchange failures we now go through smart contract failures and like just different different kinds of risk these days yeah all right so we're gonna try to end on a somewhat positive note why don't you guys talk about what it is that you think the next innovations will be that uh will come out of this kind of like build cycle and potentially be catalyst to the next bull market well i don't know the answer honestly um i have completely no idea and sort of throughout history i have never known until i've seen it you know that if i try and post-rationalize i can go back in my head to like 2013 and be like yeah i totally saw the future of and i saw you know uniswap and all these things but really i didn't i just you know i wanted there to be a financial system um that worked in the same way bitcoin worked um and i didn't really know what that looked like and sure maybe that looks like some parts of uh decentralized finance and you know some parts of decentralized finance and not practically decentralized so i think we've got a long way to go i i've never really been able to predict what the emerging um trends of um crypto are going to be when i see them i i think a lot of the secrets of crypto and like the how you predict the future i think they're like hidden in plain sight and really it's just like using everything as people build it use it give it a go see if it's useful to you see if you can understand how the product works or why people would want it and then if you think that that's good and it's useful to you then you like buy a lot of it so bitcoin was like that ethereum at first i i was excited for and then it became like an illegal fundraising platform in 2017 and i was a little bit like is this all we can do and then by early defy i got to use those products and i was like okay wait these things are actually kind of cool and now i like i'll buy a lot of these things and if these things are being built on ethereum then ethereum is also realizing a different vision to being like a felonious kickstarter so like i don't know honestly no idea i'm not the person that you should ask i'm i feel like i'm much better at seeing things as they are and therefore like making decisions based on reality but i'm very bad at predicting which way reality is going to go in the future without evidence oh sorry it's a non-answer it's okay chris non-answer is probably the safest or most sound answer as i'm just looking at what teams are raising to build overarchingly i would say the caliber of entrepreneurs moving up another peg here and um i'm very excited and that's not just vc talk but like i'm quite excited for two three four years out what what's gonna emerge because we really are getting some very quality web to talent mixing with crypto native talent and so it'll have the crypto backend but the web 2 experience and sheen um getting more specific like with what kobe just mentioned about d5 from icos and 17 into d5 that got built i think the same thing's going to happen to nfts so 2021 for nfts was what 2017 was for d5 so like ico was the og static defy in a way it was just fundraising it was static there wasn't that much that you could do with it but speculate but then it raised all this capital that allowed defy to emerge and you had early things emerging in 17 right with 0x and i think maker launched at the end of 17 with dye and you had the very earliest og guys by the end of 17 but really was like 18 19 20 that d5 bloomed programmatically and i think you'll see the same thing with nfts as they get a lot more interesting programmatic like rich nuances and user experiences whether it be in game play or community organization or even funding interesting creative works so i'm excited to see nfts move past you know pfps and pure speculation i think you'll start to see with d5 you'll start to see delineation between like punk and permissionless d5 which basically puts up the middle finger to regulators versus like white collar regulated sealed off defy and then that will allow a lot more institutions to come in turning to bitcoin bitcoin is going to get more programmatic bitcoin is not going away i don't think bitcoin is going to suffer failures because of its incentive incentive model i did the really early research at arc in 2015 on bitcoin's transaction fee once the block rewards go away this has been a problem forever for bitcoin people are talking about a lot right now but i do believe bitcoin is going to find ways to solve it and bitcoin's brand is the strongest brand in all of crypto um it is near globally recognized and ways to make it programmatic are emerging be they lightning or stacks or whatever and you know i people have like said that's just never going to happen and when people start to say that is when it happens specific to eth eth is going to continue to scale eth2 is going to happen layer 2 is going to happen a few of the l2s will be big winners hopefully the user experience of going between eth and l2s or between l2s really improves here we definitely need it too and then i guess i'll end with the up and coming smart contract platforms you know some of the winners there are going to chase what eth did in 2021 so that was eth getting to probably i think is around 500 billion network value and so then you just need to look at the supply of those things the market structure and say okay if this thing's gonna chase that you know what will the prices of those things be and i think you're gonna start to see like a lot of sector specific segmentation where the use case of the entrepreneur building the dap fits the underlying smart contract protocol and so it's like we know what ethereum is and stands for it's like the most og the most decentralized the most kind of funky and creative cosmos is like the most thin pieces loosely joined you have solana as like consensus at the speed of light and like more financially oriented then you have you know storage-based systems like you know filecoin or r-weave which are like focusing on their own types of things i think people have forgotten about polka dot and kusama but they shouldn't and so like really looking at like why builders are going to choose a smart contract protocol i think will then inform what is going to happen with those smart contract protocols when the next expansion is upon us but it's it's not a good idea to like point fingers and laugh when everything is going down because some of these things will rise again i like that uh that i said nothing and then you just picked everything you listed every kryptos you're like polka dots came back kasam is coming back don't forget about this one every single asset in existence i while you were talking though i did think a little bit about what i think needs to happen in the future and not necessarily what i think is going to happen but i think it is important for the future of crypto and i think it's like fixing trust assumptions whether where they're not necessary so i think you mentioned you know it's not exchanges that gets hacked get hacked anymore it's actually smart contracts and the biggest smart contract hacks recently have all been bridges and like you know there was the ronin bridge there was wormhole etc so i think you will see light client uh optimistic relay bridges zk bridges state proof bridges whatever whatever we end up on if you can get zk bridges like viable in production really a raising where there are trust assumptions in the network and replacing those pieces of fragility i think uh will be important and i think we also probably need to see real world assets onboarding because crypto is sort of this sort of tangential ecosystem where you built all this defy stuff but the only thing you can really do with it is leverage trade crypto assets uh or like you know yield farmers and and stuff but a lot of the products that have been built are actually quite useful if you somehow connect to reality and have you know real world on crypto rails so like those two things that i am like looking for signs of life within in bull markets a lot of people figure out user needs and they sticky tape or bandage up a solution and then in bear markets people have years to build a proper solution to those problems so i think that'll be make me quite optimistic if we can like work on some of those things however you said you wanted to end on a high note i don't want to end on a high note because this episode was about bear market and i i do want to draw a parallel between what i think might happen soon and what happened with luna because you saw luna you know it was worth 100 and it started crashing and it just went in a straight line downwards right like i've like i don't know if anyone's ever seen something in crypto do that before but it just kept going down it it felt suddenly felt cheap at ten dollars and then moments later was worth one dollar and then moments later it was worth ten cents and then one cent and then like fractions of cents it was just a straight line to zero but after a day or two of that selling and the price was you know extremely low all of a sudden versus what people had mentally acclimatized to uh over the previous six months all of a sudden i went i went and looked on coin gecko and i looked at the market cap and i was like okay so it's worth the price is zero and then it's still worth five billion dollars like that how does that make sense and i think that this is the first bear market where people are going to have that realization over and over and over and over it's the first one where they've mentally acclimatized to prices where seed investors are still up 100x or 200x or 1000x and things can go down 99 and then 99 and then 99 and then 99 again and still be overvalued at the end of it because the fully diluted valuations of these projects that are unlocking over the next four years will mean complete decimation of their prices and still a valuation that is unrealistic when compared to what they have built compared to their metrics etc and as liquidity has pulled out the system as chris was saying earlier the people holding these coins that unlock these tokens that unlock have every incentive to gather that liquidity into their you know hibernation pot for uh the future to offset other losses to um you know pay back uh lps or or raise capital for the future and this is the first time this happened in crypto this like sec sponsored low flow uh investor locked coins professional investor model and i think it's really gonna people over sorry i don't know if i'm allowed to swear on this book i think that's a really good tone from kobe to temper say some of my enthusiasm what i would say is like people really have to pay attention to market structure and so kobe's talking about fully diluted valuations you know paying attention to how insiders are unlocking um and what their price points are because you you could have something that's down 90 but seed investors could still be up as he was saying you know 50 or 100 x and they will continue to sell what i use so i very much pay attention to market structure but i what i use to keep me sane is again looking at past patterns right so like eath defy in the 1819 bear bottoms you know for the blue chips like xerox and maker were in the hundred to two hundred million fully diluted range right and so then if you have solana d5 projects at 20 billion you know that's where you could have some of those crazy scenarios and where you do want to pay attention to what those fully diluted valuations are similarly i think eth bottomed in 1819 around 10 billion i think things some of these still quality smart contract protocols will go lower than that but it's kind of like okay go back and look at where things bottomed in 1819 on a fully diluted basis where support came in know that some of these bottoms will be even more horrible because of how much insiders have been allocated to but like people have to contextualize valuations i think to have any grip on where bottom will be here and we will bottom around when btc and each bottom but if btc and eth keep testing that bottom the long tail will just keep bleeding lower okay you guys this has been so fun where can people learn more about each of you and your work uh twitter.com kobe but like prepare to be offended it's not nice there you'd be pleased to know kobe in a placeholder lp call someone asked me who's the best person to follow on twitter or most crypto native and i said you but i did say like you have to be prepared to be offended as well you can also find me on twitter i'm cbernisky and placeholder's website is placeholder.pc perfect thank you both so much it has been such a pleasure having you both on unchained thank you thanks laura thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about chris kobe and the bear market check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel ness mark murdoch shishank and clk transcription thanks for listening you
