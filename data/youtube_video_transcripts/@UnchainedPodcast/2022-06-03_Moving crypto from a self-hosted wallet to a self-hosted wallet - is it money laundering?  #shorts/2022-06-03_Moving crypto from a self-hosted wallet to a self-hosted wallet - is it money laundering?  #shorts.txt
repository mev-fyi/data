moving something between unhosted wallets or self-hosted wallets itself seems hard to say is money laundering i mean this is the same thing as using tornado cash if i took all of my crypto right now put it into tornado cash and and brought it back not doing anything else remotely illegal that in and of itself is not illegal if you committed a crime and then tried to obscure the trail of that money by putting it through tornado cash or other means that could arguably arguably be money laundering so again we come up to the question that we talked about before if he had the proceeds of the crime and he was moving them from wallet to wallet to wallet in some attempt to hide his trail one could make an argument that that would be money laundering now i don't think it's a very strong argument right this isn't legal advice but if you're going to commit crimes it's usually not a good idea to do it you know on public blockchains that leave an immutable permanent trace of your activity that's not legal advice the legal advice is like don't commit crime but if you're going to do it leaving a trace like that doesn't strike me as as very effective money laundering now of course ineffective criminals are punished all the time right if you try something and you do it in a stupid way and you are caught you can't say what i did was so stupid you couldn't possibly have believed i was trying to rob the store like no that that doesn't work but there really is a good question about whether moving money from one self-hosted wallet to another could really count as trying to hide a trail of money when the trail of money is all going to be right there for everyone to see and of course that's even before we get to the questions that we raised earlier about doing that in advance of any kind of purchase that would be allegedly illegal if you enjoyed watching this clip hop onto youtube.com c unchained podcast to watch the entire episode and don't forget to subscribe while you're there you can also listen to the whole show in any of your favorite podcasting platforms
