CZ binance and several crypto influencers have been hit with a one billion dollar lawsuit for promoting unregistered Securities I had no idea those accounts were called crypto influencers I thought the technical term for them was Bots it's a class action lawsuit so anyone who lost money trading finances on registered Securities may be eligible for compensation if anyone in the audience has been personally victimized by crypto prices raise your hands now okay I'm seeing that most of you have both hands in the air but Moskowitz Law Firm who filed this suit has actually settled similar cases against FTX and Voyager see some people do make money in crypto for one I'm shocked to learn that there are rules that govern what influencers can and cannot promote on social media does anyone know of a class action lawsuit that I can join for anyone who spent 275 dollars on a hair product that was allegedly guaranteed to ensure their boyfriends didn't break up with them despite all the bad news for binance CZ is not stressed in fact he was caught partying lavishly on a yacht with other crypto Founders in his defense that's sort of the only way to party on a yacht
