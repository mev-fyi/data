openc customers fell prey to a complex phishing attack on sunday morning according to an internal investigation completed by the nft marketplace the attack was not specifically connected to openc emails domains or its official website overall the attack took place across 15 hours during which thousands of dollars worth of nfts were stolen in a tweet thread recapping the phishing scam openc cto nadav hollander explained the scam was most likely a targeted attack as opposed to a systemic issue regarding a contract upgrade on openc that tricked users into signing a malicious smart contract going forward hollander is confident that fishers will have trouble executing similar attacks because openc is adding eip 712 to its new contract this upgrade will improve the security of signing off

organization focused on supporting terra and ust the largest stable coin ontario and fourth largest stable coin by total market capitalization writ large notably proceeds from the 1 billion lunar sale will be used to purchase bitcoin and create a forex reserve available to tap during times of extreme market volatility to keep ust's value pegged to the dollar according to a thread by tara the move is designed to assuage concerns regarding a crypto bank run scenario and bitcoin is the ideal asset for such a plan although the widespread adoption of ust as a consistently stable asset through market volatility should already refute this a decentralized reserve can provide an additional avenue to maintain the peg in contractionary cycles that reduces the reflectivity of the system the ust forex reserve is an lfg initiative to provide a further layer of support for the ustpeg using assets that are considered less correlated to the tarot ecosystem like bitcoin in addition to the terra
