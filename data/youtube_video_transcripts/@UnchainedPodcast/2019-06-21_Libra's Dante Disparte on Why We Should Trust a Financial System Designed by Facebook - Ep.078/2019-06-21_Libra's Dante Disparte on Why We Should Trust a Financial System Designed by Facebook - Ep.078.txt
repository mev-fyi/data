exchanges crypto businesses and regulators today's guest is dante diskpart a head of policy and communications for Libre welcome Dante Thank You Laura happy to be on the program you've had a big week for those listeners who were under a rock here at this week Facebook unveiled its plans for its cryptocurrency Libre Dante just to make things clear for listeners can you distinguish between the roles of Facebook Libra and Calibra in this system sure so at the outset I work for Libre Association so I had policy and communications for the Association and the Association is comprised today of 28 founding members including Facebook you have groups like Visa MasterCard uber lyft social impact partners like Kiva Women's World banking Mercy Corps among others and that's going to be a continually growing list of founding partners of the Association Association will do three primary things in this project the first is to provide overall governance the second is to provide a reserve feature and treasury feature backing every Libre digital currency and the third is to manage the technology roadmap as an open-source blockchain project so those are the three roles of the association Facebook of course as a founding partner and really the the firm that has helped incubate this project has been driving the early technology development but has now shifted that as an open source project under the Association and Facebook has also simultaneously launched its own digital wallet called Calibra which will be an on-ramp that will facilitate access to Libre and payments through Libre across its multitude of platforms such as whatsapp messenger and as a standalone solution and within the Libre Association there's the association itself the council and the board can you also differentiate those for listeners yes so you know like any nonprofit organization especially one with this type of governance structure and the vision ultimately is to do two things one is to create the sim a simple global currency and a financial infrastructure that can empower billions of people an assignment that big and a mission that big of course requires governance and and leadership so the the board of the Association will be kind of an ultimate governance body that will each member of that group will have the same vote the same weight there's no proportionality to that it's really meant to be very democratic and require one-thirds votes on certain certain decisions relating to the digital currency the reserve features and governance and that really just ensures that there's an equal weighting in that coalition a council as well effectively would sort of mirror the type of governance that you see in these types of associations around the world that you'll stay a little bit closer to the action from an operational point of view and that count and that that those two organizations and bodies here are still in the design phase of a charter for the Association as well as the search for a overall head a managing director if you will to drive the organization so it's very early days yet and tell us more about yourself your background and how you came to be in this role yeah so it's it's um such a fascinating journey as you know Laura the you know at first when you first encounter blockchain and crypto currencies it requires a suspension of disbelief especially when you think about our economy and our financial and political systems that they tend to be heavily centralized they tend to be very opaque they tend to be friction Laden and so when you first encounter this technology you you of course are you go down the rabbit hole very very fast and so in my case you and I first met on Necker Island back in 2017 an important year I think for a blockchain but also an important year for the world is it Puerto Rico where I'm from was flattened by a series of hurricanes as was Necker Island and all of a sudden the urgency of moving to a world that was more equitable that created more opportunity and where you could sort of leverage technology to drive social impact it just stopped being abstract for me and so from then I've spent courtesy of your kind introductions I spent the last 24 months chronicling the development of this technology in Forbes and then working really hard to make it acceptable in the halls of power around the world so you know lo and behold here I stand before cameras trying to defend crypto and blockchain in front of the entire planet and you I just out of curiosity was wondering because you have been based in DC for a long time will you be moving to Geneva for this role yeah that is the plan and candidly you know other than my wife indicating that I always score expatriate opportunities in cold countries I'm very much excited to moving to Switzerland and to Geneva specifically so yeah so I will be taking up the assignment based out of Geneva with the headquarters and clearly the goal there is to be very much plugged into civil society and to international organizations which would call Geneva home so that this becomes as much a global project and not a us-centric effort and just to to fill reader listeners and I think you had previously also lived in Denmark which is maybe you read about the cold exactly I lived in Denmark for nearly seven years where most expats don't last but a couple so so I have a great affinity for for Europe and looking forward to living there again so what's your response to the number one concern that's being expressed about Libra which is that Facebook which has a poor track record regarding privacy is now launching a system that will have financial data on billions of people potentially potentially well you know so they're there there's a general tendency on the planet which of course hasn't spared any organization or any institution marked by a really really precipitous decline in an institutional trust the Edelman Trust Barometer picks this up and it's true of public for-profit nonprofit organizations the world over so I think there's a there's a broad broad mega trend on the planet around institutional trust and a decline in institutional trust for my part I wouldn't want to be a part of an organization or a project that would only amplify that erosion of trust and I think at the design level when you really really start to you know Intuit what is being built here and how it is being built and how Facebook and by virtue of the Association has really put great checks and balances on its power this is as close as you can get to creating something that can serve ultimately as a public good so I think there's a huge opportunity that at a high level to really expand finance and its capabilities in response to the direct question about trust and the commingling of personal data payment data and social media data part of the reason I think Facebook has established a separate subsidiary that would be registered and regulated like a financial institution would is to create a clear firewall between payment information and personally identifiable information and the Association itself understands clearly that we don't exist in a vacuum of financial regulations so you know I've been incredibly eager to continue the dialogue with regulators and policymakers around the world where I think frankly blockchain and crypto currencies go a long way further than traditional fiat currencies in the issues regulators care about like anti money laundering fraud traceability this type of opportunity blockchain does more for that than self reporting which we typically see from financial institutions yeah I think so one concern is that even though Calibra will be a subsidiary that because the wallets will be rolled out on messenger and whatsapp but that kind of just immediately out of the gate gives Calibra potentially you know the same kind of reach and power as facebook at least in terms of the amount of data that it can collect and you know it's financial data so I think you know and then to have sort of the DNA of Facebook managing that data I wonder if if that's also part of the concern you know like this is meant to be an open system and other companies eventually should be able to build on it etc but there's only really one entity that has the kind of reach you know other than maybe I think if you look at the first the composition of the 28 founding members in total you have organizations that often are in direct competition with one another whether it's Visa and MasterCard or uber and lyft you have companies like Vodafone which of course have great opportunities in terms of mobile payments and penetration and different geographies around the world Medicaid logo in Latin America so you know even at the beginning of this effort which we of course acknowledge with the humility it deserves this is a very very long arc and a long long term project that we're embarking on there's an acknowledgement that it has to drive competition that the technology has to meet the the most scrupulous standards of being an open-source technology and that on top of that there has to be you know competition healthy competition and so if you think about Libra really is aspiring to do and what the Libra blockchain is empowering the world to do it is to do for payments and money transfer what the internet did for communication and information sharing and so you know naturally at the outset pulling on board the opportunities that each of those 28 founding members represent the types of use cases the types of innovations they will see and the on and off ramps into Libra we will move hopefully you know finance and payments into a new terrain without sacrificing the the trust and the type of security you and I take for granite we're going to talk more about what the scale of this project means for users and governments in a moment but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors ready

conversation with Dante Tess part a of Libra the Senate has called a hearing on Libra and the French Finance Minister has said that Libra must not become a sovereign currency how did the Libra Association and Facebook intend to overcome any governmental obstacles like if a government or if governments request changes to the design of the network between now and launch will you accommodate those well what what clearly conversations leading up to the announcements that have dominated the headlines over the last couple of days conversations with regulators and policy makers have been ongoing I note of course you know general positive sentiments if you will from some of the central bankers around the world which have expressed that you know there is a clear utility for this type of solution that it has to be designed with the right sensibilities and with the right reflection of macro prudential standards an area of personal sort of expertise and understanding for me but but let's also push back a little bit on the question of many are going to be asking and many have asked what are the risks if this project succeeds let me explain what are the risks if we fail today finance and our current economy and the way we organize things primarily using analog systems has left 1.7 billion people without access to a bank a rough equal number has are on the margins they're under banked 40% to 50% of the American public can't withstand a $400 financial setback and all of it in no small measure is born out of a system that has to do checks and balances and kyc and anti-money laundering checks in a largely manual self-reporting way and largely in in law in in works in payment networks that aren't interoperable with one another so as a consumer the second you are on the wrong side of the perimeter of your current financial institution you get fees death by a thousand cuts if you will through fees that happens when you travel and you use an outside ATM network it happens when you want to wire money all over the world there's a ten to seven percent fee structure on remittances and so you know at some level you need these uncommon coalition's to form around these enormous social problems and figure out how to redefine what banking means to reach that last mile that's one way I think the planet has a chance to address the root causes of instability and regulators frankly and policymakers all over the world care about economic competitiveness and addressing income inequality here we have an opportunity to do that well so one thing that I was a little bit curious to me so I was noting that the videos and other marketing material make it clear that Facebook really is targeting that developing world and yet here we have India's talking about banning public cryptocurrencies Facebook and whatsapp are banned in China those are probably some of the biggest markets there so how does Facebook plan to get adoption in its target audience so I can't comment directly at all about what Facebook's plans are and but but so so in the Association as well really operates outside of any direct customer interaction partly because this would be governed at the country and jurisdiction level the the aims are to build an infrastructure that serves to empower billions of people financially and pull them into the on-ramps of economic opportunity but that has to be done clearly in very very close consultation with partners and companies and developers and nonprofit organizations and others that would be able to plug in jurisdictionally and nationally to make this a reality you know back to the numbers that I gave you I gave you a moment ago of that 1.7 billion there's roughly a billion people on the planet who have asked to mobile telephony and mobile data which at some level especially when you think about the power of blockchain and sort of these types of opportunities is the Bank of the future it's not a matter of if it's already it's it's a matter of when this this big scale transformation starts to happen and as you pointed out already in China and different countries in Asia and around the world mobile payments and mobile banking is reality so in that sense you know countries like the United States are now being left behind by another divide in terms of Finance and capital this is not just an emerging world opportunity I think there's a lot to be had if this project succeeds in developed countries as well but I wouldn't ask a little bit more about the developing economies because one thought that I had was as I looked at this system I was thinking that the Libre token could be highly disruptive to currencies of developing economies so do you imagine that if Libra succeeds in the way it's been proposed that the citizens of these countries would end up preferring to hold Libra over their national currency and if so what do you think the effect should be on the on those countries currencies that's a really really good question Laura the you know 50 percent of the world's population today are exposed to domestic currency markets and environments where you have anywhere between 10 and upwards in terms of volatility and value swings and you've seen in just a number of recent examples what failed domestic monetary policy looks like with the collapse of Venezuela and you also solve in as well as Hail Mary pass at creating the petrol you know supposedly asset-backed or oil backed stable coin you've also seen this type of hyperinflation sort of take hold in countries like Zimbabwe in different places around the world so you know the real utility of Libre in in at no level is meant to create systemic risk nor disrupt financial order in any economy on the planet part of the reason that's the case is that number one it's not a speculative asset so every instance of Libre being issued based on a supply and demand func not a scarcity function would be backed one-to-one with a reserve of stable assets obviously the composition of that reserve is you know a long way away from fully determined but the goal is to create as close to a digital twin of the type of financial stability central banking independence again that you and I might might take for granted and that looked at through the prism of privilege that you know many of your listeners might understand that reality isn't isn't the case for billions of people around the planet and so a financial instrument that is digitally native that enables that that type of facility and certainty needs to exist if the planet wants to have a global stability and create opportunity for people yeah yeah I definitely think it could be better for the citizens of those countries they just wonder how affect their governments um but I actually want to move on because we have limited time one other thing is that the white paper kind of mentions that this could also form the basis for an identity system would that be tied also to Facebook's Facebook profiles I can't again you know I don't think there is a linkage between payment systems and profiles I think the two things clearly would be firewalled and you know your social media preferences don't constitute I think a sufficient burden of proof to stand to meet identity systems where we think they're great opportunities with Libra and the Libra blockchain on identity which of course is another multi billion person strong opportunity for the world to improve upon is in the type of kyc mechanisms and in the type of financial mechanisms that all of these wallets and all of the ubiquity of Libra being accepted as a payment instrument around the world creates an opportunity to start triangulating by leveraging government-issued identities and you know the types of on-ramps that the financial regulators and systems would like into this into this asset so implied in in in Libra being so broadly utilized at least have has the opportunity to become so broadly utilized you could really start to also chip away at the identity Challenge on the planet which like Financial Inclusion there's a billion or more people who have no nationally issued ID that is an interoperable that has really created a lot of insidious issues where again a network like this and this type of coalition can help address that going back to our conversation about how Libra might find itself in certain sticky situations with governments what would the Libra council do in situations like what we've seen with the US sanctions against Iran where Europe doesn't necessarily support those sanctions and has actually been trying to work around them if US regulators came to the Libra Association wanting the network to enforce sanctions I'm just making up a hypothetical example and European countries didn't what would the Libra Association do that's a good question so clearly you know abiding by prevailing laws number one whether they're affect sanctions the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department or payment sanctions anti-money laundering issues relating to terrorism finance and all the rest a network like this will at all times in my humble opinion outperform a disaggregated completely competitive financial system that rides on analog rails a network like this one will have more to do in advance and compliance standards and advancing sort of the regulatory and risk management standards of modern finance today then the alternative status quo has had a very very long head start and status quo has stopped at one point seven billion people without a bank if trying to resolve for that is wrong not to sound too coy about it I think then you know we have to all look at ourselves in the mirror okay so it sort of seems like you're saying that there might be cases where it would for instance defy the US government wanting no no no not the least and I hope but in the scenario where where there's not kind of like global consensus around the sanctions were some you know where certain countries want them and others don't well so so again the the Association won't with any jurisdiction the Association has three macro level functions governance management is reserve management of an open source technology the companies that offer consumers and citizens and different jurisdictions around the world are the regulated entities that provide an on and off ramp to to Libra the currency clearly as the project advances this really paves the way for the recognition of crypto and digital assets and blockchain projects from a legal and regulatory point of view and that's one of the reasons you need an uncommon coalition like this one to succeed but at no level would we suggest that not abiding by prevailing sanctions regimes and all the risks that would be really the subject of individual wallets and providers in this ecosystem that are all among the most highly regulated entities on the planet I couldn't help but notice that there were no banks among the founding members and honestly when I first was reading about the system I thought oh this could really disrupt the banking system so for the reserve it seems like you actually will need banks and financial institutions to store these reserve assets that back Libra so how do you get them to help out in a system that could eventually disrupt their business or or are there other options for holding the reserve assets yes that's it that's a great question as well the first I would say that you know the 28 initial founding members is just that that the goal is to build up to a list of 100 organizations by the time Libra is minted and issued and so you would expect to see in that group of a hundred and even more over time banking institutions much more opportunities I think for market expansion of tradition thanking which is part of what would motivate some of the companies you've seen and some of the organizations you've seen and that elihss initial list of 28 so I think keep an eye on that space and keep an eye on that list of members and and I am almost certain you'll start to see some household names from banking the goal here is not to disrupt modern finance it's to respect the rules of trade the terms of engagement and to expand the opportunity collectively to to be able to empower billion people so that was one point clearly the reserve function and the treasury management function is a very very substantial part of this that that similarly has to comply with prevailing norms in terms of managing assets and and keeping things in sort of safe hands and the care custody of control of large financial institutions and so there - there will be a very very clear partnership with banks central banks and regulators and and targeted geographies around the world the Association will also be establishing a social impact grant making program what kinds of goals are you trying to achieve with that well that's one of frankly from a personal point of view that that is one of the things I'm most excited about and I think there's a great opportunity there so the social impact grant program again will be established and will be put in motion but the idea there is you could envision for example partnerships with UNHCR on refugees and sort of the types of large-scale displacements of people that have them lose access to their homes loot lose access to normal and when you have the opportunity to start really plugging in the diaspora communities from around the world through remittance corridors as one example if we can give back to the 715 billion dollar global remittance cash flow a couple percentage points in in price reduction and an instantaneous delivery like we enjoy with messaging and and and so on think about the impact from a social point of view so those types of innovations and linkages we think the Association can help catalyze through the social impact grant program among many others and so we're looking forward to opening up that process as as a in addition to continuing to recruit nonprofit organizations and social impact organizations as a part of the founding membership all right well I look forward to seeing how all of stuff plays out from kind of what looks like regulatory headwinds from the outset but then also what our very ambitious and laudable goals so thanks for coming
