I just find it funny that they even thought they could that they were in a position to offer that because that's the US government's decision so that's definitely obvious so just for some background here in case you're not familiar with this because Avi actually he has this like it's I don't want to call Eric I mean it is arrogance but he's got this thing that he genuinely believes that he understands the law he both understands that he's not a lawyer but also has very strong legal opinions and essentially excellent again the only reason why I know this is because I actually witnessed him trying to give a defensive Fortress and some post-fay Rari manipulation stuff that he was involved in and essentially his arguments are essentially always the same hi everyone welcome to Unchained

quick note the day before this podcast was released the cftc charged Avi Eisenberg with violations of the commodity exchange act and manipulation and attempted manipulation of a swap we'll put a link in the show notes to the complaint but I just wanted to explain why we don't mention this news in the show today we're discussing the arrest of mango Market's exploiter Avi Eisenberg and its implications for defy here to discuss are Gabriel Shapiro general counsel at Delphi labs and Collins Belton managing partner at Brookwood PC welcome Gabriel and Collins thanks for having you good to be here just a quick note before we begin everyone my research and prep time for this show was drastically cut short and I have to record this from a slightly different location which also cuts down on the actual time that we have to record so it'll be a shorter than normal schedule and also perhaps a more freestyle form of interviewing that means you'll only be 60 more prepared than 90 percent of interviewers no comment all right so two days after Christmas Avi Eisenberg most famously known as the mango markets exploiter was arrested by the Department of Justice in Puerto Rico for Commodities fraud and commodities manipulation Avi had famously kind of already confessed although I don't think he thought uh what he did was anything wrong and this was in a tweet which most people have heard in which he described the mango markets exploit as a highly profitable trading strategy so for those of you who don't recall the details I'll be took out a large portion on Mango's Perpetual Futures contracts he then inflated the price of the eLiquid mango took or that's what inflated the price of the liquid mango token and then he used that inflated value of his Holdings as collateral to borrow pretty much all the protocols assets and then entering the protocol so uh I was curious uh just you know for your take generally and why don't we start with maybe Gabriel who wrote the Tweet thread that kind of sparked this conversation do you think that what Avi did in this case actually qualifies as Commodities fraud and commodities manipulation as he was charged with well yeah I would say that overall what he did I would consider within the ethical Norms of the D5 space But nevertheless most likely illegal or at least there's a strong argument that it's illegal uh which makes it kind of interesting right we have you know things that are like ethical but illegal and also things that are legal but unethical and then you know sometimes they're both illegal and unethical I think this was one thing where ethically within the Norms of defy in my opinion is fine but it is illegal whether it constitutes fraud is a very interesting question I do believe it like constitutes some form of manipulation some form of cornering but who exactly the defrauded party is right because a smart contract isn't a person and it kind of was the smart contract that was deceived or arguably it was the risk engine for the smart contract that was deceived is uh you know it creates some interesting issues that I guess we'll talk further about but yeah I do think that there's a strong claim here that he did something illegal and Collins what about you yeah you know I think I'd largely agree especially on the distinction between his manipulation and arguably fraud Target is I think you know to the extent that there is something that's likely to hold I would I would imagine the manipulation charges are a bit easier here just under the black letter law since there's a little bit less of this uh intentional question I think especially again what you've said you know he explicitly kind of did note on online that he manipulated the market in order to achieve this like Gabe said though you know when you look at kind of our defy Norms there's a question as to you know whether people should have expected something like this when you did operate within the parameters of the system so I think you know we'll talk a little bit about that one other thing that Gabe just alluded to that I find kind of interesting is that you know when you look at the fraud question I think a lot of the people especially in the mango Community want to take the position that you essentially defrauded the Dow or the members but this kind of leads to a weird Catch-22 and you know it's kind of funny because the complaint actually takes this position at least from my perspective where the Dow essentially is to say hey we run this thing and you took our assets which then puts them in the uncomfortable position of having to argue potentially in another context as to whether they should be the ones seen as running an exchange so there's a weird tension here and hopefully we can talk a little bit about that I think that was part of you know at the heart of Gabe's threat there as to how this may impact D5 depending on how people want to interpret this so both things that you guys said were so interesting we'll we'll talk about Gabe's first I mean the notion that what he did was both illegal but also within the Norms of defy like can you talk a little bit about that like why is it that things that people would traditionally consider illegal are things that's at least some segments of the crypto community may not consider out of bounds sure I mean I think it raises very interesting questions and it just always comes back to this code is law thing right if what we have is an under if if the social norms of using a crypto system are that it's supposed to do a certain thing and everyone's understanding is that and if the code does something different from what it's supposed to do then we have an issue if that's the social framework then we have major major issues across the entire crypto system ecology right because why do we have immutable State then right if we have a notion of what's supposed to happen and it doesn't happen and the wrong thing gets recorded we should be able to mutate that state um if someone if our if our notion of ownership is the same as in the real world that is you own your coins well you know if I get locked out of my car and I have some valuables in there um you know like I have legal methods to break back into the car or even someone else's car and get those things out right whereas on the blockchain there there's no remedy for that right I don't get new keys I've just lost it forever if I've lost my keys um and so on so we have this universe of pure bear assets where basically what you can do with them uh determines what you ought to be able to do with that them that's the norm with which people operate in space not your keys not your coins right and the same thing with the smart contracts right you know in my opinion unless you want to just re-centralize everything and be able to reverse transactions and all these things you really kind of have to be able to say that when someone is using one of these systems they are opting into a situation where they want code to be law for them obviously it doesn't necessarily mean it's law for external parties who haven't opted into that right but we need it to be that when you opt in you're able to give up the you're able to consent to those risks you're able to take on to those risks that whatever the code does is the results are going to accept and the notion of Prosecuting someone for using the code in a smarter way that other people didn't predict is is anathema to that right because that really means you know if he was able to do that and if that's somehow wrong right it's something that the code could do is the wrong result that ultimately means that it's not the crypto system that governs things it's our understandings and expectations and if it's our understandings and expectations well then it's exactly like a normal contract and it ought to be illegal or frowned upon to set things up in a way where you can't fully perform that contract because of immutability and these other things so it's a real tension and that's why I say you know really we need to kind of find a way to make it acceptable for people to opt in this set of risks and understand what risks they're opting into also of course these hacks happen all the time but it's not even really a hack that these attacks these exploits happen all the time and the vast majority of people get away with it and most people aren't even that mad about it in crypto uh like they're not nearly as mad about the typical D5 exploit as they are are about FTX for example because you know it's just kind of considered the name of the game Sizer risk appropriately don't put all of your eggs into one protocol certainly don't put it into it if it's open source if it's sorry if it's not open source uh or if it's brand new it's insufficiently tested it's not audited we just have this whole other set of standards for when we're dealing with code that dramatically differ from you know when you're trading stocks on NASDAQ or something and so it's almost like you're saying that in the defy space they would consider that in this particular situation the developers of the smart contracts are almost more at fault or something like that is that yeah I don't know if it's the it wasn't a smart contract code problem as such it was really and we should talk more about how the attack went down but at the end of the day it was a governance problem I would say as to the fact that this particular collateral the mango token itself uh the token the government's token for the protocol it was too much was allowed to be borrowed against it within the protocol yeah it's like literally the same thing as FTX and ftt too much was allowed to exactly too much was allowed to be borrowed against it relative to its liquidity and the rest of its risk profile and what else was going on in the profile so it's it's not so much I don't know that it was a developer problem it's more of a governance risk management problem in terms of the assets that are whitelisted in the protocol and the the collateral ratios that they have within the program but I think you know it's kind of interesting you say that because in some ways I do see it as I don't know if I'd say it's a developer problem but is this a system design issue but it's compounded by the fact that you do have you know in essence this governance ability in and of itself you know the ability for people to make those decisions to be modern to to be modifying them is is kind of what introduced that risk now obviously you know they could have made this immutable at the same risk by just setting the parameters in stone but I think that also you know speaks to a little bit of detention you alluded to and then also some of the things that we were talking about before where you've got people that kind of want to have their cake and eat it too to use the cliche phrase where hey you know we want to be able to essentially say this is immutable and we're going to depend on code AS law but then when somebody like Gabe said you know figures out you know a clever if not and I don't like using the word ethical because it's ethical in one sense I think in a pure like philosophical sense but ethical in the sense of like yeah he knew that they were innocent and quote unquote innocent people or users that would be deprived of their value so I don't know if it's ethical from the colloquial sense is the best word let's just keep using it they weren't ultimately deprived of their value though were they yeah and that's that's actually what I wanted to talk about actually so the private Contracting element is kind of something that I think Gabe was alluding to it and part of that other point I just kind of hopped to that which is you know you've got this weird idea that blockchains in some way might be seen as like allowing extreme versions of private Contracting um but in this case you know it also runs head long and this is another attention I think we wanted to talk about with the actual you know Regulatory and kind of legal framework that exists in reality if you start looking at the intentions and and things outside of let's say the four corners of your blockchain contract and so we see that actually you know with mango the the Dow tried to negotiate a settlement with him where it included releasing criminal claims against him now obviously you know the US government is like why what are you talking about none of this is something that we're going to respect but it actually does highlight again an issue here which is if you aren't going to essentially adhere to those Norms of everything that's codified is exactly how we will essentially accept these results and instead go to all right we're going to add a meta layer of additional governance whether that's to be a tokens whether that's outside you know negotiation then you do start to introduce the exact tension that Gabe is talking about where the regulator is going to say okay well why wouldn't we also step in why wouldn't the other Frameworks also apply here and so I think this is what I think you know when we were talking about the motivation for the episode the interesting thing is all right well there's you you have to almost take a position here either you want this you know code slot and by the way I don't think either of us you know let me know if I'm speaking wrong for you but I don't think either of us are saying code is law is exactly of the land now but we're saying if this is the norm that people are going to adhere to and they're going to espouse then they can't in those other times start saying hey you violated some you know either before unspoken Norm that we just made up on the spot because we're pissed off about losing money and so I think this is and this is honestly a challenge I have with government systems and crypto generally um I think you either have on governed systems I think there's some World we'll probably figure out a governance system that will you know avoid some of these flaws but right now most of the governance systems introduce these exact tensions by you know by virtue of just being a governance system that introduce outside decision making yeah and I think uh Collins just raised a really I agree with all that and college just read it's a very interesting point legal point but he didn't state it completely explicitly so I just want to make sure the listeners are clear right there are two potential things that are implicated in electronic attacks right one is sort of Computer Fraud abuse anti-hacking type of laws right and that that is not those are not the charges that have been brought against Avi whether they could bring such charges would be an interesting question but those are generally speaking specific computer statutes that say that for example prohibit unauthorized access of data unauthorized use of access credentials such as passwords uh and things of this nature and they're phrased generally in those terms although they often also have catch-alls that can be vager uh and and that was not what is here right because he didn't really use a he didn't steal someone's password or generate someone's password word uh you know by my repeated guesses right brute forcing instead what he did is a is manipulating the price of an asset in a way that when combined with the functioning of a certain set of code enabled him to get a good result right and it wasn't that there was any flaw in the code there was no flaw in the code there are also a lot of people describe this as an oracle manipulation attack but it wasn't actually an exploit of the Oracle the Oracle function completely correctly it accurately reported the prices he went to the markets that the oracles pull price data from and he did transactions that basically made the the accurate true price of that asset on that platform to be artificially high right and that's why they're bringing this as a manipulation claim rather than some sort of computer hacking claim Etc but both set of laws in terms of the broader discussion about consent and private contract acting could be relevant and in terms of the computer hacking laws you can actually cure that issue right you could that's why we there are pen testing programs that's why they're a bug Bounty programs because the specific relevant parties it's a little harder in crypto for various reasons but you can at least try to get everyone relevant to say yes we consent to certain people or anyone under certain circumstances attacking this and trying to do it harm if they follow this certain protocol you cannot do that with Market manipulation and I think the reason why you can't do that with Market manipulation is because the implicit theory of who is being defrauded with these price manipulations is the market itself it's it's everyone in the market it's not only the mango users who are the ones who had the most potential risk in terms of direct economic harm but it's everyone and so even if every single mango user literally signed a contract giving them a release which of course is not what happened even then they still would the government would still be able to bring this action so that's why it raises very interesting issues around consent private Contracting Etc also one other thing which we won't go deep on this episode on but I'll I'll give Gabe the dunk on me on this is you know for a while there's some people debating on you know is it better for something to be you know regulated from the Securities angle of the Commodities angle I think this definitely shows in conjunction with some other stuff like ukidao that you know stepping into the Commodities Road doesn't absolve all of these issues and I still am of the belief that a lot of times the cftc is probably the more appropriate regulator and I should also note you know this is the doj bring this although I would you know be very shocked if we do not see cftc follow up on this but I think it you know highlights that you know the fact that the CFT or the FBI agent in this case one you know highlighted that he thought some of the assets were Commodities but that actually LED them to the belief that these things were slops that he was actually trading perpetuals or swaps there's actually a statement I actually copied it after the episode here where um you know the FBI even just explicitly says he starts a symptom saying perpetuals are slots under the CDA it's not like a it's not a question in his mind it's not a theory that's actually very problematic for you know a lot of D5 protocols if they want to be serving U.S participants and they're going to have let's say a dow running the exchange and it's not fully immutable so you know this type of thing is a good example of how even though I might still believe the cftc is more appropriate it's good that we get you know leaked something like the dccpa and people don't understand it like the cftc doesn't mean oh suddenly you're cool like hey they regulate gold and oil and they don't really care about those stock markets because it's very clear they say here you know the FBI agent is looking at this thing hey you manipulated the spot price in order to leverage swaps on a decentralized exchange so that he could achieve this result and that's what led to the manipulation charges that's what led to the fraud charges and again you know I'd note that while this isn't a cftc complaint the FBI agent and I have this excerpt here we explicitly notes that you know the the mango decentralized exchanges is run by the mango Dao that I think is going to be interesting to track that's the statement that I think will probably show back up in in the near future but we'll see yeah one thing that I wanted to comment on was earlier when Gabriel was describing avi's actions he said he like I said I don't remember um how you started but you you know kept kind of trying to explain what he did with the prices and then finally you settled on that he artificially inflated the price well what was interesting is when he came on my show right after he had done the hack I similarly I sort of remember what question it was that I asked or what phrasing I used but he corrected me by saying oh well no that was actually the real price at that moment like just because it's not what anyone wants does it mean that it wasn't the correct price it's the correction it's it's the correct price but the price is incorrect to the value right and this can happen right I mean we do have different Notions of pricing versus value people can overpay for something yes that is the price they paid and it is accurate price they actually paid that but they were you know deceived or about the the value and so they were paying sort of like the wrong price or too high of a price and yeah there is that that disconnect is possible yeah yeah I mean for sure this this case brings up so many fascinating angles so why don't we do this we are going to unpack how different elements of the case could affect defy as a whole but first

we kind of started touching on you know different aspects of this even before went to the ad break but let's maybe start with Gabriel's Twitter thread because Gabriel you know as much as I think a lot of people believe that kind of Avi what Avi did was wrong in some sense your conclusion in the Twitter thread was that this isn't necessarily good for defy that he got arrested so what do you what do you fear are some of the um indirect consequences for the D5 space that could result from this the whole point of these systems is that they be secure on an autonomous decentralized basis which means that you can't rely for safety on extrinsic deterrence such as fear of punishment or extrinsic actors who may be able to reverse transactions adjudicate which transactions were correct or incorrect the idea is that it be secure robust consistent on its own that it'd be so well designed that it can it can do that right to do that it's really and you know just look at the history of smart contract security dating all the way back to the Dow hack or you can even look at l1s in terms of consensus attacks value or tax minor attacks when the the developers try to develop these systems as to be as secure as they can right things happen and we learn lessons it's an iterative process right so because of the Dow hack re-entry attacks are very very a rare flaw in smart contracts I would say if one happens now it's just due to negligence at this point almost always right you didn't get an audit you didn't know what you were doing whatever right but that's because that that happened and had really bad consequences and made everyone alert to that and then they developed you know systems for automatically scanning code for that vulnerability and you know improving design patterns and all these things right so we actually need these attacks in order for the ecosystem to grow and to ultimately become the best it could be right and the same is true even is recognized even with centralized systems because they have bug Bounty programs and all these things the difference is that as I mentioned earlier for something like Twitter right if Twitter wants its its web app to be secure they can have a bug Bounty program and really the only thing that those that any sort of bugs or potential exploits can come from is most likely going to be some type of code vulnerability one of these types of vulnerabilities that is covered by the anti-hacking statutes and so they can consent to it being attacked and the the hacker will be the white hat will be okay I'm wearing a black hat but the white hat will be okay if they follow those rules and they will be able to prove their system iteratively with these economic attacks it's just not possible to to give that consent but nevertheless we do want these systems to be secure against all types of attacks including ones that you can't fully consent to right and so so this is the issue we don't want to start relying on the legal system to make these uh systems secure we want them to be intrinsically secure that means people have to attack them now do they have to attack them the exact way Avi did no because you know he could have their some someone leaked Discord messages that are alleged to be from him or someone contemplating a similar attack in the weeks ahead of time where he was saying hey you know I found this vulnerability but you know it looks like there's not much in the treasury so I think the white hat Bounty would be small so it was better for him to attack the whole thing and decide his own way down white hat Bounty right but so but we could as an industry and I think there are people working on this uh for sure jump published a thing and I know kind of a coalition edition of VCS and white hats are working on something where you would you would set out clear parameters for attacks you would uh potentially even have like pool more pooled money by a coalition of protocols to reward people so the reward you know could be sufficiently large and all these things we need to keep doing this we can't be scared to do this uh because of for certain attacks because those can attacks can't be fully mitigated with consents and waivers but that when we do go and talk to Big law firms about setting up some type of white hat Safe Harbor that is what they say they say well you can only reward the code exploits that violate the Computer Fraud statutes because these other ones are manipulating the entire market and you're not the entire market so guess what you can't consent to that but we can't let that stop Innovation because otherwise these protocols will never be secure on autonomous and decentralized terms because they won't get attacked enough hmm yeah yeah it's kind of funny because I think like a year or two ago we were talking about you know the idea of Indemnity funds and insurance funds but those Indemnity funds where at the time focused on some of the operators of things like Dows and participants that might be at risk but I think you know since then it's probably expanded to be a more you know necessary conversation on a broad basis um I would say you know Gabe focused a lot on the lack of vulnerability testing that we you know may suffer from in the absence or you know in the presence of the regime that applies like this I actually think one of the more straightforward things is that there are a number of different D5 models that are currently employed by different you know almost core infrastructure pieces at this point that you know arguably are going to come under scrutiny as acceptable if something especially like the manipulation or front-running claims get treated as something actionable by the government moving forward and what I mean by that is you know we can take you know two let's say two or three of the you know more common or probably most popular let's say kind of infrastructure plays right now with Mev Mev you know and some characterization might be seeing we're not not in some characterization it does you know essentially take the concept of front running operationalize it and then democratizes it amongst the entire spectrum of users such that you know it makes it more fair but there is an argument and this isn't my position necessarily but I think you know if I'm steel Manning this from the cftc or the doj's perspective and I want to apply something similar to Avi my argument is essentially going to be well look it looks like you guys are just saying you've operationalized and democratized front running for everybody willing to participate in your playground it's not that you've got rid of it or something like that it's that instead you're protecting this network by essentially enabling everybody to do so and in doing so cutting down the risk of one or two particular actors being able to manipulate that but here's the thing there's there's no like Safe Harbor or exemption in the cea if you're like oh the manipulation is like for everybody so it's cool so like this is the type of characterization that I think people have to think a little bit about you also have dexes and some of the Dex types of plays that rely on Mev like please that are going to be doing things you know and I won't you know name I think everyone knows particulars at this point or there's you know essentially an L2 version of this for every you know major aggregator where they're doing something like they're ordering transactions on an L2 Network or on an off-chain basis and then submitting them in ways that provide front running protection so again these are all things that I think are positive for this system these are things that one again as Gabe has highlighted in the absence of traditional legal systems we're gonna need you know systems you know algorithms structures that essentially enable us to either mitigate or control for or protect against certain risks that the legal system typically does and in order to do that we do kind of need some of that experimentation I do tend to grid I don't think obvious approach was greatest but by the way just as we go through this I realize we're happy with this episode I want to note I can't speak for a game on this I maybe I can but like I don't think this episode should be looked at as like a defense of AVI or like you know prosecutors are looking at this God forbid he gets off on like some weird quote from this episode I I actually you know witnessed some of his takes like he was also involved in the space Rory collapse and he actually was also involved in his own projects uh collapse where he also used the system as intended with Fortress Dao in order to have people vote for a project that he was affiliated with did not fully disclose things there and then essentially you know made the same legal arguments as he's done here which is to say hey I've used the system as intended I submitted this all through governance you all essentially consented to this and so yes I should be able to walk away with these treasury assets interestingly you know I'm surprised that this has not yet come up and perhaps you know the likely discover this because I think it's the same bucket of things but I just want to add that last part before we get back into how this impacts Deep by uh this is not supposed to be like a yeah if you did it if you saved us all or something like that although I am wearing my black hat so but yeah I know my my interest in this was just because of how um like sticky and nuanced the whole situation is you know like I said I think most people in crypto view what Avi did is like wrong in some respect but then I found it fascinating that Gabriel was saying that this could set up kind of bad precedent for defy and so I wanted to explore that but Collins you keep on um mentioning kind of the role of the Dao and how that could um also kind of I think or how this case could present conundrums for Dows in general like you've raised the issue about whether dolls want to be seen as running exchanges um I feel like there was another Point can you talk a little bit about how this case could affect Dows that run protocols like these yeah and I think you know to talk about that we could take a quick step back to ukidao that happened a few months ago and for those that aren't aware there was essentially an exploit that happened in another protocol there were some allegations that essentially the the assets that were traded there are involved there were regulated commodity assets but but in relevant part for this discussion there is a dow involved in that in the operation of that protocol and in that case the cftc and the doj's position is that the Dow is essentially running that that protocol which allows for derivative types of transactions the issue is that you know prior to going after the Dow they looked at the founders and said hey you know we think you're you're liable for some of these things the founders settled and now you have this question of okay well who at the Dow could one respond to this receive Service uh you know who should be liable can they abortion the debt in this way this has been a question that people have been talking about but I think it's I think it's a little less controversial in that case than if the same type of thing was alleged here um and the reason why I say that is because in this mango situation they're explicitly just saying hey you guys are operating an exchange that allows for the swap of regulated Commodities exchanges now the issue is if that is the position that's accepted let's say at a court level and something like that they're essentially saying hey this Dao is an organization whether you want to call it an incorporated Association whether you want to call it a uh you know an Inc whatever it is this this organization is running this thing you would normally need some type of licensure to do so and the absence of that you guys are all liable for not having this license in addition just like we've seen in UK in other situations typically when you have something that's a licensed entity like a DCM or some type of Futures exchange you also have the same type of money laundering and sanctions obligations that we've seen everybody you know freaking out rightfully so over the past year and a half those things like not only do you have to conduct AML and kyc but you're blocking and geofencing off Iran and North Korea and all of these places now obviously you know the Dow is one not equipped to do that right now they don't do that and I think their position would be hey we manage some treasury we don't really operate this exchange but but that was already an issue that was you know pronounced in ukidao and I think he or he should have come out it would really explode and ripple across the rest of the space because Uki there is an argument at least that the way in which the keys were transferred from the original Founders to the Dao may have left the Dao with some operational control that might be untenable I actually don't think it's a great argument but I could at least again if I'm trying to steal man the cftc position I could at least see that as far as I'm aware in the mango holder situation they don't maintain keys that could change significant parameters I'm going to assume that's the case um and even if they did I think there isn't no evidence or at least nothing as alleged in the complaint that they were actually doing so in connection with this attack or even prior it's just that hey they had some governance control perhaps they can change some parameters but none of that was at issue here it was just hey the guy just ran this exchange but they're saying hey this Exchange in and of itself is an exchange that would normally have to be registered in order to run these things so I think the the implication for a lot of Dallas set up this way is is hey either we you know we take this position that yet she defrauded the Dow the Dow is owed something but then you're in the uncomfortable position of saying okay well if they defrauded us as The Operators of this do we have responsibility for it and then I think it goes back to the art instead should we be looking at system designs again going back to our defying Norms where that isn't even that's not even a possible question or solution I don't think people should be in the position of saying hey we operate this protocol but unfortunately as I think some people in our community have rightfully pointed out it's it's arguably irresponsible to launch something like a mango or something like that you know from from day one totally immutable totally unable to change anything totally unable to rectify mistakes because I mean again I mean think about this wasn't even a hack this is just a system design issue but we've seen countless hacks where you know arguably let's assume it wasn't an Insider attack arguably it probably would have been better for somebody to have like an emergency key to stop something um when they couldn't or perhaps it was a multi-stick and they couldn't get consensus fast enough to stop an attack so you know while I obviously think that on a long term basis having these like very very kind of immutable designs as almost a rigid standard are ideal there's a there's a harsh reality that I think all of us that are like decentralization Maxis after except which is unless you have very simple and narrow you know systems there's some intern period where unfortunately it's probably better for folks to maintain some control in order to avoid these risks but then you have this tension that gets introduced here you know I think it's been a little bit too much of a convex thing where it's either immutable or you just have complete arbitrary powers of some multisate to do absolutely anything and there is a lot of in between there and I think there's like not only in between in terms of different things that protocols have done but I think there's a very unexplored design space like for example curve has an emergency multi-segrate which I'm actually a member of and I don't have any indemnities or anything from them but I'm pretty comfortable with it because its powers are extremely limited right all it can do is like freeze uh like a pool and switch it into withdrawal only mode right or like stop the curve rewards to a pool and then it's like over rollable by this by the fold down right and so you can you could also like imagine like a multi-sig that has a power to just do one thing which is put a particular proposal on a much short to the Dow on a much shorter voting schedule there are a lot of there are a lot of different mechanisms you could play with and again the a key takeaway right is that there are two sources of liability one is was there some negligent design or something like that that enabled this particular exploit to happen and the other is well just the whole thing in general did it require some type of license or is it required to be operated in some other way you know and is there alive ability for that both are bad problems and both are sadly probably relevant here although I think on the design aspect like I I could make a straight face defense that that no one in mango did anything wrong but there was no governance problem no design problem nothing like yes obviously in retrospect he could borrow too much from mango token but like is it to the point where it's like Reckless like grossly negligent or whatever that they said it that way you could probably argue either way right so yeah these are two different issues yeah well so Collins is that one of your concerns about the Dow that like if it were determined that not only did Avi manipulate it but that the kind of you know the exchange owners or operators in this case the Dow messed up by allowing um that kind of collateral to be used and that way or without stricter limits or something like that like do you feel that that could be an implication here well not only could be an implications but I think it highlights the the kind of issue here right like one you know most of the down members unless you're going to carve out the original developers who probably told some tokens or something Have No impact on the overall design of the system like there are governance Powers even to the extent let's assume in this case that they did have some ability to let's say change some of the parameters typically your governance control and I know for this is something I do know for sure mango they don't have the ability to refactor the entire code base all of a sudden overnight so it's limited to a certain set of inputs or parameters that they can tweet and so it highlights kind of the issue and and your citizen with ukida where you're trying to establish some type of liability regime if you're the government you're saying okay well do we go after the original devs one you know you can imagine a situation where let's say manga wasn't originally allowed as collateral and the devs and this actually you know does happen in D5 protocols where they do things like they may not allow their token to be traded originally for other regulatory concerns and then like governance holders voted in there would be a real question here right in the hypothetical you just gave me are the developers who originally developed this thing but maybe it didn't have the quote unquote system design flaw because they didn't enable the collateral suddenly liable or should suddenly the community of token holders who voted for this be liable for introducing that design flaw and if so is the subset of people who voted for it so that you can apportion liability to them like their individual Partners who made that decision or should it be the aggregate Dao and then are they liable to the entire Market or just to the other partners who lost value all of those things kind of highlight the issue when you start thinking through this and you say okay well hold on none of that really is the right outcome here one because even to the extent you felt bad for some of the let's say minority Partners in the Dow they kind of signed up for this their option is to either leave the Dow partnership or to go along with the vote that they all aged to when they kind of signed I would say informal Constitution where you said hey I'm going to agree that the majority decision governs the parameter switches here I'm going to agree that if something gets introduced by collateral that I may not agree with my only option is to either Exit or to accept the decisions here but once you start introducing these types of questions and potential legal liability regimes you can start to see Gabe's former point which is suddenly it up ends and kind of undermines the entire notion of these systems and it starts to do so not just when there's a conflict or an issue arises but it actually does so even prior to the fact because these types of decisions are going to be made you know a priori to some type of you know exploit they're going to people that hold the tokens are going to be making these same types of decisions if this type of liability regime applies because they're going to know hey hold on maybe we should or should not allow something like this to occur if the government is going to be to show up in two years and say Hey you know 63 percent of you who voted for this are liable for the other 37 so the entire dynamics of how Dallas will work I think are upended by this and yeah it's a good example of of an implication that you know might seem very limited like hey maybe just these dial members are going to be liable for something but it won't be just like you know people are already starting to change and Order their behavior in response to the ukidao complaint despite there not even being a resolution yet the same thing would start to occur here if it really was the case that these dials were not just operators but suddenly individual members or collectives could be liable for these things the entire the entire system would be upended and I think you'd see a lot more Anonymous participation you see a lot more student Anonymous participation offshore participation and I think you know like you know Gary or CFC is listening to this and they're like yeah that's what we want I think they should really consider if that's what they actually want because one you know we've already seen what's happened in FTX when all of these things go offshore we've already seen where individuals can organize outside of our parameters but still introduce risks to our system so I think you know some Regulators I I suspect that that's you know somewhat their goal here is to make it so unattractive to participate in these systems or groups that they become untenable but I think the end result won't be that they become totally untenable it's that they become pushed to certain areas that aren't just tiny you know yeah we can call them Niche markets but a niche market that gets you know three let's say seven percent of the world's population or interest over the next 10 years is a lot of people and that's a lot of people that can impact our markets as well so I think that's something that they also need to take into consideration when they're trying to make this type of participation so unattractive or so confusing that it essentially gets pushed to the Shadows or maybe they're confident that they can crush it up and you know Gary is powerful so we'll see one other question that I wanted to ask was about how mango markets negotiated with the Avi when he returned like 47 million of the tokens or whatever and then they said we won't pursue in any kind of legal action against you or I'd remember the phrasing but I just find it funny that they even thought they could that they were in a position to offer that because that's the US government's decision so that's definitely obvious so just for some background here in case you're not familiar with this because Avi actually he has this like but he's got this thing that he genuinely believe that he understands the law he both understands that he's not a lawyer but also has very strong legal opinions and essentially excellent and again the only reason why I know this is because I actually witnessed him trying to give a defensive Fortress and some post-fay Rari manipulation stuff that he was involved in and essentially his arguments are essentially always the same and so I would be Thunderstruck if the mango people offered this it's really obvious if you look at not just his original post they kind of did right because they posted something in the governance Forum that said basically here's the deal we're making with Avi right and they did have a line in that that said by voting for this proposal it was their proposal it was a mango team proposal I guess by voting for this proposal mango holders agreed to pay off the bad debt with the treasury and waive any possible claims against bad debt holders which was of course was Avi so now I'm sure he required them to put that language in there and he probably thought that by doing that he was getting himself some protection but this is not going to be an enforceable agreement right oh no I agree I'm just saying I think Avi was the one who suggested that I don't think the Dow is like hey let's release him it's Avi who thinks he's like the legal suits genius it's like nah you've got to release me right just to answer your question Laura it doesn't they didn't need to think the mango team or Community or whatever they didn't need to think that they were in a position to waive those claims they just needed to think that there was a guy who if they said these magic words would give them the money back and in fact they made my suspicion you know partly because I I know I know a lawyer involved in the project is that you know they were uh uh they were thinking the exact opposite that this is and it's unenforceable so let's just say it get the money back and they're still getting he's still gonna have criminal lives so yeah so it's more that Avi was so gullible to think that actually protected him in some way yes what will be interesting though is what impact that does have again on this fraud allegation I think on the manipulation claim it's probably useless but again and the reason why we keep raising this just in case it's not clear is that fraud fraud cleans generally have essentially like a heightened feeding standard uh whether it's the government whether it's individuals you essentially have to prove that like somebody had a very specific intent when you're dealing with fraud claims um and again it's also the case with most other criminal claims I'm not a criminal or so I'm not going to go farther than my limited knowledge but suffice to say fraud claims require a very specific level of intent and despite the fact that I think all of us you know think that obvious bsing online and is kind of crazy and gullible he has been radically consistent that he genuinely believed that he did not do anything illegal now that does not mean you're not a fraudster maybe you've omitted something but I think you know something like this you know let's argue good faith negotiation and even his claim of saying hey I think something like this white hack bounty is not enough and then going and negotiating a higher one may give them at least some challenge in saying hey this guy intends to take all these people's money I mean the guy showed up he said it was him negotiated with the community and signed us a release now I don't think it's going to absolve him of all of his criminal liability but I do think you know if I'm him I'm at least telling my lawyer hey you got to make some arguments about how it's very clear I was working in good faith to get this money back and in fact I did get all the money back all of the retail users ended up completely whole and I ended up with my bug Bounty now again I think ultimately from the manipulation angle completely useless argument like hey you did go out and manipulate this but from the hey you intended to defraud these people when you've got a pretty long history of saying hey I'm gonna do this thing collect a bug Bounty then did it and just negotiated a higher one again it's not bulletproof but I am interested to see if that ends up becoming part of his argument of saying yeah I posted all of this publicly because I genuinely thought what I was doing was not fraud so maybe he's got something manipulation issues that can get rid of the fraud issue which you know it ain't nothing the fraud issues you know often the ones that you're looking at you know more serious criminal liability and more serious issues so I'm interested to see if that helps yeah and I actually want to give the audience like a little bit of perspective on what you're talking about in terms of his mindset because he wrote a blog post about different strategies that he and his team had been using kind of especially during I think that's yeah he posted this in early 2022 so it must have been kind of in 2021 so he talked about how they did nft sniping where the team made these Bots that could just mint a ton of the hot nfts right when the project launched and I do something with the gas price um to like save themselves money because I think the way a lot of other people were doing it was trying to participate in the mints by just spamming with really high gas fees and so because they were able to generate a ton of these mints then you know the floor prices you know uh like higher right after the men and and so it was just like easy money and to my mind it's like very similar to what like ticket scalpers do and he said that just three weeks of that netted them two million dollars in profit eventually like other Bots took over and he wasn't able they weren't able to do the same thing as effectively but another thing they were doing was they were borrowing ample on Ave had an interest rate of two percent and because of the rebase and ample whenever that rebase was more than the two percent then they were just profiting from that as well and he said that they garnered one million dollars in profits on five million dollars of capital deployed so those are kind of like I would say just more like smart trading or whatever in in this vanity or I don't know what you think of the nft thing maybe that's like in a gray area but all I'm trying to say is like those to me don't seem so obviously illegal and so then and then it gets to the Fortress Dow thing which Collins you alluded to a little bit but basically he created this project and I may not have all the details right but but the way the project worked was that it would sunset at a certain point if the value of the FUSD reached one dollar and then he kind of like mucked up the project in some way where that was just going to be the inevitable outcome and he would walk away with like seven million dollars from that and um like all the people that had participated in that Dow didn't couldn't really do anything because that it that is what how it was designed to work so it was kind of like a rug pull where you know he like did the minimum amount of effort and and then at a certain point went kind of slack and just like let it die and then you know profited so you can sort of see how over time like it gets more and more up to the line and potentially over it again when you're in that kind of mindset of that type of person like that's your I think you're right that in his mind he's justifying the mango markets thing the same way it's just like a bit further even from kind of his original exploits so I don't know if you have any comment on that no no I mean I I completely agreed I think that's it's kind of funny because I you're describing it I'm like yeah you know we did kind of witness in real time the evolution of somebody this is kind of like seeing SBF but publicly because we saw him start with something that's like oh that's pretty scummy but I guess you can do it and then all of a sudden it's like well if I own half of the Bahamas and goodbye um so yeah yeah I mean I I definitely think you're right there um just uh it's kind of sad because he's he's actually a smart guy like I don't like him but it is kind of funny to see him kind of like Wax poetic in the random discords where you know he's one I shouldn't say it's funny but it's kind of bizarre like when he's talking to some victim and he's like no you just don't understand the system is working let me just explain to you why I have your money instead of you but at the same time you can see you know he had a failed curve attack after this mango thing where you know again he described it publicly people said oh that's stupid you couldn't do that and then he proceeded to try it and it almost worked and I think there were enough other interested parties that essentially just pvp'd him on an open market that's a good example of how again you know he publicly described that nice um you know he publicly described that proceeded to do it and I think the only reason why we're not also talking about that right now is primarily just because other whales were interested enough to essentially fight back and take the other side so again it's hard although actually I'll just say about the Ave thing that so he again was going to do the same kind of price manipulation in order to you know to take out more money than people think he would have thought he should have but what I read was that on the same day Ave released at stable coin white paper and so the token price pumped and he had a massive short on Avi so he lost all this money and so in the in at least what I read they were saying that it wasn't necessarily people like hunting his position so much it's just that the like in a totally unrelated although although the timing of releasing that white paper could also be another form of hunting his position The Way It Was Written it made it seem like that wasn't uh the purpose it was just the day it happened to come out but anyway you guys this has been so fascinating I don't know if you if we missed anything if there's any like single last statement you want to give yeah I mean I would just say a few things I mean at the end of the day I think credit Protocols are cool I think they're socially positive I still think that there's a huge design space for making secure ones and there's you know mango is kind of still like a maybe like a Gen 2 credit protocol or something like that but um you know there are all kinds of things like Dynamic interest rates you know summer governance maximize summer governments minimize but different mechanisms in fact SBF had you know had a long post before he went to jail about the mango protocol exploited and talked about you know how different types of risk engine designs that perhaps respond a bit less immediately to price changes on centralized exchanges for illiquid assets you know can mitigate this type of attack so yeah I mean I hope that we can just continue to let people experiment and kind of maybe create some parameters around what's a socially acceptable type of attack and then I hope prosecutors will like use their discretion not to throw everyone in jail uh so that we can keep building cool things and ultimately make them very secure okay and Collins last few words I think that just protocol designers and users should just take the bear Market to potentially step back be a little more rigorous in establishing early parameters to be safe things like thresholds for deposits things like time locking some things for a bit it's not like you're going to get two billion dollars of TBL anyway take the opportunity now if you're going to launch something to actually do so in a fairly reasonable Manner and then scale up we used to do that in 2017 or 18. it's crazy that we're looking at the Ico era for lessons but you know consider it other than that you know thanks again Laura hopefully uh your building is safe and not on fire right now thank you all right well it's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained people can find you in the links in the show notes I'll put links to your social media but yeah thanks again great thank you have a good rest of the day thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Gabriel Collins and obvious arrest check out the show notes for this
