if relevant and asking your question email it to hello at Unchained podcast calm with the subject line video question again that's Hello at unchain podcast calm with a subject line video question I look forward to seeing you there within months cryptocurrency anti money laundering regulations go global are you ready avoid stiff penalties are blacklisting by deploying effective anti money laundering tools for exchanges and crypto business the same tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy my guest today is Mona Elysa co-founder and CEO of melon port welcome Mona thank you tell us your background and the problem you're trying to solve with melon port so my background is in traditional finance I started off my career as a trader market maker and prop trader at Goldman Sachs back in 2003 after eight years I then moved to the buy-side and worked in a hedge fund as a portfolio manager for four years and following that I tried to launch my own hedge fund long/short equity hedge fund out of Zurich Switzerland and that was a complete disaster so that experience started with one investor offering me a 20 million dollar seed investment I managed to raise another ten million dollars next to that and and launched the fund with 30 million which anyone who's raised 30 million will know it's not easy amount to raise but it was it was a complete administrative and operative nightmare because what I what I learned for the first time in my life was that goldman sachs and the hedge fund I had worked for had huge operational and administrative back-office support which allowed me and my colleagues to focus purely on investing investing decisions and that was enabled because of their scale unfortunately when I went out with a small amount like 30 million that burden fell on myself and it came with a lot of extra hours a lot of a very sturdy very steep learning curve and it also opened my eyes to how many financial intermediaries lie in the middle of one hedge fund transaction so just off the top of my head I can count five or six intermediaries for every single transaction that occurs within a fund so whether that's a transfer agent a custodian a funded minister an external auditor a internal operations team compliance officers and so on and so forth so so this was mind boggling to me and the one the one upside of this experience was that for the first time in my life I was able to understand how the entire engine of a fund works of an asset management company from the complete back-end to the to the front and cycle of a trade booking risk management compliance and so on and so forth and I suppose that set me up quite nicely for the next project which was building Mellon so what we do with Mellon is we set out nearly three years ago now to build a completely new infrastructure for asset management which doesn't need or require any financial intermediaries to achieve the same kind of security compliance operational accounting standards that you can get in the traditional world but using the blockchain infrastructure so it's a protocol that allows people to set up operate manage and run funds within a set of rules using smart contracts as the automation engine and using blockchain accounting as the accounting tools yeah I find this so fascinating to think about like there there is a chart in one of your blog posts where you kind of lay out all the different roles and how they're kind of traditionally managed and then you have a column that shows how Mellon manages it and it's all like smart contractor put you know replace this role with a smart contract in that role with a smart contract and etc so to you do you kind of want to describe a little bit what those differences are between like how a traditional fund is set up and how a fund with melon is different yeah sure so in the traditional world believe it or not it can take between six months to twelve months to set up a fund which is kind of mind-boggling when you think about it why does it take so long because you need to find all the financial intermediaries you're going to work with you've got to negotiate with them various rates and conditions and then you've got to set your funf prospectus up depending on which you know jurisdiction you regulated what in what kind of funds you want to set up so a fund prospectus is like multi usually about a hundred two hundred page document which stipulates the rules of what this fund manager can and cannot do in his or her fund and is designed to protect the end investors who are going to invest in your fund and all of this is written in long legal speak and and this fund prospectus is basically the basis for which your fund rule set is going to live by now in the traditional world you need a bunch of financial intermediaries to police you to make sure that you do not breach any of the things that you said to your investors you would not do and so that's where all the financial intermediaries come in because all the trades you're booking are booked with paper certificates they're settling t plus two T plus three there's a very big lack of transparency in the traditional world so you need human bodies and people to monitor and figure out where you know your positions lie where your risk lies to to check your accounting at the end of the day to make sure that your trades are reconciled and so on and so forth so that's where all the costs stack up now what we're doing on the other side is we're saying so so sorry to take a step back that's a several month process and typically will cost a hundred hundreds of thousands of dollars per year at least a hundred thousand I would say now taking a step back and imagining this new world that we have which is digitized assets or tokenized assets and this is fundamentally the the biggest assumption we make when we're building our protocol that the future is digital you know all assets will have a tokenized form of some kind in the next twenty ten twenty years and because we make this assumption we're now able to use the entirely new infrastructure to build funds on top of and that infrastructure is obviously blockchain technology and we're now able to say well let's take this fund prospectus idea and let's build it into smart contract code so what the Mellon allows you to do is say okay I want to set up a phone today now I want my phone to be able to trade with this asset universe this set of assets I want it to be able to trade with these exchanges I want it to be able to I want to I want to allow these 25 investors to invest I want you know a two-and-twenty management and performance fee I want maximum 20 positions I want a maximum position size of 5% and so on and so forth all the stuff that you would typically find in a fund prospectus you can now write in code or we've written in code we've started writing in code and the options are endless and now managers can just you know select from this suite of options and put together this set of customized smart contracts and deploy that to the blockchain as their fund and the fund address is now what investors invest into so the smart contract rules are enforced by the blockchain and the ink and the accounting is written in the smart contract code and enforced and sort of you know inherent to the blockchain qualities so you can you can calculate the share price of your fund you can calculate your management and performance fees the smart contracts can distribute the fees and so you get this very powerful automation element you get this other powerful aspect one of the reasons you manage to reduce costs so dramatically is because you don't need financial intermediaries anymore this also means that investors can hold custody of their assets at all times because the token that they have in your fund is redeemable at any time for the underlying assets in the fund and it means that they can trust the manager to manage their assets within the rule sets of the fund because the rules are transparent to the investor so you take the process down from a few months and one hundred thousand hundreds of thousands of dollars to a few seconds maybe a couple of minutes and maybe at maximum a couple of dollars in gas yeah well that's incredible and just out of curiosity so we're speaking just so the listeners know we're speaking before you guys launch your main net and you know obviously as you have been describing million port is a protocol so what does the front and like user interface look like both for the fund manager who wants to spin something up using Mellon and then the their LPS so the front-end is pretty easy as far as blockchain technologies go to interact with it it basically enables a easier way to access the smart contracts so so managers can download the code for the for the front-end as well and operate their own front-end customize it customized the you know even customized to some degree by adding various smart contracts if you know we've made we've built the first suite of smart contracts but as you know the asset management industry is huge so there's there's potential to build a lot more on top of Mellon in the coming years but yeah the the user has a way to interact with the contracts on the front end level through downloading an app so for fund managers that want to spend something up should they have some coding skills or is that not necessary iid Lee ideally they should have some coding skills whenever interacting with blocked any blockchain technology which requires putting assets at risk and that's just simply because the technology is still very young and experimental and I think it will still be at least another two or three years until people can start to feel very confident putting serious amounts of capital into blockchain or blockchain run protocols or smart contracts just because the the the security processes that are in place are still very young and underdeveloped but that's changing very fast I would say right now managers can definitely set up funds and start to experiment by having you know a few a few investors a few you trade making making trades with various exchanges monitoring how the PNL works checking that the risk management if they try to breach a rule that you know testing to see whether the smart contract actually blocks the trade or not when it's supposed to and that's what we're excited for people to try out to really start to start testing the the smart contracts on the front end even to see that you know everything that you pay a fortune for in the new world and creates a lot of administrative and operational headaches can be done now with just a few clicks how are fund managers paid via Mellon so they're paid in in the same way almost in the same way that they're paid in the traditional world so in the traditional world there's two ways a manager gets paid they get paid a flat management fee which is a fixed amount a percentage fixed amount of the assets under management they get paid per year so if they're it's it's typically it's typically between one and two percent of assets under management and then they get paid a variable which is dependent on their performance above a high-water mark so above as long as they're creating profit that year for the investors they get to keep a chunk of that and that amount is typically on average about twenty percent so they get this obviously in the traditional world is calculated in USD and and and paid out to them quarterly or at the end of the year usually in the Mellon protocol we have the contracts to do those calculations and distributions except that we pay them out to the manager in shares of the fund as opposed to in USD or eath or whatever they can be obviously sold and converted into another currency but the the actual mechanics of it payout in shares of the fund so over time the manager the better he or she performs will accumulate shares in his or her own fund and in terms of the time frame I even read that that can be done down to the second then like quarterly yeah yeah block time yeah yeah who do you expect to be using mil in port I think initially it will be crypto managers because we're talking about a decentralized technology at the end of the day and it still requires you know the lack of financial intermediary knows means that you have to have a fairly good degree of understanding around how blockchain technology works how to look after a private key how to you know how to trade on a Dex and so on and so forth and that might sound easy to you and me but I think you know for someone coming out of the traditional world they'd find that a little bit complex still so I think the first use case is the first users will probably be crypto managers who have been monitoring our project for a few years and I think that the the starting point will be that they'll start to pilot tests in small amounts and play around with the technology and provide feedback and and hopefully get excited about it and and start to pitch in with you know with either adding to the kind of development or just joining the ecosystem in some way to help to help build this into an even larger and more successful protocol in long term when the system is more robust do you expect that we'll see different types of people launching funds than have traditionally done so oh absolutely yeah I would imagine longer term as things like security improve things like regulatory clarification around you know how to use blockchain technology in financial services as we see clarity in as well as we see kind of yeah clarity in security token issuance because that's obviously a huge untapped pool of assets that can be traded on a on a melon protocol this would then bring this would then start to bring in the traditional managers because I guarantee you that the high barriers to entry and traditional asset management is a serious problem there's a lot of aspiring managers who dream of nothing more than to spend their time investing and who are pretty good at it but just never really get the chance in a way like like me because they're bogged down and burdened by the costs and time required to meet all the compliance reporting regulatory obligations etc when you're that small I think there was a report out a few years ago saying that you need it's estimated that you need about 200 million dollars in assets under management to survive as a fund manager within the first year of operating a fund which is crazy when you think when you think how low the barriers to entry and other industries are and wait so why is that the like I mean if you were saying it's maybe like a hundred thousand for the administrative stuff I don't understand why so - so 200 million dollars is what you're supposed to be investing on behalf of other people it's not what you can spend so the the fees you would extract from that are typically 1 or 2 percent per year and then you typically need to pay yourself or one other person or salary but in general the operational overheads for a fund are five to six operational staff per investment professional so you're looking at five to six employees internally this is without like the external financial intermediary fees just to just to make the operations of your fund work compliance report you know and and and and and smooth well I see okay yeah then then that makes sense and so do you also imagine that then you know because I guess like a lot of our financial services tends to be dominated I think even maybe by certain countries and geographies so do you imagine that we will also see this opening up opportunities for people in areas of the world where they've had less access to traditional financial services I really hope so I would it's very hard to predict the future but in a way just thinking back to how you know when the mobile phone came out it was much adopted much faster in emerging markets than in developed markets because they just skipped the whole fixed line thing because the infrastructure wasn't there and if you think about even solar panels you know it's being there being adult adapted a lot faster in areas where they have no electricity because there's no infrastructure there to begin with so if you take these kind of leapfrog examples then then you can also say well in in areas where there are financial services or the financial industry is underdeveloped and maybe partly because there's a lack of trust in the people providing those services I think there's a good argument to say that they can leapfrog to to a kind of more modern infrastructure before the developed world because in general the developed world financial services work pretty well I mean every eight to ten years you get this big kind of you know disaster which has repercussions but in general on a day to day basis you know there is a fairly good degree of trust with the you know client and a bank and with your investments and so on and so forth but in in the emerging market world I think there's a big lack of trust there which can really benefit from from these technologies and so as I mentioned you know you're just about to launch me and I think by that time that's come out it comes out that mean it will have been lunch where or what kinds of funds are using interest from you said crypto funds are they are those ones that are styled more like hedge funds or VC or yeah I mean all sorts really like we just had our second ever asset management conference blockchain asset management conference in sugg last it was two weeks ago actually and we asked that question to a panel of crypto fund managers and then we asked the question to the audience which I would guess was about 25 to 30 percent crypto managers and we we asked them you know who in this audience will be willing to pilot or we'll be piloting Mellon and other decentralized financial technologies you know this year when they as they go live and there was a you know almost all the kind of crypto fund manager hands went up in the room so that was encouraging to see I think there's a reluctance to go all in and I think that reluctance is completely justified I think we have to remember that I've you know I said it earlier on the podcast but the technologies are young the security tools we have are young you know I think melon will be the most complex protocol by a factor of almost five times to ever hit the main net in terms of the complexity of the smart contracts and that's you know that's something I I want to be warning people about not not being complacent about yeah well actually that was my next question for you one of the main issues obviously with crypto funds is the possibility that funds could be hacked or lost then there's actually a really similar issue with smart contracts where we've seen a number of smart contracts that have lost funds due to bugs in the software so how does mil import secured funds so it's not Mellon ports job to secure funds in fact Mellon port has absolutely no control over the protocol whatsoever once it's deployed to the main Nets it's it's really out of our control what happens what we have tried to do is what we promised to do which was when we first set out to build this project we promised that we would do two external audits we have done three on the final set of code and a total of seven in the last two years seven audits that is but I would only really count the last three because the code has changed a lot in the last two years and we've also been running several bug bounty programs and main net competitions to test the software having said that you know what you said completely holds you know there's we do see bugs occur we do know that bugs can lead to a loss of funds and and we have to be very very very aware of that when using using these protocols especially especially as security processors are still quite young and and take a lot of time as well but there are really great progress being made in techniques like formal verification and tooling formal specification that we can start to use but these take time and this is definitely going to be a focus for us in the next coming two years but this is this is over and beyond what we set out to do initially and this will just be part of the next phase I guess you can kind of think of this main may not launch as a we proved that it's possible to get to a Minimum Viable Product on the main net and now it's pretty exciting you can set up a fund you can trade you can you know do all the things we said you'd be able to do but next step is right how do we make this robust because you want people to be able to trust this code with more than just testing money but substantially more someday and so if bugs are found in the smart contracts then essentially you will what you'll upgrade those smart contracts or how does that work so like I said we as in melon port have no more control over this because it's a decentralized governance structure so what recently happened in beginning of February was that we handed over the protocol to the melon council and a melon council will be looking after the protocol upgrades and reviews from now on as well as setting the network parameters and deciding on future resource allocation so the melon port team will the former melon port team will have a seat on that council but there there are several other members on that council that will have to vote you know on all upgrades and decisions and these include two auditors were actually three auditors one of them being a formal verification expert so ZK labs Matt differente Martin lund fall from maker Dow and that pub and Nick Munoz McDonald from solidified audits and then we had we have will Harborne from Earth Phoenix so the one of the decentralized exchanges that have been integrated into the melon protocol then we have other other members on the council who have other degrees of expertise I think the total number of council members was eight so you can start to see that three out of eight were auditors and that I hope hopefully kind of emphasizes how importantly we we think about security going forward going forward the council will grow by consensus so Mel imports set the initial council and from now on anyone who wants to to join the Malan council will have to apply and be voted in by consensus we're going to talk about governance more later in the show but I wanted to also ask you so the protocol only uses two centralized exchanges but right now decentralized exchanges don't really have sufficient volume so how do you guys get good prices for the fund managers who might want to use the protocol today that's a great question so we leveraged off khyber networks mechanism so khyber network has a has a system of plugging in reserve managers which provide bids and offers and it always shows the best bid and best offer at any one time now we were a little bit skeptical of this idea at first but we were told by Loyola that the founder of khyber they exactly I don't know we were told by law that in general the the the bid offer on khyber didn't differ more than about one to one-and-a-half percent from centralized exchanges at any one time and honestly we didn't believe him when he said that so we actually we actually almost dismissed it but then thought hang on why don't we back test it ourselves and see so we did and he was right we found that actually the bid offers are less than in most cases less than 1% and at most have been less than one and a half percent and so actually the concept was pretty neat for us because you know these are Unchained prices that are provided by khyber so it prevents us from having to push prices to the blockchain through an Oracle or other means which also means that it's more cost efficient for us and also if someone or if a reserve manager in Khyber is providing a wrong priest wrong price sorry there's a substantial financial loss for them because they you know they will they will be forced to trade at that price so so it seemed like a good win-win situation well couldn't they be doing something like taking a short position and then falsely quoting a low price and or colluding with others in order to you know get some benefit I mean can you elaborate on the example well I just mean like if if it's if they sort of know that Khyber is the one source like I just feel like there would be ways in which they could maybe even collude with others so maybe you're right that like one of them sort of pays a price but then if they're working in concert with others and they could take some other position that would that would benefit them yeah so I mean the the the way that it works is there are quite a few reserve managers plugged into Khyber and Khyber we'll always pull out the best bid and the best offer at all times so in theory you should always have the best bid and the best offer and if someone is trying to manipulate the prices by offering something that is substantially worse then the the logic goes that that their price wouldn't be an option in the first place now if they all collude and they all provide a wrong price then I mean which I find pretty unlikely because most of the reserve are a lot of reserve managers on Khyber are anonymous as well but they're also staked to quite a high degree so I mean the the only benefit they could really get out of it is is is buying fund shares at the wrong price and even that they wouldn't be able to do because the there is a delay mechanism by which the council the Mellon Council has has a possibility to stop price is being provided for the prices of the nav so nav calculation that's the share price calculation of the fund so there is like a check mechanism whereby if the Mellen council or if the software uses notices that the prices are off they can just not push the prices which means that for a certain period funds don't get a price but it's better than the alternative which is I think what you are getting at we're gonna discuss governance in the middle and token after the break but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors within months cryptocurrency anti money laundering regulations go global are you ready avoid stiff penalties are blacklisting by deploying effective anti money laundering tools for exchanges and crypto businesses the same tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy face it regulations can stall or kill a fast-moving crypto business new financial action task force and european union cryptocurrency AML laws are coming soon you could be hit with stiff fines or blacklisted no matter where your servers are in the world prepare now deploy the same powerful cipher trace tools used by regulators protect your assets streamline your compliance programs and keep your exchange or crypto business out of the regulators crosshairs learn how effective anti money laundering tools help keep your crypto business safe and trusted learn more at Cypress comm slash Unchained cipher trace is securing the crypto economy back to my conversation with Mona ELISA of melon port I also wanted to ask you so we've been talking about how right now things are kind of experimental because it's new so what benefit is there to LPS to invest in a fund that uses melon I think being on the forefront of what's about to happen in decentralized finance is is a big reason to be playing around and dipping your toes into this technology because it's it's really pivotal it's true that it's not going to happen overnight in my opinion but it's it's happening fast and it's not just melon it's it's an entire ecosystem of players that are coming together and linking their technologies together and and this makes it much more powerful than if it was just one company building one protocol so just as an example you know melon has integrated together with FNX as a decentralized exchange Oasis Dex which is another decentralized exchange khyber network and radar relay and ERC Dex which are zero extra layers and this is I mean we would have done more it's just that we've been fairly time constrained on what we could do in two years and then we're running our governance structure on Aragon os and this is you know this is just a you know a team of 10 developers not even 9 developers has managed to do in in two years so the as we grow as we move to the next project and continue to grow as the ecosystem around us grows you know these technologies become stronger and stronger the liquidity problem becomes easier to resolve you asked about liquidity before so there's five Dex's we have integrated now and we've a grated the order book so it's not still not great liquidity but it's an aggregated order book which means that for a user perspective they're getting a deeper you know with one with with one protocol they're getting access to all five order books at the same time and being able to get better execution price and better liquidity and a year from now that five exchanges might be ten or fifteen and two years from now it might be thirty the same time we might have found better solutions for scalability which means that liquidity naturally will increase there may be more regulatory clarity around decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer trading which will bring more professional traders and market makers into interplay you know you're even starting to see centralized exchanges like by Nance and coinbase you know make acquisitions or or develop their own internal decentralized exchange software so it's just a matter of Earth Phoenix was a great example of how they they port the liquid you from BitFenix to ethnics and as a result makes them one of the more liquid decentralized exchanges so there's still a lot of innovation going on and I have no doubt that the ecosystem and all the challenges or problems that remain will get solved and the good news is there's more and more talent coming into the space there's more there's more brain solving the same problem and that means that the solutions will get better and better and faster and faster so it's just a matter of time so as you have been mentioning this is an area that's typically highly regulated so how does Mel and Handel know your customer and anti-money laundering processes so melon in a melon protocol has a tool inside it or has a has a functionality inside it which allows people to whitelist which addresses are allowed to invest in their fund now the KYC AML is handled by the manager independently because this is not something that melon port does melon port does not operate the software and certainly doesn't sell the software this is all open source under the the open source licenses that we use and people have to use it according to their jurisdiction and their requirements so they're they're gonna differ from place to place now they still remain quite challenging the regulatory issues around these technologies and the main reason for that is is that most law that's been written about asset management and financial services requires as the legal requirements financial intermediaries to check transactions accounting and all that kind of stuff so we argue when I say we all tell you about that in a second that if the smart contract and the blockchain can replace the financial intermediary with arguably eventually more security and more transparency than the financial intermediary and for less cost then maybe these rules should be adapted for black blockchain technology and we realized this over a year and a half ago which is why we set up an association called mama which stands for the multi chain asset managers association and this association lobbies globally for raising awareness about decentralized finance technologies and why the financial intermediary will become less important over time and we've had some great successes lately with the Swiss lawmakers when the blockchain federal report mentioned on chain funds which was a huge which was a huge win for us we've also seen wins in France where our feedback got put through to the French finance ministry and we're having success in Liechtenstein and Walter - to a lesser degree as well but it's still you know there's a lot of work to do and we're very blessed and lucky to have I think we're up to 70 members now most of them are builders like us in the decentralized finance space and most of them are very active with us and helping from their jurisdictions as well and one other thing so you keep kind of talking about these different entities around the Mellon protocol and like a couple times in my questions you sort of said like oh well you know it's not Mellon porch that's doing this so can you just describe some of the different entities and also talk about how you're winding down Mellon port sure so madam port was mandated for a two-year workshop to build the Mellon protocol and deploy them on a protocol and that's exactly what we did in fact I think we did more than what we said we would do now the association was created a year and a half ago after we saw a need for something like that in order to help drive adoption later that was just a side hobby it was never part of any promise we just thought this is something this space can benefit from so we helped set that up it's not run by us it's run independently from us by by a strong team of people and we just support it and so do now another 65 or so companies support it the Mellon council is is the body that will look after the council after men import after the protocol after men or it is wound down and have already been handed over everything they need in order to do so and they will push they only have three things that they need to do one is deciding on upgrades and pushing upgrades through the network but ultimately it's the user they can never force a user to upgrade it will always be the user that has to opt up to an upgrade but there will always be something recommended by the council they also have to decide on how to allocate the resources and by that I mean the Mellen token inflates by about 300,000 tokens a year and this pool of tokens is there to allocate to developers well 80% of it is to is to be used to develop to to be allocated to developers or security or that certain form of verification or anything like that and the 20% of those tokens are to be remunerate in the council and then the third decision they get to make is adjusting the network parameters and so you for those of you who don't know the Mellon token is a utility token which operates much the same way as ether does on the etherion blockchain it's a gas for asset management except that it's not charged on every single function you call in the melon protocol it's only charged on on three functions in the protocol and and that's designed specifically to keep costs low to the manager and to keep friction low now there is a possibility that the gas price can spike if the usage of the network goes up dramatically or if there's a dollar ethology leti or melon eath volatility and therefore we want to be able to adjust that parameter so that if it does get too expensive to use it can always be adjusted down by the council well and also talk about the other part of governance which is the the business beside the expose business representatives yeah sure so the council okay so so the council is composed so actually that's so if you think about the stake in the network there's three stakeholders when it comes to the asset management ecosystem there's the users which we define as the fund managers and the investors in those funds there is the token holders and there is the main future maintainer and developers so we believe that we've looked after the token holders and the maintainer is developers through our token design which very nicely links the usage of the network or the number of users on the network to the purchasing power of the token so this makes token holders happy and this makes future maintainer z' and developers happy because if they add value to the network the likelihood is that more users will come to the network which will benefit the purchasing power of the token so that leaves one stakeholder group that is unlooked after or not represented at all and those are the users and and this you know this is a problem because the users are probably the most important people we need for a protocol to be successful because let's face it without users it would you know the whole thing is a failure and and the users are also the most vulnerable because they're putting real assets on the network so we thought hard about how we could represent them and our conclusion was that there had to be a pretty strong body in there who was going to be making future decisions and that would be the melon council and the important aspect we considered when designing the melon council was that we wanted it to be technically skilled and user representative so technically skilled because user security and features decisions should be made by qualified people and not just by unknown unidentified parties who may have other interests or conflicting interests and the user representatives because we believe that the users should be able to self nominate representatives on the council that can tell us what the users priorities are and tell the council you know we want to be using this more but we're worried about security so we want you to allocate all your funds to security or 90 percent of your funds to security this year or you know actually you know we're pretty comfortable with security now but we need you to build this feature and that we really need and if we had this feature we could do like a hundred or a thousand more funds on this protocol so this is this is really the thinking behind the council it's to represent the unrepresented stakeholder group in our in our network and and we hope that the design we've chosen will prove to be successful on that front and how are they chosen the the Expo which what the council or the yeah I mean like you've talked about their requirements but then how yeah I think so so a madam porch or the initial council so that would be the technical council because there are no users yet since we're not on the main net yet and for every five technical council members to user representatives can be nominated nominated by the users and and enter the council so the users have to be self organized through a body of their own and they get to elect one or two or three depending on the ratio representatives that then can enter the council and start voting with the council on decisions and let's talk also know about the melon token in your system people can use melon but they can also use ether so why don't you describe the purpose of the token and how that works so actually we you do need melon to use the protocol but we abstract this away from the user by charging gas fees in eath just to make it just to improve the user experience so on a on a function that you you would basically get charged on the setup fund according to the computational units you're consuming and we use the same unit calculation that aetherium uses for smart contracts but this time we multiply that number of units by the melon gas price and not the etherium gas price this gives the amount of each charge that eath goes to a contract called the melon engine smart contract the melanin engine contract basically is like a what a unidirectional market being provided in eath melon so it's always selling eath and bidding for melon and the more eath it acquires or the more ethan the melon engine the higher the premium it bids for the melon so basically you can almost guarantee that the melon will always get bought because someone will arbitrage it and then it gets burned immediately and it's the burn that's the really beautiful part because it really links the usage to the to the purchasing power through the what we've we've we've modeled this off the MV equals PT or the plant one P yeah you can have both PT o P Q quantity or transactions so it's a it's a economic identity it's not a valuation metric by any means it's an identity which always holds and so we can keep the purchasing power high by two ways one because we're burning the token so we're completely removing it from the supply and linking the usage to the to the purchasing power but we're also keeping V low and you'll you'll have red pieces by Kyle Somani and Ryan's or and others who talk about something called the velocity problem with tokens which says that if a last he gets too high then actually the purchasing power of the token goes down is basically like the turnover exactly yeah and so by having this burn mechanism in there we prevent that same token from being recycled into the asset management network or economy if you think about it as such which dampens the V dampens the velocity which enables the you know the purchasing power to really kick in so you know all of that is obviously assuming that the token is only used for asset management which we hope it will be because it shouldn't be used for you know buying and selling goods like there are better tokens to do that for talked a little bit about this before but let's dive a little bit more into the inflation of the melon token how will that be handled in the future and what will the inflation be used for so the inflation is created at the start of every year and it goes into a multi-sig which is controlled by the men and council and this inflation is about 300,000 tokens a year so it's disinflationary it starts off as a percentage quite high and drops you know substantially each year it's basically twenty percent of that three hundred thousand will be used to compensate the melon council and the other 80% is there for a few different purposes it's there to attract developers to complete melon improvement proposals which we have on our github so we had a lot of suggestions and great ideas from our community in the last two years and we didn't have time to complete them all because we had priorities but we documented them all in a repository and we hope to be able to remunerate people from those melon tokens who who put their hands up and say I want to develop this feature etc we'd we'd like to see although we don't fully control that at this stage but we'd like to see the melon council allocating a lot of those melon tokens towards security in particular maybe formal verification and other aspects but this this you know something that will have to be discussed and voted on but especially in the early years you know at least our entity thinks that that would be a good use of funds but also there's this idea that other projects can apply to the council for melon tokens instead of running their own IC o---- or token sale because this further aligns interest and increases Network effect so what we saw in the lot a lot in the last two years there's a lot of people coming up to us and saying hey we really like to build on melon but we need to raise money so we're gonna do an IC o---- and I found myself thinking this is a disaster right there's just too many tokens in one ecosystem it starts to add friction instead of remove friction which is what we're all trying to do so if we can now say to people you can build your asset management application on top of melon but instead of doing your iced tea oh why don't you apply for some melon from the council and then that aligns interest because we're all basically working towards putting users on this network and this makes the the network have more integrity and more features which brings more users and if we have more users that the token should have more purchasing power and if we have a strong token purchasing power the likelihood is the value of the token will be strong which means that maintain errs and developers want to earn in that stable or you know and that's kind of stable token or kind of valuable token so yeah that's really the summary of how the how the inflation will get spent and you've also talked about token swaps and token mergers on melon how do those work yeah so it's possible unlikely but possible that one day we get a project which is of equal size to us or bigger that will say or smaller that will but fairly big that will say hey you know we're interested in applying for a melon token but actually you know you only have let's say two million dollars worth of tokens left on your in year 2019 allocation but our you know market cap we've already done our IC o---- two years ago our market cap is 15 million we're really interested we see the value in aligning we see the value in in the synergies we see the value in growing the network effect and so on and so forth but you know two million melon tokens isn't going to cut it for us so the the possibility would be that okay we decide that in the case of a in the case of a merger for example we decide that both entities or both protocols scrap their token a new token is created which can encompass both tokens and that the sort of market caps per se are combined and remunerate it accordingly and this means that because everybody now has a new token which is the same token that these two networks or two network effects even have now been combined into one bigger they're stronger there's more developers working on futures security etc and there's more users now this would only make sense if the dilution to both entities or both protocols was less than the value created by merging but you can see scenarios you could you can imagine scenarios where this this might be possible in the future so as far as I understand once we kind of have like a number of funds that are using melon that there will be a published ranking of their performance over what time period and how often will that be updated I mean the performances are all on chain actually so that they I mean in theory you know you can pull out data for any timeframe and any ranking and this is actually another benefit because fund managers really struggle to build audited track records which people can trust them with to you know to invest substantial amounts of money in so from now on at the very least melon can help a manager build an on chain totally audited and verifiable track record within a set of rules which is pretty awesome so the the front end now the front end and extracting that data for the blockchain is a little bit more complicated and we are working on a tool which hopefully should be live in a few weeks which will be able to to track performance at least over one or two time periods and and hopefully over time we'll will make that to a more sophisticated and I want to also then ask a little bit more about kind of the structure going forward because your co-founder I don't know is this in reto or Rio Lucho rotring Claire is starting up a new company and at least for now I think melon port is hiring his firm drinkler software to do some work on melon chain so what does that work and then going forward what will that relationship be between his company and the protocol so when rehto first left the company in May 2008 een I think yeah it was May last year the the plan was that he wanted to do some research on man and chain a research and feasibility study shortly after that he decided not to and informed the board that he no longer wanted to so that actually that has been put on hold and we instead we expect the Mellon Council to research that this year over the course of the next 12 months there's actually no rush for it from our perspective because we're not expecting v 1.0 of poccadot until october this year and certainly we won't be rushing into everything anything until we've done our research on all the interoperability solution so we'd meaning the council not not just not just our team but yeah you know we've got a little bit of catching up to do on all the interoperability solutions we've got to see how they all pan out how they come to the main net how they're used how they fit our particularly how they fit our use case and decide at the right time I think it's probably a little bit too early to make that kind of decision right now and we'll we're at this moment in time where there's a lot of competition around the various block chains that's kind of heating up will Mellon always be on the ethereum blockchain oh that that's a hard question to answer right now I think that really depends a theorem as far as we're concerned today is still the best blockchain to run a decentralized protocol on now having said that we've been pretty focused on building melon on aetherium for the last two years and coming out with 1.0 and delivering our promise on time will now allow us to step back and revisit that assumption over the next few months and see whether whether we should be thinking in any other direction or you know whether we should be thinking to build a para chain or side chain or whatever but it's very hard to say that right now because we've just come out of a of a two-year sprint where we've basically been focused on building melanin aetherium and not much else so here you are at this moment you're about to launch me net what projects you have building on top of melon port right now so there's a few projects investigating the only one I can publicly speak about is Ash finance so this is built by a team originally called originally called Midas technologies and this is a team out of Germany that are building a gamification a fund manager gamification app on top of melon which is pretty cool it allows managers to challenge each other to battles it has a mobile interface and it's it's going to be available in various app stores and they're coming out with their beta any day now so I'm very excited to see that they're a team we've enjoyed working with we've really enjoyed their enthusiasm and the fact that they jumped in so early for better or worse because you know we've we've they've done a really good job given how busy we've been and they've done a really good job of independently working on this app without too much help from us so I'm really looking forward to seeing that and hopefully we'll see many more use cases coming after that great well where can people learn more about melon so the best place is probably our medium page where we regularly publish blogs we have a great YouTube playlist just out from our m1 conference which clearly you know that the first set of six or seven talks is clearly going through walk you through the entire melon stack and then later on all the other kind of protocols and decentralized exchanges etc that were integrated into melon and the DOX melon port comm is a great resource for developers to get who wants to get down and dirty with the code and see what we've done we'd love to answer any questions our Telegram chat is always available and so is our reddit channel on melon project great well thanks for coming on Unchained thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Mona and melon pour check out
