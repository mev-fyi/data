lightning is pretty complicated right now it's hard to set up a node it's hard to connect a node really really well with other peers it's hard to manage channels and liquidity in channels so what we're trying to do is really make lightning really really easy this is Jeff Benson for Unchained David Marcus is the former head of Novi at meta and the current CEO and co-founder of Light spark which builds infrastructure for bitcoin's lightning Network after announcing Light spark 11 months ago the company is going live with three products Light spark connect Light spark predict and the light spark API and software development kits so David what is lightspark connect so in a nutshell what we're trying to do here is basically take lightning which is amazing it enables anyone to send and receive money in near real time and and settle in near real time at a very low cost and almost infinitely scalable what's been the interaction between light spark and lightning labs in this endeavor you know lightning Labs is building you know the most successful lightning distribution out there and uh and so we're building on top of what they've built over the years and uh and basically our software is built around uh l d to make it really really easy to use um and so that's that's what we've been focused on it's really you know taking the best that is out there and making it really really easy to use not only to set up but also to manage so you know if this is the first time that you're actually operating on Lightning the concept around channels and liquidity that's locked up in channels and the fact that you need to rebalance that liquidity all the time is something pretty foreign if you're used to traditional payment networks or blockchains and so in uh in this first drop so to speak of our product we're really taking care of all that in the background in an automated way and so you don't even need to know channels exist we actually as a matter of fact never talk about channels in our interface so tell me a little bit more about light spark predict Light spark predict is the the part of the product that actually helps you find the best routes to Route transactions depending on transaction size and destination but it's also a way to dynamically and automatically assign liquidity to the right channel just in time for the transaction so that your Capital efficiency is just much better than it currently is if you deploy Bitcoin on on Lightning as a way to enable transactions to flow through the network now few weeks Bitcoin ordinals and now stamps they've sort of rejuvenated interest in Bitcoin for other things so if development continues to broaden Beyond payments what role might Light spark play so look I think that you know the more things you can do with Bitcoin in terms of you know using that immense amount of liquidity that's out there for other applications the better for us because you'll need to move value around really quickly to buy these things or to interact with these new products so we think it's all all really good and you know it's kind of a reflection of the the era we're in where listing a token is not you know a thing anymore so people flock back to bitcoin to build really amazing things and you know it's very exciting to actually be building a site you know side by side with that community foreign
