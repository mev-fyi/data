not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and we've got Laura the CEO of the show and then you've got myself a massive the head hype man a dragonfly uh we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block.xyz for more disclosures it's been for once a relatively calm week in crypto I actually for the first time I learned that my mom watches the show and uh apparently when she misses me she turns on the show because she wants to she wants to see me and like she likes my camera and uh she told me the feedback that she gave me on the show is that like yeah I see this um who's the who's the crazy guy with the crazy hair and I'm like Oh you mean tarun she's like yeah tell tarun to cut his hair my mom wants you to cut your hair to ruin I just just to relay that to you you know don't worry my mother tells me that all the time too so I don't think she watched I don't think she watches this though but yeah okay I it does make me very nervous now to imagine my mom watching the show but um I I'm gonna try to push it out of my mind I mean it's short on the one side so you could just like record from you know one angle of your face I love it that they didn't object to the color it's only the length she did mention something about the color but I thought I wouldn't bring that up because she she is she she has other preconceived notions about people with colored hair so I thought okay I'm not gonna mention that one but the long hair she she pressed on that a couple times so okay but she otherwise she otherwise uh said that you talk a lot that was the other thing that she mentioned to be clear she doesn't she doesn't know anything about crypto doesn't follow any of the space she's just she's just here to like listen Feel The Vibes I like the tone we're setting for the show it's going to be the pick on tarun uh Emma said which which I'm which I'm good at and I I set the tone already in our little pregame um conversation but anyway well okay so let's let's break it down with uh some of the News That's taken place this last week so one of the interesting pieces of news this week was around arbitrum so arbitrum of course launched their token the ARB token a lot of fanfare around the airdrop which took place you know a couple weeks ago um and then came the very first governance proposal on the arbitration Forum uh which is known as aip1 and aip1 uh the way it was proposed is that it was supposed to be spending 750 million ARB tokens about a billion dollars worth of ARB tokens uh you know roughly 10 of the total Supply it's gonna be sent to the Arbitron Foundation to give them Capital to invest into initiatives with the arbitrum that are going to be built on top of arbitrum uh and our polders wouldn't really get a say it would give the orbital Foundation total a ability to do what they want with the 1 billion because you know they got to compete they got to compete with polygon they got to compete with Solana whatever right that's kind of the general idea so now the arbitrum holders looked at this this proposal and they were like wow that's a lot of ARB without any oversight I don't really like that and so he started voting against it and then the arbitrine foundation was like oh [ __ ] hold on guys this was actually not meant to be a proposal in the traditional sense this is meant to be a ratification because we kind of already did it and so this caused the governance holders to freak out and everyone on Twitter to get mad and say oh my God governance is a sham arbitrum token doesn't do anything uh because it turned out that a lot of these tokens uh 50 million of the 750 million are tokens was already allocated to a market maker uh supposedly winter mute and then 10 million was already sold into Fiat to cover operating costs for the foundation and so the foundation you know issued this kind of flat-footed response saying like well no you know look at just as a matter of practicality we we have to have tokens in order to set up a foundation and to engage contractors and to do this stuff like you know Dows don't show up for free and Foundations are money and so like look this is I'm sorry we kind of messed this up we should have communicated this as we already did it as opposed to here's what we would like to do um but a lot of people got bad because obviously this was not communicated well um so arbitrum has since then uh backed up and said okay guys we hear you the entire internet is now mad at us um we are going to you know redo this whole operation we're going to break this AIP into pieces and we're going to try to re-pass individual pieces and get more feedback from the from the Dow but this is this is raise a big conversation about how much is governance really governance and how much of this is kind of a show especially in the early days of a Dao when obviously there's you know a lot of insiders who are basically controlling the the outcome of these votes so what were you guys take seeing the drama unfolding over the weekend I mean I just didn't even know why they had tried to do the ratification I was like if you already did it then like like why even go through this ceremonial thing it doesn't even make any sense you should just be like by the way here's how it was all set up you know and not like do this ratification post you know after the fact like it doesn't even make any sense it's just like they stirred up the pot for no reason they'd already done it there was nothing anybody could do about it so why go through the motions of making it seem like people are proving something I was just like you guys caused yourself this problem over like nothing and maybe you guys know more about doubt governance than I do but I was a little bit like why you could have just been like here's what's been done yeah I I kind of agree I mean there always is like a little bit of this LARP in the beginning I think people think of it a little bit kind of like yeah the comps always get drawn to like um WordPress and automatic or like you know uh red hat and Fedora where it's like um okay there is the open source thing that people are contributing to and then there's a separate entity that like the Dow pays to do the thing and in reality it's it's kind of a large they're they're kind of very tightly you can connect connected at least in the early days and so it's like yeah sure it wasn't the best show but like it was the alternative note like no one's going to develop arbitrub and and like you know some so they're gonna wait for some third party to show up and generate like a Consulting proposal and so you know obviously everyone kind of wants the outcome I I said something to a Founder recently which apparently really resonated which was like early stage startups they were a little bit like China where it's like yeah you have the power and the control but like you need to let the people believe that they have some of the power and some of the control sort of keep this this process going and uh apparently that resonated with them but I think of that a little bit like this like we kind of know the outcome but people kind of need to be brought into the process anyway I'm guessing also they thought that this thing would just pass uncontroversially right my guess is that they were like you know what it'll look better for us if the if the community just like rubber stamps this thing as opposed to if we like when we come out with our token economics we're like yeah there's 50 of the community but ten percent of that 50 of the community is also ours and we're gonna like figure out what to do with it uh and we're not gonna have any oversight over it that like kind of looks bad and they were like I bet we could just get the early people to say yes to whatever we asked for in the first proposal that that's my that's my first guess looking at this is that they did not think this would be controversial and then they you saw them like trying to justify they were like well if you compare this to like avax and compare this to polygon like actually we have less of the the percentage of the tokens that just goes the foundation that just goes and makes grants and stuff so like why are you arguing with us like stop arguing with us it was kind of the vibe from the responses in the governance Forum so I think this was not I think they like kind of backpedal my guess whole speculation my guess is that the back pedal at the end when they realized that there was just a Revolt from the token holders and they were like oh no no this was meant to be a ratification like that that was the intention from the beginning where I guess in the beginning they probably assumed it would just get overstamped and nobody would care and the thing would just pass very easily yeah I mean I think that there's yeah the the comparisons to other networks is pretty fair I also just think that the one question I have is like what lawyer kind of like said that this was like a good thing to do because like it does feel like a little bit like there's some Law Firm unclear if it's a U.S one or Cayman one or something who is like hey guys you know because there's a lot of regulatory pressure you know it would be great because it looked like a dow voted on the foundation because of a of the like cases that exist right now like the ukidao case and stuff like that so like why don't you just like toss in a vote but like make sure it get make sure it passes uh and like it there's somehow some of that it the way the initial response read like it was drafted by a lawyer and the later response read by his Drew was drafted by like a crypto person sort of suggested that like somehow there was like a lawyer running this and it was not like and and and you know you know I gotta say like I I really love the Arboretum team because they're like really good Engineers there's like a ton of people who are really focused on engineering I'm not sure if I I know much about anyone who does sort of community stuff there so it can it I I don't actually know who who runs this but like the the response just felt like it was written by a lawyer to me like and it it felt like some legal counsel was like hey you just should just do this and it you know of course sort of ended up not working out as well and yeah I just I one of the most uncomfortable conversations has to be the arbitrim team talking to whatever legal counsel suggested this that would be what I like I would not want to be in that room well I mean I'm still reeling a little bit from this analogy to China because like if blockchains are supposed to create these little mini democracies but really it's all like these sham democracies where instead it's like actually top down control like that's really problematic like the fact like that that is what resonated with that person and that that was the analogy you came up with I'm a little bit like what are you guys all building here like that's not what people are to be fair this was a this was a centralized company that happens to operate in crypto it's not it's not a Dao or not a protocol or something like that but I mean I think it's it's kind of like yeah I mean I mean in in the early days things start out kind of centralized you need someone to start pushing the Boulder and then things kind of slowly decentralize over time I mean I think maker is actually kind of a pretty good example in terms of like um you know there's you see political infighting which is a testament to like the fact that no one is actually you know pulling the strings and also frankly there's this other component here which is just like these big lump sum payments and sort of the lack of oversight around budgeting maker actually does an incredible job with budgeting like you can basically see all the different light items broken out for all the different core units and like most Styles don't do that they operate like this where it's like you know pay 100 million dollars and will like develop the protocol and uh you know trust us it's going to be spent well I I just want to give like sort of a little bit of the benefit of the doubt to the arbitrim team in some ways because like I do feel like they did actually add in some other safeguards like the fact that you can vote off the off-chain directors like the Dow basically effectively controls the multi-sig that was pretty interesting like a lot of other L2 foundations didn't do this I think the difference is in a bull market when a lot of these other l2s launched the knives weren't handily readily available uh let's say and people just didn't notice that people were doing much more egregious things and I think that the the kind of like timing plus the really bad uh PR stuff which looked like it was written by a lawyer just like those two things compounded into something that looked horrible but you know yeah I I agree that like I think like they actually made some very interesting steps towards decentralization and their proposal that are all going to get overlooked because of like sort of some of the other impropriateness stuff yeah I mean I would I would describe it a little bit differently which is that you know arbitrum you know arbitrum is a layer two and that means you know of course they have a centralized coordinator that basically runs all the blocks like you know they run the server that runs the layer too so you know the sense in which like this thing can be decentralized is actually a it'll take a while before this thing is actually governing anything that's plausibly decentralized from the architecture of the thing and that's true for all the layer twos at the moment that said like they've basically been completely centralized up until the point where they launched a token and now all of a sudden there's like this changeover very suddenly where they have to move from being totally centralized to now being plausibly decentralized or at least like you know uh deferring to Dow governance and that's a very Sudden Change in the way an organization runs in a way decisions are made in a way that people think about their own roles and who they're responsive to like it is a very sudden and weird thing that normal organizations never do this is this is purely like a weird blockchain land you know uh you know Bizarro World thing that we're doing this idea that like hey guys why didn't you set up all these decisions to be responsive to the Dao which just existed 10 minutes ago and like all these random Forum posters are now your boss like that's weird it's a weird thing to like change your mindset into and Armstrong very clearly like although they've built a great Community they were never subservient to their community in a way that they now have to be now they have a token so they've never had to deal with like the mob and now they're learning they're getting a crash course and like what happens when the mob shows up and the mob is mad and the mob like they they have your tokens now and they control you and they're very upset and you know you could see that like even the way the original post was written as you were saying tarun it was written by this group I can't remember what it was called it was like some consulting firm that they they later admitted like they were like who is this person who wrote the initial proposal because it's not like somebody of the artist from core team and they were like yeah it's this like consulting firm that we hire to like handle governance matters for us and it was like bad luck you have to understand there's like the you know one of the ways I would delineate the difference between arbitrary and optimism and this is not like a a purely like a very tight uh dividing line but like the arbitrim team is like a bunch of Engineers and academics and and they're they're really built around like focusing on the engineering side and I think they kind of like let all the other stuff kind of like untouched especially community-wise on for a long time right like relative to say optimism which arguably has like less of the engineering and like kind of technical adroitness in some ways but they did start with much more of a focus on the community and like Community Management from the beginning and they weren't kind of like hey we'll bolt it on at the end and this kind of is it illustrates that philosophical difference between the two of them in a lot of ways totally agreed totally agreed and you can see that in that optimism has always been talking about the community and public goods and how to make all this stuff beneficial for everybody even when like optimism wasn't even working they were spending an enormous amount of energy explaining how all this was good for everyone and the mob should be very happy and arbitrary was kind of the opposite it was like look we built you a great Layer Two what more do you want like why are you yelling at us like give us give us tokens so we can go make it more valuable so I think it does uh I mean look after this like I guarantee you everybody at arbitrum is shell shocked and they are now never going to make this mistake again and everyone is going to get like some some form of like training in like never ever say anything never ever dismiss token holders ever because like we can't let this ever happen again but it's a it's a it's expensive and painful lesson are there any Dow comms Consultants yet you know it's like when there's PR crises you can hire like a PR consultant is anyone doing specializing in Dows I feel like they'll be a good Market you know I think um uh the the meme I would make about this is 2020 was the year that everyone could be an investor 2023 is the Year everyone can work in investor relations which is like basically what the like hey you're liable to the Token holders yeah I feel like this has actually come up on the show before where we talked about the importance of community managers and like I also have personal experience running like a big group and um online and yeah when things get out of control it is bad so like learning how to communicate learning what to do when things go down having like kind of like shifts basically for people to manage you know when things are starting to Bubble Up In The Forum and whatnot like I feel like that's all going to be super important but yeah I feel like in this case where it's already been done and then you give them this facade of like having control over something like people are not going to react well to that you know so they should have just been up front and been like sorry this has been done already um and we're announcing it I mean you can see also that like it wasn't a facade it turns out because the the token holders really did have control they didn't have control over the 50 million that they'd already cashed out but the rest of it the other 700 million yeah they have control the token holders have control because they took it back and now they're gonna re-submit things to governance and get people to sign off so I think in the end it's like it was messy but it is a validation that like hey yeah ultimately when you have a token the token holders are in control yeah and actually in a way maybe it's good because it like probably galvanized the token holders and so there's probably like certain people that are naturally filling certain roles of like oh you know now we're gonna be watching blah blah blah I haven't been following this so I might be just making stuff up but I could imagine people being like Oh we need somebody to do you know XYZ to watch for this or that and you know to come up with ideas for this or that so you tell me I don't know if any of you have been following it more closely but it seems like that would naturally happen now I think starting governance on such a sour note is is going to make everybody super vigilant for the next proposal and the one after that and like the level of argumentation and every proposal is going to go way up so these things do have a way of like affecting governance and making it feel more adversarial with the foundation or with like the uh you know the the team that's actually building the software whereas I think in places where there's just not as much pushback in like almost every proposal gets passed there's just a sense it's kind of like a board in management right there are times when the board is just like very Pro the CEO and they just kind of let them do whatever they want he's like look we trust you um but if that doesn't happen it's like why are you doing this why are you doing that and like every single question every single decision from the from the CEO is being fought by the board it's just a precedent that like tends not to go away like it just tends to persist so my guess is that that's going to happen to Aboriginal governance at this point which may be good or it may be bad it's hard to tell I I mean I think I think a lot of this also just has to do with like um if you know if you look at sort of the governance practices of say startups from 2015 through 2021 there's like strict like loosening right like people have like less and less board control um people had less and less like governance rights over um their Investments like you saw sort of this loosening and standards and I think a lot of uh projects that launch tokens in you know that era so that that would include kind of the other l2s they sort of inherited that and so Arboretum is sort of in the same way that right now every you know fundraising round has very strict terms way stricter terms than say 2021 token holders expect sort of the same kind of Reckoning uh and it's sort of interesting that the stuff that happens in the like pure private Market peer Equity Market is is like has bled into into daos in in some way right that's like it's like sort of a unexpected thing but I think the arbitrary scenario kind of illustrates that yeah I think that I think that's possible that's possibly true okay let's um let's change topics so the other big thing that's coming up next week is the chapel upgrade so chappella is a combination of two big upgrades in ethereum one of which is Shanghai which people have been talking about forever the Shanghai upgrade is the upgrade that ultimately allows stakers to unstake and withdraw their ether and potentially sell steak ether which has been kind of dormant uh just stuck on the on the state side since basically when staking went live with the with the Advent of the beacon chain so today we have about 15 of the total ether Supply staked uh and so that means that within short order all of that stake will potentially be eligible to be sold now different people have different expectations about what this is going to do in terms of how much ether is going to get unstaked uh it's not straightforward to be able to to model exactly who's going to unstake when and who even if they do unstick who's going to sell or not most people are anticipating a lot of unstaking although this unstaking is kind of uh there's multiple steps you have to go through and not everyone can understand take it once there's a couple of cues that you have to go through in order to fully unstake Gauntlet tarun you guys wrote a piece about the Shanghai upgrade talking about what you think the effects are going to be on staking derivatives ethereum security can you summarize for us like what are your guys expectations of what's going to happen with the Shanghai upgrade yeah I mean I think you know the the the stuff that people are fighting about on Twitter regarding it is sort of the polemics of what we were talking what we wrote about the polemics being like everyone's going to withdraw it's going to have no security it's over they're going to withdraw and sell because they've been locked up for X number of months that's one side of the argument the other side is everyone is hodling forever uh and and if if this doesn't remind you of like Bitcoin happening events it's it's sort of like Bitcoin happening events had the same level of polemicism right of like oh like at The Happening everyone's gonna sell right before or after and like they'd have some weird Theory right like rainbow curve type Theory yeah so I I think the the main thing we were we were more focused on is the fact that there's you know staking derivatives have a ton of concentration um so staking derivatives allow you to basically give your 32 each which is sort of the minimum amount to make a validator do a validator and then you receive a sort of IOU and the IOU is sort of like the pooled stake that um a bunch of validators are running the network with and the IOU lets you sort of have some liquidity on your asset and so these ious are very popular in fact they're you know larger in some sense than the rest of defy right now they're one of the most popular Assets in in decentralized finance and the reason for that is that you know people when they are you know contributing their eth to validate the beacon chain they're locked up until this upgrade uh and they've been locked up since the big contains started and so you know it's been quite a while and so the idea with taking geruders is it allows people some form of partial liquidity now we've had some liquidity crises around staking derivatives in the past um so right after about a month after uh Luna crashed three arrows Capital had their insolvency event and in that process they Market sold an extremely large amount of mistaking derivatives causing sort of some unexpected behavior in this upgrade we sort of don't expect the same level of that type of stuff happening partially because a there's a bunch of staking derivatives and people have started partitioning their risk somewhat into different stake ingredients and B the net leverage ratio is much lower so people were using these staking derivatives and sort of treating them like eth and then taking you know like five to ten X leverage on them and I think the net leverage ratio you know prior to Luna crashing was actually quite a bit higher uh than that almost like 20x on chain and so that and that leverage ratio has gone down and so I there's you know there's going to be sort of some orderly events like I'm sure there's going to be people unwinding positions in in you know getting ready for this but I don't think it's going to be either of those two polemic ends where everyone sells at the same time and eth POS is dead or you know like everyone's hodling forever and like how can you not expect the rainbow curve for the price for for ethereum so yeah true if I had to ask you what do you think is going do you think the net level of each state is going to be higher or lower two weeks after the Shanghai upgrade what would you guess um my guess is that it will be slightly lower so I don't think it will be higher but I don't think it's going to be dramatically lower I just think there's a lot of people who have liquidity needs but but I do think that the overall staking derivatives ecosystem is expanding quite dramatically like there's a lot of different staking derivatives there's also things like eigenlayer which will allow you to sort of restake your assets and provide them to certain networks for services on chain like oracles or or or other things like that and so there's sort of a sense in which that there's a bunch of opportunities yield opportunities tied to staking that are sort of growing over the next few years and I I expect the recovery time from maybe a slight dip to not be not very long in some sense to me the only single origin organic yield on chain right now is heat staking and and it for the foreseeable future it is really the only thing like the other staking products just don't have the same level of liquidity interest and actual you know usage of generating fees Mev Etc I like the idea of calling eatstaking organic yield I feel like there's some branding exercise around there that we can do well well like the the thing is in the last bear Market um the now Infamous gbtc trade and sort of Bitcoin basis trade Worthy pure organic yield wait what makes yield organic hold on how are you defining organic now that that doesn't sound very organic to me gbtc is not organic but the Bitcoin basis trade where like the Futures and spot were all like historically always trading at some deviation that was like something that was a huge that was like the organic yield and part of that just had to do with like the nature of Bitcoin Futures versus the nature of spot and like delivery but that was sort of bitmex was sort of built off of that in a lot of ways I was going to say this reminds me so much of grayscale eth um right and that it's it's like Hotel California you can you can check in but you can never check out if you stake right now which obviously makes it in some respects unattractive for a lot of investors right like each staking as a percentage of total eth is very low much lower than like pretty much every other POS chain um in part because you don't know when you're going to get liquidity it's the same reason why ethi uh the grayscale each trust is trading at such a massive discount is because you you're basically you know hoping and betting that at some point it turns to par but you have no real read on when you'll be able to redeem it adding this sort of redemption Loop and you know completing this sort of ARB makes it underwritable for a lot of investors or just etholders who are sitting on the sidelines right now so um I think I think it makes it kind of more attractive to get the organic yield like so I guess we're going to use that term now it says plausible in the long run that there's going to be more each Stakes because like you said you know a lot of Youth is just sitting around doing nothing um and you might as well get something for it and you know uh not only secure the network but I do agree in the short term you know it's it's likely that there's going to be people who want to get out as opposed to people who immediately want to get in so I think two-week prediction I'd probably agree with tarun that more eth will be unstaked but I would guess like two years there will be more each stake than there is today yeah and a lot of this is like a natural basis effect so like think about the eighth price at the time the person staked think about the eth price now and imagine you're a fund that's dollar denominated you have to return to your investors in dollars well your net return might have might actually be negative because of uh the fact that each price has gone down from when you were staked when you first started shaking like when you made that position so your your basis will affect that and like there's obviously people who have negative bases right like the the beacon chain started at a much higher each price so you know you can't imagine that all of them are just gonna stay forever you know it's never that's never been true we gotta do some tax loss harvesting basically what you're saying it's it's like stuff like that like that type of stuff that's kind of like systematic stuff I think there's a ton of that that exists one thing I find so interesting about this conversation is that nobody has raised this issue about how now the New York attorney general and Gary Gensler keeps saying every crypto aside from Bitcoin says security but you know Leticia James also said that ether's a security and I think like back when stinking started Gary councilor said that staking uh products look or not prod I shouldn't say products because that sounds like from an exchange but I just mean that's coins uh you know that are secured by staking our Securities he was implying all this and I just find it fascinating that like nobody seems to be thinking about that like you guys were all like yeah there's probably gonna be more staked ether in the future now that this has been implemented um which yeah I don't know it just sort of feels like the industry is sort of like we don't care yeah I mean if you're going through an exchange or something like that I think as we sort of saw with the Kraken uh settlement you know maybe there's some uh legal dubious around it but obviously there's solo stakers and people who aren't in the US and whatnot and so there is some some attractiveness there I don't know I think overall though like with each staking you know obviously yield goes down as more people join and so like I do Wonder kind of where that that point on the margin is where like it actually is you know attracted to people to to stake versus not yeah the reality is like right now your opportunity cost is just like your opportunity cost is relatively high right now to stake until Shanghai and then your opportunity cost is super low and once the opportunity costs sufficiently low I think I think Turin is right like each staking just looks like the quote-unquote risk-free rate even though it's not it's obviously not actually risk-free because your validator can mess up but like that lowest risk thing you can do is just going to become the de facto thing that people do and then if you want to take on more risk you can decide to do something more fancy or do leverage staking or do leverage something or other but you know the default thing like all the ether in efe is just gonna you know okay state that because you know might as well make some more money from it or something I was gonna say there have also been some lobbying efforts to basically change the tax classification for staking rewards because right now they're taxable as income as you receive them but obviously they're locked and it's very annoying due to that kind of accounting and so I realize we're talking about you know uh crypto taxes on we're talking a lot about crypto taxes right now I don't know what's going it's been a quiet week in crypto yeah yeah yeah last week everything blew up in this week we're talking about taxes but anyway it is almost taxable more and more to be unveiled it is true very topical yeah but the other the other thing I remember so back in the day I remember there was this big argument on the cosmos forums talking about whether they should make staking in Cosmos where they could it should make it so that the entire Cosmos uh asset is um what's the term when rebasing like make all of Cosmos assets rebasing except for if you're staked if your state you don't rebase that way it's economically equivalent to staking in that like you're getting a you know a fixed percentage of the network but you don't have to pay taxes yes exactly exactly so this is called demurrage uh it's the kind of like old school French thing that like French shipping magnates used to do I think like the hard part that I find with all of this is that staking doesn't really feel that much like a security itself alone like if I'm a solo Staker in some sense and I get slashed for like not being online or not or invalid processing of a transaction well that is only in your to me there's not like this common effort of others to take that loss now when you're pooling staked products like staking derivatives or like these pooled vehicles the pooled vehicles are a lot closer right because I am I am sort of subsidizing like the loss is shared the the profit and loss are really shared amongst everyone but the individual stickers just seem so far removed from Orange Groves in Florida and so I just like find it really hard to imagine that and that's why they're single origin and organic that's I need I need a t-shirt of like buy organic yield I think that's really Charming um okay well so okay speaking of getting slash getting slashed so there was a very interesting attack that took place this week a 25 million dollar Mev attack now we don't see these very often uh last time that we saw like an Mev attack was was quite a while ago I remember something uh somewhat distant last year that took place that was that was directionally similar where basically what happened was that there was uh somebody who set up their own validator and when their validator was was up to produce the next block they put these bait transactions into the mempool to try to get these Mev Bots that are constantly scanning the mempool trying to find transactions to front run under a sandwich attack uh they put these Bay transactions in the Mev Bots tried to submit flash bundles to front run these transactions and then the the person who was running the validator basically like unbundled the blocks and reorganized all the transactions so that the Mev Bots instead of front running or sandwiching other other uh their their own bait transactions instead we're getting front run themselves and sandwich themselves by the attacker and so the attacker was able to yield 25 million dollars in a single block by doing this across a bunch of Mev bots so there was a a bunch of rigmarole about how flashbots could have mediated this by uh checking for something about checking for signatures on the proposed block or something like that I didn't quite follow the details um Tom through other you guys follow exactly how this attack played out yeah I think the one thing to note is that though if we take a step back when ethereum has the merge there was this software called Mev boost that flashbots made that anyone who is validator can run and what that means is what Mev boost does mechanically is every block producer who's selected so like you know there's some verifiable Randomness we select the next person who chooses a block they become an Auctioneer they say I'm willing to sell the block space that I'm deemed to produce in the next block and you can bid in my auction and Mev boost lets people bid and these people who are bidders are called block Builders and they send you blocks of transactions and the idea is that if they found some Mev they might like you know reorder some transactions or add some sandwich attacks and then they send it to you the proposal because you you have to produce that block and there's sort of some interesting rules of how this works so the way that the people who are bidding send you the bids is they actually send you some form of metadata proving that the transactions are sending you are valid plus their bid the interesting thing that happens though is it you don't Reveal Your transactions so the the proposer the person who who is selected if you revealed all your transactions they could just copy your transactions right they could just like censor you in the larger transaction so for a censorship resistance reasons you don't include your transactions however there was a sort of bug depending on whether you want to call a bug or intended feature where if someone basically sent you a certain set of metadata uh and then you know when the proposer validated it before sending it to the rest of the network if it was invalid um you could still sort of see the transactions that they sent so what that means is that someone wins the block and they don't but they bid without sending you their transactions then subsequently they send you all their transactions but then you send an invalid block to the rest of the network that doesn't get accepted and then you immediately make a block where you add in all the copies and then send it and try to you'd cause this kind of race to get your block to be first and the software had this unintended effect that like these invalid like these invalid blocks still sort of leak their transactions so there's a little bit of information that the the the sort of malicious validator could use now I know this Probably sounds scary to a lot of listeners but this type of stuff for the record happens in normal trading all the time in normal high frequency trading you see all these kind of weird sequencer issues between multiple venues um so I I would say that these types of like auction Hocus Pocus stuff happens everywhere uh Equity auctions are notorious for this um so I'm curious too because I know like obviously part of it is at least on ethereum if you're a validator like you know you're going to be proposing a block with like two epochs ahead of time um and that allows you to do you know multi-block nav or do something like this um and there's kind of some research into like randomizing or obfuscating that a little bit more so this kind of stuff isn't possible um you are I guess our resident expert like what is the state of the art on stuff like this yeah I'm glad you asked I think the uh proof of stake uh versus proof of work has this one particular problem so in proof of stake in order for the stake distribution to be sampled like in order to say like you know Laura puts in a hundred each Tom puts in 10 Heath hasi puts in 90 each the fact that like Laura should be sampled the most that rule requires you to sort of lock your eth into a contract that can then be sampled at those ratios right of 50 to Laura uh 45 to see Etc and you can't just join and leave the network whenever you want you know in in particular because the network everyone needs to agree for some amount of time that the stake distribution hasn't changed that we're sampling the same distribution and such that the probabilities are all correct in proof of work that's not true no one actually ever has to know how many people are running machines or running hash where there's hash power uh the difficulty adjustment just sort of infrequently adjusts based on how many things you've seen but it it actually means that people can join and leave whenever they want and so there's there's this whole line of research of like how do you can you use Advanced cryptographic tools to get proof of stake to have that property um and there's sort of some some negative results on this but the positive results are this is papered by um Dan bonnet and I think Nicola Greco from 2020 called uh single secret leader election so it's sort of a way of selecting a leader in a fully private Manner and and on the next block they they provide some sort of ZK proof-like thing is there a knowledge proof that like hey they the the correct person was selected and so the state of the art is people know things that can be done people have implemented them they are not very good for production because they rely on some cryptography that I think people are not 100 comfortable with which is uh threshold fully fully homework encryption okay well that went totally over my head that sounds that sounds um all good I remember um back in the day there were uh I thought ethereum was also relatively unique in that like you have a very far look ahead to know when the next who the next leader is going to be and other algorithms don't have that property so I believe it was like algorand or tesos I can't remember which one it was that like you can know to in advance and one of them was like one in advance or something like that I I forget all these details now because it's been so many years since anybody was talking about consensus mechanisms I remember back in 2017 and 2018 this is like all everybody was talking about was the different properties of consensus mechanisms and here we are so many years later and nobody cares about any of those things anymore and this is the one place where it matters I'll I'll get I'll give I'll give ethereum a lot of credit in in one place which is that a lot of other proof-of-stake networks have very long Epoch times for like how long the stake distribution has kept constant um and that you're known for like many many blocks in advance and I think ethereum did do a lot of work to try to like reduce that so it's it's like realistically like six to 12 blocks that you know in advance versus like hundreds or thousands in some other networks yeah fair enough well there was there was one more hack that ended up getting a resolution this week uh and that was the Euler Finance hack so we talked about this a little bit a couple weeks ago uh oil the finance was hacked for uh I think almost 200 million dollars like almost all the Assets in the in the protocol were stolen so Twitter went on this wild goose chase try to find The Ether that was stolen from the attacker and some a small amount of it was already returned but it turned out that through cooperation with law enforcement uh particularly supposedly with help from Han Ventures uh they were able to get in touch with law enforcement that was able to track down who the attacker was and ultimately they got into conversation with the attacker and were able to negotiate a return of all the funds or the vast majority of the funds so we don't have a lot of details things are pretty vague as to what happened and how it happened but supposedly a bunch of people were involved including Samsung and um uh Hudson and a bunch of folks who were you know just part of the security apparatus of ethereum who helped everything run so Oswald that ends well looks like Oliver got all the money back uh and the attacker was tracked down I think one of the lessons here from Euler Finance is that it's getting harder and harder to get away with big hacks and we saw this before last year I remember there was a number of hacks last year that got fully returned or like returned minus like some small finders fee quote-unquote of like a couple million dollars and so this does seem like especially in a post-tornado world it's just like we've increased the friction of being able to cash out and the non-kyc exchanges are getting less and less that it's just more and more difficult to hide your tracks on chain what are you guys thoughts about this uh this this Euler return I mean like this was uh something that came up when I was doing the Dow hacker thing from my book you know when I interviewed people um about who I thought it was and stuff they were saying stuff to me like oh my gosh he could have saved all that money and then he would have been a hero in the ethereum community and now because he did the opposite uh you know he'll be shunned and people were saying things like reputation is everything and he could have like had it made for life like he would have been considered this like amazing solidity you know Dev and I mean maybe some people might think of him that way now but you know I think a lot of people probably don't uh so yeah I mean I've sort of just shifts the incentives in a way where I hopefully would think that a lot of people who find these exploits would start realizing like oh what I can do is I can you know make a little whatever like Bounty fee or whatever they call that um and then I will be made for however long because I've now set my reputation as being this like amazing person who can find these exploits like like basically they could be like the other like the next Samsung um but when they do the opposite then like you know people don't want to deal with them and you know and then they could get in trouble with law enforcement like look at Avi Eisenberg he he like he not only did he tweet that he had this highly profitable trading strategy he came on my show you know like talking about it and I you know would imagine right now he's maybe having some regrets about those decisions so yeah I'm I'm very curious what methods they're using to get these people's identity sometimes it's very obvious they do something stupid like they are funding these through an exchange account and it's like okay well obviously that's not going to work um but I believe the Euler hack was actually funded by a previous hacker that was funded via a tornado cash deposit and so like I don't know what they're using if they're looking at like IP addresses that are submitting like transactions to an RPC node or if like there's some extra I don't know metadata like I'm actually very curious um to kind of hear more and obviously Han used to work at the doj so they probably have some I don't know interesting uh sort of fingerprinting tools as well um I also have people on so I think Euler was saying on Twitter that like um hey all the all the funds have been recovered and obviously the denominations are different because some of them were sold so there's a bunch of wbtc you're not getting all the wptc back so we'll figure out how to net it out but there was I think like 1100 each that went into Tornado from the hack that did not seem to be accounted for so maybe they just negotiated like a uh sort of you know settlement fee or you know like a finders fee for the uh for the Bounty or for that for the bug but um yeah I think some more details kind of to come yeah I would guess also that part of what makes it a little bit weird is that if you remember a couple weeks ago they were communicating with the Euler hacker through ether's canvas or not either scan Masters but like on-chain messages and somebody what was it like a previous uh hacker it was like North Korea or something was communicating with the attacker and so supposedly like the attacker had gotten in touch with somebody and there was some like it sounds like this was a more complicated thing than just they looked at on-chain records and then they figured out who it was it has to be that they established communication and were bargaining and then like somehow my guess would be like in that process they found something some of the on-chain notes were crazy like the one that was like I [ __ ] up I'm Jacob like in fact that they said their name there or purported names was kind of also one of the notes from the hacker said I'm sorry to everyone who was hurt by the Sun and they signed it Jacob yeah and they and they said things like oh you know I didn't mean to like take people's life savings and I didn't mean to like hurt these families and blah blah blah and it's a little bit like okay when you're gonna take that amount of money how did how do you not realize like it's gonna like are you like two years old or like I don't know it's just um but one thing I wanted to say about the North Korea thing was like apparently people thought that maybe what had happened was they were trying to obfuscate who they were and so they like decided like oh I'm gonna do this weird transaction to make it look like North Korea is involved so that was kind of one of the hypotheses around that whole thing is very odd and I have to imagine also a lot of these attackers are probably you know basically the equivalent of script kitties who are like living in Russia or something and they're like 14 years old and they just live on etherscan and they found some vulnerability and then once you do the hack like you can follow all the steps like okay first funded from tornado and then make sure you use a VPN and blah blah blah then you have the money and now once you have the money like there's no guide for like how to get the money out there's no guide for like how to deal with like wow everyone on the Internet is trying to get in contact with me what should I say to them what should I not say to them how do I avoid getting unmasked and you know I I have to imagine that that's where a lot of these hackers fall apart is not before the hack but after the hack like after the hack is done you know More Money More Problems like now you have to suddenly deal with the fact that you have 170 million dollars on your hands and like the entire world's coming after you we've never covered this hack on the show I'm not totally sure why maybe we did a little bit but the James zong the the Silk Road 50 000 Bitcoin person because that person was caught after like 10 years or not 10 years eight years something something like that and it was the interesting thing was like all the that there was a recent doj following like last week or two weeks ago um in that case about like his like lifestyle and the things he said and I thought it was really interesting that like that's being used very much against him uh in this case or at least like part of the the the case to claim he has no remorse and so yeah I I feel like a lot of this you know it's like uh the post exploit actions are actually very important almost 100 times more important than the getting into the exploit actions it's like you got into the museum and you stole the diamond now you have to get out and not get caught ever for the rest of your life you gotta like not suddenly increase your life expenditures the point where like your neighbors start noticing something's off like it's a lot harder actually to get away with crying than to do crime a lot of the time yeah and this is what I was saying before because like like you're right once you have that money that is stolen you can't actually use it like if you're gonna use it you're definitely gonna get caught like look at the razzlecon people you know I mean it's like they got tracked down to their like Walmart gift certificates and stuff like that like uber rides I mean it's like super specific so if you do the good thing then like you'll get a reward and then on top of that you you know can probably work for whoever you want afterwards so um but you're right I think it's like little kids who are who are doing this and they they haven't thought these things through um one other thing I wanted to mention though about the jamesong is that Taylor Monahan did this like amazing thread where she talked about it all and like she has her funny you know the way Taylor writes her tweet threads was amazing and hilarious so you should check it out and she has like screenshots and images of his time parting on the Yachts with like hot women and whatever yeah right right this was all used against him in the case and and I think it's like kind of interesting like that maybe Karma doesn't exist instantaneously but it does over long enough time yeah and like another part of the Tweet thread and granted I didn't read the court thing so maybe the court thing is even funnier but um it goes into how you know he was trying to hide two billion dollars or some some number that was in billions in his home like physically and it was like in random places like in a popcorn tin and whatnot like it's like hilarious yeah the James long thing should be a movie like I actually feel like it's like one of the cases that that like is unsung here unsung like villain I don't know like you talk about unsung heroes but these people are like unsung villains well let there be a lesson to all young people watching The Traveling block crime does not pay if you're gonna make money do it organically like tarun says single origin organic on-chain yield that's right that's right that's gonna be that's gonna be our meme now I think for the chopping blog that is our approved way to make money in crypto I'm surprised like no one made that Meme before because like it is just kind of true right like it's weird we got to do it ourselves all right there was another t-shirt that we were thinking of making for The Chopping Block this clearly needs to be the second one I forget what the first one was though it was it was I think it was Robert in the GM cup either that or it was tarun uh looking at the looking at the camera out of the corner of his eyes didn't people make the GM cup like like people on the Internet seem to have like gone and like you know made made the made the same version we have a shop at Unchained we should uh whip those up in there stick them on there but but the other one was about um I'm not gonna say because I don't remember off the top of my head but we'll we'll try to find it for the next show we definitely we definitely need to get started on some Unchained merch I will wear I will wear a shopping blog merch on every show if we have something okay I will not wear chopping long birth himself is chopping block merch like all chopping block merch is basically different versions of Tyrone saying things we'll wait to ruin what if it was like super colorful what if we could make super colorful shirts okay you're you're starting to work on it you're starting yeah you're starting to get here and I just realized you have different classes now you don't have your like asymmetrical glasses you know sometimes I wear them yeah I switch them up okay tarun give us what is your algorithm for when you decide to wear the yellow asymmetrical glasses versus this one so so actually one of the funniest things I actually went to this conference of like not very crypto native people but they the folks there apparently there are people who listen to chopping block but they only listen via audio and didn't know what I looked like and they were very surprised and I thought that was very funny so like to audio listeners I may look slightly different than what I sound like okay so before the audio listener actually you this just yeah you just made me realize this for the audio listeners tarun looks [ __ ] crazy okay I want everyone to understand tarun has has very colorful multi-colored hair constantly Wears asymmet Like glasses that are not quite symmetrical and are also multi-colored his outfit is usually very tie-dye just so that everyone understands that because I feel like this whole episode we made a lot of references to tarun's outfits that may not make sense if you don't picture that wears very colorful uh printed pants like like pants with prints on them which is lots of different textures and colorful shoes um and also his hair changes color frequently so it's definitely not been the same color or colors throughout the whole recordings of uh TCB but anyway do we have a poll at one point where people could vote for tarun's next hair color I think we should bring that back yeah I have to admit you dye your hair so often I'm a little bit worried about like whether it's breaking and like how healthy it is you know my my the My Philosophy on this is my my father lost all his hair and it was bald at like 31 and I'm like you know what i'm older than that and I I still have my hair and I'm coloring it so whatever you know okay philosophy I like it while you have it you got to do something with it and then you know if it goes It goes that's it say love you okay all right well on that note I think we're gonna wrap for today so uh when this episode goes out we're gonna do another Poll for tarun's hair color for the next show ing your end I'm in but the one thing is I'm getting a haircut on Friday so okay maybe the poem we'll be good we'll be good okay then yes it can be executed that's good that's it for now all right everybody bye everyone yeah [Music]
