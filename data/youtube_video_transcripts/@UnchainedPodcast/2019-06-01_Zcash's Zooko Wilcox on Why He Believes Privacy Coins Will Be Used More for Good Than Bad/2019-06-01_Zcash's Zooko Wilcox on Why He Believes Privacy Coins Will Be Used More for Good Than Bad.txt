of the Z cash company welcome Zuko thank you for having me Laura so we're all rather lucky that I was sick last week and had to reschedule because now with all the news coming out about Facebook privacy and NSA tracking Bitcoin users we're about to have a lot more interesting episode than we would have had last week but before we get into that I want to find out about you your history what was your pre Bitcoin career and how did you become an interested in or think of the idea of a private digital money um my pre Bitcoin career I was working on a distributed cryptographically protected filesystem it's named tahoe la FS before that I worked on a lot of different projects over the years that mostly had something to do with encryption or decentralization come up with that idea I read it I read a science paper in about 1993 by a cartographer named david sharm which proposed privacy preserving digital money and showed how you could implement it cryptographically and from that moment forward I thought that was the most wonderful thing ever and could potentially help humanity so much and so that became my favorite thing so now I'm literally living my lifelong dream and why do you think that captured your imagination I always had the idea that humanity's best resource is the other people that can help you out and they can cooperate with you and that we're unable to take advantage of that resource by constraints of distance and language and culture and national borders and things like that and so I discovered this concept of digital money shortly after a couple of other formative events in my young life which included I discovered the Internet two years earlier one or two years earlier then I discovered digital money so maybe 1991 or so and another formative event was the fall of the Berlin Wall a few years earlier than that which made me think that these boundaries that prevent people from being able to cooperate with each other we're all going to come down and why would privacy be a key component of that privacy is really essential to decentralization it's almost at a certain sort of protocol level it's almost the same thing because the the reason for decentralization is censorship resistance right and the easiest and probably the most powerful way to censor people is to threaten them so if someone if someone is is writing or reading books that you disapprove of you don't try to intercept shipments of books you just tell anyone anyone who writes a reads or shares this book is going to jail right so in the same way with modern internet protocols if our goal is to achieve censorship resistance and let people use the protocol to cooperate with each other in defiance of some third party who wishes to prevent them from cooperating then probably the number one component at the technical level to provide that is encryption makes sense it's interesting it goes back to quote from an interview I did with navall that a lot of people tweeted which is he talked about how money now is a form of speech because code is speech and now code is money and you know obviously in our society money is power and so if you can move money around or transact in a private way then obviously that would be quite powerful but I want to keep talking about your personal story actually because I had read a little bit about it and I saw that before you launched the cash there was a period where you were sleeping in your car what was going on then and how has your life changed well that was a period when I was we had started trying to form the Z cash company and we had stopped really sustaining the previous company that made Tahoe le FS that company survived and still exists and still maintains Tahoe le FS but during that period it wasn't making enough money to pay our bills from that company and we were spending all of our time trying to get investment to fund the launch of the Z cash company and also during that same period I got divorced and moved out of my house and so for a little while it was touch-and-go there until we landed 1 million dollars worth of investment to launch the Z cash company and who were some of those investors well they've already caught that you mentioned having been a recent guest on your podcast was one of the most influential and important of the initial investors and he was an important business mentor to me who not only put in money but also taught me how to do these things I'd never done before but wait what do you mean by that what were some of those things oh well all kinds of business things that like raising money was a big one right going around and soliciting a bunch of investors is arduous and the way to do it successfully is perhaps not obvious and so it was really essential that I had the balls help and advice on how to do that I think that took almost a year I didn't count so this might be an exaggeration but I think I got about 80 something knows like I pitched this company to 80 different investors who all turned me down like about 12 or so was the initial batch of yeses that I needed to get started and rent a house well I happen to see so Matthew green the cryptographer at johns hopkins I happen to see this week that he tweeted a little bit bitterly about Krypto kitties getting 12 million til funding there was something in the tweet I should have actually pulled the quote for this episode but I'll link to it in the show notes because he seemed bitter about the fact that it had been difficult for you guys to raise money for just a factor of timing we were doing that in what was that 2015 so it wasn't it wasn't a good year to be raising money for a privacy-preserving global decentralized payment system no that was the heir of blockchain not Bitcoin so let's get into some basics what is the cash it's one way to think about it is it's we cloned the Bitcoin protocol and we added encryption and so what does that mean for a user of Z cash well I have to include the caveat that we also maintained the ackwards compatible unencrypted mode so if you're a user of z cache you have to be aware of which mode you're using it in but if you're using it in with the encrypted feature then it means that when you make transactions just like in Bitcoin those transactions get posted to the blockchain so that the entire global consensus can recognize and validate that transaction but the difference is that with the Z cache cryptography the amount sent and the ID identifier or that address of the sender and the address of the receiver those things are all posted to the blockchain encrypted so that only the sender and the receiver can see them the sender the receiver and any third party that they that they share it with and for listeners just going forward why don't we maybe just define these terms so when as we continue the conversation I think so and correct me if I'm wrong Zucco but I think the official terminology is shielded transactions or shielded addresses for the ones that are encrypted and then transparent addresses and transparent transactions for ones that are not and that are more similar to Bitcoin and that they're visible on the public ledger is that correct that's pretty close but let's not say shielded or unshielded transactions because a transaction can include multiple addresses like you could send from a shielded address to a transparent address and you can even just like in Bitcoin send money from multiple addresses or to multiple addresses so you could send to like shielded and transparent addresses addresses simultaneously okay yeah anybody you can send from any address to any other address so so the important thing to think about is if if you are using a sheltered address then nobody is learning anything about how much money is coming in or how much money is going out from your address and when and to whom and then if you're using a transparent address then people can see how much money goes in and out by just by looking at the blockchain of your transparent address and then they can see the addresses that you're receiving or sending from if those other addresses are transparent addresses make sense yeah but if the other addresses are shielded addresses then nobody can see from where the money is coming just by looking at the blockchain so this is something that I'm a little bit confused about because so if Bitcoin is one big public ledger and zeusie cash also partially uses a ledger then can't those private addresses can't the amounts in them be deduced a little bit sort of like a pseudo coup do you know what I'm saying like if you have two pieces of a puzzle can't you put it the missing parts together that's a reasonable question imagine that suppose there were only one person who had started using a shielded address so far and there were a million users who all had transparent addresses then if you saw one of those transparent addresses send 10z cash to a shielded address you'd know which one it was because there's only one shielded address right and then if somebody sent 5z cash from a shielded address to a transparent address you'd be able to piece it together makes sense now the hard question to answer and the important question for the privacy of real users is is there a way to piece it together in practice based on how many addresses are currently in use so if there are a large number of shielded addresses in use and someone makes a transaction from a shouldered address to a transparent address that let's say it moves 5z cache if your look just looking at the blockchain you have no idea which of the large number of shielded addresses could have been the source of that transfer all of them are equally valley to have been the original shielded sender does that make sense so far sort of but wouldn't addresses sort of be created as trans actions grow right so couldn't you sort of figure out like oh this shielded address was created on the blockchain at this point at you know around the same time that this transaction I think you might be imagining the shielded addresses as being more like the current Bitcoin addresses in the current easy cash transparent addresses and that you might be imagining them as being like an arbitrary string of numbers that you can see when you look at the blockchain and that's not true that's the difference between Bitcoin and Z cash is that the if you just look at the blockchain you don't get to see the shoulders addresses at all so you don't even get to see how many there are or when they were created or anything about any of them does that make sense because every all the information about shielded addresses is all encrypted by the keys of the sender and the receiver who are using those addresses okay so but when I go to a Z cache block Explorer there there are these lists for some of these it will say shielded value so does that I don't understand what that means I thought that that meant that if you're looking at one of those that says there's shielded and unshielded amount then now if you looked at Bitcoin block explorers that show you the input and output tray addresses involved with a given transaction yeah so this is the rut this is like the same style right it's showing you a set of input transactions and I said of output transactions oh but only for the transparent addresses that's right it's you're looking at a list and one says greater than equal to nine point eight three three three six six four one okay click on the hash on the left-hand side of that list okay and now that will load the details of that particular transaction so basically we're looking at a transparent address and the only information that we can see from the block Explorer is that some part of this transaction involved a shielded address but we don't know which address that was yeah so on the left hand side of that transaction there's a column this has inputs and on the right hand side there's a column this is outputs yeah and there's a large number of addresses each of them begins with the letter T and that's how that's how you can tell that each of these is a transparent G cache address transparency cache address is always start with the letter T and there's a lot of them rows like hundreds and then each got a little tiny amount that you've got about 0.01 or 0.02 Z cash from this transaction right ok so then on the left it says inputs and there's nothing there so this is the place where you would see a an address if you didn't have the uni cash cryptography that make sense to the absence the fact that the left hand side is a blank empty space is the magical thing there is something about this transaction that makes me think about tumblers or just trying to obfuscate a trail in some fashion isn't that what it looks like to you to have you know like input and then so many tiny outputs to so many yeah I mean actually I believe that this is probably payouts to miners who have been running a Z cash mining rig and you know they're part of a pool and so they each ran the writing rig for a hot time period and then the pool is probably has found a block and gotten her a mining reward and now it's splitting up the resulting mining reward and sending a little bit of it to each of the miners who contributed to the pool so that's why I think there's hundreds of different and transact transparent addresses each of which is receiving a little bit of Z cash is interested I find it fascinating actually that even when you even in a transaction that involves a shielded address you can sort of deduce what's going on yeah oh yeah that's really that's really right and the reason we can deduce things is because there are these transparent addresses involved makes sense alright but this goes back to my question about it being sort of like a Sudoku right mmm yeah yeah it kind of is yeah it's a Sudoku puzzle and in the world where there are a lot of transparent addresses and being unused and a very few shielded addresses being used then it's like a Sudoku that you can solve because you can sort of process of elimination or you know logical deduction but in the world where there are lots of shielded addresses being used then it's a Sudoku that is enormous and doesn't have any doesn't have enough clues to answer does that make sense yeah well well we'll see something that I wanted I'll see you ask you about is I know people say that privacy is important to solve in the area of cryptocurrencies because bitcoins are not fungible in the way people think they are because some coins can become tainted by illegal activity and it's visible on the ledger and so I know that you've talked about how you can have at least with Z cash you can have fungibility but also you know these coins that are transacting in this public fashion but is that just because all the key the coins engaging and only in illegal activity are choosing the privacy function and so does that fact in itself like having had a history of you know going in and out of a shielded address with that cast suspicion on Z cash coins and make them non fungible well first of all I have to take exception to the framing of the use of privacy being for something that's illegal that's not the only use of privacy and it's not what either the Z cash community or the Z cash users currently use it for or value it for so consider instead something that's got the same consequences but a completely different social flavor for example you could be mining cryptocurrency in Venezuela and you could be concerned that extortionists are going to track you down and confiscate your minors or extort you and require you to pay them off or something like that even though you're not doing anything illegal and privacy not just at the blockchain layer but in other ways is like I said at the beginning of this conversation is really the number one defense against that kind of threat similarly if you're a cryptocurrency buyer and user and the United States your primary threat model is not the police and not the NSA at least not if you're using Z cache because people currently don't use the cache for his legal things as far as I've seen but your primary threat anywhere okay that was a tangent let me finish with your primary threat okay I'm happy to tell you could go into the unknown facts such as they are about what people do use coins for but I will say as you are actually well aware from from some of your other research and writings the absolute primary threat if you're a law-abiding cryptocurrency user in the United States it's thieves right they may not be even from the United States they might be from other countries but thieves are tracking down cryptocurrency users and taking over their accounts and hacking their phone numbers and things like that and stealing their their coins every day all the time and and that is a pressing and valuable reason why you should not want your the details of your transactions to be posted to a public blockchain I can think of a couple more one is that nonprofits accept donations in Z cash a lot and one reason for that is that donors often prefer privacy when donating and another is that if a business wanted to use a blockchain 4 or a cryptocurrency either way for business transactions they would require privacy it wouldn't be acceptable legally or in business considerations to broadcast their transactions to the world so anyway I think that was like two tangents in a row because you were asking a question the question was if it was a good question it was if the uses of privacy are few and far between doesn't that endanger the privacy of those people who do choose it right yeah that is a good question there's a there's a there's a technical detail about the difference between the Z cache approach to privacy and other sort of lower tech older technologies and that is that in Z cache everyone who has a shielded address is indistinguishable from everyone else who uses a shoulder stress does that make sense and not only everyone else who's currently using a shoulder to address but you're also indistinguishable from everyone who has ever used a shoulder to address in the history of the blockchain so if there are only like 10,000 people who are using shielded who have ever used two shouldered address no in reality there may be more I'm not sure about the exact number but even if there are only a few thousand or 10,000 people who are using it that still means someone who looks at the Z cache blockchain and tries to solve the Sudoku puzzle and deduce something about your behavior based on what they see in the blockchain they can't recognize anything you've done is any different from anything that the other 9999 people did that make sense yeah but I want to go back to that question that I asked earlier I I personally obviously I mean I think everybody is interested in privacy for things that they are interested in doing but in this case where you are describing to me the different reasons why people are using Z cache and not just the cache but the shielded transact or the shielded addresses obviously you listed reasons that would be fairly innocuous and understandable but the fact of the matter is you you probably don't know how many people are using C cache for illicit purposes right we get you we get some information from journalists and law enforcement like if you read all the news about investigations and busts and things like that or reports from think tanks who are analyzing the evolution of technology and emerging threats and things like that then you can find out some facts that way like what kinds of currencies are used on dark net markets for example and there just aren't that many that are using Z Cassius is that the conclusion here and there have been no dark net markets reported to have used the cash yet I mean there could be one that no one's ever found out about or talked about but there's no no law enforcement have ever said that they arrested people who for running a dark net market that use the cash and there's no no there's no chatter on the dark net market like discussion boards about anyone using Z cash there so as far as I'm aware from that data there's no uptake yet of Z cash for that use case okay well you get off easy at this moment but we're gonna return to that and later discuss the NSA tracking Bitcoin users the Facebook data breach and more but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors founded by Ed Stevens appreciate is billing the most valuable relationships on earth in each episode of Unchained

founder and CEO of the Z cash company so in light of this week's news about the face book Cambridge analytic a data breach and about the NSA tracking Bitcoin users I want to discuss the Z cash in light of those and let's talk first actually about the intercept story which is the one about the NSA tracking Bitcoin users and listeners I'll link to this in the show notes you can read it if you missed it but I guess Edward Snowden leaked documents showing how the NSA was not just tracking Bitcoin users blockchain data but also what it called quote intimate details of those users computers unquote and the article said that the NSA had collected some Bitcoin users password information Internet activity a type of unique device identification number known as a MAC address they were also tracking Internet users Internet they're Network ports time stamps and they were doing all this to identifying what they were calling Bitcoin targets would it be possible for the NSA to track and target Z cash users in the same way yes the only thing that Z cache does better than Bitcoin at this point is it avoids putting clear text data into the blockchain like Bitcoin does but it is the same as Bitcoin is with respect to what an attacker can learn by snooping on your network while you use it and what an attacker can gain by compromising your device when you're using it so in both of those cases with Bitcoin and with Z cache you could use tor the anonymizing routing system in addition like by connecting to the Bitcoin network through tor or connecting to the Z cache network through tor and that might help against at least some attackers but basically that that kind of information is still exposed to see cash users today as to Bitcoin users I mean that the information about them is still exposed to someone who can either take over their device or spy on their network usage well yeah so Matthew Greene who I mentioned earlier the johns hopkins university cryptographer who's also a founding c cash scientist said that this makes privacy quote totally untold ly worthless unquote and that section of the article the company but he's a great a great ally and partner in our science research yeah but I want to just explore this little further because he said and/or so this is actually now just the writer of the article I'm just gonna read this quote this is the text from that section of the article the NSA's interest in cryptocurrency is quote this is Matthew Green know that they're quoting bad news for privacy because it means that in addition to the really hard problem of making the actual transactions private you also have to make all the network connections you have to make sure all the network connections are secure green added green said he is quote pretty skeptical unquote that using tor the popular anonymizing browser could thwart the NSA in the long term so that's even undercutting that idea and then he said basically in other words even if you trust bitcoins underlying tech or that of another coin you'd still need to be able to trust your connection to the Internet and if you're being targeted by the NSA that's going to be a problem so what do you say to that do you think that people can have any privacy against this kind of surveillance it's possible in theory tor might help what we know so far from public information including the Snowden leaks is that tor has stymied at least at some points in the past the NSA itself which i think is a good benchmark the NSA is a very powerful sophisticated organization but we shouldn't focus on them as the enemy or the threat right for most people the NSA is not their threat model and so they continue to need improved privacy for their threat model even if that improved privacy is not going to protect them against the NSA so that makes sense for example suppose you were a company that wants to use a cryptocurrency to do business over the Internet it's fast its international is programmable you appreciate the decentralized nature of it so you're not becoming vulnerable to some other company or some third party shutting you down and so you you're using cryptocurrency for your business and your threat model is that thieves and competitive businesses and foreign armies and things like that might be targeting you either to steal your money or to take some strategic action against you in the marketplace by spying on the internal workings of your business so you really should upgrade to better privacy tools including tour and sea cash for that kind of purpose even if it were it's still possible which remains uncertain that the NSA could successfully defeat those tools so it sounds like you just like it's almost like you rank all the different threats and while you acknowledge that this is a threat you feel like compared to other ones it's maybe less of a priority what I think is that everybody needs privacy the NSA needs privacy right it's a distributed organization with multiple components that need to communicate with each other and it's being threatened and attacked if the NSA we're using a crypto currency for any purpose or a distributed publicly accessible blockchain for any purpose then they would use technology similar to Z cache or their use e cache itself or something to protect their operations from their enemies if you're a corporation like Apple you cannot afford to broadcast your internal private operations and planning and activities to your competitors like Samsung right so you need privacy and you need privacy technology you can't just rely on Samsung to be honorable and not look like wise Samsung is not just going to use some kind of block chain or cryptocurrency that exposes its innards to the public and then just requests that the public all not take advantage of that so you need privacy and you need privacy technology in the modern world so I want to get away from us over a sort of oversimplified view of the NSA versus the people that's important to me to actually but it's it's only one example of the pervasive requirement for data security and privacy in the modern world and like you say in the week since you and I last talked this this overwhelming need for a better technology has become increasingly apparent to more people if you were paying attention you were already knew that the world was going this way like with the echo Equifax hack it's become apparent and it continues to become more and more apparent to more and more people that our current way of doing things in we sort of entrust all of our private data to some third party is not a sustainable or scalable way to improve society to protect society going forward but so this is actually something I was so curious about because we've seen so many times in the past that there's been news about different privacy breaches but by and large nothing really changes people continue to agree to every terms and conditions a company puts in front of them so a part of me and you know I've covered this also in previous articles that I've written and I've just seen it time and again people would answer in surveys after the Snowden revelations of a few years ago that they cared about it but then they did not change their behaviors so like I'm just curious and this may not be something that you track but after a you know a news cycle like this one that we're in right now or after Equifax do you see activity in that part of Z cash increase at all or do have the numbers largely remain the same because last week it's a good question well I can tell you right now that currently on sea cash only 14% of transactions are shielded which I think says something about just how much people value or don't value privacy so why do you you know oh and is that well you tell me is that more of an is typical because if so maybe now there's a little bit more interest in it after the Cambridge analytical news but it's still so low well actually I think there's a lot of demand and I think a lot of people are using Z cash just because of the privacy feature but if that's the case why are only 14 percent er transaction shielded well actually it's it's in part it's more like six times as many people are using the the exchanges that support only unshielded transactions in order to buy and sell coins are for speculative purposes you see what I mean I got the six times by figuring that 14% is about one-sixth are you saying that all of that is just exchange activity well my inference of course I I don't have particular insight into what people are doing with with the network but my inference from everything I read in newspapers and on Twitter and whatnot is that the most common use for all coins right now is buying and selling them for trading purposes for speculation or to store up value and I'm sure that the exchanges that support Z cash are the source of a large number of those transactions like the one that you and I looked at today well I guess that was mining that's another big source but mining and exchanges are two of the the biggest activities in all cryptocurrencies there are additionally actual uses of C cash aside from mining and speculation like the ones that I mentioned but I I mean you're asking a very good question which is is there a like a credible real demonstration of people's demand for privacy aside from like lip service that's your question right yeah yeah I really think there is like the I don't think the ratio of shielded to unshielded transactions is a good measure because because as the unshielded trent is that the rate of unshielded transactions goes up as more and more like exchanges and wallets add the ability to use unshielded addresses that makes that ratio get smaller and smaller but in fact the total usage of shielded transactions is also going up it's just not going up as fast we I'm sorry but the balance between them is what yeah the transparent ones are going up faster for the speculative reason well I don't know for sure why I mean I know for sure why is that most of the exchanges and wallets and third-party tools like open Bazaar and shape-shift and all these different things out there they mostly only support the transparent addresses and they don't support the sholdit addresses at all yet why not is it just too difficult or is it yeah it's mostly to do with engineering the the cryptography to accomplish that that novel privacy property that I described earlier it it's so expensive on your CPU that we couldn't even get it to run in a smartphone it only works on laptops and most of the third parties like exchanges and services have not implemented it at all so that if you're dealing with one of those parties like if you're using crack and the exchange to send to receive C cache in order to trade it for dollars you can't use crack and only uses transparent addresses itself on its side right they would be difficult to convert that to you guys know if they didn't know the amount no no no what they will probably yes so the only reason that they don't is a matter of engineering and efficiency and so that's why what the Z cache core team that the Z cache company employs what we're doing right now is developing an improved cryptographic protocol that will greatly reduce the computational expense of shielded addresses so that it will be possible to implement shielded addresses in some mobile phones and hardware wallets and all apps like that oh wow okay but I don't want to get away from this interesting question about privacy that continues to fascinate me I just wonder what do you think is going to get people to care about privacy yeah that's a really good question i partly think it's true that people care and they're sincere and they're caring but privacy is a social value that you want everyone in your nation or your community to have privacy it's not like so much an individual value so it's similar to how when we put that it's a public goods problem it's like the tragedy of the Commons you know the idea that everyone benefits by having a well maintained shared area but you can't expect just every individual to out of their way to take care of the shared area so similarly with privacy its you want everyone in society to know that they can communicate freely their opinions to each other make moral choices express and act on their political beliefs you know read whatever books they are interested in that's all part of the way our society was built and has lasted this long until about 15 years ago and that's not something that you can regain as an individual just by protecting your own communications that you're your own computer usage you should protect your own computer usage in like I said earlier the most urgent reason to do that is to make it hard for thieves to choose to target you but as a society we want privacy for its social benefits it's not so much an individual benefit so are you just going to kind of continue to preach the benefits of privacy or do you feel like there's some way to kind of nudge people to actually really care about it well I think we definitely need to make it easy that's what has always been the most important thing in all of our other tools you know computer apps and things that we've learned to use over the years it needs to be easy and understandable and feel safe and feel good to people and that's why what the company is does e-cash companies doing right now is focused on improving the efficiency if the shielded addresses so that we can make them the default that everyone uses whenever they use e-cash the other thing is that I'm continuing to preach I mean I do preach the value of privacy for nations to protect and enrich of them as nations and for communities to make them stronger and healthier communities but I also preach the value of privacy for businesses to comply with the law and to protect their customers and to protect their own internal operations let's talk about selective disclosure and viewing keys first of all define them for the users and then answer the question for me of whether they defeat the purpose of privacy at all mhmmm selective disclosure is the notion that the things you do aren't going to be broadcast to everyone in the world but nor yet are they going to be hidden so that only you can ever see them instead you're gonna get to choose to whom you will reveal your actions so this is why I say that privacy is all about consent I disagree with people who say privacy doesn't matter because people like to share pictures of themselves doing embarrassing things with their friends on social media to me that shows that privacy matters because they're choosing that and because they could have chosen otherwise that gives their choice meaning so selective disclosure as well as being meaningful and valuable it's also a necessary consequence of mathematics because if you're using math to protect data ie using encryption to protect data then that means there is a decryption key which if someone gets it then they can see the data so it's a problem if someone gets access to data illicitly like in the Equifax hack but it's also a virtue that you can choose to share access to some third party by giving them the key and that's what we call a view key and Z cache because to distinguish it from the spending key right the spending key is what you keep in order to be able to spend your money later and the view key doesn't give anyone spending power but it gives them the ability to view the transactions in the blockchain it's like a Google Docs so well there well when I asked about whether or not it defeats the purpose of privacy part of it is actually related to this next question I want to ask you which is I know you listened to a previous interview I had done with Kathryn Hahn back when she was a prosecutor with Eugenie yeah well she's amazing but she talked about how she liked Bitcoin because it made it easier to check crimes and she talked about how she worried that privacy coins would make that more difficult hmm and so I actually asked her for this episode what I should ask you and she said oh well you know since that interview I've learned that transactions can be unblinded and which I'm presuming is you know she was referring to a selective disclosure and viewing keys but I just wonder so if the court lets say a court orders a transaction to be unblinded how does that occur like can you know if a court can force such a thing then I guess that's why I just wonder or that's why I asked earlier like does that defeat the purpose of privacy yeah that's that's a great question the answer is a little bit complicated but I think we can work it out I think we have to analogize to the Internet you know how people are always analogizing cryptocurrencies to the Internet they say Bitcoin today is like the internet was in 1990 whatever have you heard that 94 I think is the year good yeah we're up to 94 are we well I remember 94 and yeah I had a home page but anyway I was only just learning about it email well I think there's actually so I sometimes that kind of comparison can be a little bit fattest but there's a a really substantial technical reason that the comparison is valid which is that when the internet spread and society started to depend on the internet for their important parts of their life there was actually some consternation among some people that this would undermine the legitimate authority of government and the interesting somewhat nuanced fact is it kind of did a little bit there were there were some where we are Cambridge well there's a lot of ways we know we've come a long way in the last 25 years but there was a little bit more nuanced it's not that either this is really just the same as what came before it's not that the internet was just like newspapers and it and it's not that cryptocurrencies are just like PayPal they actually are different but also it's not that they are so different that none of the structures and processes that society has evolved will be able to cope and it's just like the end of government and society as we know it instead what happens is with both cryptocurrencies and with the IP protocol that underlies the internet it is a global open scientific fact that hundreds of millions of TechNet technologists around the world know how to use it and no one can stop them from using it because they already have the knowledge of how IP works tcp/ip and increasingly not we're not quite hundreds of billions of them but a lot of them also know how how a cryptocurrencies work and that's sort of out of control right people in other countries can use Z cash and Bitcoin and tcp/ip as much as they want for whatever they want and we can't really do anything about it but at the same time the next part of the process is that companies build services on top of that structure so soon after tcp/ip started spreading and the internet started spreading around the world then a bunch of companies started up like Google and Amazon that provide services built on top of that open Network and those companies are at least mostly under the same social controls and social processes as their predecessors were ten and a hundred years earlier right and the same thing is happening with cryptocurrencies there's an open protocol that anyone in the world can use that no one can be excluded from which is the Z cash protocol at the same time there are companies like the aforementioned creakin and Internet except cryptocurrency exchange which are United States companies of which are compliant with the United States laws and what new rulz we make as legislators and what new conclusions we impose by by courts will apply to those companies okay that was pretty damn long-winded oh I'm sorry I used a curse word on your podcast but so but I had to say all that because both of the simpler answers are very wrong the answer that says that since we have central law or not centralized is the wrong word centralized is a very troublesome word isn't it late Regan there's an answer that there's a way to look at this that says since we have large organizations that lots of different humans depend on like coinbase then there's no point in Bitcoin it's it's no different than PayPal that's clearly wrong right even though a lot of people depend on coin base and and even though those people are completely vulnerable to what would happen if a hackers stole all the bitcoins out of coin base or whatever that doesn't mean that bitcoin is meaningless right there's actually is actually quite important there's an open protocol that those that those bitcoins that coinbase controls are built on top of and transact it across and that there are other companies in other places around the world that are also using the same open protocol so it would really be oversimplifying to say the new technology doesn't matter and it's meaningless because people use these large companies or institutions or third parties or whatever and on the other side it would also be oversimplifying to say that the underlying thing is I mean the the the new technology is going to wash away all of the social structures that we currently operate so this may have been the dream or the intent of some people at some point I don't know but I really don't think the the spread and adoption of Bitcoin is going to eliminate companies or governments or any of the processes that we use to protect consumers and combat crime and everything else but I hope you got that down because that was way too much talking well but the thing is that I thought you were going to then reveal what happens if a court orders that somebody does oh geez yeah I didn't even answer your question yes what would happen right so the answer is at the protocol layer I mean the answer is that somebody controls the keys and in a lot of in a lot of cases it's going to be a third party like coinbase they controls the keys which is the same thing that we currently do with financial institutions like banks wait and this is this is when in the future when even shielded transactions are handled by exchanges because earlier you said that right now that's not the case right so so at the at the protocol layer whenever you create a transaction in Z cache you retain the view key which allows you to reveal that transaction in the blockchain to a third party of your choice now we have to look at the next layer up at the sort of I don't know what the word for this is the layer where services get built now at that layer there might be some people who are running their own Z cache node themselves and they control their own key and so if they post a transaction to the Z cache blockchain then they are the only ones who have the ability to disclose that transaction to anyone else and there might be other people who are relying on a third party like coinbase and in that case coinbase is the one that's generating those keys and posting those transactions to the blockchain so then coinbase is the one that has the ability to disclose the view keys to third parties and so for the individual it's just sort of up to them it's not something a court before I mean they could order it and then I guess the individual would choose and pay the consequences if they decide not to right and that's you know it's it's not that's basically how our society is always operated at least for the last couple hundred years up until about ten years ago ten or fifteen years ago we started entrusting more and more of our personal data to third parties and there was a legal struggle in the United States about whether the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution should apply to personal data even when it's entrusted to third parties or not and it has mostly worked out not that if you have like correspondents like letters that you send back and forth with a friend or a business partner or something until about you know 20 25 years ago those would probably be on paper and there would be specific processes whose authority derives from the Fourth Amendment for when a court could compel you to reveal the contents of your letters to a third party right and then when we started entrusting all of our letters to Google and Yahoo and other third parties even though the what would be desirable for society I don't believe has changed from 25 years ago to today but what became enforced by the technology and the courts changed so that now a much looser standard is required before those third party email providers will provide copies of your letters to a third party interesting well we're running out of time but before we go I actually want to ask you one last question because in that same episode I did with Kathryn back in the day she also just was musing because as e-cash was about to launch at that time and she said oh I wonder you know about the moral implications of creating a private gentle cash that would make it easier for criminals and you know I wonder if the developers think about these things and so earlier in the podcast when you said that you are not seeing activity on the dark markets in Z cash that it seemed like you were saying for that reason you feel pretty good about reasons that people are choosing the private transactions but if you were to find evidence that people were using it for human trafficking child pornography to purchase hitmen or illegal arms how would you feel about having created something that was used to do that it would be disturbing to find out that something I've contributed to is used for Bad ends but when we set out to do this we thought to ourselves if we're going to empower a bunch of humans are they going to use their power more for good or more for evil and I feel very sure it's just my conviction in life that if we empower billions of humans that they will use it much much more for good they will protect each other from poverty and disease they'll support their families they'll do for each other through economic exchange what they have already started doing for each other through the internet the Internet has lifted everything up right it's improved education it's improved government it's improved our ability to stay in touch with remote loved ones it's improved our jobs it's improved our entertainment and amusement and relaxation and I feel a very deep conviction that many humans around the world are in desperate urge indeed of Economic Opportunity and economic freedom that they have been unfairly denied and when we give them that they will use it almost all for good let's hope I am similarly optimistic and believe in the good of people as you so we'll see well it's been so great having you as a guest I've just loved this discussion where can people get in touch with you or see your work where you can definitely go to the Z cache website zca sh great well thanks for coming on the show thank you so much thanks so much for joining us today to learn more
