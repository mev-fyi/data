de carcel co-founder and ceo of blockade games welcome marguerite hey laura thank you for having me so you've had a pretty long history in crypto and there's been a lot of things you've done it's really fascinating tell us that story and you know how you got into this whole space so this story starts a long time ago in 2013 when i was actually really into gaming so i had these amazing gaming gpus and um at the time the person i was with was in the military and they were in uh like network they were a network engineer so they discovered bitcoin around this time and at this time we could still uh use our gpus for mining bitcoin so we made a few rigs we participated in the race for the gpu battle that happened but right on the other side of that was the asics um race for the best asics and setting up those rigs uh so we took our funds backgrounds of building computers and gaming and participated in the mining early days of mining uh which is when script coins really came about like litecoin things like that um and started participating in the culture i guess of the what we call today now crypto twitter and that community um from there though my actual background was fine art so i had been a curator and gallery director for over five years uh prior to mining the cryptocurrencies and so i started to try to think about what is a distributed system um what do we use to centralize of networks how do they work um what is a bitcoin because it was a pretty abstract idea when you're being challenged with what is money and i started following andreas antonopoulos early on i i pulled people on to these different like similar to what we're doing right now onto podcasted shows and just asked them a bunch of questions because as a creative i was really curious about what does it mean that these computers are essentially racing to solve these cryptographic puzzles and when they do one of them unlocks a bitcoin reward and that is money and everybody on the network all the computers agree that that is money and they check it and then they track um so that was fascinating so i started actually um making artworks first portraits of people in this space that i thought were interesting and uh participating for different uh publications like bitcoin magazine and then eventually i found myself starting to encode information into these portraits um first it happened with andreas and tinopoulos i started using zeros and ones and then i realized oh those zeros and ones could mean something so the next one i did was of amir takai and cody wilson which was my very first crypto puzzle um and it was themed dark wallet because it was a project at the time of this idea of using a wallet to mix bitcoin for more um anonymity and when i was making it i realized oh i should definitely hide something because of the theme and when i posted this on bitcointalk i had no idea how viral it was gonna go it became one of the most viral threads on bitcoin talk in 2014. and i was kind of like what did i do uh so um first we had set up a few phases of this what i call a puzzle trail so one step leads to the next step and you uncover pieces as you go and it's it was all across the internet we even hid information on different wiki sites i had to go and convince moderators of these wikis that to let me hide this information there um and and anyways it there were different events along that first trail like such as a minecraft server where all of a sudden these characters from bitcointalk and crypto twitter were coming on board to this minecraft server we were hosting that was a part of this whole puzzle trail it was just my first real experience and deep dive into the crypto community from this creative angle and it blew me away because i was not um i was not really your technical you know cryptographer i'm not going to be contributing to our ecosystem in that way but the playfulness that we unlocked in that first puzzle blew me away and it led to basically six years of that type of work for different projects helping people educate their communities as a tool for community building it's and it also that type of um crypto puzzle work attracts talent dev talent which makes sense if you think about um some of these different processes to uncover talent like i mean you know the cia we joke they put out puzzles cryptographic puzzles and you know people that can crack them are deemed like as maybe suitable for you know it's like as a way to recruit essentially um anyways we i've found so many amazing developers so naturally over these past six years our projects became more ambitious more um just we were pretty much making full-fledged games so it was in 2017 end of 2017 that artists i had been working with artists that were better than myself and faster that i had found along the way and the developers that were brilliant that we decided as uh the cryptocurrency markets you know they started to rise we had that bitcoin bull run one of my most famous pieces was solved had been unsolved for three years had five bitcoin in the prize we are at this place in our in our history um our bitcoin history where we decided it was time to do something more ambitious and more serious so we founded blocking games that is the game company that and we've um you know we've released multiple different projects along the way but um re that journey of how we got to where we are today has been pretty fun and organic um my cto of blockade his name is ben hydorn he he was getting his phd and in computer science and security and i managed to talk him out of it he only had one term left and i was like then you know you don't really need to finish this phd what we're doing is so much cooler and ever since then uh i mean so yeah anyways laura that's that's been the journey here in a nutshell and we can talk more about those different projects under blockade games if you'd like to yeah well so just one thing i wanted to um clarify about the puzzles was it that i once they solved the puzzle then it would give them the private key that would enable them to take the bitcoins locked in it yes that's usually the final step so along the way you might get hints about how to uncover the private key when you get it but it's going to be information that's you know encoded it's been shifted there's a cipher key required i mean there's all these little pieces that you collect along that whole trail that when you get to that final string of information you'll know hopefully how to um uncover it and then for um that one puzzle that was unsolved for three years with the five bitcoins in it how much was it how much money was it worth in us dollars when you put that money in and how much was it worth when the person finally solved it i believe bitcoin was about 120 a bitcoin when i loaded it and then um let's see when it was solved the sum was 50 000 and at the peak of that it was worth a hundred thousand so when it was worth a hundred thousand was when this whole wave of re-interest um came around it and um it was a couple actually the group that solved it they had worked on it pretty much for three months and i knew that it was close to being solved i watched it being like on the bitcoin talk thread they were people are really close but then they just would talk themselves out of it like oh i'm never going to be able to solve this so it's not really close to being solved for a while um but those developers who actually did that they went on to um i don't know if you're familiar with the pineapple fund i am that's the person who at the height of the bubble just decided to give away a roughly 86 million dollars in bitcoin because they had more money than they really knew what to do with exactly yep um an amazing individual and they reached out to me when this puzzle was solved and asked if we would do more work like this if they contributed funds for us so that's when about that time february uh 27 2018 we made pineapple arcade which was uh we have since taken it down but it was since it was all these different arcade games that were crypto themed such as a pac-man but it's actually the bitcoin chasing you know and then we had a monero a coin that would disappear so just we played around with remaking a lot of these old classic games but they had in them uh cryptocurrency prizes so if you played a certain way or you figured out some easter eggs just like the old 80s games a lot of times they had easter eggs uh you would unlock prizes and then um actually the pineapple fun person himself created at his own trail that was an in real life puzzle hint that started from the arcade and then led people running around australia um to win some bitcoin which a lot of people don't know this story but there were people that went to the extent of uh hiring people like people in england hiring people through like almost a craig's ad the version to get people in australia to go run around in national parks in the middle of the night and look for these landmarks it was yeah it's just our space is really wild i love it i love it so one other thing that you did along the way um was plasma bears and so why don't we just kind of fill in a little bit more of the history but and then we'll get to blockade games and neon district yes so plasma bears actually came after pineapple arcade it was um as we were exploring how would we build what we're working on right now which is neon district uh as we were really trying to wrap our heads around what we wanted that to be the user experience and one of the number one things was a free to play blockchain game so that it could be open and inclusive so plasma bears was basically we tried to come up with a a really fast application that we could build web-based application that took some of these bigger picture ideas to just test them out and see what kind of tech stack would be required uh to build the larger version which was neon district so plasma various is essentially a it's like a build-a-bear if you imagine a build-a-bear uh where but it's five separate nfts non-fungible tokens the head is one there's two arms two legs and then the belly we worked with artists in the cr in the crypto space which um back then places like super rare and known origin were still just kind of coming together this was also in 2018 um in the end of 2018 early 2019 but i reached out to these different artists because a lot of them did really neat texture work like um gifs or gifs and we then basically skinned the bear parts with these gifs made by these different artists so we made a huge library of those skins so you could have aesthetically different looking bears there were whole sets but there was this game of trying to complete the set uh to if you wanted to but then you would take these bears on a text adventure and as you played the text adventure uh you would receive like their parts that were had better um better stats so they had a breakout of you know their agility strength things like that uh that's associated with each bear part so you're basically leveling up your bear a piece at a time so that when they would go on these text adventure missions uh that were rated by difficulty according to the different stats yeah so it was neat because the bears also had personalities so if you had mostly sad bear parts your bear all of a sudden would be an animated sad bear on your webpage um so and they were fun to gift so this was all free to play so we had people that were children all the way to like my parents and other people's grandparents able to go to this web game it was on at the time what was called loom network uh which was an ethereum layer 2 uh network which is no longer around anymore but um it allowed players because it was so cheap and we could just take care of everything on the backend we could control you know run the nodes it was somewhat centralized like you wouldn't think of this as a financial network you this was a playful uh exploration so anyways um yeah it was so cool to have people playing and not cost anything and sending bears across social media so you could drop a claim link to a bear on twitter and someone could click it and then to own it all they would have to do is put in basically a username password and that bear would be in their inventory and then we had a gateway where you could send those bears out to ethereum interesting so you know i mean this is like really fun and fascinating it just sounds yeah like like a fun thing that anyone could do but obviously you're using blockchain technology for a reason so what problems exist in gaming that you think blockchain technology can solve so for my own gaming experience um i have multiple times gone through the process of what's called uh grinding which is where you're playing these games and you're trying to get to let's say level 20 and once you do maybe you realize the characters that you were developing along the way aren't the ones you actually wanted this is something you would see in world of warcraft something like world of tanks a lot of open world games and um that's frustrating when you get burned out so players go through something called burnout and i felt like blockchain opened up this opportunity from our experience with crypto puzzles and seeing people feeling incentivized for the treasure hunt that digital treasure hunt experience to unlock something valuable i felt like we were in a place where the actual journey itself could be the process of creating the value and therefore when you leave you're leaving with that value with you so while people would tell me the crypto puzzles they felt like well even though i didn't win at least i learned something you know that's like i guess a positive way to look at it but in this case you could learn something and also have almost memorabilia from it's like having swag from the experience having there's people that have played neopets and there's a game called neopets um and they talk about how i while if i still had my meal pet today that would have such sentimental value to me so these are um basically digital goods and your game assets being digital goods and as a space as a content creator space we are unlocking currently what is possible with um with digital goods and digital durable goods so so there's this time money investment problem that blockchain um games are exploring and then there's also as we're talking about that web 2 content and web 3 ownership and trying to close the gap between the two um what we're finding is we have unlocked basically a like a new type of development ecosystem for uh for creatives essentially so while we have the financial markets and in cryptocurrency for fungible assets being able to have uniquely identifiable dynamic and um and now like even with interactive as we're exploring interactive non-fungible tokens and we're starting to use programs as nfts that the space is evolving so rapidly i guess that this developer playground and content creator playground that we're co-developing together um is fascinating so i think as any content creator could probably speak to the problem of creating something virtual or digital and it not feeling like you could capture you're capturing the value of being able to sell it historically and now we're at a place where artists are just basically flooding into our space because of this new opportunity interesting yeah i totally understand that as a creative myself so why don't we then now talk about your company blockade games what are you doing so we're using the idea of um well i'll speak more specifically to neon district in a second but when i think of the when we think of uh digital goods i think of how they still require some sort of bridge to interact with them um the game is that tool so we're basically creating a platform in which users can take their assets that they own and have a way to interact with them and develop them craft them and bring them into um make them their own essentially and so like the game is that tool to bridge the gap in my mind between the content creation web 2 and the ownership of web3 the uh the blockchain part of the game is is actually just the fact that you own these assets they live on the distributed networks what we wanted to do with that was create neon district which is a cyberpunk role-playing game uh think of a final fantasy vii any final fantasy game really or zelda these games are immersive storytelling very very rich in storytelling about the hero's journey um character development it's a role-playing game from if you think of dungeons and dragons or a lot of board games where you have a dungeon master that sits at the table with you there's an emphasis on story and being immersed um the other part with game with the games though is the art so even like final fantasy rpg really broke the ground as far as um beautiful art and games together so neon district wanted to tie since our community a cryptic community seems to resonate really well with cyberpunk and that sci-fi genre we wanted to make it really rich and beautiful uh in as in if you've ever read snow crash or um neuromancer or like any of these classic sci-fi books it has this gritty edgy uh feel to it it's very colorful so we've spent a lot of time actually developing we have over 10 000 art assets that um you can use and craft cyberpunk characters and you can swap out the different components like i was talking about plasma bears before where it's five different nfts that you compose into the bear it's similar with these uh cyberpunk characters except it's much the um they're much more complex as far as their character class meaning the types of characters they are and their role they play in your gameplay so um so we've unlocked not only that artistic composing part which i'm very passionate about just with my own background but also um the ability for a player versus player and taking these assets that you own showing them off against another player so what we see on december 15th is for the first time after three years of development on this game um you will be able to invite another player to play against your own characters and you're going to be learning how the game mechanics and everything work there's um there's a lot to the actual game mechanics of neon district such as there's card games involved there's your characters attributes but the most exciting part is it has active animation it's active game play which is pretty big there's not very many pvp active uh games in blockchain i can't i don't actually know if there is one at the moment they're usually passive okay yeah this this sounds really interesting um one thing i was wondering is you talked about kind of like certain complex things that you could do and i heard an example that you gave on another show about the dungeons can you walk us through that and how you know that's kind of like a uniquely crypto thing where do you know what i'm referring to which part of the dungeons the um about how you can create these contracts that people have to sign when they start and then well so i'll just say it um you were saying that basically you could design your own dungeon and you could have some kind of stipulation that you know if the other person loses then they have to forfeit all their assets yes so um so in the future i imagine that we could do something oh it's not part of the game now not currently but it is something that's on our minds about how we can as for example um right now you're going to have the pvp roll out and then q1 you're going to have the campaigns which is basically being it's kind of like a dungeon sort in in that way but it's player versus computer so we've set up the story we've set up everything you're going to experience and the drops uh we are basically acting like the dungeon master but beyond that there's opportunity for players to collect uh backgrounds art different components land and pick plots on grounds establish what would be considered a raid so if you're familiar with world of warcraft again any of these open world rpgs set up a raid in which you can create a boss character who could hold the center of your dungeon you can drop monsters you can you can customize and define the experience you could set the rules and then you could place bounties so people could see what prizes they have a chance of winning if they go and explore this dungeon but there could also be stakes placed such as but if you lose you this this is what you're going to lose and it would be something where if you agree to that contract that asset that whatever you've risked would probably go into escrow you would play the game if you lose you would lose that asset in escrow you don't have to do it that way um you can do it so there's much less at stake but um the idea that we can do that is pretty fun and i am someone that loves the idea of permadeath with these game characters so if you tell me that there's an opportunity to go do something high risk with my game characters that i have maybe crafted and spent a lot of time on when i lose one it's going to be devastating but when i win it's going to be amazing and i think this is a like emotionally and you you would have to sign something away that says you know you're not gonna cause trouble if you lose but um but i think the emotional feeling even when i played there's a game called darkest dungeons um and it has characters that's almost similar where you send them a dungeon quest like this and they're emotional so they go crazy and you have to keep them uh you have to keep them as sane and healthy otherwise they start to perform badly in the dungeons and sometimes they even hurt each other or there's all these little things about their uh their psychology but anyways they die and when they die it could have been a character that you've been taking care of for a long time and you have rehabilitated multiple times it's just devastating and i imagine because we haven't done this yet but i imagine it's going to have a similar feeling um so yeah there's a lot of opportunity for players to like i said the game works as this tool layer for us to give you something that becomes an interactive play field and there are some other new behaviors in gaming that i think non-fungible tokens or um cryptoc collectibles are enabling in neon district like i've also heard you talk about farming there how are you using that yes um so the farm like uh farming with there's two different ways that this could happen one is in game where you could while you're actively playing the game you could be accruing uh different cryptocurrencies or different nfts unlocking as a reward for your gameplay um there's also the idea of actually i so recently i launched a token a personal creator token called coin as a way to interact more with my development developer community and my content creator community uh and if you for example were to stake a game character maybe it's a high level game character and you're staking it it could have a chance of having a nice yield on coin or some of these other like uh there's another token called cred which is basically the underground like street cred currency of my community uh that so like there's a lot of playfulness that we can have where you can play because it's not all locked into one application we can take these assets and um yes we have an 1155 and a non-fundable token farm we have 721 farms we really just have knobs and leverage to pull and play with as far as giving gamers new opportunities to um explore what they can do with their assets and so just explain the difference between an erc 721 versus 1155 so 721 is its own like is the contract whereas the 1155 nfts all exist within the contract so they are not uniquely identifiable as the same way as the 721 is they're like consider 1155 a batch oh okay which is like better for developers and a lot of ways for um just resource like resource management okay and you've also been doing some fun things with nft farming and sharding which sort of marries nft with d5 can you explain how that works yes so um there's an exchange called niftex exchange um exchange and what what it's being used for is taking things like high value game assets and high value art assets basically anything that's an nfc that's considered high value and the sharding is basically it gets charted into erc20 so it's a the erc20 becomes a fractionalized representation of the nft what we did was we created a farm where you stake uh you can state coin cred or if we're working with a partner right now it's rng uh which is richard kim from galaxy interactive's community um it's like a gaming focused community anyways they're sticking to right now but we switch that out sometimes anyways you take these tokens and you can stake and what you're yielding then is this erc20 fractionalized representation of the nft and when it's complete then what happens is we turn on um the shotgun clause the shotgun clause means that anyone that now owns one of these shards can make a bid on the entire asset and what will happen is that will price their shards so if you know if i own 10 and i've put up one eighth bid then i'm my assets are uh proportional to that so if someone wants to out they can either buy my shards from me off of me or uh they can counter my bid and we've seen some of that activity but what we found is because of the nature of how involved it is it's what i would call inventory management with uh the height when we were doing a high turnaround of the different farms and the different pieces that we're going to focus more in the future longer farming times with higher value pieces so that it's really something that people want which is i think i love the concepts and they're very cool but we're still really early so right now it's definitely experimental um but yeah it's something to pay attention to because fractionalized ownership of nfts if you think about uh you know this in regards to the mona lisa or something else art like historically then we saw an axi infinity asset um one of the axes started out at a 40 valuation a prior to being started and then the bidding war for that axi went on beyond 140 eth i don't even know what it finally settled that but um pretty wild how how it was it became a whale game essentially well yeah that's what i was wondering about when people can just buy their way into highly skilled players or owning valuable objects or into high levels of play how does that affect the dynamics and the fun of playing the game or how do you kind of like account for that in your game design absolutely so um actually historically there's a open having open economies and games is like it's something that big game companies stay away from because it's so hard to do so it's not if you talk to let's say um fortnite epic games uh tim sweeney the ceo of epic games it's not necessarily because they're not doing blockchain because they don't believe in the technology um it's because it's a very hard difficult thing to do um so yes you like we saw i think it was doom uh three the no dial sorry diablo three had an open economy and it destroyed all the whales bought all the high valued assets and then the game was no fun for anybody uh so it's a auction house um it's something that a lot of people point to when they say this does not work but uh if you take something like magic the gathering for example uh which is a lot of the backbone of neon district inspiration is card game meets rpg so in magic the gathering for example you can have a high value card but if you don't know when to play that card at the right time it doesn't really matter that it's valuable i mean it can be valuable for lots of different reasons for the art for the addition that it was a part of historically that it was owned by a pro player at one point and one in a certain tournament um so there's different there's different reasons why something can be valuable and then the when to play the basically imagine um imagine like a sledgehammer and you know a sledgehammer is gonna be very powerful and decimate your opponent okay but let's say what you actually need is a screwdriver a certain type of screwdriver and you have to use it at a precise moment now that is a lot harder and you have to be smart in thinking ahead and and have the ability to use that asset at the right time that's the difference in uh the different style like these how you design the game it's called the wide game design versus a vertical game design so the vertical the game design is basically a power ladder to become the most powerful whereas the power is distributed in neon district across a wide um it's a wide design okay yeah so i guess even if you could buy some of the fancy players or objects or whatever if you don't use it well then you're just going to have wasted your money because you'll lose it right away yeah well you're just you won't understand how to use it and you won't be able to recognize it's the strategy and the mechanics of the game it's like chess right like um it's like it's basically like chess on steroids is is is this how like strategic the game is okay all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about how block games can use blockchain technology and also turn to more on how all this can affect creators but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on btc and more than 20 other coins once in the app you can apply for the crypto.com metal card which pays you up to

money and time on swaps one inch is capable of finding the best possible trading paths and splitting them among multiple market depths recently the one-inch team unveiled one-inch version two the main highlights of v2 are pathfinder an api that contains a new discovery and routing algorithm and a new intuitive user-friendly ui the v2 improvements ensure the best rates on swaps while dramatically cutting response time back to my conversation with market decor sell so one other thing that i've heard you mentioned about how blockchain technology could be used in video games is for um big decentralized profiles what does that mean in gaming like why would a decentralized profile be so powerful so this is something that actual game companies are really interested in um i know firsthand that for example epic games has slots uh that they're they basically have slots for different user identities that they're placeholding right now um and so this distributed network of decentralized identities taking that off of the game companies as far as being in charge or like being responsible for user identity is a big deal it means that we can allow players to opt in to things they want to be targeted for that's outside of the game company and the game companies can pay attention to that information that users are sharing and so um so for privacy uh reasons this is allows us to interact better with our users that want us to interact with them so if i am a certain type of uh gamer i'm playing these games i'm sharing this information i'm a social influencer i can select that i'm a social influencer i can put in and like valid verify across my different social influencing accounts um the game companies can see that see this information they can see what i like to do what i what i'm playing with uh with blockchain assets i if i'm sharing that information you can see what types of assets they have game companies can target you as a user and give you uh other opportunities that uh almost as gifts one it allows us to find our users better or different types of users better the yeah so those are the different reasons why decentralized identities are exciting um and profiles are exciting and so are you trying to angle neon district or or any game that you create through blockade games toward crypto people or are you trying to draw in regular gamers who would then have to be introduced to some of these new blockchain-enabled concepts like nfts and farming and and if so then how do you introduce those concepts to them so originally the vision was to just drop a game to the mainstream market and let them uncover that it was a blockchain game but um what we've since actually decided to do since we developed such a core crypto uh community is we are going to use that audience first and foremost um as we basically iterate on top so instead of waiting for the entire game to be done with all the features uh which would be needed for a public release for mainstream gamers you would need to have all their normal things they would expect in a game with the cryptocurrency uh gaming community we can actually release earlier so we're releasing early and we're going to be adding those features as we go but off of what our users want so the goal is to still end with a game that the mainstream user doesn't doesn't need to unders like realize that it's a blockchain game but we're going to go ahead and start with our cryptocurrency community that we've already cultivated but for just a regular gamer do you feel like there will be a learning curve for them like oh now i can sell this you know valuable sword that i earned or do you know what i mean like or do you think it'll just be pretty natural and easy for them to get those concepts i think it's going there's gonna going for right now for this next year at least there is going to definitely be a learning curve um it's gonna there's gonna be all this whole you we need to have the magical moment that happens for users to be like that might if you can think back to the first time you sent a bitcoin right to somebody else and it actually you p maybe you actually paid for something with it a long time ago and you're like what did i just do we need that same experience for the gamers and these and the with this content so um being able to have this sword and sell it and now you have your first cryptocurrency and maybe you actually didn't spend any money to get it maybe it was literally just your skill set that allowed you to cultivate and craft this piece um it maybe it's a sword and you go and you sell it then so in the district we can cover your back-end transactions so we can get you to the ethereum net since we're on a layer two solution at the moment without you actually um having to have cryptocurrency but maybe you have to spend you know cover something for the transaction it can also be your in-game currency that you um have just accumulated along the way so you make this transfer to ethereum and now uh that marketplace will prompt you to have your metamask wallet or whatever wallet you'd like so that whole onboarding marketplace process uh at least for this year one year two uh we would love to have our own marketplace enabled and people to just trade directly from the application itself but regardless my point is the magic moment of being able to trade that asset that maybe you never put any money into other than your gaming skill and your time and get your first cryptocurrency and if that's the way you get your first cryptocurrency i think that's going to be such a hook for people to understand these economies we're creating well so you mentioned that you're on a layer two network for ethereum and that was something i was gonna ask you because obviously one of the biggest problems in crypto sort of generally but especially in ethereum right now is uh and in particular for you know these smart contract type transactions is the scaling issue you know bumping up against the throughput on some of these chains so what blockchain are you using and um is it something where if your game takes off even as much as crypto codies probably could have done it you know because it was limited by ethereum it didn't really grow as much as people thought but um but if it were to take off as much as cryptic kidneys might have then will your blockchain that you're currently on being be able to handle that so it's a we i was actually just talking to ben on blockade cto this morning and exploring about like okay so what if we hit a million users uh million daily users like what would it look like and you're still going to have scaling problems this is not like a magic solution it's though it's optimized so that's 7 000 transactions per second uh from for the matic network which is uh what we've landed on and it's also um there's still the opportunity though with i as i'm sure you've been following with ethereum two uh with optimistic roll-ups and how successful those are so if we hit a place where we start to bottleneck because of transaction scalability we can um we can explore doing something like a roll-up as well um but i really don't think that's going to happen in the immediate future um so with the 7 000 transactions per second that we'll have on matic we have the ability to have a pretty robust uh vibrant game with awesome users and why did you select matic you said also that it was very easy to connect to ethereum so how does that work yes so we have um both matic has their gateways we have gateways to ethereum there it's it's very cheap it's like something like one ten thousandth uh the cost of making a transaction on matic then it is ethereum um it's it's the they match their addresses so your ethereum and matic address are um are the same and it's also um it's it's 100 evm compatible so if you're an ethereum developer and you wanted to build on ethereum and you feel like you're somehow being bottlenecked because of the theory more it's too expensive and or the user experience isn't what you really wanted it to be matic was a solution for us to get all those things we wanted and still have um all the benefits of ethereum essentially so um it it works right now as a layer two which is i guess in my mind it's probably the most successful layer to uh currently and how does um you know having these different blockchain technologies in the game affect the business model of blockade games as opposed to a traditional gaming company so we can have um we can take cuts from the secondary sales across as these assets trade over time um there is you know the question of yes we're not a walled garden where we're going to be reaping the benefits of the rewards of all the sales um but that's also like we were talking about the new content the this new developer ecosystem where when you build very robust communities that are rich and so in our case it's going to be rich and story art and and also just the experience what happens is developers come and build supporting uh basically experiences to for these assets and they do this because there's one a lot of these indie game developers are very highly experimental and they're not doing it necessarily for the money they're doing it just to see what happens and because it's fun and here's a community they can interact with that's established and maybe they really resonate with the genre um so the the open um that open eco developer ecosystem that this unlocks is something that hasn't really been explored yet you can look at examples like minecraft and other uh other games that have developer ecosystems but in this way like if let's say i'm a developer and i i have collected a whole bunch of a certain type of asset i can build an experience around that so now all of a sudden those assets are more valuable we saw that with cryptokitties where they took a certain type of cat some developers took a certain type of cat they bought a whole bunch of them and they created a game a racing cat game just for those cats and so then the dapper labs team was like what just happened why are these guys so expensive and and so like that's there's just a lot of opportunity for people when they own these assets to explore new business models themselves we the business models that are spinning up all over the place around content um from just being an artist so things that don't even have utility at all just from brand recognition and content creator recognition assets are selling i mean i don't know if you've been paying attention to people like people people like people uh people he's a he's a pretty famous artist um his work is selling like crazy he was a he's a traditional concept artist um definitely worth checking him out there's the uh musician the indie uh musician rac and he he's he's teamed up with um other so since he's doing the audio he's teamed up with other content creators like the visual side and they're selling these nfts that once again they don't have utility they're just collectibles um so when you think of game assets as actually being something with utility that are playful like i would like to argue that i think it's going to be a stronger and more uh defensible ecosystem at large than what people anticipate and so this isn't like super germane to the crypto audience but i am so curious do you think that traditional gaming companies will be disrupted by this technology or do you think that they are just going to end up taking advantage of it and incorporating it into their existing games i think that users are going to really enjoy the idea of asset ownership and when they start to realize they can have business models themselves around games that they interact with so if i'm a twitch streamer and people are dropping me ass game assets that now i own um and my audience is also participating and i'm getting i'm being gifted assets to give to my audience uh my streaming audience and um as i interact with these these assets they become more valuable so now people are buying them from me at a much like for a much higher price just because i played with them and they're my fans um that whole business is going to be something hard to pull people away from especially as we see this i mean streamers and content creators are really taking off all on its own so you add that additional web3 ownership component to it and um it's gonna be is i think we're just going to have so many fun creative indie developers coming over and collaborating with these content creators that game companies will have to come up with some sort of strategy um and it might not be blockchain and but it might be something that feels or looks like blockchain some sort of user experience that mimics it um to keep people interested in staying over where they are but yeah when people are making money and and becoming more successful for doing exactly what they already were doing already yeah that's why i see the blockchain space really taking off yeah it's something that i'm really excited about and you're actually already taking advantage of this a little bit um you know you're an artist or more generally a creative person and that's a group of entrepreneurs that traditionally have gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to traditional content distribution models so what problems in content creation business models do you think blockchain technology could solve and how are you already kind of trying to do that with your social token coin yes um right so actually that like like you were talking about um when i first got into this space as an artist um man i was shipping artwork around the world paying for shipping it uh competing to get into these galleries which would then take fifty percent of the cut of my art um i was not enough for it to be a viable like livelihood where i can support myself as we're seeing artists come into our space and support themselves and granted it's going to i'm sure get harder to be seen or recognized as it becomes more populated but the fact that we have the tools and people to capture the value of direct sales like this to consumers right across the internet um using the blockchain like and these assets and asset ownership that to me was it's so powerful and we're just unlocking like we're just seeing these artists and the artist markets really take off that it was funny to me because i feel like this was something that was apparent a few years ago but somehow the wider cryptocurrency and ethereum communities just they almost had like binders on to it but now it's actually becoming mainstream popular um and cool so there's a coolness factor that's happening too um but so anyways the uh social token uh or the creator token with coin as i've built a fan base since the beginning with doing the crypto puzzles and you know i i tend to people call me a people collector because i find talent and i pull them in and i keep them close and so i have a lot of artists a lot of developers that i i think are awesome and from there they bring in others that we all think are awesome so because it's like big family essentially and we called uh so my token coin is actually a part of what we call coins eden and it's a syndicate within neon district so i have declared myself the boss of the syndicate um and i established the token economics so that i was the boss and i'm the largest holder of the token and i get the i get to say what happens at the end of the day but and then there's this whole hierarchy of um of the syndicate and you can work your way up through like having more coin um to have different roles in those roles we will apply different functions as neon district evolves the game but the idea is that we potentially will have multiple syndicates and people could come in and stake a syndicate and with um there's something called collab dot land which interacts with discord so it reads the ask the tokens that are in my wallet my coin or it could read any of the tokens i have but in this case in my discord it's coin and people are automated into these different roles that are private so no they're not accessible to anyone that's not basically a part of the syndicate um this is where this is the community i go to when i'm doing something crazy like i want to start a new farm and these are the mechanics i'm thinking of i just you know very rawly drop those ideas to these folks and we brainstorm um we all decide what makes sense doesn't make sense for our community at large and from there i'm actually able to take coin and um for developers like there's this project called beyond nft which is a is a project focusing on developing interactive nfts which i'm really excited about so we will support that development with coin the idea is that as we just target where our funding goes we bring that value directly back into the community by interacting and playing with it so for example we just made um on the side of neon district development um i always got really into chess i've always loved chess but with the queen's gambit happened and it clicked to me that this is a perfect game for our eco for the ethereum ecosystem to play with um if as far as being able to make chess pieces defining since now um nft support uh web files 3d objects so we make these 3d objects we set basically what was needed for the specifications of those chess pieces for for an artist then we also set the specific specifications what would be needed for a chess web game we'll put bounties on that game development um we are actively developing chess pieces other people now are sending me messages of the chess pieces they're developing and this idea that we can have chess wars with different assets um from boards that could also be nfts environments that could be nfts different types and variations of chess games um anyways going on a tangent here but talking about i guess cultivating interesting activities that where developers can shine content creators can shine artists can make now basically these 3d sculptures and you know paint them texturize them however they like and it has immediate utility so i was talking about before how you know all this high-end value art is selling but there's no utility but when we make things that are universally have utility it adds this playfulness that allows us all to interact with each other which anybody in the space knows that we are obsessed with our community um like a cross crypt to twitter even just the developer space content creator space we are very social um so bridging that social into some sort of fun game play is gonna be really neat um anyways laura i don't want to keep rambling well one thing i that wasn't clear to me so when people buy these different 3d chess pieces and stuff then where do they use them is it just like a specific blockchain chess game that they can use them in or can they take them like yeah how does that work so any so basically any developer that supports the files um the objects and designs a game a version of the game all of them are supported and these variate like various games so um yeah there's a lot of we put bounties for that development we have i know two groups that are actively developing games currently and how they monetize it that can go a few different ways they can issue their own chess pieces as part of it or they can also like maybe take a fee for when two people decide to go pvp okay and so just to go back to coin um what is it that people do with coin and you know how do they earn it or how did you release it or and you did talk a little bit earlier about how that's then connected to yet another coin called cred but if you could just go over again like what the difference is between the two and how people are in these so the reason i launched coin was actually earlier this year when covid hit we had been fundraising for about six months and it became apparent that it was going to become a different landscape for fundraising for a while and we didn't know how long um so actually blockade really we got lean and we started bootstrapping uh from that point forward to get to actually where we are right now with our launch date but in the meantime we decided okay we need to really lean on our developer friends our community our fans to help us get over the finish line so launching coin was a way to bridge again um after so i had i guess previously been straight out of the community my projects had always been just collaborated with with the community side by side when wash blockade it became this separation and i felt it and actually didn't like it for um you know two and a half years just almost like this wall of i can't really interact with my people anymore in the same way because now it's it's there's just this weird dynamic about well i'm not hired for blockade i'm not like there's a different conversation um so coin allowed allowed me as a as my individual self not being under blockade to reconnect with uh my user base and i what i did was i fraction i myself uh what i said was so you have to you have to roll with the story because it is just basically abstract but i mentioned an nft a representation of basically my brand identity um and then fractionalized it so started it into erc20s so from there we distributed to everyone that was a long time holder of um so a trophy holder which is people that have historically solved my puzzles across the years they had something that's called a trophy um to a a key a founder's key and the odd district founders key so we just had some distribution uh in that regards and then i sold crypto puzzles um i made a series of crypto puzzles that you had to own the crypto puzzle in order to have access to the experience and to solve it uh and then it had a pretty large bounty of coin associated with it from those sales i actually took the ethereum and i seeded the ethereum and coin pair on uniswap so and we started out low it was actually 10 cents a coin when we launched the market at that price and then the market naturally just went up to 30 cents a coin and from there it has fluctuated quite a bit but um but the the whole i guess the exciting part about that is it's now allowing the success of everything we're doing what the community does what i do if um blockade will accept coin it becomes this like ecosystem where everybody can share a little bit more directly in the success of things we're involved in and when we add when we decide to um basically incubate different projects and they want to stay a part of the ecosystem that value comes back to us so with the cyberpunk genre intersection that i sit at with neon district uh in this past year with coin i've actually been connecting with a lot of cyberpunk type content creators both audio like in music styles that are associated like synthwave different art styles like that and we've actually made now a more robust cyberpunk community of these types of content creators which who have accepted coin who now want to work for coin and also just uh have found different people i guess that we resonate closely more closely together as content creators what all of this i see is a major win for as we're rolling out neon district because the idea of neon district is to have a very rich developer and content creator community around it so that we can explore all these and keep playing and being experimental about what is possible with nfts and you also have something called coin artist liquidity mining which um translates to calm what is that and how how does that work so in order to keep our um basically so there's enough liquidity for us to basically sell if we need to some coin to pay for development for other you know for whatever products we want to support we are allowing people that want to support the community and efforts um basically they become a liquidity provider by providing ethereum and coin to the unesco oh it's the pair and then they receive what's called the liquidity provider token that's proof that they did this they bring this over to um coinard io dot io where we have the um liquidity mining um initiative so you stake that token and then what you're earning back is a percentage over time of coin and also a bonus token called cred so cred is this currency that basically is proof that you have contributed to the viability of the coin ecosystem and what we do with cred is across our different um stores such as the chess store such as neon district assets basically cred provide cred holders can just place an offer in cred and we generally will just accept it um you will also have limited opportunities with cred so for example there's some there's an asset called uh the death knight that is one of the most prized uh set possessions in neon district as far as his outf the cyberpunk outfit for this character and um there's a blade that's coming out the death knight blade so there's a few people myself included has worked really hard to get the complete that set um there's not very many of them there's only 25 there's gonna be 25 of these blades and we're talking about allowing there to be an auction using cred as the way in which you can so one will be like the loot box option to get which is a random chance of getting this blade but then also an opportunity for cred holders to have the opportunity to make bids on the blade and the only reason you would have cred it's not listed anywhere the only way you could get it is from being an ecosystem you know someone that has helped the ecosystem through the liquidity mining and yeah so there's a lot of ways with the game both the game company um through other exploratory projects we do that we can really i guess honor the credit holders and not only that but credit holders are actually bartering cred with each other now with assets which is pretty cool so it has like when i referenced before it becoming like the underground currency it it is like the next level cool currency like if your credit holder it's almost like you know you're one of us i love it i love it the in group um so i was so curious i mean you kind of talked about yeah just like your role as you know a creator of the games but then also your individual um persona or or just your individual relationships frankly in the crypto community and i wondered so when you switched from doing the games to offering this token what was the reaction to that when i split you mean like alongside doing the game not switched yeah but like you know when you introduce this new social token what was the reaction to that um a lot of people were excited well so i was exploring with the whole social influencer space in general because i personally don't really want to be a social that's a lot of work to be a social emphasis and i don't really want anyone but what i see is that there's such an opportunity for new businesses there um business models around having a creator took a social token and being a social influencer so i actually um the the reaction was excitement really i would say that i had a lot of positive reaction i think uh if anything i get in trouble sometimes when i push things too far like you know i'll i if there's a red button i'm probably gonna push it sometimes and there's a case of uh people just getting really grumpy on on crypto twitter about girls taking selfies and then tokenizing them or taking pictures of themselves i just thought it was silly so anyways i just i had fun and did my natural trolling with that where i would still like i would make it and still sell it and um and there's a fine line there that there's a lot to be discussed in that area but social influence and what it should be like seen as and how it should be marketed um you know that that's a space that would be explored but anyways so the social influencer piece though i've taken that idea next level where taking it off of me so much as being at the center and looking at people like um alex botez who actually is co-owner of the chess store get pwned which is uh what we launched this is what we're um basically where we're minting these chess pieces from on open c she is she's a very accomplished chess player yes she's very and she's incredibly talented both at chess and actually also in engaging and entertaining um she has a dynamic with her sister they're both influencers uh her sisters they're both gamers and then they also do these intense chess matches and she's a great educator so what people don't understand what's a lot of these um social influencers is that they are like educators entertainers like just all these things all at once um her being able to give these chest pieces to her audience as a gift um us figuring out how do we do that how do we bridge this gap with people that may not have a metamask wallet so we're exploring those ideas but also when she can actually play against other people with these 3d objects when we have the games developed and we can do giveaways afterwards with these pieces that we're played with we're going to be starting to really explore some of the ideas i'm very excited about and i think is the future um and it's i just i love that i was given this opportunity to work with her i actually um i it was funny because i was a fan of hers and then i found out that um alex patella who's the cto of openc and her went to school together at stanford so we were able to close that gap really fast as far as like um let's do this crazy idea and just i couldn't be more happy that she's been willing to explore it with us great all right well this has been super fun where can people learn more about you blockade games neon district coin calm cred and anything else you're working on yes so um things that are related to coin are you know coin artist dot io is the site that has a sidebar that has information there my twitter coin underscore artist is probably where i'm most active uh the neon district account is neon district rpg that's the twitter account in the bio there there's the link to the discord the discord is where we do all of our community interactions and that's where coins eden lives as well so if you ever become a coin holder you'll have access then to the private syndicate as long as you have five coin um yeah that's i think that's pretty much it and the game is coming out uh the first phase of the game is december 15th and that will be targeted the first pass will be for trophy holders and got key holders and from there we will uh keep releasing invitations to folks that want to comply perfect that is the day that this show comes out so um yeah i think people will be excited to play all right well thanks so much for coming on unchained thank you so much laura thanks so much for
