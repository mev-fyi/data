because will and i are talking first thing friday morning the morning after the auction for the constitution so will constitution doubt did not win the copy of the us constitution as it had set out to do tell us how you and the other dow members feel about how things went down last night it was definitely disappointed not win especially when we'd exceeded our target by so much and that still wasn't enough at the same time we had one of the fastest and largest crowdfunds in history and a significant number of contributors were first-time wallet addresses who were contributing to this crowdfund and using ethereum for the first time so my own takeaway is we've onboarded an incredible number of people to web3 there were 17 000 people who came together to unify under this one idea well we won't be stewarding the constitution for the long term um the fact that everyone wanted to and helped gave us a very very competitive bid where we were only one of two bidders remaining after a fundraise when i heard in the beginning that they were going to be five to seven serious bidders says a lot do you think the fact that the amount that you raised was publicly known affected the outcome i don't think so because there were rumblings of more serious bidders than the serious bidder who actually emerged so i think a lot of people who saw the public amount knew that it was outside of our price range and outside of their price range because they knew how much we had raised and as a result dropped out i don't think that the other bidder was affected by a public amount they seemed very willing to continue to go higher so it was something where i think there's not anything we could have done differently within the constraints that we had for example we were not able to continue fundraising because there was very strict cutoff time for providing the funds i think that uh within the constraints we had uh there's yeah nothing nothing i would have changed and do you know who the other bidder was we don't know so yeah we had the opportunity to bring the constitutional hands to the people i hope that it was a museum or other person who plans to display the public but we knew that some museums were more interested in working with us than going through the bid process once they knew that we were involved so something tells me that it's less likely to be a museum given that museums were approaching us about the partnership instead of bidding directly oh tell us more about that you know how did they reach out to you and why were they interested displaying a copy that you would obtain rather than obtaining it themselves yeah so i think that what they saw was that the values of constitution dow were very aligned with their values so many of the museums and libraries we talked with they had strong values around public access and participation and they wanted to learn from us about dao's they were amazed by how much we raised i've talked with people who are the directors of prominent museums and libraries who said that we raised in a week what it normally takes them half a year to raise and not only was the fundraising aspect something that they wanted to learn from but also the fact that this was an incredible participatory movement was something they wanted to learn from as well because museums in particular are still very consumption-oriented experiences you can look at the art but there's not much of a way to engage with it in a hands-on aspect and constitution dao gave people a very hands-on route to engaging with it and that's something that excited people a lot yeah i retweeted a tweet thread by will lobkowitz who uh did that event nf castle in prague last month or or two months ago i forgot when that was uh they turned to nfts to try to raise funds to preserve uh some cultural artifacts in the czech republic that his family owned because his family was the former royal family um his i believe it was grandfather a great grandfather abdicated the throne because he believed in democracy but the family has like four castles and tens of thousands of cultural objects that they do not have the money to help preserve and maintain and so they turn to nfts to do that so you know he wrote a thread kind of talking about how he felt like constitution doubt was kind of in the vein of what they were trying to do and solved a lot of problems that museums and other types of institutions faced so tell us a little bit more about your night like where were you for the auction why did people not know which bitter represented constitution dow i don't know if you saw the tweets about like is it brooke or david and then how did you all find out that you hadn't won because i'm sure you're aware that there were um various outlets that did uh report that you had one and then later it was revealed that you hadn't so there was a lot of confusion so yeah tell us a little bit more about your night yeah so we were at a live stream party near sotheby's but not at celebi's and it was about 30 of us who had all been working on this with no sleep for the past week who were together and there was a lot of adrenaline it was it it was definitely excitement it was definitely also nervousness it was definitely also uncertainty and we all waited around for the bid when the bid came on the room alternated between completely dead silent and tons and tons of cheering when we took the bid due to the policies in place we were not with auction houses that i believe is standard for them we were not able to reveal which bitter we were at the time we had to wait until it was officially announced by celebi's so that was something where i'd say that was the biggest gap in community participation for us where because we were not able to reveal who we were until it was officially announced there was this moment where the community didn't have as much information as we would have liked to be able to share the interesting part is that a number of people guessed that we were david because we would bid very weird very quickly um we knew what our max was um so the fact that we would very quickly did whenever whenever whenever it was needed was something that helped people guess that it was david but yeah we we definitely would have liked to um reveal that and yeah it unfortunately was not something we were able to do i i don't really know where the where that we won articles came from no one no one no one at the livestream event was consulted on it none of us had any outreach about it and i think that might have just come from rumors including discord it might have come from twitter spaces that did not have particular information about the project but thankfully we were able to put out a statement just a few minutes after those articles went live that corrected that which was um helpful for clearing up the confusion so it definitely was uh there definitely was a 30 minute period between the bid and some of the articles saying we weren't going live where i think there was a lot of confusion um and we would have liked to clear that up we had to wait until sotheby's officially announced the auction um results before we were able to clear that up but then i think we cleared it up pretty quickly and then now what uh now everyone's talking about uh the uh high gas fees on l1 ethereum so um yeah it's a new challenge to solve yeah we will actually cover that in a moment um but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 million people using crypto.com the easiest

yeah so once the results were known um we mostly commiserated um we were very hopeful and given how much we had raised and how much past the estimate we were we thought that we had a very good shot at winning and i'd say all of us going into that night thought we had probably about a 70 to 80 chance of winning and then coming out of that night we knew the results so yeah we mostly commiserated we put up the statement and then i helped them move the funds back from uh ftx us to the multisig and then we at that point were ready to start thinking about the refund distribution plans um there's built-in refund functionality into juicebox the fundraiser importantly used which was why we selected it but the gas fees are still quite high so some people are talking about l1 uh refunds some people are talking about l2 refunds so we'll see what direction that goes and so before we address that just quickly um to explain for people the dow raised 47 million dollars but your bidder did not bid higher than the final bit of 41 million so why was that uh yes so the bid price does not include sotheby's fees nor does it include taxes and sotheby's also requires a buffer to make sure that you can pay so between the fees the taxes and the buffer that all was a few million dollars so not only did we go as high as we could we we had a max that we all agreed would be a really really comfortable margin and then we had a max of if we're getting up bid we can go here and we'll be a little tight on funds afterwards but we can we want to try to do this with the community so we went up to that very max where we would have needed to raise more funds to steward the constitution comfortably but it was something that we wanted to do for everyone involved so we uh we we bid not only as high as we could but even a bit a bit beyond what we had planned in an attempt to win it but the total that we could bid was uh the hammer price was pre-taxes and fees and i have to admit i i don't remember if i saw this on twitter i i have a feeling it was actually one of my sources who uh texted me but i saw this sentiment somewhere you know why didn't you just have some whales on hand to to kind of cover you know any any amount that you you know had not previously raised and i'm not sure if i said oh maybe that's just against the values of the dow but i'm just sort of curious why you didn't have something like that in place yeah yeah the proof of funds cut off was very strict it was at 30 pm so they would have needed to transfer it to our account in advance and yeah there was no ability to to backstop the bid with whales specifically unfortunately the only way to backstop the bid would have been to be able to um have another interested bidder backstop it um that's one structure um that's sometimes used where someone who wants to buy it but is open to giving it to a cultural institution is willing to backstop a bid um so they'll basically say if you're the winner i'll i'll let you have it if uh you get outbid i'll take it instead and that would have been the only option um but since we were outbid it's a bit of a the backstop wouldn't have made um that much of a difference okay so now let's talk about the gas fee issue how are you guys expecting to handle that issue for the refund yeah yeah i mean i think the median contribution was 200 or 250 dollars so 100 in gas between depositing and getting the refund is significant i don't think that there are perfect options because one is to use a refund functionality built into juicebox that's good they their contracts are pretty optimized but you're still looking at 40 to 50 in gas to refund then the other option is to refund on an l2 so instead of having people claim we just distribute out automatically for them that tradeoff trades off an easier refund experience with a harder user experience given that so many contributors were first-time users of ethereum l2s will be i think difficult to use which l2 we would deploy to would be its own can of worms um because it is a big onboarding moment of 17 000 people onto any particular l2 i think this is a good opportunity for governance i think that letting governance holders decide do they want l1 or do they want l2 is malleable that being said i think that the people who actively participate in governance are likely a more crypto native group than the overall segment of contributors so i think that governance is the best option after navigating it represents the interests of every single contributor because a lot of contributors who are first time might not be feel informed enough to make this kind of choice and might not vote in this kind of proposal um okay so um but are you leaning toward using a governance model to figure it out or or right now it just sounds like maybe there's no consensus you're just weighing the pros and cons so the plan we went into was with the plan we went in with was using juice box refund mechanism i think now we have a flood of different proposals and it's also an opportunity to onboard people onto l2s which would be nice and positive some for everyone that being said someone still needs to write the refund mechanism so someone's filling to implement we do have a refund mechanism already implemented and there are people who likely want their funds back sooner so allowing them to refund via what's already built and what's already been tested in production um juicebox has worked with shockdown which is a doubt for the for acquiring nouns within the nouns project and variety of experiences and refund mechanisms so something that's already been tested in production when you're handling 50 million dollars is a very good thing and yeah i think that simpler is always better in these cases just for security okay yeah so so we'll see so you know we've been talking about kind of the outcome of everything but for listeners who maybe are unfamiliar even with the backstory let's just talk about how constitution doubt came to be how did this idea to form a doubt to attempt to buy this document even come about yeah so a few separate people had the idea at the same time i was not in the very first day i i joined right after they reached out to me for help with um with with compliance and getting through sotheby's kyc setting up corporate entity and such uh so the very first days were a group chat where people a bunch of people simultaneously saw the auction and thought can we do this is this possible it seemed like one of those absolutely absurd crazy ideas that could never happen and then a giant twitter dm group formed and then that's when i joined up to help them with compliance and then after that point we kept going and it grew into a discord and then uh the discord started gaining 200 people every hour and we knew that there was definitely some interest and then it uh and then we put up the fundraising site on sunday and then it just absolutely took off and i think that the major media coverage we got not only was it very positive for uh web3 helping people understand that crypto can coordinate things in this non-speculative way where people care about stewarding this historical artifact it also in addition it created this just like grand swell of enthusiasm this rallying point that people could engage with and that really got to the participatory ideals that we that we have for the project so i'd say that the way the project was built executed and even the now we're thinking about refund mechanisms in a participatory way i'd say that even though even though we're not still reading the constitution right now and deciding how it should be displayed and where to go and having a vote on which museum or library should exhibit at first we still have shown everyone the power of web3 to coordinate for these causes we've shown that there's a lot of things that web3 can do that would be impossible in traditional institutions like raising 45 million dollars in i think the final total when it transferred back to the multi-stick was 50 like raising 50 million dollars in under a week is uh is something that i think has a lot of people take notice of the coordination power of crypto and web3 and uh where do you think dallas will go next yeah i think that this is a watershed moment for dows because i think this is really the first dow with massive participation and i'm really honored to have been a part of it too and to have helped them um with compliance and to continue to help them set up the syndicate so the advice we always give people at syndicate is that the best daos have a really clear way to contribute this is what we say constantly we point to really great examples and constitution dao i think is the primary example of this where the way to contribute was very very straightforward and well known to everyone involved you can contribute money if you want to the fundraise you can help share the fundraising social media you can add the scroll scroll emoji to your to your to your twitter bio um which people were using as a way to signal their part of constitution dao and you can also join the contributor team and help out on engineering design compliance writing community management and i think that this proves a lot of the best elements of dows where everyone knew how to contribute ever and knew what to contribute and delegation was really really good there weren't too many moments of overlap but it was something that ran uh very smoothly throughout and another week we got from a twitter dm to be placing an extremely competitive bid at sotheby's through a non-profit via endowment that's really really incredible progress in a week and absolutely unheard of and it would have taken in any web 2 world far far far longer to do something like this i don't think you'd even have a bank account by that point let alone raised 50 million dollars so it's something that i think is a really watershed moment for daos and dow coordination and i think also it's a story of doubt about collaboration one reason why i worked so smoothly was because juicebox provided the fundraising portal i uh helped with compliance based a lot of my experiences at syndicate endowment provided the non-profit framework and then there were a ton of supporting organizations as well fdx us was a lifesaver in the crypto fiat conversions the mira team is really helpful in thinking about refunds and something uh like this only really worked so well because everyone was able to play their part either through the taos that they were a part of slash like in personal capacities or just the incredible organizing work by julian and alice and other people who had who had uh who had really taken on the mantle of a lot of these community components all right well i think it's historic one other thing i will say is that so i just finished narrating my audiobook and it so the book kind of covers what you could say was the the last crypto bubble um the one you know that peaked at the end of 2017 early 2018 and so in the lead up to that obviously was the original dao and it's just fascinating to me um because having freshly narrated this and gone through the story myself the original tao actually did get participation from a similar number number of people like they estimate kind of between fifteen thousand and twenty thousand but the tools at that time were just completely undeveloped and so there were so many points when they would have wanted the community to do certain things and they just couldn't get that to happen because there were just no tools available and it was a similar situation where a lot of people brand new to ethereum were had participated and so again like they just kind of didn't even really have the knowledge so um it's just fascinating to me because seeing this this clearly shows how much the space has matured in uh i guess what's like five and a half years so um anyway yeah it's it'll be fun to see where things go next but congratulations on making history even if the outcome wasn't what you wanted and um yeah we'll have to see where all this goes thank you so much yeah this is a fantastic conversation i remember putting a 70th into the original dao in 2016 back when that was not much money and um i kept on hoping for a moment like that again and uh this this this feels very much in the spirit of it it's the uh it's the 2021 version of the dao as a moment from community absolutely yeah yeah and it's it was much more effective so okay well this has been super fun thank you for waking up so early to do this interview and thanks again for coming on unconfirmed thanks so much don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week

709 632 bitcoin's taproot upgrade was activated marking the first major protocol upgrade to bitcoin in over four years with taproot bitcoin transactions should be more flexible secure and efficient taproo implements three bitcoin improvement proposals or bips simultaneously bip 340 introduces schnorr signatures a new type of digital signature that is faster more secure and less data intensive than ecdsa the previous cryptographic method bip 341 essentially compresses data from complex bitcoin transactions reducing fees minimizing memory usage and improving bitcoin scalability bit 342 tap script allowing for more flexible future upgrades put together taproot is a package of upgrades that increases network efficiency lowers the cost of lightning network transactions allows for smart contract functionality and improves user privacy as described by coin shares and by chain analysis in two reports that i highly recommend taproot was initially approved in june when it reached a 90 consensus among miners as bitcoin is open source and decentralized taproot is a voluntary upgrade meaning that not all miners are required to adopt the new technology as a writing 54 percent of bitcoin nodes are running taproot according to chain analysis getting even fifty percent of miners to accept taproot so quickly should be considered a win bitcoin's last upgrade segwit was only used by roughly 50 of transactions two years after it passed as of now four years later that proportion is 80 percent president biden signed the infrastructure bill now what on monday president joe biden signed the infrastructure investment jobs act into law the bill contains provisions that will require crypto exchanges dubbed crypto brokers by the act to report certain transactions to the internal revenue service under the current language brokers must report to the irs any proceeds from digital asset trading the tax basis for digital assets the transfer of digital assets to another exchange and transfers from exchanges to self-custodied wallets in addition all businesses not just crypto exchanges must report the receipt of more than ten thousand dollars of digital assets in a transaction the reporting will go into effect in 13 months at the beginning of 2023. in response to the bill lawmakers are working to change the language regarding brokers senators ron wyden and cynthia lemis introduced a bill that would limit the broker definition to exclude miners and stakers as well as wallet providers and developers senator ted cruz took it a step further by introducing a bill that would strike from the record the crypto provision expanding the definition of a crypto broker so it would be as if such section had never been enacted on thursday a bipartisan group of nine members from the us house of representatives introduced the keep innovation in america act the bill seeks to modify the definition of crypto broker and the provision regarding tax code 6050i board ape yacht

winners will go live simultaneously on december 17th users don't always like the answer to when token keraswap a dux aggregator announced a retroactive airdrop of a psp governance token on monday the protocol is distributing 150 million psp tokens or 7.5 percent of the total supply across roughly 20 000 wallets notably the airdrop introduced a heavy filtering process to ensure the psp was allocated to users most relevant to periswap's vision the team announced according to shred agarwal an algorithm designer for paraswap to be eligible users had to complete at least six pair swap transactions in the six months before the snapshot date of october 8. eligible users also needed to hold a minimum native token balance additionally periswap users based in the us and china were excluded from the drop as a result only 20 000 wallets received an airdrop just 0.015 percent of addresses that interacted with paraswap periswap's founder munir benshim led suggested that the robust eligibility requirements were necessary due to so many users attempting to game the airdrop in the lead-up over 1.3 million addresses more than one-fourth of all unique defy wallets on ethereum used the protocol benchmade believes many of these addresses were not real users as he explained to coindesk the vast majority are farmers and some of them are quite sophisticated they use bots sending tokens to thousands of wallets sometimes tens of thousands of wallets and they're not real active users the decision to drop a token comes less than two months after the protocol said it was not planning any such action quentin tarantino is getting sued over pulp fiction nfts last week quentin tarantino announced his intention to auction off a collection of uncut scenes from the cult classic pulp fiction as nft's on secret network however it appears the nft still has hidden obstacle miramax which produced pulp fiction is alleging that it holds the rights to pulp fiction in a recently filed complaint miramax alleges that tarantino kept his pulp fiction nft plans secret from miramax and was undeterred by a cease-and-desist order by the sound of it miramax thinks that tarantino's decision to nft work that has murky rights could lead to other artists making the same move tarantino's conduct has forced miramax to bring this lawsuit against a valued collaborator to enforce preserve and protect its contractual and intellectual property rights relating to one of miramax's most iconic and valuable film properties left unchecked tarantino's conduct could mislead others into believing miramax is involved in his venture and it could also mislead others into believing they have the rights to pursue similar deals or offerings when in fact miramax holds the rights needed to develop market and sell nfts relating to its deep film library concluded miramax consensus's 3.2 billion funding round comes amid legal action on wednesday consensus closed a 200 million raise valuing
