let's start by having you give your background because you've become quite the expert on ethereum's development so how did that all happen um well I would say my entry into crypto and specifically ethereum was actually through Bitcoin um my sister my older sister at the time when I was studying at the University of British Columbia um back in Canada I am Canadian um she told me that for my economics degree I was in my final year she was like you should write your thesis paper for your economics degree on bitcoin and why the price of Bitcoin fluctuates different from other traditional assets and I thought it was a really novel idea I didn't really understand much about crypto at the time but that's really what um helped me let that paper helped me land a job at coindesk because as I was researching Bitcoin of course I came across articles about Bitcoin on coindesk um and coindesk on that website was advertising for a summer internship and I wasn't getting a job like anywhere else at the time um once I graduated and so um when coindesk hit me up about that summer internship I really jumped at the opportunities to spend a summer in New York learn a little bit more about crypto and I really fall down the rabbit hole I would say through that internship like writing that paper for my economics degree it was like a little bit of a precursor um but I I got deep into crypto um as a journalist as a reporter for coindesk um and then I got into research after after being a reporter at coindesk because I noticed that I was I was writing most of my stories about ethereum and I really wanted to dive deeper into the tech of ethereum so Noel Atkinson who was leading the research team at coindesk at the time noticed that I I liked longer form reporting longer form writing and she really took me under her Wing that's how I landed and and got into more like ethereum research and then from there core desk was kind of winding down its research team and and moving it back into that tutorial back in I would say 2020 2021-ish and that's when I started to look for a research shop another research team that I could join Noel was also leaving coindesk at the time so I needed another research mentor and luckily at that time Alex Thorne who's the head of for my research at Galaxy reached out to me and that's how I I transitioned to my current role doing research at Galaxy yeah and your reports there are sort of like must reads for anything about ethereum uh so that's why I reached out to you about uh the upcoming upgrade on ethereum Shanghai ethereum has had this kind of long road map toward moving toward proof of stake and even though that transitions happened there's still kind of additional things that need to be done to sort of finish out that process and I wondered if you would just tell us what the ethereum Shanghai upgrade is and also when it might occur that's a great question so it and it's Essence um Shanghai is the activation of staked eat withdrawals on ethereum um since the since staking was enabled on ethereum which surprise was enabled back in December 2020 two years before the merge even happened people were not able to withdraw their Stakes so the validator life cycle could only get to the point where you can exit the network work stop validating on ethereum but you couldn't actually move your staked e back into your wallet or move it to an exchange or really do anything with it and this was sort of like the training wheels of ethereum's proof of state blockchain and for and up until now like I would say those treating meals are still on but Shanghai really represents kind of taking off the training wheels of of ethereum's proof of State consensus protocol and allowing withdrawals to happen in terms of timing developers with the activation of Shanghai on the Gorly test net anticipate if gorley the activation of the upgrade on gorley goes well then we could see the upgrade activated on mainnet as early as the second week of April okay so coming up soon yeah yeah and at the same time there will be the capella upgrade and that's why now kind of the whole event together is being dubbed chappella so what will happen with capella capella illustrates the changes that will come to the beacon chain the consensus layer of ethereum and Shanghai illustrates the changes that will come to the execution layer of ethereum um so when you withdraw your steak your steak knee is coming out of the beacon chain which is the consensus layer of ethereum but it's being moved to an address where you can interact with on the execution layer of ethereum so there does need to be some code changes on both networks but they all cohesively together make steak eat withdrawals so it's not like a different upgrade I would say per se but it does illustrate what part of the network you're changing and to enable staked withdrawals you need to change functionality on both the execution layer and the consensus layer so let's now talk about this process of unseeking ether at the moment there's about 17.5 million staked ether what are the projections for how much ether will be withdrawn post Shanghai and I was curious how you thought those withdrawals could affect the security of ethereum yeah it's another great question because that's really on the top of I would say validators and ethereum investors Minds what could this do to the price of eth like what is the impact of stake teeth withdrawals on on like you said the security of ethereum if we see a lot of withdrawals it'll really stress test the limitations of the network it'll test out the queue for only allowing a certain amount of withdrawals to happen per block per Epoch um it'll really test out the the incentive mechanisms that are Dynamic so when you see a lot of stake being removed from the network you should see the rewards of the network go up to incentivize more validated participation to come back in and so it'll be really exciting I think to see those Dynamics play out and hopefully work the way they're supposed to to secure the network but of course if there is unexpected bugs if some of these Dynamics and like levers that the networks has doesn't work out well you could see a negative impact on lowering the security of the network as take moves out but I don't foresee that happening I think there's a very small chance of that happening especially because of how this network has been has been tested repeatedly and the Dynamics that I'm talking about in terms of issuance and withdrawal cues these are things that developers have have thought through for years and again are testing on multiple different networks before mainnet so I saw you created um this chart basically for projecting so what are the different um you know types of ether that can be withdrawn or like the different ways it could be withdrawn and then when you look at kind of the different probabilities what do you think is maybe one of the more likely scenarios yeah um so we've got a galaxy has got two good reports on this one of them is on how much cell pressure we can expect after the merge and then another one just on the mechanics of the merge and at East Denver there's a there's a presentation on YouTube that's recorded up that goes through some of this in more detail but at a high level there's only one type of asset that you can withdraw and that is eth the way in which you can withdraw eth there's two types of withdrawals that you can do and only one of them is something that validators need to initiate manually the other type of withdrawal really happens automatically there's not really much that validators need to do to get those rewards and those rewards are called partial withdrawals they represent the rewards that you've earned from issuance on the beacon chain those rewards will just automatically deposit be deposited into a validator's ethereum one address every say 100 hours or so that estimation of 100 hours is dependent on the fact that the network can only process around 16 withdrawals per block and block times or 12 seconds so if you take the current size of the validator set which is around 500 000 active validators and you assume that every single validator has a certain amount of rewards that can be withdrawn every roughly 100 hours or so you're going to see the deposit of those automatic partial withdrawals happen to your account on ethereum and basically for every single validator that's been staking on ethereum since the beacon chain launched in December 2020 on in aggregate there's about a million Eve just there that validators have accumulated as reports and that's really the the Honeypot that I think most validator operators are are thinking to sell uh anecdotally they validator node operators I've spoken to have said that they will sell 30 of those rewards between 30 and 50 of the rewards that they've earned and I think most validated node operators will not initiate the second type of withdrawal which is full withdrawals and that's not only rewards but also your underlying principal balance of 32 State teeth this process of being able to unstake your full balance is a little bit harder the network just doesn't automatically you know withdraw your steak at any time you have to go through something called the execute which is dictated by a different limit than the partial withdrawals that I was talking about um so for full withdrawals I think one of the well two of the biggest reasons why I don't think full there's going to be a ton of full withdrawals happening on the network is because if you know validator node operators really needed that liquidity they already could have gotten it to some extent through liquid state derivatives through tokens like steath through tokens like ref and also I think that youth prices nowadays have significantly declined since what we saw a couple of years ago um and so most validator node operators don't have a ton of gains to realize by unstaking their eat entirely um I think we're going to see a larger number of node operators actually want to restake and just continue to earn we saw Lido for example have their biggest daily inflows ever just a couple weeks ago which I thought was was really bullish for the sentiment going into Shanghai but I know that was a lot does that kind of make sense though the partial and the full and then how one of them is automatic but the other one you kind of have to manually initiate yeah and um would you say that it generally looks I mean just like what you said about how we saw big inflows in delighto that it seems like most people are sort of eager to maybe put more money into staking rather than what's raw is that like an accurate reflection of what you're seeing I would say so I think the uncertainty around the fact that people didn't know when they were able to withdraw their e prevented certain validators and node operators from actually staking from people who did have a balance of you know five eth or six eat that they wanted to stake but that uncertainty around oh when are we going to be able to withdraw it um I think it does now that that kind of uncertainty is is relieved and the network will be able to process withdrawals I I do think that we're going to see a greater interest and inflow of staking activity so um what you talked about these kind of cues to exit and then kind of the limits on how much can be let's run at any time so given kind of any type of pressure that you're seeing already like how long do you think it will take for different validators to exit the network after the upgrade is completed yeah so it it heavily depends on how many validators are trying to exit at the same time if the entirety of the active validators that wanted to exit fully withdraw from the network take out their 32e it would take about a full year to process the withdrawals of all 500 000 active validators but say it's only 1 000 active validators that want to leave the network the way that you would calculate that is take the churn limit which currently I believe is eight active validators can exit from the network per Epoch and an Epoch is a period of time that's 6.4 minutes so you divide the number of validators that are trying to exit by the churn limit the maximum limit of how many validators can exit at the same time in 6.4 minutes and you basically like do the analysis of like how long those withdrawals would take and on top of that you would add then a buffer period of about 100 hours or so four to five days for the network to be able to to go through the withdrawals of full and partial because one thing that I didn't mention before was that even though the process for which Full withdrawals looks different from partial withdrawals eventually full and partial is all processed in the same withdrawals queue so once you're once you've exited the exit queue and you're you're done going through the churn limit your your validator is fully exited um then the network just processes partial and full withdrawals together so you have that additional limit of only 2016 withdrawals partial or full per block which is and block times are 12 seconds again so you just add in another four to five days um so yeah so I would say like in terms of of how long it'll take people to to see their rewards active it's going to take maximum a week probably after Shanghai then you're going to be able to see that million Ethan rewards just kind of um be accessible to validator node operators to do whatever they want with and then in terms of the timing for full withdrawals I don't think we're gonna see the queue really backlogged but you could see another couple days if not you know two weeks to be able to to to process full depending on how how many other validators are trying to exit at the same time and then when you said earlier that there are different groups that may have kind of held back from staking due to the uncertainty about when they would be able to withdraw are there any particular types of stickers or investors that you think um you know fall in that bucket and uh also how much uh you know interest you think there is to stake at that point and what might that do to like the network security or the price yeah I think one of the things I'm I'm really watching lately is institutions coming into State I think the regulatory action by the SEC against Kraken um for basically offering your staking services to a retail U.S retail population favors institutional act activity and staking at least in the U.S and I think the uncertainty around not being able to have access to your Capital until like you know some unknown date in the future um really does discourage institutional staking activity that kind of uncertainty I think is something perhaps an individual an at-home Staker with um 32 youth lying around um I think they're able to to get on board with an idea like that more so than say an institution so I think when we're talking about increased staking activity I'd be I'd be really interested in in seeing greater participation from institutions to post Shanghai and the recent Announcement by um the liquid stake in Collective I believe they used to be called alluvial and they're backed by coinbase and I believe figment is a staking service that's that's targeted just for institutions so products like that also make me think that there's a concerted effort to get these institutions on board and based on that do you have any expectation around how that could either change the youth price or the yield that's being offered for sticking if yeah so more stake um on ethereum more more eat steak is better for the level of security that makes it harder for a potential attacker to um maliciously spin up their own set of validators and then overpower the honest you know super majority I think that in terms of yield it actually brings down the validator rewards from issuance per validator it decreases it even though you've got more stakers the amount of rewards that each of them are are getting from the network and issuance actually decreases that being said you know you could see fluctuations and rewards from other sources like Mev and priority fees let's just say defy activity really picks up again later this year you know you can see validated rewards go up despite the fact that there's more validators around and then finally one thing I would say about issuance on the network because ultrasound money and this idea of eth becoming a deflationary asset is such a big and Hot Topic lately if we see a lot more stakers if we see a lot more validators you will see issuance of eth climb slightly not enough to to make the inflation rate on ethereum anything close to what it was before which was around like five percent but I think if we see continued depressed activity in transactions um you don't see a lot of fees being burned a lot of Youth being burned but you do see issuance kind of slowly start to climb up um because there's more staking activity than I think you could see like inflation rate instead of being negative um be somewhere like you know below one percent like 0.05 or something like that um so that's also something to to keep in mind about what happens when you just see like a ton more ethane State biased by institutions so we've talked about people potentially withdrawing we've talked about people potentially getting in so when you kind of like Factor it all in I don't know if you have a projection on like the percentage of a eth that might be unstaked and or sold at the time of the upgrade like basically when you when you kind of net it all out what do you think the effect on the price will be I think there's not going to be a big impact on price um I think the piece that I mentioned about um you know the impact of of Shanghai on each price goes into this a little deeper but based on the amount of trading volume there is behind Ethan a daily weekly basis if you just assume that 30 to 50 of rewards will be immediately sold after Shanghai like in the days following Shanghai it doesn't have a huge impact on the market I do think though that the staking activity that the amount of people coming into staking will have a have a larger impact on ethereum as a network I think that if we see more institution staking if we see more retail staking I think that we could see what is currently 15 of total eats Supply stake like double by the end of the year and I think with the continued adoption of the good taking tokens I almost said liquid staking derivatives but people have been telling me to stop saying that there's a lot of like different ways to to say that word um but anyways liquid sticking receipts if you want to call it the greater adoption of what that is I think you could start to see staking um the staking rate on ethereum the total amount of eat steak become the majority of the supply like upwards of even like 80 I think you could see so much of each state because it doesn't make sense for people to just hold on to an asset that they're being diluted from if they're not staking it um and if there's a clear way to like stake your asset and still have liquidity from the asset like why not yeah I mean for I mean I guess this whole time ethereum uh has had a pretty low percentage of its asset that is staked um right now it's like 15 and like on Solana it's 71 on DND it's 97 other chains like Avalanche polygon and polka dot are kind of in the 40 to even like 60 range um so is your theory that the low levels of staking on ethereum are solely due to this uncertainty about when you would be able to withdraw that's a good question is that the only reason why we're seeing a low activity for staking I think that that is a big part of it Shanghai the activation of Shanghai will take away a big barrier I think the second reason is that unlike other proof-of-stake blockchains there is a significant amount of other ways to deploy your asset like other ways to use e like the fact that there's such a vibrant D5 ecosystem on top of ethereum uh very vibrant nft ecosystem on top of ethereum um so much Innovation on the decentralized application front um and ethereum for the majority of its history wasn't a proof-of-stake blockchain it really comes down to the maturity of ethereum as a proof of stake blockchain and the maturity of liquid staking derivative protocols the more that those two become ossified over time I do think that the staking rate of ethereum will will start to look a lot more similar to to the bnbs and to the salanas to the other proof of stake blockchains but it's a good question to think like was it really only because stake teeth withdrawals were not enabled that we haven't seen this happening sooner and I think it's a big part of it but I think some other factors like ethereum's history and also the other ways in which you could use and deploy ethon ethereum um definitely played a factor and so we keep talking about the different liquid sticking derivatives or liquid stinking token uh providers um so what changes do you expect to see in that area uh after the Shanghai upgrade lots of changes coming up with um the the liquid staking providers my goodness so Lido is working on a V2 upgrade where not only will they enable withdrawals um basically redemptions of steath for eth which it should do which should help the peg between that staking derivative to each become more stable but on top of that I believe that the Lido V2 upgrade will also initiate the early steps to allow more flexibility on the types of validator node operators that can that can participate in Lido since Lido's launch you know the validated node operators on Lido have been vetted very carefully and meticulously kind of curated and what Lido is trying to do is decentralize and become more permissionless over time and so one of the ways in which they're trying to do that is by creating Lido modules where you can have different security and risk assumptions for you know a certain set of validator node operators versus another perhaps some that use like distributive validator technology perhaps some that don't require any vetting of validator node operators Etc so I think that's something really interesting and important for ethereum stakeholders to watch out for because Lido is the largest staking provider period it controls more than like one-third of total eth staked so decentralizing that protocol over time I think is a really important Initiative for the health of ethereum and the second one second one I would I would highlight in terms of liquid staking providers that I learned about at ethanver actually on the stake the withdrawals panel was rocket pool rocket pool is gearing up for an upgrade where instead of validator node operators being required to post up 16 eth they're reducing that requirement to eight eth and they're also working on some other upgrades where they can lower that requirement even more if it's like an Institutional staking provider that's that's taking on user user assets to to spin up new validators so those are so yeah those are two upgrades I think that are are that I'm keeping an eye on in terms of like what's going to happen after Shanghai and um all positive developments but things that I think the community have that has been asking for for a really long time yeah there was a lot of concern um last year I did I covered it in a show about the potential for liquid sticking derivatives providers like Lido to be a centralizing force in ethereum and that potentially like the lto token could almost be a cause eye governance token for ethereum is your do you have any concern about that or what's your take on that situation I'm definitely still concerned about the level of stake centralization there is on ethereum to Lido I think the jury is still out though um where Trends and activity for staking um go especially after Shanghai I think one thing I didn't mention the liquid staking derivative that is being supported by coinbase is an Institutional liquid staking derivative by the liquids taking Collective and I think if you have like multiple liquid taking tokens around on ethereum some of which you need to be like a kycaml the actor to issue and some where you don't I think that could create kind of an interesting fragmentation in the defy ecosystem that is built on top of ethereum and I think you could see perhaps market share moving away from Lido to a different protocol like the liquid staking a low field protocol I think centralization now is still a big concern but um I'm still trying to do more analysis on how I think these other players that are entering the market will change that Dynamic and what kind of impact that might have on on the fragmentation of liquidity on ethereum in a moment we'll talk a little bit more about seeking plus look at the other developments

with Christine one last thing I wanted to ask you about in regards to staking is you know as you mentioned Kraken having to shutter its staking as a service program and I wondered if after that if you've noticed any changes amongst other staking as a service providers or heard any um kind of scuttlebutt about potential changes they're looking at or any concerns that they have yeah I thought it was really notable that right after that announcement was made um coinbase came out really strong saying that if you know if a similar sort of cease and desist order would would fall down on them they would try and fight it they would fight it in in court um just adds to the many legal the many crypto companies that are that are tied up in like bankruptcies or like some kind of a um some kind of an objection to the SEC um but anyways yes hard times regulatory wise for the crypto industry now but on the topic of of staking particularly I think that um honestly I haven't seen too many changes I think in staking in in what kind of staking services and activities are being offered um from coinbase um there they continue to they haven't done you know they haven't shuttered their CBE program um I haven't seen any notice from Lido about the node operators that they partner with I believe two out of like the 27 or so valid reader node operators that um are on Lido are based out of the US and I haven't heard anything about um that changing anytime soon because of the regulatory action that the SEC layered against the crack against Kraken um but that being said I I am still keeping my eye out I think this coinbase is um institutional staking um its support of an Institutional staking product does make me wonder if at any point they would retire like their their retail staking services in favor of a more compliant institutional staking service one day um but so far I haven't seen um yeah I haven't seen like major changes I think in in the front of us staking activity or Services being provided yeah which which kind of makes sense because a lot of the objection was kind of around how it was marketed but um yeah I didn't know if you know people were being a little bit skittish about it so after Shanghai the next upgrade is dubbed Cancun what will happen in that upgrade yes Cancun's a a very exciting upgrade probably more exciting in my mind than steak teeth withdrawals because it focuses on improving the scalability of ethereum ethereum I think back since 2017 you know crypto kitties days has always been trying to improve its scalability you know blocks have always been historically extremely full-on ethereum um gas fees just going through the roof during times of high network activity has always been a kind of thorn I would say in an ethereum side um so so what Cancun does is it activates eip4844 it's a code change that introduces a new type of transaction to ethereum the transactions are called blobs and it's not for any other reason then blob stands for like binary binary large objects I think is the the acronym um yeah some people say like oh why why do you call it sharding why do you call it blobs there's some rationale for these strange terms um but these transactions are are specifically designed just so that layer two Roll-Ups can um submit settle their their batches of user transactions to the main net of ethereum because right now you know Layer Two Roll-Ups are still pretty expensive um for users and by introducing kind of an optimized way to store data from Layer Two networks to ethereum it greatly reduces the cost of Layer Two prolapse and ethereum and it really like solidifies the fact that ethereum is trying to scale through layers it's trying to move execution of smart contracts user activity two layer two prolapse that can then very cheaply be able to submit and batch user transactions down to ethereum in a more compressed way all right yeah I I think people call this one uh the EIP 4044 proto-dink sharding so we've never really gone into that terminology on the show so can you just give a definition and explanation of that yeah proto-dink sharding um refers to kind of the early steps of the full vision of dank sharding and Dink sharding is designed to kind of make ethereum a very optimized data availability layer for layer 2 Roll-Ups and by that I mean that the ethereum blockchain is a monolithic blockchain it can do all of the um processes of executing smart contracts to settling them finalizing them reaching consensus about the order of transactions it does it all all in like one network but that does create bandwidth constraints that does create resource constraints um and makes it difficult for the network to scale so by moving execution to a different layer and being a place where um where you can store temporarily store kind of compressed versions of user transactions from these layer twos you kind of divvy up the work um for what it takes to to be a blockchain across multiple layers and dank sharding is really the vision of optimizing ethereum for this modular vision for this vision of layered scaling um and and historically when we we talk about the term sharding without the Dank part it was thought as as actually splitting up the current ethereum blockchain into multiple mini blockchains called shards and all those shards in parallel Computing ethereum's transaction mode of of in parallel Computing user transactions and that really scaling the network but the complexity of having like 64 mini blockchains communicating with one another figuring out whose user transaction load to bear and so on and so forth very quickly I think developers realize that this type of complexity would not be the way to scale ethereum and they pivoted to dank sharding which approaches scaling in a more modular Way by sharding um this is well I keep saying sharding but it's s-h-a-r-d just to be clear by starting but the the block space of a theory of an existing ethereum block for different um for different operations like vis-a-vis um batched transactions from Layer Two Roll-Ups um which creates a new fee market for this type of transaction um and I believe the Dank part of dank sharding is actually by the person who really um invented this idea or or at least thought about it very heavily for ethereum Dan crad Feist is an ethereum core developer who I believe is is really like tried to to get this idea going among the community and I think that's how this term like sharding was this idea for scaling for ethereum and then someone by the name of dank red Feist was like oh let's think about scalability in the context of modularity and then we got dank sharding and then we couldn't fulfill that Vision all at once we needed to do it step by step and the first step is Proto Deng sharding it's like a prototype of dang sharding so as you can see we start to get this like lovely little long word that many people find confusing um as do I but that's kind of a little bit of the history yeah this reminds me of when I uh wrote like one of the early drafts of my book I had some friends who don't know anything about crypto read it and like thankfully one of my friends is very blunt um this like totally helped the book so much but she was just like oh my God Laura I was like so lost and she was like you need a glossary in here and so I did put a glossary in there but um yeah she was just like I could barely follow this there's so much yes yes I know um yes anyway so speaking of jargon this was like more fun jargon but last summer vitalik mentioned that the future roadmap would include what he called The Surge The Verge The Purge and the splurge so can you talk a little bit about each of these steps yes I can talk about some of them um I I only know maybe a couple but the surge I believe refers to scalability so after the merge we're gonna Focus full force on ethereum scalability through modularity so surge refers to proto-dink sharding additional steps to get to the folding sharding Vision really optimizing ethereum for the the modular design blockchain design The Verge refers to changing ethereum's data structure currently the way that transactions which there's a lot of ethereum accounts ethereum state which is continually growing all the time the way that ethereum the theorem blockchain stores that data is through a Merkel Patricia data tree structure and one of the benefits of of like a tree structure for storing data is that if you have the the a cryptographic proof for the root of the tree you can kind of like verify the whole thing in one go so it's like a very efficient succinct um way to to cryptographically prove a large amount of data um but with the Verge their the idea is that that we could use a similar type of data structure um as the Merkel Patricia tree um but it's called vertical trees and vertical trees do like very similar things very similar benefits but the size of the proof for vertical trees are significantly smaller and more efficient than for Merkel producers trees so this idea that we want to move ethereum's data structure to a vertical tree type um type path forward um to to move to Vertical trees is is the point of the Verge and developers recently talked about it um in their latest ethereum Dev call and they've got some nice prototypes some nice like early code changes that they get to to make the Verge happen The Purge just from the sound of the name I think is really focusing on trying to remove more complexity from ethereum's uh from ethereum's protocol I mean with the merge The Surge and The Verge you're going to have a lot of of archaicode dead weight on ethereum that could potentially be optimized so I think I believe that the purge is really about trying to reduce ethereum complexity um and then I can't remember the the last one but I believe all of these are supposed to happen to some extent in tandem it's not like one after the other all the time um but all that to be said ethereum has a very very ambitious roadmap still still to come after after the merge yeah and I think the slurge is just what it sounds like it's like nice to haves oh I see but I yeah but I don't know what they are yeah that's fair um so when we were at East Denver we were chatting about what we would talk about in this episode and something else that you said you wanted to discuss were was governance so you know what interests you in that regard like what have you seen in terms of how decisions are made and um how that process has changed I love talking about ethereum governments I really do I think part of it is because on top of like when I was studying back at the University of British Columbia um I did a major in international relations as well on top of economics and the the different forms of governance I think for blockchains for decentralized networks in particular is um is one of the most important things to figure out in order for like the long-term success of of cryptocurrencies I I would say um I think bitcoin's model of governance is extremely minimalistic and it works because Bitcoin doesn't change a lot there's not a ton that people really need to come together about um and it's always like airing on the side of let's do nothing rather than let's do something by breaking consensus for ethereum um over the years that I've covered ethereum's governance through taking notes for the developer calls I've noticed that the number of stakeholders the number of interest groups that are present on these calls have has grown dramatically um you know I think back more in the Ico days these calls were primarily four ethereum core Developers for developers that are employed by the ethereum foundation for developers that are directly working on a client a software client like Geth or Aragon or um any of the other execution layer clients but very recently I think especially with Shanghai coming up there was a lot of different interest groups and stakeholders that voice their opinions through the ethereum core developers like I'm from this layer to roll up team I'm from this decentralized finance application team um you know I'm representing a wallet infrastructure company and here are the code changes that I would like to see implemented on ethereum for Shanghai of course all of those ideas were tabled for just staked eat withdrawals and the scope of Shanghai is extremely limited to really that one major code change which means that you know there had to be a governance process to kind of like prioritize one thing over all these other things um so that's why I would say I I really like digging into ethereum's governance and um one of the the interesting things about how governance has gotten a lot harder on ethereum over the years so the day before we're recording the New York attorney general Leticia James asserted that ether is a security in a lawsuit against kucoin and this is the first time that a regulator has claimed in court that ether is a security and I was curious for you know because you watch ethereum governance very closely um she was saying things like that the success of ether depends on vitalik and the ethereum foundation I was curious for your thoughts about her statements and whether or not you agreed with her yeah that that was uh I think it was very negative um and I of course don't agree with her statements around um these are the reasons why you should be classified as a security I think it was very notable that she classified argued that eth was going to be a security um was a security Now versus what certain other Regulators have said that if eth was potentially a security then during its Ico days but has become significantly more decentralized over time like these are very two very different arguments um I think it's true that ethereum's ethereum's road map heavily depends on development it heavily depends on developers but I would push back on this idea that the development is spearheaded by a very small group of Founders and a very small group of centralized developers I would argue that over the years most of the founders of ethereum have left ethereum like they don't work on ethereum anymore I I mean vitalik definitely does but like if you just think about I guess like the eight you know people who often say like the eight co-founders of ethereum like you know the vast majority of them are not uh they don't develop ethereum but um I think none of them except for vitalik right and and so I think that's another big point of like how much development has has shifted away from just one centralized group of people to now you know hundreds if not thousands of developers that are developing wallets applications layer twos the protocol so many different aspects of what makes ethereum ethereum is spearheaded without coordination without us for a coordinated centralized company um and I think that's something that's really missing from um the New York attorney general's you know criticisms of ethereum I think that's a big part of of what makes governance so hard on ethereum that uh clearly was not taken into account okay so I know it's very early because you know this just happened um less than 24 hours ago but have you seen any discussion about this in the ethereum community and have you seen like the developers or or just other community members changing their plans in light of this like trying to decentralize more or whatever I have not I've I've seen some offhand tweets about you know if you thought that you know if you thought that ethereum development was led by a single person like vitalik buter and like you are you are so Off the Mark like these kinds of kind of more like Angry slash you know sub tweets about what's going on um the moment the notice came out um my my colleagues like Galaxy we we really talked about this heavily and we featured an analysis some insights on this in our newsletter um which is posted on galaxy.com if you do want to hear more about um insights from like other people um I think that I think that moving forward people should talk more about the decentralization of ethereum I think people I hope that this does light a fire under um the community and different stakeholders butts to more seriously prioritize how to make ethereum more censorship resistant and how to make ethereum more decentralized maybe even ahead of certain code changes for scalability or for evm upgradeability um this is existential to like ethereum's value and I really think that more attention could be could be placed on it so to play Devil's Advocate uh you know I think a lot of the car developers are employed by the ethereum foundation so why is it that you still believe that ethereum's development is decentralized because I think ethereum protocol development as important as it is is ethereum's protocol is becoming more decentralized so when we say protocol developers are we talking about the ethereum protocol developers that are building on the execution layer or the consensus layer because depending on which developer group you're talking about there are some of them are not employed or funded by the ethereum foundation they're funded through grants for example Prismatic Labs which is the biggest ethereum consensus layer client is was acquired by Arbitrage room and that's another layer of of protocol design that is that is fully you know the ethereum foundation is not in control of so you've got Layer Two Roll-Ups as another important part of ethereum um so I think while the ethereum foundation does employ the Geth team which is like the execution layer client of ethereum um that has started becoming a lot smaller in terms of um its representation of how ethereum works there are there's now a complexity a level of diversity that has come to um developers now creating and building different spokes of of ethereum tech and I would even include like the D5 application ecosystem the nfts all of that as as kind of part of ethereums big developer Community um that oftentimes I think people forget um they think of just like ethereum core protocol development the execution layer um and I think even if nothing changes about ethereum's protocol layer moving forward there's still so much permissionless Innovation that can happen on top of ethereum's tech stack today that even if we don't see any more upgrades like after Shanghai or even before Shanghai I think you can still see a really Vibrant Community of developers building on top of of what we've got today so much that can be done through smart contracts um yeah some really interesting things I'm thinking about like restaking protocols and like liquids taking protocols like all of that didn't need changes for the protocol layer it just required permissionless innovation yeah I mean whenever I see the Electric Capital reports every year about developer activity and crypto and you just see how many new developers use will go to ethereum you know they're it's not like the ethereum foundation is hiring these people these are just people who are just like oh this is the one I want to start building on so um in that regard like I I do think that there's a lot of decentralized um or or I should say there's a lot of activity that's not being initiated by the ethereum foundation so um you know in that regard it definitely doesn't depend on that one institution but we'll have to see you know how this all plays out because um you know I'm sure there's arguments on both sides that are are very valid um so you recently wrote about ZK EVMS as the future of ethereum scalability why don't you describe those for the audience and then talk a little bit about why you're excited about them yeah for sure I think ckvm's is gonna continue to be a really big topic this year um so I'm glad we're spending some time on it um ZK EVMS are a type of roll-up a type of layer to uh roll up on ethereum although I guess it doesn't have to be at its core it's um a way to cryptographically verify user transactions um and compress them in a much more succinct and also like efficient way over different types of like cryptographic proofs but the thing about zero knowledge and zero knowledge Tech is that it's very difficult to generalize it's very difficult to kind of apply zero knowledge to um a wide ranging number of smart contract applications like um to apply these proofs um to something like for the functions of a general purpose blockchain like ethereum and so there's been a ton of research going into how can we use zero knowledge for scalability how can we use zero knowledge um to improve the scalability of ethereum and there's been really great developments um from the scroll team from the ZK sync team from starknet about leveraging this about leveraging zero knowledge for blockchain applications and and for blockchain use cases historically it has been used for privacy reasons in that you can ensure that certain that properties of of what kind of data you're working with remains hidden in a very cryptographically verifiable way but for the purposes of ZK edms and for the purposes of the report that you were mentioning it really just focuses on the benefits of zero knowledge for um compression and for efficiently verifying um large amounts of data um and so in that sense there's really no privacy benefits which is why some people say that zero knowledge proofs in the context of blockchains is a little bit of a misnomer um most people like to call it validity proofs um as as kind of a more accurate way to suggest that there's really no privacy benefits here um the evm part of zkevms it goes back to kind of how do we make this technology um applicable for ethereum based applications and ethereum-based application developers because there's so many tools that help developers con write smart contract code in solidity and if you build an entirely new layer 2 Network on top of ethereum where these applications need to rewrite their code rewrite all of the they have to like um change a lot of the the workflows that they have um it'll be hard to get adoption it'll be hard to move those applications over to a layer two roll-up so the real vision is is to try and use this this very powerful cryptographic technology but design it in a way where it can imitate and replicate the same virtual execution environment as what we have on ethereum and that's a very hard job because this this cryptography is is not the best at being generalized um um so there's still a lot of research that needs to go into it and there's different types of equivalents that um I think is is important to highlight with ZK EVMS you can kind of Finagle a similar type of execution experience on a ZK evm by being compatible at a higher programming language level than say um you know working with the zeros and ones and really at a bytecode level like trying to to integrate you know zero knowledge proof and Tech um and there's pros and cons I think to doing it both ways and certainly it's easier to do it uh it in one way over the other but this explosion of kind of interest in zero knowledge um Tech is something that I even noticed at zero at East Denver um this is a big topic of conversation that a lot of people are are pouring resources and and and money into so um yeah so it's it's exciting I think it'll be really game changing um once we have like a working ZK EDM that's been tested and proven I think for now though like my main takeaway from what I've seen across the ZK evm projects is that it's still a really uh research driven um initiative it's still it's still going to be take some time before like the bugs and The Kinks of of what ZK VM should be able to do our workout yeah I agree it feels very nascent but there's so much buzz and excitement about it so listeners should be aware that I am working on a new episode that has to do with that um all right so Christine this has been amazing are there any developments in ethereum that we've not discussed that you would want to touch on one thing that I would touch on with Cancun is outside of scalability Developers have considered and Will May upgrade the ethereum virtual machine so where we're talking about execution of transactions not only are our developers trying to work on better execution on the layer two side through ZK VMS they're trying to work on better execution in the near term for user transactions just directly from ethereum and if you want to learn more about those changes it's uh called it called the eof implementation um it it really discusses it's like a bundle of five VIPs that that make some pretty fundamental changes to the ethereum virtual machine and that's one thing that I would probably highlight to for listeners to keep an eye out for all right well this has been a fantastic episode where can people learn more about you and your work yeah so um if you're interested in learning more please head over to galaxy.com there's all of the research reports on stake teeth withdrawals on ZK EVMS on um that you know summaries of the of the developer calls that's on galaxy.com and then if you have any want to reach out to me directly you can find me on Twitter my handle is at Christine underscore D Kim perfect it's been a pleasure having you on Unchained thank you Laura thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Christine the upcoming Shanghai upgrade and ethereum's roadmap check out the show notes for this episode Unchained is produced by me Laura Shin pulled out from Anthony Yoon Mark Murdock Matt pilchard Zach Seward Juana ranovich Sam
