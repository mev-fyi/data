you got sued by the cftc for engaging in Melissa activity what's that about not a good look for a lot of people so I think that's just one example of how this could be presidential in a kind of you know not great way for people who are participating in the house you know is the effect going to be to depress Dow participation um I don't know I do know that you know you mentioned I gave trivia earlier I know he has put out a call for any member of ukidao to who wants representation to reach out so uh we'll see if they're able to pull together so we look out soon and you know fight this but there are definitely a couple ways where intentionally or not the cftc might be depressing down participation and or not centralizing but at least limiting kind of the growth of this industry
