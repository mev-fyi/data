blockchain crypto and digital currencies at paypal welcome jose hello laura how are you i'm doing really well excited to have you so let's start with your background how did you come to be paypal's general manager for blockchain crypto and digital currencies well it's a long winding road as i am spanish born and raised i've been mostly in payments in especially in emerging markets for the best part of the last 20 years did a lot of work in latin america middle east africa and i've been in the bay area for the last 10 years and i started to get involved in in krypton digital currencies probably around 2015 or so when we were doing back in my banking days we were trying to make money movements across border using blockchain protocols and that's what started to pick my my interest i've been as a people for a few years now and we started to get very very involved in earnest encrypt on the paypal side probably three to four years ago we started uh we started small as as we think that most of us have started in this field most of the research and engineering activity and then it started to grow and grow until we went public with our first retail product about a year ago and then we created the unit that i have the privilege of running today which is our blockchain encryption digital currencies division and so you say paypal got started in earnest three or four years ago what happened at that time to get paypal interested and why did paypal ultimately decide to offer this ability to buy sell and pay with crypto i think that what we saw is is one of those combinations of events that every now and then happen at the same time which is a technology that was getting ready for for prime time uh incredible demand and interest on the on the consumer side and also our merchants we're getting more interested into this as a payment instrument and also more more clarity on the regulatory side so when you combine those three things and you have a platform of the of the size of paypal where we have more than 400 million consumers and merchants is an incredibly powerful platform to be in and and we thought that it was part of our responsibility to to help in making this asset class more accessible to the public so at that moment in time was when we were seeing that everything was come kind of together if you remember we were coming out of the crypto winter in 2017 so we were having this conversation around 2019 or so and things were getting more stable and especially on our side the technology was getting more and more ready and so as um people are probably aware your ceo dan shulman famously said that after you guys offered that users who had bought crypto on paypal tended to log into the platform twice as often and his expectation was that this would make the users more loyal and increase the amount of overall payments they made through the app have you seen that play out that people who buy crypto on paypal then actually just make more payments in general with paypal we see that it's actually it's a two-way street and that's one of the beauties of of the platform we see more engagement from our crypto users as that has said we see a very high increase in engagement with the app and now we are also seeing it work the other way around if you yes as you know we have very significantly now revamped the paypal app and adding a number of new services in our strategy to become a super app and what we are seeing now is one of the side effects is we are seeing the improvements in the super app drive more engagement on the crypto side and we are seeing significant increases in crypto adoption in our base since we revamped the app so it's one of the benefits of being in in this ecosystem there are network effects between different paypal properties and we see that on paypal and when we go international we see that when we light up the product on on the vemma side and we see significant effects on on both sides so the answer is yes we are seeing both more engagement on the paypal side but also activity on paypal is driving more engagement for our crypto users and when you talk about those features that are the super app features what are those features so the company has been a launching uh and we are in the process of rolling that out now an environment where you can go to the paypal app you will see your traditional a payment activity that you know and love about paypal but now we have made more visible our commerce properties and the ability to find deals in in the app your crypto activity is there the rewards the site there is there you can do your bill payment from the app we are gonna we have announced that very quickly uh we're gonna be going live with a product that will provide high yield deposit savings so it's more and more of a place where you can handle your financial life in in one unique place oh that's fascinating and so you're seeing that people on that who are transacting in that way then just get more engaged in crypto naturally indeed and and you can see when we think about krypton our role in the cryptocurrency system there are three things where we think that that we can help the first one is the the one that i refer at the beginning which is a we have a very massive distribution and we can help in providing access to to crypto assets for users who are intrigued but they are not experts and they don't know and they don't want to know what chat 256 cryptography is they don't want to deal with a hardware wallet they want to have accurate experience into crypto under the umbrella of a brand diet that they trust so that that access is the first part where we can help the second part where we believe we can we can move the needle is on providing more utility i think that we all agree that these assets if the only thing that we do is sit on them they are less interesting and and the the main point of interest is how they we can make them useful in the real world we are starting to do that through our distributions as you might know soon after we enable our buy hold and sell capability on the paypal app we enable a crypto checkout which means that in your crypto in your transactions at paypal when you're paying with paypal anywhere that paypal is accepted you can select as a funding instrument your bank account your debit card your credit card your rewards and you can select your crypto balance so all of a sudden we have been talking about payments with crypto for a long while all of a sudden if you carry crypto with us you can pay in any of our millions of merchants and we will settle with the merchant in fiat so the merchant doesn't need to do anything we we believe that having that crypto offering in the middle of a commerce and payments experience with this distribution adds pretty massive utility to it and then the third one is that we have been on a regulated financial services player for a long while and we are very happy to contribute uh to the conversation around regulation on crypto and also we are doing a lot of work around central bank digital currencies you basically just covered all the topics that i want to get to in this podcast all right um well i do have a few more questions about this uh user update i did notice in the earnings that you said that or paypal said that the venmo app began supporting crypto in april and that in the third quarter you saw payment volume jump 36 in in venmo to 60 billion and i wondered did it look like the introduction of crypto there had something to do with that big jump uh i i wouldn't say yes our introduction of crypto and bamboo is is fairly recent as you were saying is a few months back we are seeing really really high engagement from from the vemma demographic which is interestingly you see different behavior patterns between the paypal population and the venmo population i would i think that the venmo team is doing a fantastic working in growing the volume on the vermont side i would not claim any credit on the crypto side yet i think that is is another feature that we are adding to to venmo and we will be adding more uh one thing where we are seeing more engagement on the venmo side is we added as you know as you might know bemo has a credit card a physical credit card that people can use that to fund purchases with their a with their venmo balance and that credit card has a reward program so one of the things that we introduced very recently is that users can choose to have their cashback from the demo card denominated in the crypt of their choice meaning that you are spending with your card and you get your two percent and as opposed to getting two dollars at the end of the month if you spend 100 you can get two dollars worth of any of the tokens that we support bitcoin ethereum bitcoin cash or like and we have seen that to be a fantastic feature that people love and it's a really really good first experience as we said for many folks who are curious about crypto but they don't know about it and this is like getting a a free krypton away and and removing all that friction into a first experience and so when you said that you're seeing different behaviors between the paypal users and the venmo users what what kind of behavior are you seeing on the paypal side we see that when when we look at investment amounts and transaction speeds the the vemo demographic tend to skew younger and we are seeing smaller transactions and and and faster a adoption in the curve and i'm sorry that was for the venmo users you said oh okay users and so in general how do you view the paypal and or venmo users of crypto and how would you differentiate them from for instance the crypto customers at coinbase or robin hood or square i well i cannot tell you much about the the crypto users at those other companies because i i don't know the profiles but we have gotten to know uh quite a bit about our a crypto user population and it has been a actually surprising when we started when we went live in october last year uh i think that my preconceived idea is that probably a crypto users on the paypal side will maybe skew younger or maybe skew more more affluent and what we have seen which i think is is good news for the prospects of crypto adoption as a mainstream instrument is that actually they they cut across the board i i don't think that we can point of one specific demographic or socio-economic segment that is more active in our side we are seeing engagement across the board so i can tell you that our crypto population is actually a good reflection of our overall paypal population and not one specific segment which i think again is fantastic news for for our sector and are you finding that the crypto offering has brought new customers to paypal or venmo or is it just getting existing customers to buy crypto for the first time there are some new ones but most as i said our value prop is a lot about for people who know and trust the paypal brand so the our typical adopter is someone who's comfortable using paypal they are using paypal for their payment activity they see that there is an offering on crypto and they have been cryptocurious for a while and they tend to add up more so logically we've only been in the market for about a year so it makes sense for us that the the early users tend to be more on the on the paypal population and it's an engagement uh activity more than a user acquisition activity okay yeah and but then it sounds like actually you guys are bringing new people to crypto very much so i when we do service of our users for a relevant percentage of them we are their first crypto experience which is fantastic as as we said we we care a lot about access and being able to add more and more users who become crypto doctors is something that that we care a lot about okay and so for users who are for listeners who aren't aware you have uh paxos's it bit work all of that on the back end so is or do they take care of any hedging that happens when you're transact transacting in what is a very volatile environment and also one in which the value of these assets is increasing do they just take care of all of that for you so paxos is is our partners you're saying they're a fantastic company we're very happy with with the partnership they they provide liquidity and custody too to us uh when what happens when somebody's buying a crypt on the paypal side they will place the order with us so that the customer relationship is is with us we are not sending them anywhere else and then we're using our collaboration with pax or suggest to go to the market acquire the crypto and and then keep that on on the name of of the user we don't have at this stage we don't carry crypto on the balance sheet of of paypal it's a question that we get quite often as other companies have been using crypto for treasury purposes we don't carry that on our balance sheet today it might happen in the future if we need that for operational purposes one thing that we have learned also and we have been telling a lot of people in the space is that when you operate on a payments environment a payment is more than a transaction so it's something that is relatively straightforward when people want to send value from an ethereum wallet to a different ethereum wallet when that is part of a payment transaction there are many things beyond the value movement that come into play there you need to deal with refunds and with disputes and we need to deal with the the payment stack on the merchant side and financial reporting so it might be that in the course of our a payment activity it makes sense for us to some of uh crypto hour balance for operations not for investment but at the moment we don't have that and so why in this time when a lot of corporate i don't know if a lot is really the word but but a good number of companies have decided to add crypto to their balance sheets why has paypal decided not to do that because again from an operational point of view we don't need it yet and from an investment perspective our treasury team is is deploying the the funds in a different strategies but we don't have we don't carry that and we will probably not carry that for investment purposes and part of the we deploy our treasury as an operational instrument and again in our current construct we don't need to have crypto on balance for operational purposes okay so going back to the transactions how has the fact that crypto transactions are not reversible changed the way that paypal thinks about security fraud and similar issues when it comes to executing those transactions you know versus obviously like a bank or a credit card transaction that goes back to to this very very important point that a payment is is more than than uh than a transaction uh we spent quite a bit of time thinking about it as our product today exists inside the paypal environment when i say it exists inside the paypal environment means that to transacting in crypto with us you you buy the the the crypto from paypal and what you want to sell it to sell it back to paypal and when you're paying for a good service with your crypto balance you are doing that with a paypal merchant as well so as long as all that of course inside the paypal environment all our usual product features apply so there is buyer protection and seller protection and and all those things it's going to be a very interesting as we as we have announced a few months ago when we enable on chain transfers and the ability to withdraw crypto from your paypal balance or bring it from an external wallet all those things that you are saying very much come into into effect so we it does have a impact on how we look at a transaction which means that we are very intent on how we're going to do between transaction monitoring and validation of the merchants who are doing these transactions it is it is a different ballpark than a traditional credit card transaction and so for the first part of your answer i did notice that if somebody buys using crypto then there's a little note that says you know if you end up returning this or reversing the charge you'll you'll be refunded in the dollar value of the crypto at that time so that's the reason why because you're just using kind of your internal ledger for that is that yeah and we are settling with with a merchant in fiat so what is happening when we when you pay for krypton a transaction at paypal is we will sell the the equivalent amount of your crypto balance we will receive dollars in this case in the us and we will give dollars to the merchant which means that you can totally refund your transaction but but your commitment with the merchant is in that dollar dominated amount and it's also tricky when you're operating in a highly volatile asset that that you don't want to create an incentive in which people will buy with bitcoin and then bitcoin goes up 30 in value and then people have an incentive to say hey i want to cancel my transaction i want my bitcoin back in that we we want to make sure that it is a more useful and easier to transact with but the moment that you're locking that value for a commerce transaction then you are blocking that value yeah yeah this goes back to obviously um for instance things like the bitcoin pizza that now would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars exactly um so in terms of that ability to withdraw some crypto that some a user bought on paypal to their own wallet is uh kind of the the not the hold up but the thing that you're working to develop further would be these security and fraud i guess protections in order to release that kind of capability we will make it easy for people to send that to to other wallets obviously will it be different when they are using that for a commerce from commercial transaction they want to pay with bitcoin at some other commerce where there is a paypal flow or they just want to take it to a hardware to a hardware wallet so in in commercial transactions our protections do apply on a transaction where you are withdrawing a crypto because we want to put it in your wallet basically we want to make it easy for you to do it but there's not really a refund there because it is it is not a payment you're just moving your value around and i do i did also notice that the crypto page in paypal at the moment says that if uh people's account is hacked that paypal will replace their crypto and i was wondering how that was going because hacks are kind of a dime a dozen encrypted there's all kinds of phishing scams and other types of scams so why did paypal decide to do that and are you finding that uh there's kind of a lot of usage of that feature uh so paypal one of my colleagues likes to say that that we present as a payments company but we are very much a cyber security company that happens to deal in value so we have been in in this business for uh for a very long time as you know you were referring uh the activity of the company we are around a trillion in tpv worldwide every year so we are very used to keeping the money of our users safe and cryptocurrent is an extension of that uh yes it's an important commitment we stand by by our commitment i think there's a very important part of our promise to the users that they can trust us and if something happens to the account we will stand by them wow okay that's quite a promise um so for a long while now there's been chatter and that paypal may launch its own stablecoin which you have denied in the past we've seen obviously there is another large company that has been attempting to do this which is facebook and disclosure i do write a newsletter for them but watching what has happened to facebook's efforts with dm particularly in terms of their reception from regulators how does that affect paypal's own plans or even thoughts in this area uh so first of all is too early for us to be discussing specific plans on on the space but but i'm very happy to to have a few ideas on how we are seeing the the world you were talking about dm and talking about the regulatory environment it's obviously a very very active moment now in the in the discussion around regulation of of stable coins and it feels like we we have part of the blessing of of operating a platform that is live in 200 countries is that we are in a position to see what's going on in different parts of the world what i see is in terms of stable representations of value right which would include both cbdc's and unstable coins it feels like the world is evolving in in three directions on the one side you see something like is the the china model meaning these representations of value will be a issued by by the central bank so you have the the electronic juan you have an ec why issued by by the people's bank of china and that is one model so no private stable coins central bank money you have the the the recommendation that was issued by the presidential working group a few days ago where basically they are thinking of something that that i would call more like the positive stable coins so they they're making they're taking an approach in which there are some characteristics of deposits of stable coins that likened them to a bank deposit and so a stable condition should be basically a bank they say an insured depository institution and then there is a model in which which is maybe where europe is going that they're talking about e-money-stable coins uh so this is not a banking deposit this is kind of a store value it's an electronic store of value and then you can be any one institution or a payments company and issue an unstable coin i think that those those three approaches can coexist uh isn't clear on which the how different regions are gonna go in in one way or or the other and and that's part of the debate that i think that we will see happening over the next months and maybe maybe even years how that evolves i think it's going to be an important part of which companies will be willing and able to do what we do believe and we see that part of the requests that that we hear from our clients is that there is a demand for these digital representations of value that are stable we believe that they are a fundamental part of both digital assets becoming more mainstream but also being more accepted for commerce and payments we have been very very vocal that we want to be supportive of cbdc's when they are available dan schulman our ceo has spoken about that we are quite active in the space we are collaborating in the task force that the bank of england and the treasury in the uk have put together to think about uh how a digital fund would look like we are part of the mit's digital currency initiative where we contribute engineering time to developing because one of the things that we see specifically in the cbdc space is the the ratio of powerpoint written to code written is very heavily skewed toward the powerpoint and we want to contribute to the to the code base so we think that stablecoins again are fascinating space which is really really really important uh that that it gets regulated in an appropriate way in which consumers and merchants can have the right guarantees and investor protections uh and there is a prevention of illicit finance in a way that also is not stifling the innovation in the segment and so it sounds like you you know aren't necessarily at least at this moment interested in paypal issuing its own stablecoin that you kind of want to play in all these different areas i'm sure you're well aware there are a lot of commentators who have said that it would probably make a lot of sense for paypal to do something like that is there something a kind of in the regulatory world or maybe in like a type of business opportunity you'd have to see or something in the infrastructure or something else that would finally you know have that make sense for paypal uh i not about it again not specifically about paypal ourselves issuing something or adopting something that is the market i think that for for that to happen especially for even thinking about adopting one of the stable coins that are already out there uh there are a couple of things that that would need to happen on our side as you know we are very much a commerce and payments company we care about commerce and payments use cases unstable coins that we see on the market today and i'm sure that the the audience of of unchained are very adapted using stable coins in their in their daily lives most of those use cases are mostly for trading or for defy protocols and and if you think about stable coins deployed on on ethereum they are a fantastic use case uh if you're going to do a few transactions of a large volume for our use cases we are much more interested in being able to support 10 million transactions of 10 each more than 10 transactions of 10 million each so we need two things to happen in the in the in the space we have not seen a stable coin out there that is purpose built for payments yet uh we see a lot of activity in some of the new protocols and where our engineering teams are doing uh keeping a close eye on how some of these layer new layer one protocols or the layer two evolution on on top of ethereum that will support the throughput and scalability that you need for payments at scale and so the technology getting ready and especially in terms of security throughput and scalability is one aspect the other aspect as we just discussed in the in the prior question is that there is clarity on the regulation and what are the regulatory frameworks and the type of licenses that are needed in this space and so earlier when you were talking about the scalability issues for stable coins that you might adopt are there any particular layer twos or any particular chains in general that look especially promising or or scaling technologies that you're especially interested in we have been doing obviously quite a bit of work on ethereum in general for many of our use cases as as you know this is such a fluid space that doesn't that if i give you names today then those names will be different six months from from now we have been anything that supports interoperability is relevant for us so we have been quite intrigued by things like like polka dot we have been quite intrigued we have been very impressed with the way that the solana the solar ecosystem has been has been growing we have been quite impressed with the growth around algorand i guess that one of the things that that we keep an eye on is we tend to follow developers so where we see interest from the developer ecosystem and developers spending time is is where we think that that good things can happen and and we steer our engineering teams who are working in space towards those same areas i'm sure that if you ask me six weeks from now i could give you four or five different names this is how exciting it is yes i totally understand welcome to my world as a journalist who you know can't definitely can't keep up not that anybody can um but okay yeah no this is fascinating because as you saw from my question you know i was thinking it was um certain other issues that might hold you up on that but of course i hadn't thought about the scaling issue which of course is what everybody's talking about now all right

have been coming up throughout this conversation as i'm sure you're aware fed chair jerome powell did say uh this past summer that one of the reasons for the fed to create a cbdc would be that then stable coins wouldn't be necessary i know that you've said you think stable coins and cbdc's will coexist so can you talk a little bit about more how you see that space developing absolutely and i think that there is no reason if you look at if you work by analogy with what we have today we have electronic money so there are balances people have their paypal balance and unbalances in other in other wallets which are built on top of a fiat money or money that is deposited in banks there is no reason why the same analogy does not exist to the stablecoin world i do believe that we will see stable coins that are backed by by fiat money that is deposited in commercial banks and i do think that we will see a stable coins that are backed by by cbdc's when there is a cbdc out there when you think about what central banks are are doing and what they're trying to optimize for in general terms they're thinking of cv disease as a an instrument that can be advantageous for financial stability and financial inclusion and it's more likely than not that it's going to be by design is going to be issued centrally because it has to be issued by by the central bank from a technology point of view i think it's relatively unlikely that it will deploy those assets on on public blockchains so if you are thinking about what are the implications who is going at the moment that let's imagine that there is a digital dollar or a digital pound or a digital euro that is issued by the central banks in those regions and developers and companies want to use that for for payments or for decentralized finance or for other aspects it's very unlikely that the the fed or the bank of england are going to deploy a digital euro a digital pound or digital dollar on ethereum so somebody will do that that work and you can think of a stable coin backed by a cbdc as kind of a wrapped version of that cbdc it's obviously a different claim so the cbdc the main aspect of it is that is a claim on the central bank that you can take your cdc and go to the central bank and get your your money but it can also be used as a reserve for a private stable coin that then can be deployed across all these protocols that we have been discussing which i i don't think that the central banks are going to be doing that directly all right so yeah we'll we'll have to see all of that plays out um one other thing was you did talk about how you're working with um some of the digital dollar efforts can you talk a little bit more about what you see as the main issues there that need to be resolved before such a you know a digital dollar could be issued it's an extremely complicated project to work on which takes me back to my comment on on we believe that is is is a good moment to start moving from powerpoint to to the code because you will only surface some of those problems as as a cause part of the conversation these days is still relatively high level right so the if you follow the the discussion around the stable coins is still a lot of that is about this is going to be a two-tier system or a one-tier system meaning that is the central bank going to distribute directly to the public or is going to go through distributors who must be regulated financial institutions or telcos or others those are still they are foundational discussions and principles that will impact the development but when you start to get into the into the nitty-gritty of it there are many many detailed questions that the jet that that will need to be solved for instance one of the things that we we keep scratching our heads is in an environment where there is a cbdc the cbdc that is issued and that you carry that in a wallet in your cell phone what happens if the network is is down what happens if there is no mobile connectivity or happens way if there is no uh how do you update the ledger because one of the requirements is that you should be able to transact in any circumstances similar like you transact with with physical cash today and that is not just only one one example other discussion that is very lively and relevant is privacy around stable coins so what is the the presumption of privacy if you're interacting with a with a with a form of money that is issued by by the government and there is a central ledger there are ways to address that but those are both policy and technology conversations that still need to happen i am very very optimistic that we will see a digital money issued by central banks but also i believe that this is going to play over a number of years i don't think that this is something that we're going to see in six or nine or 12 months yeah and about the privacy question what do you think will end up being the most likely way that that's handled because i know a lot of people working on this you know have talked about uh that as kind of one of the main questions and as i'm sure people are well aware um a lot of the criticism of the digital yuan is that it's almost like a surveillance tool so i'm sure you know people would or central banks you know like like uh here in the us or in other democratic countries would you know be sensitive to that concern uh i'm sure that that will be the case and there are technical ways in which we can enable that that privacy i think that we all think that privacy is a good thing and the thing that anonymity might be a different thing so there are as we said it's important to have controls in place that prevent illicit finance activity going through these instruments so there have to be ways in which in which you need to be able to monitor that activity and prevent that activity from happening but there are ways in which you can enable flows where the data is stored in different places the access rights are different the technology will be there i think that we are still need to have or or the the the central banks need to have the the policy debates as well on how there will be a menu of options and you will be enabled more or less uh privacy i don't think that the technology is going to be over here for for that so another theme that has been coming up throughout the conversation is regulatory issues i'm sure you're well aware that that is probably one of the biggest topics on everybody's mind especially in the crypto community in the us and to my mind one of the biggest uh core tensions is this issue of whether or not to apply regulations that have been built for a model that uses intermediaries to crypto which obviously the purpose of it is to replace intermedia intermediaries with software some people are advocating that there be new regulations i'm sure you're aware that there are some regulations or some guidance on regulations already that is kind of pushing for crypto to keep the model using intermediaries what do you think is the best approach i know you're very active also on this contributing to that world economic forum report on regulation yeah so i i think that there are a few things that are relevant here first for the ecosystem to develop and for digital assets to become mainstream there has to be regulation of the space i think that is important that there is clarity and if you talk to many actors in the space when they're thinking about jumping in or adopting more broadly part of the deterrent is hey we don't know how the regulation of this environment is going to be so regulation is a prerequisite for this sector that that we love and believe that has a ton of promise to to flourish and develop so it has to happen your question is explicitly on do we need a new framework or can can we adjust the existing framework i think the little experience is that we have so far because this has happened in a in a short amount of time is that the places that have developed specific frameworks for this have been more successful in driving that innovation if you think the maybe the most prominent example in the in the us is new york with their virtual currency framework and the famous big licenses where there is there might be people in favor or against but there is clarity so you know unders do you understand where what you need to comply with maybe an international equivalent of that is germany where there is uh they went exactly in in the way that that you were suggesting in your question or stating in your question which is hey this is not exactly the same instruments that we have seen in the past and it's not just about fitting these new instruments into the old regulation because that would be a little bit of the or the square peg in the round hole maybe we need to make sure that there is a new framework developed for this and that is informing the mica regulation in europe and is also part of the recommendation that the presidential working group was was issuing a few days ago where they're saying hey we it looks like we need new a new framework for this and they were requesting from congress to issue legislation here uh it it feels to me that there are places that will benefit a lot from from being purpose built for the specificities of digital assets it doesn't mean that we need to start everything from from scratch if you are in the us there are very good instruments that are already in place both from the state regulatory system and the federal regulatory system that might be very applicable to what we are all trying to do but these assets are different and working by analogy mike might help us at the beginning but there's going to be a moment in which these digital assets start to have use cases that are not just working by analogy and are totally brand new use cases and the existing framework might not be as easy to adapt okay yeah we'll see how this plays out because i'm sure you're well aware that there are definitely people in the government both regulators and i think legislators who seem to uh believe the opposite that the existing frameworks apply um so another area you know that sort of brings a new frontier to things is that crypto networks uh you know kind of offer things like interest if you offer services on the network such as staking or lending crypto does paypal ever see that its offering would allow users the opportunity to participate in things like that we we are considering what we should do in a world where where that moves more and more toward proof of stake what is the best way to provide access for for that we have not formal plans about it yet but we see not only in terms of of staking but as the environment moves from asset accumulation if you want to asset to uh to the management of those assets and what is the the ability to both derive returns from those assets but also participates in the ecosystem is the demand that the public will will have so we need to we need to be ready to to address that we don't have a formal plans on it yet but we are seeing that as more and more something that will be relevant in the in the midterm maybe even in the short term and similarly other centralized crypto companies like coinbase robin hood they're also developing non-custodial or self-hosted wallets for crypto users does paypal ever see that it would also create products like that we believe that it's important that that the users can move their their crypto outside the paypal ecosystem and that's why we announced that we were we are going to be enabling a transfers from from their paypal wallet to crypto wallets that they host outside and it feels to me that that's like 90 of the functionality that you would have with a unhosted wallet most of our users what we are seeing is part of the reasons that they are interacting with us is because they like the trust of the on the paypal side so they they are they don't want to get into the complexity of handling their own digital keys or or their own private keys so we don't see a ton of demand on our side for us to offer a standalone wallet we believe that we can provide that connectivity to the protocols and the rest of the ecosystem by enabling on-site transfers from the wallet that we have today okay so but if demand if there was demand from your customers you would consider doing something like that our product roadmap is very much driven by the demand from our consumers so when when when the environment changes we definitely adapt to to that and it's one of those where you can say never say never er but it's not something that we are seeing right now okay and so you know about this ethos of decentralization and also participation what role do you see centralized companies such as paypal playing we are you know i'm sure you're aware seeing that some companies are doing things like participating in governance of decentralized networks would paypal ever consider doing something like that decentralization is something that obviously is very is very core to the to the ethos of of the system but but decentralization is not a binary state so there are different degrees of of the centralization we want to support the decentralized environment we think that is we think that the benefit and of of this is that is built on open source we don't think that is on our role to be to be relevant actors in the governance of specific protocols so that actually is not our role to play and probably would be perceived by the community as i in my conversations to the community i don't think that they feel like the place of corporates is being very involved in the governance of these protocols we want to enable our users who choose to work with that with us to be able to exercise their their rights but i don't see ourselves being very active in the governance of any of these protocols anytime soon we want to support it and we think again as we said that decentralization doesn't mean that is uh that doesn't mean atomization it means that there is no there is not a central point of view of paypal by design obviously we are a corporation we are a centralized entity coinbase is a centralized entity and robin hood is a centralized entity so we think that there is the push towards decentralization happens when you are able to make the cost of contracting cheaper so the one of the reasons i keep saying that i the the reason that i work at paypal is because it would be really really cumbersome to show up at the office every day or at our remote office and negotiate a contract about what i'm going to be doing that day and then do that again and again and again is that that cost of contracting that pushes towards centralization so there is an advantage in centralization what is important is that we have the right degree of centralization that supports all that activity and that there is not a high level of concentration so there will be again i think that we should discuss between decentralization and which is a beneficial and full-grown optimization which might be something that we are far from yeah no i i think um what you're talking about is it kind of spot on with some of the feeling in the community because i think it i think this was for the ens governance token i did see i think it i i'll make a correction if it wasn't this if it was a different project but coinbase was named a delegate and i did see some commentary on twitter like why would you delegate to coinbase and you know kind of people criticizing that so i think you're right that there is some sensitivity around centralized corporations but i find it fascinating that they are participating um and you know andreessen also did publish something about how it's thinking about participating governance so clearly this is this is a question um so one other thing that i found fascinating was your ceo has talked about some problems of the legacy of financial system saying that it can be more expensive for poorer people to use and cheaper for wealthier people use and i know earlier in your career you were head of emerging markets at paypal and i wondered what opportunities you saw for crypto and for paypal through its crypto offerings to address those kinds of issues as you were saying we are a company that has financial inclusion at heart and and then shulman over ceo and all the company think very very strongly feel very strongly about it i do believe and one of the reasons that drove me to the space was this promise about the ability to help with financial inclusion and especially creating financial opportunity in emerging markets isn't one's a question though i'll tell you what i do think that i that i see impact now and where i see impact in the future i think that in the short term where these instruments are going to be a most effective is in helping on the on the small business side and and supporting entrepreneurs and companies in these markets who can accept payments for abroad uh at a lower cost and and faster one uh when i was as you were saying in the past in my capacity as a head of emerging markets strategy for paypal but also running the our business in in the south american markets the spanish-speaking markets i've seen firsthand the impact that we can have for a small merchant that is running a scuba diving school in costa rica and he wants to accept payments from tourists in the us and their local bank is going to charge them hundreds of dollars per month to accept credit cards and the travelers from the u.s don't want to give them their the credit card number because they don't know the merchants on the other side so for that when you can enable either through cbdc's or state the positive state will go and see money stable coins you name it but if you can provide a way in which th that business can uh export more and get more business and get more revenue by adopting digital currencies i that's where i see the short-term impact on financial inclusion and opportunity in emerging markets first a lot of the conversation around digital assets and cryptocurrency in the context of emerging economies has been more about remittances and how you can send funds from the us to kenya and people can receive that on a on a mobile wallet that exists what we have not been able to solve yet is the last mile so imagine that i can send a funds from the from the u.s to my family in kenya and people will receive that in a mobile wallet but if they still have if that value that i have sent them if they cannot use it widely in the market and still they need to go to a cash agent in kenya to convert that digital value into cash because that's what they can use in in their day-to-day then we still have 80 percent of the cost there basically we reduced the cost of the long haul which is not where the problem was and we still have the problem of the of the last mile uh that's why for instance things like what is going on in in nigeria when we have a cbdc that is issued by a central bank in one of these markets and that cbdc can be legal tender meaning that you that that the public will be more used and uh to interact in digital value and merchants will be accepting that so that you don't have that intermediate and expensive step of converting into cash that is where where that is the prerequisite that we need for the consumer side of emerging markets in in because then is then is different then i can send any stable coin to that wallet in kenya or in nigeria and they can either use it directly or convert it into a digital token that is accepted in the market but until that last mile of acceptance is implemented in the market i think that the consumer uh part of it will take a little bit to develop and so i'm sorry you're saying that it would need to be a stable coin in the local fiat currency accepted in this digitally native uh form i think that we we need to have acceptance in the day-to-day of non-cash non-physical cash forms of value for that work yeah yeah i've seen crypto people talk about how you know when people talk about stable coins they're typically just talking about us dollar pegs stable coins and i've noticed when i interview sources in europe or asia or whatever they will they will say oh at that time the value of bitcoin or ether was x and they quoted to me in u.s dollars not their local currency so it's it's fascinating that yeah um right now uh in the crypto world payments are very very local and one thing that happens with i i live in single silicon valley part of sometimes you see that perspective from silicon valley is a little bit simplistic in that sense and assuming that every that is the that word you're gonna invent from here is gonna is gonna apply everywhere uh those components that you're saying so local currencies local regulation the local last mile and the the distribution network and the merchant network of those digital currencies they are issues that are quite frankly not technology issues some of them are business issues or they are policy issues but you need to be able for that to be to be effective even in the case of mobile money and pesa and kenya is always a highlighted as the success story for non-crypto but mobile money but even when you look at other cases in in in africa kenny is a little bit of the outlier so empeza has been very successful there but mobile wallets in other markets have been less successful so we are we are all making steps toward the main goal but i think that i see short-term impact uh on the business side before i see that on the on the consumer side in these markets yeah so we'll have to see how all this plays out i feel like you know the the ideal of crypto is all this democratization and um we haven't seen too much of it yet um but something that is all the rage now is nfts and the metaverse um you know i just thought i would throw this out there i don't know how paypal might get involved but do you see a role for paypal or would you just limit yourself to kind of the financial areas of crypto oh i totally see a role for us in in nfts and it is interesting us as we discuss at the very beginning we've been on on the paypal side working on this maybe for the last three or four years i i've been in the space maybe for the last six and i have to say that nfts is one of those that grew way faster than i that i expected it to grow it feels like it was only only one year ago we were thinking about it as something that yes it will happen eventually at some point in time and then all of a sudden the the storm unleashed and i think that we're just at the very very beginning of of it i personally have really really high hopes and high expectations that it will extend way beyond what we are seeing today in terms of collectibles and arts and art and we will see digital tokens that can unlock experiences in the real world whether they are that your ticket to a concert is issued as a as a non-vulnerable token or any other of a zillion use cases that the developers are hard working at what do we see as pain points and places like where where we can contribute again in the spirit in the spirit of how we built our initial retail product in terms of making a is a easy experience for a non-sophisticated user to begin with i think that applies very much to buying an nft today the experience of buying an nft today is the number of hoops that you need to go through so you need to know that let's use the the erc20 case you need to know that you you need to buy ether and then you need to get that ether into a metamask wallet and then you need to go into an nftmr marketplace and then you need to buy something uh there and then your token exists in some version and you don't really know what to do with it you said and then you get rug fold yes so that that goes to the protection side as well so that is something that is definitely on the on the early adopter side is not yet a mainstream experience for for a curious but not sophisticated user so i think that we definitely have a role to play on how do we enable a seamless payment experience for nfts i think it's something that that we feel like we have a role to play many of our merchants and partners and and especially on the media sector they are asking for that you say hey can you please make it easy for our users to engage with these with this nfts and then the other part of it is same that i that it impacts to the two payments impacts to the custody so how can people interact with those uh nfts and where are they going to live so it's something that we are monitoring very closely we think there is a space for us there is a very very rapidly developing system ecosystem uh and we are in the very early stages but definitely we feel like we have a role to play there yeah yeah i guess now that i think about it of course i did have someone from visa on my show uh kaisha felt the head of crypto there and he also talked about and so it does make sense and yeah i started imagining all kinds of partnerships you might do but speaking of future things or things coming down the pike i'm sure the listeners will be curious when are you going to add new cryptos and how are you deciding which ones to add so when when we started we wanted to make sure that that again that we were capturing a significant part of the market cap of crypto and we but also that we were that make sure that the assets that we were putting in front of our users were of very high quality and and we consider that we are that we have this responsibility of providing a created experience in the short year that we have been in the market i think that we all have seen that a lot of the growth in the markets has gone out it has happened outside the traditional tokens out there so what with industry calls bitcoin dominance has decreased significantly and we expect obviously that bitcoin will will continue to be there for a long time but we are seeing a ton of growth outside those more traditional tokens so and we see that that demand from our consumers so people want to see more tokens on their on their paypal wallet so we will be looking into that it's something that that again as i said we are our roadmap is very much driven by our consumer requests and the best way to influence our product roadmap is to reach out and say hey we would like to see to see this is very important on on our side that that again that when we make the decision to add additional tokens that they are very high quality and a really high standard so we're going to have a very high bar i don't expect that you're never going to that the vehicle will never be the place where you go and see 150 different tokens we want to make sure that that we can address the main themes uh and that we can again take care of our users as they explore what they want to do next so you're not going to try to take on uniswap or anything like that i'm just kidding assets uh but but it is but but we see that we see the demand from our users saying we will offer we see and we would love to see a more and a larger offering of tokens on the app so what is your vision for what paypal's crypto offerings will look like maybe let's say three to five years from now i was trying to figure out if you had asked me that question three years ago i would not have been speaking about cbdc's and nfts and things like that because i don't think anybody was speaking about about that uh i think that we we need to be open-minded and humble in first in our role in the system and how how much do we know because they did i have no idea but whether three or five years from now we are going to be talking about decentralized computing and all the rates is going to be how you can be processing or whether we are going to be talking about a federated identity or or what is going to be the next the next band of of the road what i know is that that we are here to stay so we are a company that cares a lot about financial inclusion opportunity and we think that these assets are a fundamental part of driving that the next wave we think that is a really intriguing opportunity to actually have significant payment activity in on new rails whether that cbdc's or private stable coins or something else which is very close and very core to our business uh and we believe that that also that identity is going to be a very important part of that and and that we have a role to play around digital identity yes as well so if you were to ask me i think that in addition to nft cbdc is a stable coin and all of that the places were that the one of the places that i'm the most intrigued about these days is digital identity and how that is going to play in a decentralized world oh that's fascinating and it's so basically you're you you think that maybe paypal would yeah would kind of basically offer some kind of digital identity for its users uh i i don't know how it would look like again is this three to five years is from now it's a different planet but but this is one one place where where i think that we see a demand again from from consumers but also from regulators and also from from merchants so somebody will need i don't think that five years from now when you want to have a transaction in in two wallets what we're gonna do is to send someone a inordinate number of characters of the wallet on protocol x or protocol y there has to be some type of interoperability and portability of of credentials that you can use to identify your yourself and just jumping off from that i did want to maybe circle back to this super app vision for paypal um and i don't remember how clearly we defined it earlier in the show but you know this is kind of the vision of something like a wechat but here in the west where it would support messaging saving shopping etc and one thing you know when i was thinking about that i was also thinking about how in crypto as i'm sure you're aware things are very community driven sometimes almost a little bit religious and i'm sure you're you know aware that a lot of crypto communities will congregate in different telegram groups or in discord channels and i wondered how you saw that kind of like cultural aspect of crypto uh maybe or or how you saw paypal as the super app kind of capitalizing on that cultural aspect of crypto again i think that this goes back to to our a humility i we have the the atmos of respects for the community i i don't think that that we want to interfere with the community we're here to to serve the community and to listen to to it if the community chooses to go and interact with people on a messaging a service that happens on the people side fantastic but part of the benefit of that cultural aspect of crypto is that the community will generate use cases that that i am not able to think about and people will not think about and corporates will will not think about so they bring a totally different lens there i think that our role there is to listen to what they have to say and and to amplify their their voice uh and and provide them with the tools and the and the infrastructure i think that actually i'm really interested in on we can do on the technical work to make sure that we provide the tools for developers and that we can able to provide the right environment and the right security for them to build a crypto products on top of what we can offer and if they choose to to use us from a retail perspective that is fantastic but they are the ones who are driving the system forward all right well this has been a fascinating conversation where can people learn more about you and paypal there are a number of uh places that where you can learn more about us there are landing pages on the crypto side but obviously we have grown our team significantly over the last year and then we have spending quite a bit of time on in outreach and and finding a candidates and explaining our stories so that everybody can reach us on on our landing pages on our reports and we are more and more present in bds as we continue to to develop what we think are a worthy efforts to push the ecosystem forward perfect well thank you so much
