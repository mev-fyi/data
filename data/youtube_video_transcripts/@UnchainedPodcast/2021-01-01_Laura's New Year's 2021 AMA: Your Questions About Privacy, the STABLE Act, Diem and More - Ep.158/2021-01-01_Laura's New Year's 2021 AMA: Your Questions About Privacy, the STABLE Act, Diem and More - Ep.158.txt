questions i solicited from twitter next time if i get my act together in time and i'm not juggling five bajillion things at once i will solicit them on the show so you can record your questions so here goes zur rez asks what do you think about privacy designed blockchain so it's kind of interesting because these blockchains are sort of under attack i guess you could say from regulation right now malcolm demir has actually talked about this in the episode that i did with her and lynne alden um where she said that that's kind of the main thing she'll be looking at for 2021 and i think um you know we at the so at the moment that i'm recording this we only have um rumors about what type of regulation it was that uh treasury secretary steve mnuchin wanted to put on crypto right now because i think actually you know privacy coins were in the crosshairs and this was something that jessie liu who came on unconfirmed talked about uh she was the what was it former district attorney i think for washington dc she's prosecuted um a ton of cases around um some of the biggest ones involving like illegal use of bitcoin and by actor state actors like north korea or you know by the the child porn website in in korea welcome to video and and some of the other big criminals like terrorists and stuff anyway point is she highlighted that um as something that she was noticing in i can't remember it was the the dod enforcement framework actually and um i do think that you know this is going to be something that comes up again because brian brooks the acting controller of the currency also kind of you know when i asked him about what how he thought the us might regulate privacy he said oh well you know the us is different from the other countries because we're um we're the victims of terrorism or something or we're subject to terrorism or something like that and he said that he thought people would be willing to make a trade-off for that which i thought was very interesting i really was curious to know what the crypto community's reaction was to that comment um but yeah so i think we're going to see that kind of come up as a battle and i actually i would be surprised if in the end there wasn't some way to have um blockchains that feature privacy prominently because in a way i can't imagine the technology really taking off in all the ways that it could take off if there wasn't such a feature and you even see that like in um a forthcoming episode i have on unconfirmed it's a panel discussion but there is somebody from the federal reserve who talks about building systems for central bank digital currencies who says you know flat out like you can't design these systems unless you have privacy um as a consideration from the beginning he said it cannot be an afterthought and you know and he's time out for central bank digital currency so i really do think that at least some of these blockchains will have to feature it prominently and i i don't think that we're going to end up with blockchains that just don't have it at all i would be surprised you know on a long enough time scale i do think in the in the beginning there might be a bit of a battle but i think after we get real adoption then i would be very surprised if we don't start to see more privacy features um somebody named p zero ochre wrote do you endorse the stable act um i don't endorse anything that i feature on the show um whether yeah i just i don't endorse anything um i know a lot of people in the crypto community were very much against the stable act which was the bill that was introduced by um representatives rashida tlaib and some others that basically said you know if you want to issue a stable coin then you have to apply for a bank charter and you know obviously their reasoning for it was a little bit confusing which is what i asked him about the uh one of the advisors to the act rowan gray who's a professor at willamette university law a school of law i asked him oh you know representative talib said that she thought that the the reason for the act or for the bill was that it would prevent uh stable coin issuers from perpetrating the same types of crimes that big banks had perpetrated against disadvantaged populations and so i asked him flat out how does turning stable coin issuers in the banks prevent them from doing the the crimes that banks did and you can listen to the show he had great answers for pretty much every question i asked him i thought and you know i thought it was very interesting to hear his viewpoints um but you know yeah just for like if you ever hear anything on my show um i wouldn't say that just because it's on my show that i'm endorsing it and you know that applies for everything across the board the serumist asks do you think facebook's dm formerly known as libra is going to have a negative or positive impact on the broader crypto ecosystem i think what will probably happen is that in the long run it will have a positive impact i think what might happen is it might be a little bit like aol in that it you know as aol was to the internet in the sense that it might just get people into the the crypto world or into the blockchain world i should say and help them learn how to transact very quickly and easily with this kind of technology and just get them you know into digital money generally and um and you know teach them like how to use a wallet and and you know send transactions with your phone and um perhaps maybe even you know do other things or or or at least have access to be able to do slightly more interesting things with the technology and so in that regard like i think just teaching people some of the basic behaviors around how to use it is going to be extremely useful you know one thing that i think kind of gives me pause and saying that it will definitely be positive for the broader ecosystem is just that because um facebook is as big as it is and because as i said regulation is going to play a bigger role in um the world of blockchain technology i believe than it did in the the internet in general um so i just wonder if the fact that it's an entity that can be regulated and that so many people will have access to this i wonder if that will kind of in a way um just make it a place where people kind of stay rather than venturing off into some of the other blockchains and that's something that i'll just be interested to watch it it'll be kind of a curious thing to see if if that you know does happen however i'm sure as we are all quite well aware facebook is no darling of the regulators and i think pretty much the vast majority of people would agree that giving faith a company like facebook more power over yet another aspect of our digital lives um you know maybe isn't the best idea so um and i know people say that dm is you know not owned by facebook but you know it was created by facebook they hired a lot of the initial people for the foundation etc so clearly you know it's in the dna of that organization um you know over time who knows maybe it will really be a lot more independent um but there's just no question that from the beginning it will be very very tied to facebook so in that regard um it really could go either way it really it really could um all right so we're gonna let's take a quick ad break uh right now uh these are the sponsors who make this show possible thank you to them and um yes in a moment i will answer more of your questions today's episode is brought to you by block native block native is the easiest way to build and

lee asks what's one thing you missed from pre covid about the crypto community oh um what's one thing i miss pre-code oh boy um you know i think the obvious thing to say would be um obviously the in-person gatherings and that really runs the gamut in the sense that um some of them are you know kind of like smaller gatherings of people that yeah are just like lovely and you you know just get to hang out and chat and um and just talk about all the crazy things going on in our world um which i really miss um but i actually think a lot of those also happen around conferences and so even as we all love to hate on some of the big conferences um just the fact that those do bring together such a huge proportion of people and then um we can all go off and and have our separate meetings and and little uh dinners and parties and whatever aside from that like i think um yeah that's really fun and um yeah i miss i miss those so and i i just want to give a shout out and thank you to all the people who've invited me to so many wonderful things like in uh some really lovely destinations as well that i've been able to attend and yeah that was just something i never expected from falling in love with uh bitcoin um but that is what uh has happened to me and uh has been a really fun part of the ride okay bad crypto bunny asks how do we use b chain blockchain and crypto to weed out propaganda and false news stories okay so um this i don't know if you guys followed that whole thing that happened with that startup civil it was like a consensus spoke it basically was this media company um or they were trying to launch their own blockchain the civil blockchain with a token cvl that was going to i don't even quite know but somehow like i think verify the stories on the blockchain or something like that or put the stories on the blockchain and they did actually attract some really big names like i remember i think the uh the ceo or the editor-in-chief or something was like a big name for npr unfortunately i forgot her name um but yeah there were there were a lot of like you know people from well-respected publications that had joined in and i do know um manush zamaroti who does the zigzag podcast um she had done note to self before and i think joined up with civil as far as part of the zigzag podcast and if you listen to the first episode the first like season or two of that you know i mean it's basically chronicling of like first of all the pitch to them and how they joined on and like how they thought like oh like this is going to solve some of the ills of our industry etc etc and you know then obviously the civil project ended up failing just because it did not raise anywhere near as much as it aimed to raise in its ico and so it sort of like never even got to get going um and yeah i i now i i actually i should reach out to manush i know i don't know what she's doing i think she still does the zigzag podcast but i don't know how she's funding it maybe just normal ads or something but the point is that you know i always was a little skeptical about how they were going to use the blockchain to verify their news stories i mean was it just going to be very discreet facts that were like easily verifiable i mean there's there's obviously a whole subset of facts where yeah you could um do it that way but you'd have to phrase them just so because there's like 20 different ways you can state the same fact and so what are you going to do put all those 20 hashes on the blockchain and they all represent the one factor you know i don't know so yeah it wasn't clear to me how they were going to do that and like this reminds me of i think it was like stampery there was some early um blockchain startup where you know i kind of like did a little interview with the guy um just to find out kind of like how they were thinking about it and it was some kind of they were they were pitching it almost like it was a notary um but then i said well what if someone puts like a lie on the blockchain and he's like yeah we're not gonna we're not verifying whether or not these are accurate and so then i was like okay well then what's the point of this like if i just take a spam email that somebody sent to me at 12 noon on friday and i stick that on stampery like how was that useful you know i mean and he was like yeah well then we know that you know you had that spam email at that time and i was like okay this is like i was just like why why um so yeah so all of those kinds of similar questions i think would exist for any kind of blockchain that aims to address the issue of false news stories um because i think what would happen is you know you always do not always but every once in a while there is a news story that like needs some kind of correction on it and so what then if there's like a tiny little fact wrong that's like immaterial to the story but you know needs to be corrected but then is the story somehow invalidated or i don't anyway so i just i really i don't know how that's gonna work so jared zemp asks what are the best pick and shovel plays in crypto right now okay well you know because we're uh somewhere in the ballpark of roughly a year away from a coinbase ipo um i would probably say coinbase um is you know i mean clearly they're already sort of the proven on-ramp to a crypto in the us um which is the easiest place to buy uh and just convert your fiat into any kind of crypto and you know obviously now they also offer stable coins so i think um just in terms of like on-ramp like i still feel like we're in the days where we need to just or where the industry would want to get more people on board and into the system and learning how to use this stuff so so that would be one um i i do think in general uh any kind of exchange obviously so far has proven to be has proven to be a good business i would say also that right now i think we're starting to see a lot of kind of like specialization amongst the different players so you know i know paxos is um serving as the back end for a number of big companies including uh paypal and so i think you know that is just sort of like a niche that they're carving out for themselves and i could see a lot of other players picking different niches um you know like whether it be custody or um staking or you know whatever so i think we're just going to see a lot of that and i think any kind of company where you see somebody owning an important niche for crypto that's probably probably going to make sense at this moment rather than actually you know some of the bigger more wild things that are probably more exciting to the rest of us so the last two questions are not like in the previous ama i did last week i had some about about journalism and being a reporter and stuff um they were a little bit more crypto focused these are not but these are just the last questions i have um matthew murray asks what distinguishes a journalist from an entertainer okay i don't even know where this question comes from i'm just going to answer it straight i i don't think journalists really do their job thinking about necessarily providing entertainment i think they come at the job from thinking about um informing people um but also doing it in a way that is appealing to them and that will get their attention um whereas an entertainer you know isn't going around like trying to figure out what the facts are um in addition to getting their attention they just want people's attention so they're willing to say anything and um and whether or not they've fact-checked it is completely immaterial so um so that's probably actually what distinguishes them uh one does the reporting and um make sure that or tries to the best of their ability to make sure that all the facts are correct and the other does not need to do that at all which i'm sure actually is quite liberating but but yeah that's not how we journalists do it all right um and then last question from archanfaust is what are your thoughts on the state of media and journalism in america so i think the main thing that i think about right now is just the business model which has come up a few times across the last ama and this one which you know like pretty much the whole of my career in journalism has been through this massive disruption of the media industry and it's just so crazy because um you know my first real journalism job was at newsweek.com and the reason that that is very fascinating is because this was at night in in the year 1998 when um newsweek was the thing but like newsweek.com like what was that like people didn't know what that was and i didn't know what that was and i show up and it's like you know i forgot like somewhere between seven and nine people and um it's just like this like little operation and we only did gosh i think we only did like three or four stories a day and they were very very very short and um it was just yeah anyway looking back it was slightly comical now that we've seen what the internet has grown into um but the point that i'm talking about is that when i showed up there i was like newsweek.com okay great that i get to work with all these news week editors but i want to wait for the magazine like i don't want to wait for newsweek.com and you know there were like a few very very tiny things i did get to write for the magazine and i was like so excited about those and and of course you know i enjoyed fighting writing for new york newsweek.com because i just love writing and so that was super fun for me but um you know it was like the magazine was it and i just did not see at all that the dot-com stuff was the future even though my next job was at wsj.com again the dot-com not the newspaper so i again was like how can i get to the newspaper and i remember at that time like kara swisher went to the wall street journal and was constantly reading her and i was just like wow like you know she has the life like this looks fun and this also was the time when the focus really was the newspaper in the sense that all stories were written for the newspaper and the role of the website was simply to put the newspaper stories online like that was our job and yes we had other things we did like we took the wire stories and kind of from dow jones and like we packaged them for wall street journal readers and um and there were there were some like special sections we did that were just online and things like that so it wasn't like completely just this remote copy paste thing and like you know make it nice for the web but um but that was like basically the main function and obviously things now are so different you know things are like written for the web first and then whatever you know makes it to the paper mixed with paper you know the next job i had again new york times dot com so and and even this whole time literally this is over the span of you know i forget how many years the first years of my career i still always just was like i want to be at the real publication it took me so long i like i think it was like you know like 10 years into this disruption before i realized like oh the web is the thing like um so the point is all i'm trying to say is that weirdly here i am um 22 years later and i'm a little bit like oh the media industry is only just now kind of figuring out the business model for the web um you know obviously the the experience of the new york times with their digital subscriptions has been like huge for them um you know the wall street journal got that like way earlier but of course they have a lot of people who get their um companies to pay for their subscriptions uh but i think you know the washington post has seen a pretty good uptake on their subscriptions and my old employer forbes just instituted their their own subscription model um you know before they were only advertising focus like most of the web so i really think that and we're seeing this more and more you know quartz bloomberg i mean just all these places they all now have subscription-based models which is what it was like in the old days you know i remember growing up as a kid my parents would oh my god our household was filled with magazines because they just subscribed to all these places the way that they consume their media was to pay the media companies and get the magazines so i wonder if people will just pay more for media um frankly i hope so because that's how it used to be like i said i literally think my parents subscribe to like i don't know at least 20 different magazines like i remember we got newsweek and then and um sorry newsweek and us news and time like all three of them you know it wasn't like they just picked one they got all three yeah i'm still curious to see how business models continue to get disrupted in my own industry um you know i feel very lucky that um i've managed to ride the whole the wave in the podcast boom to have my own shows that support me independently like you know this again has affected my own career again it's like a disruptive thing in media um but i think that i was like lucky it was like just at the right time and i was like somewhat early not super early but like early enough so yeah so these are the main things i think about a lot when it comes to media and journalism in the states it's probably not exactly what you were asking um but this is just what i think about because you know this is how i want to continue to make my living for the rest of my life all right you guys that's it thanks so much for tuning in there won't be any news for you camp this week um as we did last week because me and my staff are all off for the break don't forget we
