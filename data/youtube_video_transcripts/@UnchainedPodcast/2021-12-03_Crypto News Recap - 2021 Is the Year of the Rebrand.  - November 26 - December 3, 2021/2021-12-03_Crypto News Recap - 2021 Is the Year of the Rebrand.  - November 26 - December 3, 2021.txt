[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap before we dive in i just wanted to urge you to check out four articles that i published this week on medium i read about the graph protocol which is basically a decentralized google as well as why one of its potential competitors decided to instead help support the graph and become one of its core dev teams on facebook bulletin i explain the tokenomics of both bitcoin and ethereum if you need a refresher on how to value btc or eth or know a friend that is just falling down the crypto rabbit hole go check out these primers on my bulletin page all four links will be in the show notes for this episode first story about your dow hack left one user minus 906 btc badger dao a d5 protocol built to provide yield on bitcoin fell victim to an attack on wednesday night badr dao tweeted badger has received reports of unauthorized withdrawals of user funds as badger engineers investigate this all smart contracts have been paused to prevent further withdrawals according to peckshield the total loss is over 120 million dollars based on peck shell data it appears roughly 85 of the 120 million dollars came from four large bitcoin addresses which lost 906 491 203 and 184 btc respectively equating to losses approximating 51 million dollars 27 million dollars 11.4 million dollars and 10.3 million dollars as a press time thursday afternoon the cause of the exploit has yet to be confirmed however tritium or tritium or some pronunciation like that a bad core contributor speculated in the discord that it could be a front end issue with the badger.com user interface tritium wrote there is no problem with the smart contracts it looks like a bunch of users had approvals set for the exploit addresses allowing them to operate on their vault funds and that was exploited once we noticed we froze all the vaults so nothing can move and are trying to figure out where the approvals came from how many people have them and what next steps are such an attack which targets the front end of battery dow rather than the decentralized protocol itself raises many questions which a badger dao discord member named sciguy laid out in the main discord chat this hack has really opened up a can of worms for questions for me one how can we make sure what we approve in metamask is legit two how can funds be moved even with a rogue approval from a ledger secured wallet eg if i swap a coin on uniswap i must manually hit the buttons on my ledger twice once for the approval and once for the actual swap how is this hack possible three how the heck does a front end attack happen does this mean he hacked the server and uploaded a modified contract so when users click claim they get his while badger devs have yet to release any answers to the above questions eagerl capitals cryptocat vc pointed out on twitter that front-end exploits can be avoided through proper metamask approval hygiene practicing proper wallet approval techniques can save users from giving defy unlimited allowances on certain tokens a feature deployed by dapps where users only have to approve the wallet dap connection once rather than for every token deposit while convenient this setup leaves users funds at risk as hackers have shown the ability to drain users wallets giving unlimited allowance to d5 protocols to allow this cryptocup vc explained don't trust the site's ui take the address manually from the metamask data and look at that contract on etherscan she added never approve more than you plan to use you can always approve more in the future yes it costs a few more dollars so is psychological help once you will get rugged square rebrands to block square the jackdoor sealed payments firm is rebranding its corporate and identity to block according to a press release on wednesday since launching in 2009 square has expanded its scope to include a variety of crypto linked services including square crypto a square offshoot focused on bitcoin

to building out services for crypto assets square also purchased roughly 170 million dollars of btc back in february the rebrand acknowledges that square is no longer just a payments company specializing in commerce solutions software and banking services for seller businesses says the company we built the square brand out for our seller business which is where it belongs said jack dorsey co-founder and ceo of block block is a new name but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same much like how facebook's rebranded meta did not alter the name of facebook the social media app disclosure i write a newsletter for facebook meta block explained that its name change only distinguishes the corporate identity from the other parts of the company like square cash up title and tbd 545-66975 and each of those entities will keep its name square crypto however is rebranding to spiral a term the company thinks reflects on the nature of bitcoin as it continues to grow like a spiral from a single point encompassing more and more space until it touches everything the news comes just on the heels of block ceo jack dorsey stepping down from the ceo position at twitter the social media app he co-founded in june dorsey famously explained if i were not at square or twitter i'd be working on bitcoin if it needed more help than square and twitter i will leave them for bitcoin dorsey told the crowd at bitcoin2021 with his time at twitter over and squares rebrand to block it appears that dorsey is making his summer statement reality metaverse land is going fast metaverse

attempting to figure out how to use bitcoin as collateral for cash loans allison cites three sources familiar with the plans goldman was working on getting approved for lending against collateral and tri-party repo said one source and if they had a liquidation agent then they were just doing secured lending without ever having bitcoin touch their balance sheet coinbase and fidelity digital assets were mentioned as potential candidates with whom the us banks are in discussion goldman and a handful of other big banks are attempting to follow in the footsteps of digital asset friendly banks like silvergate and signature both of which already released a bitcoin-backed cash loan program earlier this year 31 million was lost in a d5 hack spanning ethereum and polygon approximately 31 million dollars in cryptocurrencies were stolen from mono x in a hack on november 30th monox a d5 platform specializing in liquidity pools saw about 18.2 million dollars in wrapped eats stolen along with 10.5 million dollars in matic other tokens were taken as well according to security researcher mood at gupta the exploit was caused by a smart contract bug that led to incorrect price updates when doing token swaps he added the attacker did a bunch of swaps from monox token to monox token to pump the price of monox token in the system once the price was obscenely high they swapped their monox tokens for all the other assets in the system in a postmortem monox noted that it has a 1 million insurance pool which it is working on distributing monox also hinted that more compensation could be coming for affected users please note that fixing the issue is at the forefront of our thoughts and most importantly how we can restore what was lost by our community be on the lookout for a compensation
