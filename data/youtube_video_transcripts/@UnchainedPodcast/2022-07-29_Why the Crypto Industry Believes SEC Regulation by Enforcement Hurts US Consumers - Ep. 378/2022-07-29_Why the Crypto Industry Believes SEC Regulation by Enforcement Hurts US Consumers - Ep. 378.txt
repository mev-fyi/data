association welcome marissa hi laura thanks so much for having me i've been a fan of your podcast for a while well thanks so much for listening last week the crypto world was rocked by charges by the securities and exchange commission against a former coinbase employee and two associates that they had engaged in insider trading to net over one million dollars however many people in the crypto industry felt the real story had to do with the fact that almost as an aside the sec also stated that at least nine of the crypto assets on coinbase were securities tell us more about what the sec did there and how they did it and why this was significant sure so you're right that last week rocked the crypto world um with this lawsuit that the sec brought which was brought in conjunction with a doj prosecution uh the doj prosecution interestingly was for wire fraud whereas the sec lawsuit was for insider trading which necessarily requires uh insider trading of securities so when the sec brings a lawsuit for insider trading they need to prove that whatever the asset that was being traded is a security so like you mentioned the sec named nine different tokens in this lawsuit and they alleged that these tokens were securities but the tokens are not actually defendants in the lawsuit so the tokens have no opportunity to defend themselves even though the sec has the burden of proving that the tokens are actually securities and so that's kind of maybe a roundabout way to do that why didn't the sec just directly charge either those coin issuers with offering unregistered securities or coinbase for running an unregistered national securities exchange i mean it's hard to tell i think one reason could be when the sec goes after an individual defendant they're more likely to the individual defendant is more likely to settle likely they'll have less resources than a coinbase or these token projects so like the sec saw or is seeing in the ripple case for example ripple you know is fighting back really hard and putting all of their resources toward fighting the sec which the sec of course is a government agency and they do have a lot of resources but i think they're the trend is that they like to avoid going to trial and they would prefer to settle so that could be one reason i do see other people saying that this is kind of a way of sort of going after these small-time players that don't have a way to defend themselves but in this case so if they win against these individuals then does that mean effectively afterward those security or sorry those tokens will be deemed securities or is there any other way you know that this could play out it's interesting because it could play out well i'm sure it could play out in many ways but the two ways that come to mind come to the front of my mind one way is this gets taken and gets fully litigated so either it goes through the summary judgment phase which would mean that the court has to decide whether these tokens are securities or it goes through trial which again the court or the jury would decide the jury decides the facts so the jury would decide all the facts and then the court would make the legal decision as to whether these tokens are securities so in that in that in those two instances there would be some determination whether these tokens are securities the other option is that the defendants settle with the sec which may be likely especially given that there is a criminal prosecution going on and normally when there's a criminal prosecution that coincides with a civil litigation the civil case gets stayed which means that it basically gets paused so the criminal case once that finishes then the defendants might be more likely to settle with the sec and in that case nobody is deciding whether these nine tokens are securities but the sec effectively has labeled them as securities i mean labeled them in like a public court filing so that has consequences for the tokens they might get taken off certain exchanges and we know now that the sec has the opinion that these are securities so effectively you know it's almost the same thing and so then in that hypothetical scenario then there would never be any official process um by which these would be labeled as securities and for that reason then would we also not not get the reasoning behind why they were labeled as securities right and that's the issue with what the sec is doing i mean they're essentially regulating by these enforcement actions and in this instance they're enforcing against someone who isn't actually you know the entity that's creating or running these tokens so the tokens themselves don't have an opportunity to defend themselves or argue that they're not securities yet the sec has the power to label them as such and is there any process by which the token issuers or the exchanges could try to force the sec to reveal their reasoning or go through some kind of process to officially label them as securities it's possible that they could intervene although i haven't done the full legal analysis of what that requires and whether that actually is allowed but sometimes in a civil lawsuit another party who's interested in the case could intervene and basically state their interest and ask the court to decide you know how the case impacts them but they shouldn't have to do that that's like the main point is that if the sec wants to label these tokens as securities they should have just named the tokens themselves so then the tokens could or the token projects could fully defend themselves but otherwise no oh interesting you know not that i'm a legal person but it does seem like this should be something that's hashed out in a kind of clearer manner yeah i have noticed a bunch of crypto people in the industry and also sec commissioner hester purse as well as cftc commissioner caroline pham they've both been criticizing and like i said other crypto people they've all been criticizing the sec for conducting what they call regulation by enforcement what does that mean and why do you think they seem to think this is a bad thing yeah i mean i definitely agree with what they're saying and it's great that they've been speaking out against what the sec is doing and interesting you know that hester pierce within the sec is also speaking out against it and when another regulatory agency speaks out against the sec um that there's some strength to that so i should clarify that hester percy's remarks came before this happened but she you know has criticized scc for this yeah but caroline fam her remarks were in direct response to this enforcement action i think that same day maybe within a few hours of the lawsuit being filed regulation by enforcement is rather than the sec going through normal rule-making procedures where there's a notice and comment period they have to conduct some economic and industry analysis of the impact of the rule and it allows the industry to weigh in on whether a rule makes sense and is tailored toward whatever the sec is targeting in that rule the sec instead is going around that and going after entities through enforcement actions and basically stating their opinions of how in this case like the howie test for instance which is the test that we use to decide whether an asset is a security and so they outline their opinions in either a court document like a complaint or sometimes like in the case of block fi just in settlement papers so there's no official rule-making process and yet the industry has to look at these opinions that the sec writes and glean their insights from it and somehow apply it to their own businesses without much guidance so it's more like reading tea leaves than having some clarity right that's a perfect analogy and it's tough because the sec is not the individual entities are not in a position to make arguments and defend you know their what they're doing and their business models so it's not fair they don't really have an opportunity to be heard in a moment we're going to talk about the consequences of this type of regulation but first a

laura link in the description back to my conversation with marissa lindsay lin a partner at dragonfly capital tweeted that the sec's regulatory approach has created what she calls perverse incentives such as high concentration of tokens being allocated to vcs and accredited investors pre-launch or projects being reluctant to be fully transparent for fear of being deemed decentralized and responsible founders choosing not to build in crypto along with other things such as u.s consumers losing out on crypto innovation what's your take on her perspective here do you agree that the sec is doing things that actively harm crypto consumers in the us definitely i think that even though the sec states that one of their goals is to promote innovation it's really doing the opposite and it's making entrepreneurs developers entities really hesitant to do business in the us because they're they're really there's no guidance whatsoever so i mean the last guidance was in april of 2019 and since then there hasn't been anything except for these enforcement actions so they're in a tough spot and they're really guessing and what makes it worse is that the sec has said in public statements to the media that companies should come in and talk to them and seek guidance directly and there have been instances of that and then the sec you know will send a subpoena or request depositions and then file an enforcement action against them rather than actually help guide the company to be compliant the industry wants to comply and like companies and entrepreneurs want clarity wow so it's almost like they're being punished if they try to be good actors right right which is so unfortunate because there's so much innovation that's happening in this space and it really just gets squashed when people who want to comply can't because it's so unclear so the same day that the insider trading charges came out coinbase announced that it had filed a petition asking the sec to create rulemaking on digital asset securities what did the petition say and what do you think of it do you think this was the right move yeah it sort of outlines what we've been talking about where they want clarity and they want to comply and i think that it's it's a timely move i'm not sure if the two were connected i believe that they were not at least according to the public statements that have been made but we'll see how the sec responds to that i think the sec has its own agenda and you know they're not mandated when coinbase sends a request like this i don't believe that there's any sort of it's not like congress mandating that they do something so we'll see how they respond but it would be great that if there was some clarity in the guidance oh so there's no requirement that they even respond to this i don't believe so i haven't looked into the question directly but i don't unless they sued the sec which i know that they didn't but i don't believe that they they have to comply with a private party's request so on the flip side there are people who kind of criticize coinbase as well like for instance they wrote a blog post titled coinbase does not list securities end of story and some people felt this was sort of circular or self-referential logic like we don't think it's a security therefore it's not so what do you think of coinbase's process for listing tokens i know that they have a rigorous process that they go through to do this analysis under the howie test i don't know you know exactly what their internal processes are but i do trust that they go through a rigorous process and they analyze each token individually and they have lawyers on their team who are all very smart and they know securities law so but do you you know like in i guess in this sort of instance where they're declaring that they don't list any securities would you say that that's like a factual statement well it's hard to say whether it's a factual statement because i haven't looked at every single asset you know that coinbase lists and done that howie analysis but i do trust that they're doing that internally and that they have a rigorous process there i mean there are severe consequences for being an unregistered exchange so i would think that they want to avoid you know being prosecuted by or being found liable for operating as an unregistered exchange and they have these rigorous compliance processes you know in place to avoid that bloomberg then reported that the sec is investigating coinbase for whether or not it improperly listed securities on its platform some people criticize the sec for having let coinbase go public and having apparently been fine with its listing process at that time how do you see these seemingly contradictory actions yeah it's interesting and they they seem to contradict on the outside i think that of course you know there's changes that can happen within a company to at one point you know they might not have had unregistered securities on there and then now that the sec thinks differently so we'll see what happens with this investigation but it also highlights the fact that that coinbase was not brought into the to the lawsuit to the wahi lawsuit so they could have brought coinbase in there and made coinbase defend themselves in court and coinbase would have had an opportunity to be heard but instead of doing that they're going through this investigatory process where there is no judge mediating between the two of them and coinbase is now in a position where they have to comply with the sec's document requests and you know subpoenas depositions and then the sec ultimately will decide whether or not they want to bring a lawsuit against coinbase but i expect that coinbase will fully defend their position based on their rigorous analysis that they've done on these tokens and all the tokens on their platform so obviously there is so much going on in this realm of whether or not you know certain tokens are securities what is the process by which companies should you know choose to engage with them or even you know if there's certain projects that want to launch tokens you know what is the way to do that in a compliant way in the us so what are you looking at next like what do you think happens next and sort of what's on the horizon that you're watching out for at the blockchain association we've been trying to think about various legislations and bills that can help clarify this issue so whether something is a security or a commodity and if it's a commodity it would fall under the cftc's jurisdiction essentially we're trying to find ways that can bring clarity to the industry and then also you know are likely to get passed into actual legislation rather than just remain a bill and then another another piece of that is helping educate not only the industry but helping educate lawmakers and regulators about crypto more generally in the technology so regulators can then develop narrowly tailored regulations that actually you know make sense and aren't impossible to apply to crypto obviously you senators cynthia lemus and kirsten gillibrand did propose you know such a regulatory framework what do you think of that and what do you think the chances are that we might see some action on that soon i mean it's a great start for sure and it definitely helps clarify the securities slash commodities issue and it gives jurisdiction to the cftc which we really like in terms of the chances of it getting through i think we might see something next year congress is out of session starting next week in august and then there's the election in november so likely nothing will get passed this year but we've had some great conversations and it's it's really i mean it's a comprehensive bill and of course there's room for improvement but it's a really great start all right well it has been such a pleasure having you on unchained thank you so much

alameda research offered a proposal to grant quick liquidity to customers of voyager the recently declared bankrupt crypto lender in summary alameda would purchase customer assets from voyager with cash and put them into escrow at the same time ftx would authorize voyager customers to create an account and quickly cash out or hold their distressed remaining assets on the ftx exchange as sam bankman freed described in a tweet thread on the topic boycher quickly shot the proposal down filing its declination on sunday and describing the proposal as a low ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue reports the block in the filing voyager claimed that ftx and alameda made misleading or outright false claims and ignored the tax implications of converting crypto claims to us dollars according to the block voyager would be willing to listen to a serious proposal that could potentially better its customers over the crypto lenders current plans bitcoin and digital assets rally on rate increase following the federal reserve's decision to increase interest rates by 75 basis points the crypto market experienced a substantial surge as bitcoin swelled 9.6 on wednesday and ether jumped 15.5 after the increase rates are between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent the highest levels since before march 2020. as for why the rate increase is good for bitcoin alfonzo pecatiello author of the macro compass newsletter explained on twitter if the fed isn't going to force tighter financial conditions on autopilot anymore real yields will actually start declining again with that in mind he added when real yields decline valuation intensive and risk sentiment driven asset classes outperform that's because the marginal return for owning cash us dollars becomes less attractive and the incentive to chase risk assets is larger such as qqq which tracks the nasdaq 100 and bitcoin in related news gross domestic product declined at an annual pace of 0.9 in q2 celsius customer emails

inflation harmony's 100 million dollar solution inflation after losing 99 million dollars in the horizon bridge hack the harmony team published its reimbursement plan this week with the hopes to make wallets either 50 or 100 whole the proposal establishes a three-year program structured around a hard fork that will inflate the supply of one harmony's native token through two different options a 50 reimbursement with a minting of 2.48 billion tokens or a 100 reimbursement with a minting of 4.98 billion tokens with a total supply of 13.1 billion one the proposal plans to print an additional 19 or 38 one tokens to pay back the users affected by the attack via inflation the team explained the decision as forward-looking we decided against using the foundation treasury in the interest of the longevity and well-being of the project as reimbursing from the treasury would greatly hinder the foundation's ability to support the growth of harmony and its ecosystem harmony foundation is committed to continuing supporting harmony for years to come and plans to reserve the foundation tokens to facilitate this comments on the governance forum post took umbridge with this approach for example foreign participant diluted to xero was especially frank with his or her disdain regarding harmony's proposal two weeks for the shitty proposal and no re-peg payment in one aka inflation and

a yearly basis plus roughly 750 000 worth of sushi tokens over a four-year vesting period on top of that there is a 350 000 sushi bonus for hitting certain metrics and a price rise payout that could net howard 8.35 million dollars if sushi rose above 11 again while many of the comments were positive it was noted by community member dr anon 911 that such an aggressive offer could leave sushi swap
