tuned my guest today is Chris Dixon partner at entries and Horowitz welcome Chris thanks for having me we're recording this episode just a couple days are to your big news Congrats on your new crypto fun thank you and also on nabbing Katie Honda's your new GP very excited winner let's talk first about the new fund you raise 300 million dollars for a crypto only fun through Andreessen mm-hmm although Andreessen has been investing in crypto for a while now aside from the fact that you were bumping up against the limits of how much you could invest in crypto via the regular fund why create a crypto only fund yeah I mean the main reason the main reason is we wanted to have you know kind of a first class effort to we do we think crypto is incredibly important and we wanted to have a first class kind of organization and effort to approach the opportunity so this allows us to have you know a full team I think we have eight now four kind of on the sorry three on the kind of technical side me Katie general counsel operations things like this so yeah as you know crypto just kind of has a whole bunch of complexities and and and it's just different a lot of ways so so the main thing was to have kind of a first class organization devoted to doing this and to really make it kind of a key focus for the firm and out of all the technologies that you do invest in why create a crypto only fund as opposed to like you know a VR only fund we do have a bio fund so we thought you know bio kind of the intersection of computer science and bio wasn't interesting enough area and different enough I mean sort of one way we think about it is you know is the knowledge specialized enough that you need a dedicated team so on the bio side for example like we know we have we have two partners there who have deep backgrounds in biology and they also have also computer science but you know one one sort of simple way to think about it is if I go to a bio meeting I understand maybe the business stuff and the computer science stuff but I don't really understand like a significant portion of the bio stuff it's just a different domain right and and crypto you know although it's it's computer science there's so much as you know and you focus on this on your podcast there's so much kind of specialized knowledge you've got to read all these white papers you've got to kind of like study consensus mechanisms and just his whole world and the people involved and it was different we felt like it was different enough that it really required kind of a whole oh you know a whole kind of separate effort and I'm so not surprised that you guys hired Katie Han because I think she's so brilliant she's awesome and she has the exact background in my opinion that would help crypto gain legitimacy how did you come to bring her on as a GP yeah so I got the privilege of working with her on the Quinn base board so she's been on the board for for over a year she she and and has just been incredibly valuable there and is super actively involved in all aspects of the kind of company and I think she's just an outstanding board member you know a lot of how we think about it is you know there's really - you know I think sometimes people outside of the venture world think what you do in venture capital is you know pick companies to invest in which of course is some of what you do but a lot of what we do is after we invest you know try to help the company right and so I got to see firsthand how helpful she was and then I just heard Ennis you know like she's in the community I just her name comes up all the time you know founders all want to meet her they want to work with her and so you know and and then she's also in the border hacker one for example she also has security expertise and so just getting to see her her work firsthand and just being super impressed by her and so yeah I think it was a real real coup to be able to recruit her so I'm it's a I'm excited to work with her and know what do you think about the fact that she is the first female GP I think that's great you know we obviously we want to have more diversity in our in our you know in our general partner ranks but but you know we she's just an outstanding person for this and founders want to work with her and so yeah but it is so exciting I think because everybody talks in this space and I think it's just true if I look at the numbers and when I go to conferences I can see that there are so few women but she's definitely so deserving on hopefully that will change and I mean hopefully I hope that over I mean I hope I hope as the space grows it will change in multiple ways I think both in terms of you know gender diversity and and things like that but also I think in terms of you know bat-like to sort of skill diversity I think I think for the space to grow we need you know people who you know aren't like right now as you know that the community tends to be very technical kind of focused on you know consensus mechanisms all these kind of very technical things and that's very important and and we need to continue to have that but I think we also need people with with different both you know kind of backgrounds in yeah you know let's product design and general management and engineering and just like all sorts of other things so I you know I think that a really important thing over the next couple of years is to make kind of the space more inclusive and grow it and and have more people you know I you know have people leaving you know other industries other tech company know tech companies universities coming into the space and I think that's the way we kind of succeed I kind of I saw this you know it reminds me a little bit I was involved in the kind of what people call the web to movement you know so kind of I'd started a company in 2004 it was a consumer internet security company and I was sort of you know like there was he sort of all these people that were into like you know these new ideas around like RSS and tagging and like delicious and Flickr and all I don't know there's this whole kind of thing that was going on back then and and a you know and the early people in to that you know we're really into the like kind of you know the ethos of it and and all you know all the nitty gritty but then as the space grew right you kind of had you brought in the space brought in a much broader set of people and companies like Facebook and other you know successful companies did that and so I think that's the way we kind of get to the next stage is to really kind of you know if you know hopefully three years from now or we're you know the the space is ten times if not more people working in it and much more reflective of the general you know at least tech population and hopefully the general population and I'm sure herb regulatory or government background is a big factor yeah it's certainly her regulatory expertise is important that's a key that's it that is I mean she's got a lot of skills but that certainly is an important skill you know I think it's as you know and I'm sure you know you've you know a lot about this but the the the biggest issue right now which is the uncertainty and so every founder that we're working with is sort of hey can you help me just figure out what I need to do you know there are obviously our bad actors like none of the people we're working with the bad actors and there's lots of good actors despite what you know sometimes the impression some people have in the space the good actors want to want to comply but but frankly don't know how right now and so helping helping projects with those issues is is very important right now yeah so we're gonna come back to that in a moment but I wanted to also ask you know when you invest in crypto you're investing in open-source projects so how does that investing process differ from when you're investing in traditional startups and how does that affect your decision process around which projects to invest in yeah that's a great question I mean I think of it as we're investing in well yes yeah so I mean we it's not that different so for example we've been investing you know in our in our traditional VC you know practice and just generally and Silicon Valley people have been investing kind of open-source I mean not directly an open source but things around open source so you know like and github and all these other kinds of things so there's you know a big open source component but then there's some other kind of component layered on which which you know provides a business model or something right but I think like for example we don't like we're generally like I'll speak for myself I'm very opposed to things like software patents I generally don't believe that defense ability and technology comes through things like patents or trade secrets or closed-source things they generally come through network effects communities kind of other kinds of things like this so let me just think about you know take bitcoins an obvious example you could you know as shouldn't people have forked Bitcoin you could I get four could be I could have Chris's Bitcoin tomorrow I don't think anyone would use Chris's Bitcoin actually well but you know the point is like you know but this goes back like I mean like I'd like to give the example of like Wikipedia for example Wikipedia is all you know all the all the information there's open source right I could download it I could create Chris's wikipedia.org right but look no one's gonna go to it right it's just not it's not how the real how actual defensibility happens on the Internet it comes to the fact that Wikipedia you know it's almost like think of it as almost like it's almost like a like a restaurant like a venue or something like Wikipedia right it's like a place you go like you go there because the other people are there because the community is there right because and the community creates great content and then you go because of the content is there right so you can just you can replicate that you can replicate the data but you can't replicate the community right so that that's how we think about it it's sort of who is if it's very you know who's going to build a network that is going to have defense ability through technology you know obviously good technology but that can be copied through and then ultimately through you know good governance good community ethos kind of you know those kind of you know and then that leads to second-order net network effects so then you know I expect as these networks become larger they'll start to get integrated into more things in the world so if you look at historical internet protocols the tcp/ip right one of the core protocols of the internet like if I you know I can make my own version of IP tcp/ip but it's not going to be baked in you know TCP of use baked into every computer every route or every sort of thing in the world like as these things become more important they'll start to get baked in these integration points and things like that yeah so we really look at the lens of who's going to creates kind of the best technology that leads to the best community in network and so when it comes to looking at you know the different types of technology that could be developed in this I'm sure you're probably thinking like oh these certain things need to be developed or these certain problems need to be resolved so what do you think are some of the biggest problems right now that crypto networks need to resolve yeah I mean some of this will be obvious so for example you know scaling is a big issue right obviously and so that that and that's that means different things in different networks but you know I think I think of it as so like the way I like to frame it is we have this crypto crisis great this incredible new software primitive which is trust right which is this idea that from a bunch of non trusted network nodes through these consensus mechanisms you know like like you know Nakamoto consensus like it's a Bitcoin or like there's a whole bunch of other consensus mechanisms through these consensus mechanisms you you get this sort of emergent property of trust where you can trust the network and that trust lets you build things like money or some more contracts and other things right but you pay a price for trust which is you you have to kind of waste network resources or you know or use redundant network resources which makes these networks harder to scale right so you know so let's take a theorem as an example so every piece of code that you run every smart contract that you run on theorem has to run redundantly on all these different you know on all the miners right so whatever it is 30,000 miners or something that's not an efficient you know if you're looking at it through the lens of you know you're a Google engineer looking at through the lens of like how you design traditional distributed systems that's not gonna look like an efficient way to do it right and so how do you so the question is how do you you know keep that important feature of trust while also scaling these networks to what I call web scale which is hundreds of millions and really billions of users which is kind of what you know Facebook and all these other kinds of networks are at today there's a ton of good work going on there at many different in many different areas I mean there's there's stuff going on you know at the core there's new projects every day coming out with kind of new kind of consensus mechanism mechanism breakthroughs you know there's a whole bunch of stuff you know ideas around like how you can char these networks which is sort of you know that's kind of a basic you know basic but like a standard computer science move to kind of create more parallelism is to do sharding there's a sort of related ideas things called like plazas and like kind of sub chains there's on the Bitcoin side there's Lightning Network and you know kind of payment channels you know in theory inside there something equivalent thing called state channels there's sort of side networks of things like you know like true--but which is sort of this site I almost think of it like a GPU next to your CPU like kind of gives you additional horsepower there's a whole bunch of interesting like kind of brand-new cryptographic research around things called like Starks for example where you can where you can do more computation off chain and just use the blockchain for and I'm happy to go into more of this but there's a ton of interesting work going on there I'm very optimistic about it but that has to happen right records right now like I think etherium is supports for example 1.2 million transactions a day you know the Bitcoin side this is reflected in the cost of a transaction which i think is you know right now it's sort of it's fine in the digital gold use case it's not fine if you want to you know use it for small casual payments which was sort of the original yeah that's the original white paper talked about so that's obviously a big issue that's something we've invested in a bunch of projects around that so that's on the infrastructure side and then there's a whole long I go on and on about infrastructure and then but then there's some sort of I see this there's two big buckets right this infrastructure and applications right and so there's a whole bunch of stuff with an infrastructure side I personally spend a lot of time on that I think it's very interesting then there's the application side so what do you do with these things right like how do you actually you know in the end you know crypto wins when we have a billion people using these networks who don't even know why you know know what crypto is right like that's sort of how I think of how we win right like no one cares you know people that use whatever Facebook or something don't need to understand the underlying technology right so so so what have fun des mentally use these things for and there there's just a ton of interesting stuff happening in in many different areas everything from you know crypto finance kind of a call it which is you know people creating like decentralize no to centralized exchanges and and other kinds of issuing financial instruments lending you know sort of things you would find in the traditional financial industry there's a whole area of called traditional asset tokenization so taking kind of you know traditional access quote-unquote which is like real estate as an example and making a tokenized version that can be traded in the block Jim a bunch of stuff happening around kind of crypto goods like virtual goods and gaming and I think it's very exciting for like from from a media and gaming point of view things are on payments you know I'm particularly thinking particularly interesting area for that is the the billions some something like a billion people who have Android phones you know you can get a $15.00 Android phone now there's there's something in the order of a billion people that have Android phones it's on that bank accounts I think I think providing kind of financial services those people also most of them don't have identification either like literally don't have like a government-issued ID so let alone can't get a bank account I think providing financial services to those people it's a really exciting opportunity anyway so there's a whole whole bunch of interesting things going on the application side and I expect you know I think one of the things that's so exciting about this area is its pure software and software is this very rich malleable kind of medium and so I would expect if we if we talk again a year from now two years from now the list I give there will be much longer and in fact it is much longer than it was a year ago so just to give you a simple example non NF T's non fungible tokens ie crypto goods that was that really didn't he that was kind of a new coming people I think people had sort of thought about it but like it really was a new concepts in the last 12 months and unlocks this whole other area and I think not only unlocks like new possibilities but unlocks and what I always look at things through the lens of talent and what well one of the things are really excited me about crypto goods is it got another you know million people excited about crypto who were more on the creative side the gaming side so I like I know a bunch of kind of game entrepreneurs who were early entrepreneurs around you know Facebook and iPhone gaming and until crypto goods came along and if teased they were like okay this crypto thing is like you guys I don't know what you guys are doing over there but I think it's not for me and now all of a sudden they're hey Chris let's get together you know this stuff is suddenly interesting right because what is a crypto good it's it's it's it's sort of proof of existence it's like a token but with graphics and it has this kind of whole other dimension to it that appeals to a whole nother set of kind of whole different sensibility and so that's really exciting because I think of it as like the way we win is we grow the army we need we need we 10 million people of programmers and researchers and entrepreneurs and product designers and you know creative people and just like we need this big army to just go and create like all this awesome stuff and that's how we win and so anything we can do to kind of bring more people into the fold that's great right and so I think there will be more I think what we're gonna see over the next year or two is more creative ideas like that that in turn excite new groups of people who then come in and we get this kind of this really interesting kind of flywheel going with with kind of people and talent with and then software and the to kind of feeding back on each other yeah I was talking with Olaf the other day and we were talking about video games and about how now because of things like cryptic hoodies and what you call cryptic goods which by the way I love the term I'd not heard that until you wrote your blog post I realized oh wow like I could have a digital good or multiple digital goods in these virtual worlds and then I could carry them from game to game yeah and then it's it's not that dissimilar from how I am in the real world where I have sort of unique things that are you know that signify who I am like this necklace and this shirt and you know that purse or whatever and so it's like oh this is kind of interesting and I also did an interview with Philip Rosedale who had done Second Life now I was doing a high-fidelity and he had mentioned to me that in the virtual world like your height matters a lot less than it does in the normal world and I was like oh that's a bonus and so thinking like oh there's like a lot of possibilities here and and I haven't played video games and forever but like just thinking about the possibilities there I got excited and those are the I agree and I think you know I think we're at a moment now where I would argue we're in a moment we're in this kind of interesting transition period in I think generally in society kind of with the Internet where we still think of the digital world a lot of people still think of the digital world as kind of as kind of second tier second class to the offline world and you hear that even in the language we use so you know there's commerce which is offline commerce and there's ecommerce right in econ so whenever you have like the modifier are you sort of saying that's that's like the that's the subordinate if that's the subordinate world right so there's email you know you know the fact that we say digital goods versus goods like etc where you know eSports I think we're in this transition period I think that 20 years from now it's going to be obvious that the digital world is is in many ways primary it's where you you know meet your you know meet friends it's where you make earn a living it's where you do you know all these important things and this idea that like I think it will seem funny that you know we once you know didn't have a notion of money and ownership in this world and so for me goods like of course goods are going to be important to digital world because look how important I mean you certainly like owning people seem to like owning things in the offline world by when they want things in the online world and right now you do have this notion of virtual goods and games and things like this but you're really kind of borrowing them you the game you know I guarantee you that your goods and whatever you name the game like they could change the rules the game will eventually go away you don't really own those goods they're not yours you can't take them you can't trade them you can't really keep them and so you know I see it as taking what is obviously a very important thing we do in the offline world which is just like you know just look we pick pointed so Bitcoin took obviously money is really important in the offline worlds of course it's gonna be important the online world in the same way you know owning having property rights in the offline world and owning stuff is going to be important the online world and so yeah I need just a matter of time before a scene is like just sort of almost like a basic right that you would say you would be able to hone things in the digital world yeah and going back to how the digital is always seen is not the default I experienced this shift where in the past if I'd been writing for Forbes com I would have noted forbes.com because Forbes magazine that's the real one certain point it was know I was running for Forbes and that meant the website I was writing for the magazine that I would say Forbes magazine yeah so I I did live through that shift you've been talking and writing a lot about decentralisation and I wanted to get you to talk a little bit about you know you've seen this process both as a successful entrepreneur in the traditional startup mode and obviously on the Investor side as well but how do you think crypto and ease are changing entrepreneurship and business models yeah decentralization is a very broad topic and it can mean a lot of different things you know I think one one lens through which to look at it is is is through the kind of where we are in the tech world today right which is we're in a period now with highly centralized period right where four or five by five tech companies right Google Apple Amazon Facebook and Microsoft you know the vast majority of time people spend online and products they interact with and things like that are owned by those companies right and those companies are you know if you're an entrepreneur they're they're challenging to work with because they I wrote a blog post about this is called why decentralization matters where I have this kind of s-curve I show which is basically the lifecycle of these platforms I've just sort of what we've seen now over thirty years of tech platform so about platform by the way I mean a network where developers can build something for users sort of it provides kind of an intermediate point so it could be Windows it could be Facebook it could be Twitter you know the Facebook the case of like when you have like third-party developers like Zynga etc it could be iOS and these things typically go through a life cycle we're in the beginning you know Facebook starts off they really they're they're they're trying to get Forbes to put their content on there so in the beginning they're like please please come over you know we need your content right because they need it to make a better experience right fast forward to today and I think it's a very different story right I mean they're like hey we're gonna change the rules we're gonna flag you we're gonna you know lower your take rate I don't know whatever you know there's a whole bunch of stuff right because now they don't need you anymore because they're so they're big right and so this and this is sort of this s-curve I show which is that you basically have this life cycle these networks we're in the beginning they try to attract what economists call complement sort of the things that go with it you know the complementary goods and services but then at the end they just sort of say hey like there's a certain amount of money to be made and we want we want most of the money and so we're gonna you know we're gonna let you kind of hang around the sidelines but we're gonna take all the profits right and that's why you know you have Yelp going up in front of the Senate talking about Google you know like so now you type a restaurant and so I get to scroll down to like page two to get to Yelp it's like even though like I don't know about you but I always want to find you up and it's got a go to page two and so you know and so and so what happened because in but Google's Google's doing what they know they're for-profit business I'm not criticize I think it's a you know fantastic company and they provide an amazing free service and it's you know they've done they've think they've created awesome things for the world and they're doing what any company would do which is they're now a mature company and they need to keep growing and they you know they can only grow so much through kind of organic means and so they're now trying to monetize more and things like that it's just just what happens and that's you know and I think but I think now thirty forty years into the tech world kind of the tech revolution it's fine that those companies do that but as you know investors entrepreneurs etc we also should be wise to this as well like this is what happens right so and and in our business and venturi everyone every VC will tell you this they talk about platform risk this platform risk is the risk and you're building another platform and it's a massive massive risk so you know and then so so but contrast where we are today where if you want to build something and you want to get exposure you have to almost have to get exposure through Facebook or Google or something else that's just they just control how all the traffic on the web flows you know rewind twenty years ago when the web is starting out and you know the really the dominant quote-unquote platforms were these decentralized protocols that that you know thankfully the academics and the government and the various people who create the internet created these wonderful open protocols so you know tcp/ip HTTP SMTP etc and those were the kind of the the rules that govern the Internet and so it was a decentralized network and what that did was it allowed creativity and entrepreneurship to to blossom right and so you've had you know and that's why you know and Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg and people like that benefited from that right Mark Zuckerberg could put up a website and as long as you know they got traffic and they got users like their you know the IETF or the w3c or whatever the web committee wasn't going to say hey Mark you know we're gonna take your profits now right because that's not how the decentralized networks worked so that was great but I think now we're kind of harvesting today as a society and those companies the seeds that were planted 20 years ago and we need to plant new seeds like we're harvesting that and I think it's I think it's dangerous now because I I don't I worry that the next you know entrepreneurs in a garage or dorm room don't have the same opportunity that those that those founders had and I'm not blaming them for it I think they're doing what for-profit centralized platforms to do and that has its own kind of a deep internal logic if they didn't do it they'd probably you know whatever Wall Street would fire them or something I don't know what would happen but but that's the logic of that structure what what's what's great now though is we have alternative structures right and so this is and it's specifically a lot of the ideas that have come out of the crypto community and the and the the idea that you can build platforms that are very powerful and have very rich functionality but also enforce kind of the rules of the platform in a way that won't hurt entrepreneurship later on right and so but I do a question about that because some of them have governance baked in in a way where the platform could actually change so wouldn't it sort of be somewhat similar to how you know Facebook or Google might have tea I think it depends on the network I think yeah I mean so I think I think that's an important part of being a good network is giving you know is baking into both the code and the governance that you know the assurance is that that won't change and you know and I think but we also have other mechanisms for example forking right if you know III let's just I mean to take a theory I'm like if I think a theory was a very well governed network I think I don't I can't imagine that that the etherium network would would ever go and say hey we're gonna we had some smart contract that's wildly successful we're gonna you know change the rules and take more of their money for the you know foundation or for the platform but if they ever did I think they would they would run a real risk of getting for it and so you know I think there's sort of inherent I think there's both you know there's kind of inherent guarantees built into the the nature of the networks and the fact that they're open code and and you know and and I think and the fact that you know that there aren't like the people the foundation don't really control the network right I mean it's it's the various as we've seen with with you know the Bitcoin debates and things there's multiple constituencies right there's miners there's no two operators there's developers and I think that you know that and then you also have then the threat of kind of exit at 4-4 people leaving the network I mean there's actually two forms of exit right one is you can just say you know what I'm gonna take my I'm gonna take my software and move somewhere else by the way that's another form of exit right I mean and like you're seeing this more and more with a lot of the competing smart contracts to aetherium our contract platforms are building in like they're using the VM and a bunch of they're being very like they're making a switching cost very low right so that's another so there's a whole bunch of kind of things I think vitalik has a great phrase you said it's not that we're removing the platform it's that were shackling the platform we're not removing the intermediary we're shackling the intermediary right so shackling meaning like we're putting constraints on it so that it can't become a bad actor and there's a ton of different constraints put on these networks in a way that when you have no constraints on a on a google or facebook they literally just decide okay we're gonna change the algorithm and like there's no good luck what are you gonna do use some other you know get all your friends so if another social network like it's it's not gonna happen so interesting so it's it's a you know it's not it'll it'll be interesting to see how it all plays out in the future but it's a much more attractive I would say these platforms in the crypto world are a much more attractive platforms to build on it for entrepreneurs and as investors we think they're much more attractive to invest you know to invest in something else I've been so curious about is Facebook recently formed a group to explore how it could use watching technology and then we've got these other companies and startups that have announced plans to either launch coins or crypto networks you know there's kik and Kodak and telegram I tend to view the business model of centralized companies is kind of antithetical to the organizational structures that are optimal for building block chains or blockchain technology projects so do you think it's possible for a company to create a successful crypto network or a product using watching if there's a centralized service it's definitely I mean it's it's I would definitely call the crypto both kind of ethos and business model type of quotes on that because it's a different you know sort of a business model a model of having tokens and owning tokens things like that it's certainly highly misaligned with the ethos and business model of kind of traditional centralized tech companies you know it's the the phrase disruptive is thrown around a lot and so looking you know there's sort of a technical word of it meaning of it from clay Christensen's books innovators dilemma where you have you know his his definition is you have this new you know a new technology that is you know fundamentally misaligned with the existing technology and in fact they're really interesting by this book is that you know is that if you're a smart incumbent and you're doing what you normally do which is kind of making your best customers happy this new thing will look like this kind of crappy thing that doesn't satisfy the needs of your best customers and so actually this the smart manager will ignore them now he does have a lot of writings about how you know how do you address these disruptive technologies and what Christensen says is you really just have to create a new organization he says you literally like should put it in like a different like location and like different management team and like different incentive structure and so I think it falls into that bucket of like challenges so I don't think it's completely impossible but I think it needs a lot of care and thought needs to go into the organization and how to do it because it's just very very different right and it's just fundamental I mean you just take an example of like take a you know among other things these these business models will probably be deflationary this is generally what happens in tech is that each new wave is sort of deflationary what I mean by that is it lowers the margin so you know and it shrinks the market size rather and so you know Craigslist shrunk the market of classified ads right I mean it's just like the dollar spent on I mean which is great for consumers they'd spend less money it's a terrible medium and so you know in Craigslist can do quite well if they capture like a big share of it and they have a really low cost structure and everything else generally like it's bad for media good for consumers good for the disruptor right it's generally how the pattern works and so you know if you think about a crypto decentralized file storage system like and then you think about Amazon and s3 or something like there you know there's sort of the incumbent like it's it's going to be an inherently deflationary and so it's as a good manager of s3 it's going to be really hard to say hey let's go like ruin this great business we have so I think the only way to address it is to to do something that's really kind of radical and really create like kind of a new organization I mean look but look I'm putting our bets almost almost exclusively or on brand-new companies that are that are first principles designed you know in this new from this new world I mean right well I'm not an investor but I think I

world go - preciate org to learn more about the ppreciate community and recognize someone raising the bar together with appreciate launching this summer I was speaking with Chris Dixon partner at entries in Horowitz we're about to see this race develop between various smart contract platforms etherium has the first mover advantage and you've called it the most important technology of the decade but it has serious pouts in which you know we've mentioned scaling there's some governance issues there's been bugs in the code now we've got Yost affinity and T's O's they're all launching how do you think this competition will play out and is there room for more than one successful smart contract platform yeah just to clarify but I think what I did I sort of said that but I think what I'd like to say is I think crypto is the most important technology of the decade for sure and I think you know and aetherium is is the you know is sort of the leading to my mind right now the leading you know certainly the leading smart contract platform and embodiment of that but you know anyway so just just a little more nuance on it but that I'm a huge fan of a theorem and I think what they've done is incredible um so so you're saying how how will this kind of play out so I think yeah it's a great question you know theorem is it's hard for me to say I'm such a big fan that it will sound like I'm just I just think what Vitalik did and what the what the kind of a theorem community did was so important because it it it just it really revitalized the space you know after all of the kind of the block size debate and just kind of all the the bitterness and things it just provided this kind of whole fresh kind of perspective on things inspired a new wave of entrepreneurs it's now really kind of inspired to look at valley so it's just a hugely important thing and and you know it's and they've got just incredible momentum so just I'll tell you what I do you know what I do obviously is part of a big part of my week is meeting with entrepreneurs and they're building various crypto things and it's just you know I'd say 90% of them are building something on ethereum and so it's really just kind of captured you know the imaginations of people I think it's are any of them planning to try out any of these yeah well so that's the other question so I mean so I think they I think if you're building an application you want you know you ultimately want to get a lot of users using your application right and if you if you build an application and successful and you and you start to be kind of rate limited by the platform you know I think a lot of those people will think about switching and this you know switching costs are you know they're it's not trivial but a lot of other platforms are deliberately supporting like solidity and a lot of the other things to make it easier there you would have to replicate some of the tooling you know like the browsers and the and all those other kinds of things but it's not that much right now so I think it's kind of just to me it's a big question of I mean look the the it sort of falls on a prior questions we first need applications that really breakout which which you know that breakout to you know tens and then hundreds and millions of people and at that point maybe sometime in the next year or two the applications that do that will probably be king makers of this more of whatever smart contract platform satisfies their needs right so you know so look it sort of happened on you know imagine if you know lets you know when the iPhone came out you know you had I forgot what like Instagram and you know snapchat and all that really kind of hit apps if you know the iPhone just you know whatever at a million users wouldn't let you have more users or something those people would have seriously considered Android or something and that could have led to the development of Windows Phone for that matter or whatever it might be and that could have so I think it's I think it's very really too early to call I mean I think I think it'll be really important it's really is important that that that you know that through this variety of things both things being worked on by the etherium foundation by related companies by layer to projects it's important that a lot of these things you know figure out these scaling issues you know before I so I think if it's sort of a race between those two things so applications that start to grow really quickly and are able to kind of decide which smart contract platforms are the winners and then you know on the other side the smart contract platform is getting kind of enough sort of scalability and features and everything else to satisfy those applications right there's always this kind of eating in yangon technology between applications in infrastructure and so so I think it's just it's I think it's too early to call and so we see more development on the application side okay so one other factor that I know a lot of people think will be one of the determinants of which watchings will become dominant is governance but I don't feel like I've heard you talk about it that much what types of governance do you find was promising and do you think it really will be a big determining factor I do for sure you know I think the governance is interesting there's you know there's there's a there's kind of the formal governance and like you know there's all these debates around kind of like on chain and off chain governance you know so like the most extreme example on one side I think is something like Tasos where there's very rich kind of on chain governance system and then you have you know as I understand the folks at the etherium foundation they want to have kind of a more more kind of checks and balances so you have sort of the people that you know running nodes and the miners and then you know and then you'd have also the ability for you know and a proof of stake when they move to proof of stake for people that that that owned the currency to have some influence but but but they but they would argue I think that I want to I hope I'm not miss characterizing it but I think they would argue that if you just do it all on chain through voting of BISE takers that you might end up with a plutocracy so I think those are very interesting debates I don't have a answer I tend to think I tend to I tend to think that the kind of the model that aetherium and Bitcoin have kind of come to which is you do have the kind of it's a little bit like the you know the the US system where you have kind of multiple branches of government right so and those branches are sort of on chain off chain and miners etc I tend to think that that's um of mixed model like that seems to be working look it's kind of what happened i mean i i'm also looking look if you look back to pre crypto and you look at how you know how it was HTTP and all the sort of web protocol is governed i mean the reality is it was it was kind of a complicated thing but you had you had it standards bodies so you need to have two w3c or something like this and they would come up with specs but then you also have the software maker so like Chrome and Internet Explorer and Firefox have a big influence I'm like how HTTP s are HTML and you should people that matter but how those protocols evolve right and you kind of have this you know there's these multiple parties and people kind of you know it's a little bit of messy process but they kind of come together and it generally works it's a little slower than you know a centralized for-profit company would move but so I think we kind of have models and I'm optimistic about it but I do think it's very important I mean you see these debates around like you know vos and all these other kinds of new networks where there's like you know more controversial kind of governance models I think the key to me the key is that I guess the two things you need to balance on the one hand you know the key idea here and all the crypto stuff is trust right and so if you don't trust you know the only way that end-users are gonna trust that they really own a virtual good or they really on this digital money or something is it ultimately that trust has to kind of flow from the trust in the platform so I think it's very very important that these networks be trusted right and so there's trust you want but you want to trade out and so Trust kind of leans you towards conservatism right and not changing much on the other hand this is software and you need to evolve and you need to scale and you know all sorts of other things so there's this kind of delicate balance that needs to be walked and I think you know it probably it will probably very likely be a major determinant of which of these platforms win is which ones are best government you talk often about how what people work on a nights and weekends is usually what ends up becoming the revolutionary technologies that take of our lives based on that theory how do you think crypto networks will have changed our lives three five ten years or pick your time scale from now yeah so yeah so that theory is just if you just kind of go I mean I was thinking about is it just a coincidence that so many tech stories you know I read a lot of history books and biographies and things and so many of them start with like you know the homebrew hacker Club and The Weeknd Club and the you know hacking on the weekend all these other things and so so kind of you know I was reading those notes like is that is that just like a coincidence that all these things that all these things sort of start off as hobbies or some logic to it and then I kind of came up with a view that that there's a logic to it and so you sort of think about it is if you're a smart engineer you kind of have to you have to you have two different lives right you have your 9 to 5 life and you have your non - non non nine-to-five life you nine-to-five life is controlled what you work on is controlled by probably a business person who's probably thinking on it you know one to two year horizon you know or something like that right I mean that's sort of how most businesses end it - shut up and then your non you know your it's your nights and weekends where you're able to do what you want which is really where you're sort of taking a much longer term horizon so I kind of see it as they're sort of you know there's other places like research labs and governments and places and sorry and universities and government-funded projects where people are able to take a longer term horizon but in the kind of in the programming world a lot of the longer term horizon it's really just sort of done ad hoc by engineers on places like you know github and read it and whatever and they're just you know it's what you do and you think it's fun and interesting and so I think there's sort of a deep logic as to why a lot of things that I've ended up being really important the PC the internet like a whole bunch of other things started off as sort of nights and weekend projects so you know I think so what were the world looking five ten years out so I think that I guess the way I imagine things kind of playing out is we're going to continue to see I'm very optimistic that for example all of these questions around kind of smart contract platform scaling and kind of layer one scaling and all these kind of these will all get I'm very sure these will all get worked out these a lot of smart people working on a lot of good ideas so we'll have these highly scalable networks will have networks that where you can truly build kind of trust as a primitive and build other components around it I think one thing people underestimate with software I think software is misunderstood in a lot of ways as a sort of engineering analogous to you know building a bridge or something like this kind of like you're given a spec and you build a software to build it I think software is much more analogous to writing like you know writing a novel or something it's a so software is that one of the key features of software is is the composability meaning you can take pieces like Lego bricks and you can compose new pieces and you can take those pieces and build new pieces it's very much like English or something where you can take words and build sentences you can take sentences and build paragraphs you can take paragraph right you know and just like you know no one would ever say you know when people say things like you can never build a piece of software that does XY and Z you know that the smart contract that does it it'll never work right it's to me it's sort of equivalent to saying you could never write a novel that involves a you know I don't know a whale and a and a cat ship captain and it's really moving and blah blah you know like really you want a bet that like no human can ever put words together in a certain way to like you know have this emotional effect in this story and this is just like it's such a rich malleable medium very much like English language the English language something it's the it's it's different because you're using you know it's you're using logical components to build other logical components as opposed to maybe like emotional components or something's I don't take the analogy too far but that composability is such a key feature and so we're in this very interesting period now where we've got this new major new Lego block which is this idea that you can build trusted things and then this Lego block and it's like the best Lego block it's like awesome that's why it's so it's like you know and so you know it just totally changes what you can build with Lego blocks right so you got this new thing and you can build it so now you have trust you can build money right and then okay so money that unlocks like a whole bunch of stuff right so then you can put finance and lending and also and that's a whole like thread of the tree right and then you got like good script of goods we were talking about thats gonna be a whole tree that's that tree is gonna get built out over the next two years or the next root of ten years and you got all this so anyway so you got this so it's all gonna be kind of and so so I guess it's a long-winded way of saying I expect to be surprised and I expect that other people are much smarter and more creative than me and there's going to be all sorts of awesome stuff and what I'm excited about is that we got this awesome new Lego block and in a field where that that says malleable and as broad and as expansive you know writing an English language or something I think the way it's gonna play out is you're gonna see more and more stuff I think I think what I talk about a lot is you're gonna have kind of an inside-out adoption pattern and what I mean by that is you're gonna see okay so like a bunch of people are building lending platforms on the theory I'm and right now it's going to start off as totally crypto so you're gonna lend it you're gonna go to lend like your ether to the to the smart contract the smart contract will in turn lend it out to other people right and it's weird its crypto and and you know people will say oh but it's only for theory em and I like that's not for mainstream people but then look you add in a stable coins and I think stable coins will be working and you know you'll have some like scaled out working stable coins in a couple years and stable coins you know what that means is you've got a crypto asset that's pegged to something like a dollar right and so suddenly then you've got okay so you combine those two Lego bricks right you take lending and you take stable coins and suddenly you have dollar lending platforms right I mean so it's not that weird anymore and then you you know you add on a nice iPhone user interface app interface and suddenly you have you know basically the core function of Citibank replicated you know from a crypto network right but I think it's gonna when i say inside out what i mean it's going to start with like crypto people doing and be like crypto traders and all this other stuff and everyone will say oh this is weird thing but like it just takes a few small steps to like boom okay then you like plug this thing in and it's a mainstream thing right and it's not gonna be like you're not gonna it's not going to be I don't think the weights gonna be is like you're not gonna have like crypto bank and like everyone's gonna go to crypto bank instead a Citibank it'll just become that like the the legacy banks just become less relevant because like more and more stuff is gonna happen digital world you're gonna be in your you know virtual world like in the Metaverse and buying some virtual goods and you just naturally will go and like get it from a smart contract it's eristic with using a stable coin like why would you go and work with one of these like you know janky user interfaces with the legacy bank and all this other stuff so it'll just become you know it's sort of like it's very similar to how if you look at the adoption patterns of like Twitter and Facebook it's like it's not like people like said okay I'm gonna you know it's not like one day everyone said hey let's stop going to New York Times and let's just go to Twitter or something it's just like and the way it starts by the way is like you know four years Twitter and all these other networks which is people like you know like me and my four or whatever and we just like talk about Texas we used to be a tech chat room or something back when back in the old days I kind of miss those those days but used to be like a text chat room and then over time you know you had like kind of more and more mainstream people come on and it's just like eventually just becomes like the other stuff it just becomes kind of like you still go there and it still exists but it's just not as relevant right and so I think that and that's what I call inside out because it's not like you just one day like have a replacement or something like a substitute and everyone just like stops going to the bank and goes to this other bank or something it's just more that like more and more of these functions just kind of happen and inside out meaning it's gonna happen more and I think most what's going to happen like with crypto native people and this kind of crypto world you have this kind of alternative crypto a kind of economy financial system and then you know but then there's just like a few little moves you need to make like stable coins and interfaces and a few other things to suddenly make it much more mainstream accessible well so I do have a question about this because I agree with you what probably happens something like that but I think you know a lot of people when they extol the virtues of crypto they talk about its potential to democratize access to financial services but the thing is that the earlier you are the kind of wealthier you're going to be in this system and so far most of the early wealthy holders in crypto tend to be white and Asian men so do you think it's important to change that and if so how can we do it with a decentralized network that is you know just by definition not a top-down system yeah first of all I believe we're in the very early innings of this so there's plenty of time if you want to be part of it to join and I think there'll be plenty of you know there's I think there's going to be a ton of things that will become incredibly valuable and so they're still you know we're still very very it says this is you know early days and there's so many people already have become millionaires and billionaires off of crypto so yeah but I still think it's early days I don't know I think it's very early days so look I mean I don't know if we're investing as if it's early days and we're you know I believe that obviously I'm putting my money where my mouth is but um so I think it's very early days and so but I do like I think your point is great we need to you know the more we can do to bring more people in and look it's I think it's and be inclusive and and make this a welcoming community the better so I think it's a great point but I think it's tiller very early days so I think if you know a person looking for a career move or a new thing to work on you know you should come you know listen to your podcast listen to our podcast like don't read the negative read the positive stuff I don't know at least I would call ourselves the pot you know we're certainly positive you know go really learn about it it's an incredibly interesting area we want more people to come enter the ecosystem and I think it still early days and what do you think about kind of the regulatory influence because sometimes I look at what the SEC is doing and I totally understand why they're doing it and yet I do feel like it's also still perpetuating the system of the status quo where the wealthy accredited investors get in early and yet at the same time we understand what they're doing it but do you think that there's any way that yeah I think for example look I'm not I'm not a lawyer I'm not a regulator but I think this idea that that okay I mean so let's look at why why these rules are there the rules are there for good reasons to protect kind of Main Street investors from you know from people that are tricking them out of their money essentially right and that and if you don't have those rules that will happen right and so you need to have regulation and so regulation is important and I think the question is you know is for example with the definition of an accredited investor is it is the basic assumption implicit in that that you have to have a million dollars or whatever it is to be able to essentially the way it works right is you have to go through all the like there are certain exemptions where you're allowed to sell so for example we invest in in startups we're operating through an exemption that says because we're a qualified instant credit a qualified institution you know we can that we can not go through all of the kind of ownerís stuff that some one would go through like in an IPO right so like with that for example that definition credit investor like I think a more modern version like okay I think that if somebody knows is a sophisticated software developer who has spent years studying cryptocurrency but isn't a millionaire are they a sophisticated investor and able to make their own decisions I think so you know should there be an alternative way to become an accredited investor for example like you can go and take a test or a programming test or you know crypto test or something like I think that would be a great idea I'm not I don't control these rules but I've had to actually somebody teach me that or mention something like that I mean you could imagine more creative ways to decide I think what you want look you do want to avoid this thing where you don't want you know you've seen I've seen these people like with these Yahoo ads and things like trying to sell some random cryptocurrency none of us ever heard of to some person you know this would this is a bad thing right we don't want this none of us want this we don't want this in the community we don't want this ethically like and that will happen if you don't have rules so the tricky question is how do you come up with a set of rules that allow sophisticated people who aren't rich to participate in the system while also protecting kind of you know quote unquote but they call mainstream investors you know who aren't going to get you know kind of tricked by these people and you know I don't have all the answers but I agree with the sentiment but but but I don't think but I will say I don't think the answer is just like the sort of the what I think some people want to do which is sort of get rid of all the rules I think you do need for these protections I think they're very important I think well we I think ideally we have a regulatory system that balances those two things and balances innovation provides clarity to people in the space and also protects Main Street investors I know you're a fan of Carlotta Perez's mug technological revolutions in financial capital and in that book she talks about how new technologies come along and they saw the problems that became apparent with the full maturation of the previous technological revolution so I just wondered and I know this isn't like I was thinking this is kind of a tough question but I'm just so curious do you think that there are certain problem problems that decentralization will bring that aren't apparent now but will become apparent decades from now enough so what what might those be I just sort of unintended consequences here yeah I kind of like where we are what the Facebook Cambridge analytical data prime know look I I think a lot about the fact that I was I was involved in the sort of the you know the web 2 movement and it didn't end the way that I wanted it and I think a lot of other people wanted it to end which was this kind of you know I mean frankly we were maybe you know kind of this utopian maybe so maybe maybe in retrospect somewhat naive you that by creating these giant new information networks it would have this you know awesome democratizing impact and so you know I I was hoping it would have this sort of awesome democratizing impact and you know I think it did have a lot of very positive impacts but I think the idea that like women up with five companies running the internet was not where I wanted to so for example one obvious you know kind of failure mode here is you know we end up just creating new kind of giant monopolies that control everything or something and maybe that's you know maybe they're decentralized and there's a few giant you know kind of coin holders who own that and end up running things and that would certainly wouldn't be a good outcome right that's why I was going with another question too I mean that's what we had this the you probably know the placeholder folks they had a day at a conference for one of the sessions I was part of was what they call resent realization vectors so you know so new ways in which we sort of unintentionally get resent relies and how do we make sure or this time that this movement you know keeps true to the ideals and so so I think I think keeping you know keep being aware of where those kind of resent realization vectors could be is an important point I think that's to me that's an obvious failure mode yeah well one thing I wanted to also ask about is universal basic income is an idea that's been bandied about a lot in recent years and I do feel like a blockchain could be an ideal way to dispense such an income have you seen any projects like this and do you think that's an interesting idea or something that you think could democratize this space yeah so putting aside so that I think the ubi thing is a whole separate thing I think for example Brian Armstrong just launched a new charity called great give crypto which one of the ideas is there's been a lot of studies around kind of how to sort of provide assistance to people in the developing world and it it turns out intuitively or counter-intuitively or whatever that just kind of directly giving people money is actually a very effective way to do it as opposed to providing them you provide them with shoes and you end up actually inadvertently like putting the shoe vendor out of business and hurting the local economy or whatever or the shoes get lost along the way or they don't fit or whatever and so it turns out just directly giving money but that's actually very hard to do in a lot of the places in the world and so for example one of the things they're working on I think it's exciting idea is how do you use you know this technology to to make sure that the it goes to the rightful person and so you can do a whole bunch of interesting things around identity and and you know taking advantage of the fact that there's so many more and right phones out there and things like that so I think things like that are super interesting there's a whole I mean the whole ubi thing I think it's also interesting it's a whole separate can of worms all right well we're gonna end on something that in your podcast with Patrick O'Shaughnessy he started with and I wanted to start with but I was like I can't start with the same question he started with so you study philosophy as your major and I mentioned this to you before you may not remember but my major was called modern thought literature so it's sort of like philosophy literature um but I heard you wanna another podcast we were saying that in recent years you've been turning to philosophers like the ancient Greeks and thinking about ways in which one could live a good life so I just wondered um you know here we've got these new networks that sort of create incentive structures that could incentivize people to do different things and I wondered if you thought crypto assets couldn't anyway help people live better lives or maybe it's the opposite maybe you know actually we're not we're seeing there's all these scammers and stuff but I wondered you know what your thoughts were around like merging those two those two things yeah no I think there's definitely I mean I think this is very me so I think for example the idea that you could have new okay so my assumptions are the Internet is the most important technology of this century or something and will and will control and we're already seeing this happen like politics economics so you know if you maybe people listeners don't agree with me but I think that's just obviously the case and that who controls the Internet you know could probably controls all these other very powerful things in society right and and how the money flows and a whole bunch of other things and so and I think for example this should be a golden period for creators so for writers you know like you for musicians for all sorts of people we now have you know soon to have almost everyone on earth with a internet access it should be an amazing time for coordinating human activity for sharing knowledge for sharing create creative acts for having the people that create those things participate in the economics of those things I think that the way that we've constructed the networks that govern the Internet today is not doing a good job at that and so I think this is a chance to try to improve that more like kind of in a more meritocratic way share information share knowledge or education share money have a better way of you know having a information network that creates better politics not worse politics I don't think we've succeeded as at that so far we Knight technology community no and it's not it's not a good thing and I think I think it's the most important thing this is what gets me excited about this frankly is that I am NOT excited about I was not I mean you know the crypto thing this is why I'm doing the crypto fun this is why because I feel like this is a this has gravitas this has a this movement has a chance to do something very important you know for the internet which is such an important be an increasingly important thing and you know I personally had no interest in like sort of another whatever you know chat app or whatever like this kind of stuff that was happening in the venture world that was not exciting to me this is exciting this is important so look I don't want to like sound you know naively tow peon I realize that that this this could not work that this could go wrong that there's all sorts of things but I think it's a problem worth working on and I think this is by far the most likely technology for improving these things and so I don't know I've decided to effectively devote my life to it and and and I'm excited to work with people who are excited about it and I think it's a huge important topic and and I hope that we can construct new information networks that that do a better job than the current ones are going yeah yeah we'll see we'll see what happens um well this has been such a great discussion where can people learn more about you and andreessen horowitz working to learn more so and their new crypto fund yeah s you can see crypto calm and so we have a blog post there
