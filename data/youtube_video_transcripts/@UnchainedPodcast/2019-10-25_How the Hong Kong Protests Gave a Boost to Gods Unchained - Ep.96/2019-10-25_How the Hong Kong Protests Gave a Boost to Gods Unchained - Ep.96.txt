regulation and to monitor compliance today's guest is James Ferguson CEO and co-founder of immutable creators of God's Unchained welcome James hi Laura thanks a box for having me on the podcast your company got caught up in one of the recent sports controversies around feet free speech and Hong Kong and of course Chinese censorship tell us what happened so this was a really interesting week for us aah-ha stone which is a video game where players battle with different trading cards has a large eSports tournament and that one of their players called blitz Kong when he had won his round announced afterwards on their live stream to the proud to liberate Hong Kong the revolution of our times and in response to that blizzard and hearthstone confiscated his winnings and banned him for 12 months and for us we decided that we would i reimburse blitz Cheung fair any prize money that was taken away from him and also give him an invitation to compete in our world tournament which has a $500,000 prize pool for AL game gods unchained and the reason which we did this was this was extremely aligned with our values we have a game which is quite similar to blizzards game hostile in the way it's played with a big difference being that in our game God's unchained you actually own the cards in the game in a decentralized manner something which we find very strengths stated the world that we really don't like is that game studios currently are the ultimate centralized authority and because of this amount of power that they will they have to there are pressures on them to weigh in on political events like this and respond to different foreign pressures and take away items from players that those players have earned we envision a brand new business model and a brand new economy where it this needs decentralization as well to move this power away from the games publisher and the game studio but one in weeks not only should a games publisher or creator not be able to take away something that a player has earned they won't even have that pressure coming on them they shouldn't be sort of expected to respond to these sorts of pressures I'm so curious because obviously you or your company has been working on this for such a long time before all of this happened you know this was just a few weeks ago so when you came up with the idea for gods unchained like what was the reason that you had that as one of your philosophical principles that games should be decentralized was it for situations like this or for other kinds of issues this is one example of something which is rife in the industry so the video game industry the context for a lot of people who may not know is absolutely huge it is 140 billion dollars per year and 90 billion dollars of that is spent on players buying so cold in-game items but these in-game items are not real you're not buying ownership of them players of just buying license to use them on a certain server they can never transfer them from their account they can't sell them on later etc and with this business model without real ownership players are essentially just spending gigantic amounts of money renting short-term entertainment value and we see that as something that is a really really rough deal for players the free-to-play gaming business model which is used in mobile currently where players are hyped up to be in a you know high spending state where they're very happy because maybe they've just passed a level and then they're found they find out that they're then frustrated because they can't pass the next level unless they then pay $10 in and they can quickly do that we think of that is manipulative and just not fun or good value for players so what we see is a world where players are buying items which are real they can trade it with their friends they can give it away to their friends just as though they owned the item in the real world and we're very excited by what that allows us to do in terms of player engagement play a retention play a sharing just because we're giving them so much more value so let's go back to what happened with blitz showing after you made your offer to him what kind of response did you get so us we made the a thought to blitzed wrong the tweet got 32 over 30 thousand likes and 10,000 or so retweets and in the end 7 million impressions which led a large amount of hearthstone players who think that it is reasonably outrageous that a player would have their winnings taken away from them in this situation looking for a game that respects their right as players i all signed up for god's unchained so a large amount we doubled our signup rate and our player base essentially overnight well but so along with that good news there was some bad news that happened your company was the target of cyber attacks shortly thereafter so tell us about that yeah that was quite interesting so the next day as we were getting more and more users for most people with ever had visit our site and they're all in a fantastic they're very primed because are a part of our exact value proposition that we will never take away the items that players earned has just been demonstrated how this can go wrong in centralized games companies our servers started being DDoS luckily with the engineering team they were able to we had people wake up at 3 a.m. our time and they were able to resolve the issue within about six hours of sort of emergency meeting bringing in the sort of expert and external expert team as well in order to harden everything up but yeah that was quite interesting that we got ddosed within 24 hours have been announcing and just briefly so I understand because we've been talking about how its decentralized but yet you have your own servers is that just because there are certain activities that are done on your servers and then other activities especially regarding like the cards or like anything that the users themself or the players themselves own that those would be honest an ethereal smart contract or something that's decentralized yeah exactly so this is a really interesting issue which is how decentralized can you get and how do you evolve to become more decentralized over time if we tried to build a triple a quality video game that was highly engaging like gods unchained on aetherium that's simply not possible even if you're using state of the art state channels or layer 2 solutions just because there's so much computational complexity that goes into making a really in-depth eSport what is absolutely critical though is that ownership of assets is entirely decentralized and for us this is the fine middle ground until we finally have that technology called capability where you can move more and more stuff on chain so who owns the items what different rarities are are how many can be created what the different scarcities are that all exists on aetherium governed by a smart contract and then we built out different engines that catch it and make it usable by players who the vast majority of our players have never interacted with crypto ever in their and ever before in their lives they just want to play a video game where they can own and real-world trade their items on an open economy ok and so did you ever figure out who was behind the DDoS attacks we didn't thankfully the our resilience of this structure means that we can now withstand these attacks we didn't ever find out who was behind them in a moment we're gonna continue on with the fallout from the blizzard protest and how it's affected gods in Shane but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and

that's ii t/o are calm and build your crypto portfolio the smart way today back to my conversation with James Ferguson of immutable so the story actually just keeps going because I saw that then a few American University students were inspired to make a similar protest about Hong Kong so tell tell the listeners what happened then and how that's affected you it's very interesting is that when a company tries to censor some information or censor something that normally makes things worse and so what has happened for Blizzard with hearthstone is that a large amount of different Americans and people from all around the world have been rallying behind this idea that it is ridiculous and not the place of a games company in order to censor people for what they consider like their free and fair political speech and so what happened was a demo an eSports team from an American University then immediately followed up with another similar protest on a high stone stream in the tournament and their suspension at first they were just given a warning and then that was later upped to be a suspension as well but I think that what people are saying is that this is not something that is a one-off issue this is not a hopefully we can forget about it and it will all die down issue people feel very passionately that if their that games should not be involved in confiscating earnings from players for external reasons and especially when some of those external reasons our freedom of speech yeah yeah and for sure I'm sure the whole issue that started with the NBA is fueling a lot of this sentiment yeah because the American University students they they're the sign that they held up set free Hong Kong and boycott blitz so they you know they really yeah yeah but so then now are they playing so yeah one of them in an interview said that God's Unchained it is again that they're switching to and we've reached out and we have also invited them to our $500,000 World Championship for God's Unchained at the same time we've had a phenomenal response from other card game streamers and professionals who all love God's untamed not just because the game itself is complex for them and a great game but it is also aligned with their values and they love the idea that they can own these items as well so one other thing that I just wanted to verify when I was like noodling around on this I saw that maybe Blizzard actually tried to keep people from leaving their platform like people were seeing that Blizzard deactivated the different authentication methods there were like four of them apparently to stop people from deleting their accounts but I couldn't figure out if this was true this was something I saw on Twitter do you know about that yeah we we heard that we heard that assertion as well we didn't manage to see whether or not it was confirmed but at the end of the day it starts I wonder if there's some analogy between what happened with uber and lyft and when people were dissatisfied with the culture that existed at uber at that time and essentially decided that in order to align with their values they wanted to close down their uber account and switch to a similar or superious this like lift right so one other thing that I also couldn't figure out is what is this status of gods Unchained because it looks like it's sort of live but then maybe sort of not live and I wasn't sure totally you know where it is in terms of its launch so this is a question we get asked a couple of times because the way which games launch and exist now in the last couple of years has entirely changed from back in the day when you used to buy a disc and then that it the game is launched and you can play the game now games essentially exists as a live service model so while God's Unchained is in early access people you can join and play gods and change currently and last week we had like a hundred thousand matches each game is approximately ten minutes long so it means that there's something like a God's Unchained game being played by someone around the world every three or four seconds so the game is very much live in that sense and the word launch has sort of lost its meaning in recent times okay and do you have numbers on like how many users you had before versus how many you have now so we went from approximately almost 30,000 signups to 60,000 now and that number is still increasing at a higher rate than it ever was before and that group is predominantly gamers it's not people interested in crypto it's people who love the idea of the value proposition of actually being able to own and trade your cards on an open economy but who don't really have any interest or any knowledge about Bitcoin or aetherium and who are interacting with it for the very first time and can you tell where they are geographically it's quite spread from all around the world so we're very popular in USA as well as Southeast Asia and also Latin America okay but for the new users do you notice because since they're sort of like politically motivated I wondered you know where they were coming from ah we find them to be moist from the USA and Southeast Asia is the man okay main sources which I think make sense as well because they're people who hold similar values to us okay and when is the tournament so the gods Unchained at first world tournament is coming up next year something which we did was we set aside 10% of all the revenues from card sales and would put it towards the prize pool for this torrent tournament which at over 500 thousand US dollars I is one of the largest first-ever tournaments for an eSport in the world ever I so we're all about that and the other people who were thrilled about that the game ins who all are very interested in playing and trying to win for part of this prize a couple of things which I think are very interesting as well is that in order to compete in this you need a ticket which is also a tradable token and the market cap there exists a liquid market for tickets in order to enter the tournament as well interesting well so this actually relates to a question that I was wondering which is so obviously when people play games they want the game was to be fair but in this sort of situation is there some way that you've structured the game such that people can't just like buy their way to victory because you know yeah so this is this is one of the most important things how can you build in order for the gods unchained economy to be strong ah and there to be demand for all these different cards over a long period of time so five years plus five to ten years you need to make sure that you don't have what is called a pay to win mechanic because that means that very quickly there there is just superior goods and there's no reason for this economy to exist so there are two things which we've done in this regard which are very interesting apart from you know hiring the absolute best people in the world so we all gain director for God's Unchained is the he was the game director for Magic the Gathering arraign which is one of the most popular card games in the world I recently launched and it's lauded as being a very high quality product and we've been able to bring human and his expertise over to God's Unchained in order to make sure that the game is balanced but the mechanic which you go down in the end is when you pay more money you get not better cards but you get to try new it new tactics the tactics are necessarily superior ah but you get more content for the game something else which we have built out as well which has been working extremely well for us is our play to earn system so by playing God's unchanged batches you can actually earn cards and prizes which can then be sold and based on this we have had players beating the minimum wage in their country by playing God's unchained and what that does for sharing to new players and our attention that is one of the reasons that our game is doing so well okay just so I understand what you were saying earlier about how the items that you can purchase don't give you like better skills which is new in different ones then like in the marketplace how does that translate into different prices for these various items there none fungible tokens so the value behind an item comes from a couple of different things there is utility so even you know if something is slightly better it will likely have a higher price we try and avoid that as much as possible what we like people paying for is fun so if the new strategy is more fun to players then we're very happy for people to pay for that we're also happy for people to pay for prestige and status and cosmetics so if you have a diamond version of a card that has the exact same power does he's that same thing as a plain version of the card however the diamond trail is is much higher in terms of its price point and that's because gamers and people all run the world love status and when you're part of a community even if that community is inside a a video game it doesn't matter the human ones are the same everyone wants belonging everyone wants self-esteem everyone wants community everyone wants self-actualization and people also want status and that's what it comes down to as well when you're trying to work out what people will pay for it all right well I guess we'll see how this experiment works it sounds super fascinating and I like how a very unexpected event your your game attention and sort of proved you know the value proposition so thank you so much for coming undone confirmed thank you very much for having me Laurel don't forget everyone next up is the news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this

million others and download the crypto comm app today hi guys thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap I'm sure you can all guess what the first headline is as I have described it in the newsletter Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg chase flattery heat and bizarre questions from Congress and yeah that's pretty much in the description of this pretty I guess maybe schizophrenic is a word to describe the range of feelings and attitudes that the lawmakers had toward Facebook and Zuckerberg he took heat for all kinds of things including limiting anti-vaxxer other times when he was just completely cut off from the question he had from answering the question he had just been asked and then other times when he was not even asked questions at all because the representative wanted to use the full time for grandstanding but anyway despite all that he did manage to get across that Facebook wants to go forward only with US regulators approval but that the Libre Association is now in control of Libre that Facebook does not control the association so that of course creates this potential scenario where Libra could move forward without Facebook which would be pretty interesting to see play out but I actually think it still is unlikely the fact is that Facebook is best position to offer up a competitive alternative to a digital renminbi and you know how what that looks like is still an open question but you know with their scale and their user base it-- i do think that is the case the NYT had a great write-up on the term offensive that Facebook and the Libre Association undertook in Washington leading up to the hearing but of course skepticism remained the FT wrote an article that posed a great question which was quote how is it possible to bring the grave swell of unbanked on board and at the same time satisfy all the sanctions compliance and money laundering rules that come along with transacting in the big currencies and of course at the other governments were also still skeptical with the French economy and finance ministers saying of Libre quote the project would mean a private company controlling a common good and taking over tasks normally discharged by States this is unacceptable for both economic and political reasons the second story I wanted to cover is actually something that came out last Thursday but I didn't manage to get it in last week's news recap and it's about the g7 working group on stable coins issuing a report and I just have to say that first it amazes me that the g7 has a working group on stable coins like if I think back two years ago when I started covering this and nobody cared and I could barely even you know get stories to write about this topic approved like this this is we've come a long way anyway the report highlights the risks of stable coins one of the notable points that it made was about cybersecurity and Dave of data privacy being an especially big issue for a global stable coins that reach scale which of course I'm sure any of you who have ever shopped at Target or who have a credit score or who shopped at Home Depot or had a yahoo email account any of you I'm sure know that cybersecurity is a huge issue and of course we are all always talking about data privacy and a second it also talked about how a global stable coin could have the impacts on financial stability and economies of multiple countries which is something that we have discussed on the show and another point I found interesting was that it said if widely adopted the global stable coins could cause a reduction in deposits at commercial banks which is something not exactly that I discussed in the show with the Federal Reserve economist David Anil fado but some a related topic came up however the report did and by recommending that authorities quote ensure a level playing field that encourages competition in related news Tyler Cohen and George Mason University economist and author of the Marshall revolution plug wrote an op-ed in Bloomberg saying that he thinks it would be bad for central banks to issue their own digital currencies because it would likely inhibit lending which is the topic we just discussed and that in turn would depress the economy also he said it would increase the number of economic institutions that are regulated like banks which would spread onerous financial regulations beyond quote the narrow core of the banking system he also points to the fact that China is in the lead on a central bank currency saying that that has to do with the fact that it's banking and payment system are already state-run and state controlled and he says that a central bank digital currency would basically take our system which is a blend of centralized and decentralized and tilt it more towards centralized next headline why aetherium killers have an uphill battle CRISPR is key of placeholder' ventures wrote a great analytical piece outlining some of the factors that could make or break the various aetherium color killers that are coming online as he puts it quote a common logic I've seen in almost every aetherium Killer it goes something like our technology is superior to aetherium x' thus we deserve a similar if not superior networked valuation but he says that if a good enough network technology has enough tooling and distribution then those network effects can outweigh the potential benefits of switching to an alternative with better technology but worse network effects he also makes some interesting points about how proof of state networks gain traction versus proof of work ones with a main point there being that proof of stake networks need killer applications to create demand for the services being offered on that network I highly recommend that you guys check out this analysis because it actually goes into a lot more than I'm able to describe here but it was really really interesting it was probably worth actually a couple reads next headline is about backed which is going to be offering which is going to be launching Bitcoin options on futures December 9th and also they noted that yesterday or not yesterday Wednesday they saw a record 590 contracts of the backed Bitcoin monthly futures hands next headline mining is an effective strategy for money laundering so speaking of money laundering as the lawmakers did with Zuckerberg on Wednesday according to elliptic one of the more effective if less popular at the moment ways to launder money is through mining rights Tim Lloyd at the block quote the key to this laundering technique is the transfer of illicit funds via custom transaction fees paid to the miner this potentially could be a growing area for money launderers and as we know it is one of the ways that I think North Korea has gotten into the crypto game to evade sanctions which I believe was discussed on a previous show next headline circles game plan unclear last week circle announced that it had sold crypto exchange Polonia X and it's rumored that the buyer is an Asian investment group headed by Tron CEO Justin Sun now Frank Shapiro rates in the block the open question is what lines of revenue circle can depend on with as various products and services such as circle pay circle research and its one-time money-making OTC desk all axed or reduced a couple possibilities include custody and lending and perhaps interest off its Abell coin u.s. DC but right now that last business is probably only bringing in a couple million dollars so we shall see if it manages to make us mark a smart pivot or if it ends up getting sold because the rumor is that it has been shopping itself around to the likes of coinbase this week's fun bits is a tweet from Ryan Sean Adams who had a very pithy summary of this week's hearing with Mark Zuckerberg he says Zuckerberg is pitched to the US government you can't let China pull ahead we'll bend the knee you run them on monetary policy what will we build the tech we keep USD as global King and get rid of cash and 10x your financial surveillance your dollar plus our tech what do you say alright that's it for this week's news to learn more about the topics that James and I discussed as well as the stories from this week's news recap be sure to check out the links in the show notes of your podcast player if you enjoyed this episode be sure to share it on Facebook Twitter Linkedin and confirmed as produced by me at Lauren with help from factual recording Anthony Yoon Daniel Ness and Josh Durham thanks for listening you [Music]
