today's guest is chris harland dunaway freelance reporter for the verge welcome chris hey thanks for having me laura you recently wrote a long article for the verge called the many escapes of justin's son what was your story about and why did you write it the story is about the many escapes of justin's son and they're mostly unknown escapes they're sort of behind the scenes regulatory escapes or physical escapes running from a country in this case china that's how the story begins but i decided to write the story because i first wrote a profile about justin i think a bit over a year ago and uh it took quite a while to write put it together put it out but the story didn't really touch on the cryptocurrency that underpins justin's crypto empire and it was more of a labor story it was more about what it was like in the workplace if you worked for justin sun and sort of cobbling together a picture of who this guy was through that after i finished that story uh news sources approached me to talk to me and i learned a lot more about the crypto side the financial side so really i set out to write a financial story where i could follow the money as closely or as you know most attainably as possible and sort of go after that find out as much as i could and this is really the product of that and some very courageous sources really leaned on them a lot to put this story together so the article opens with justin's son at seoul's international airport what was he doing there and why was that a significant moment this is really his first escape so he had learned from cz of binance chiang panzao that uh there would be an ico ban in china and he was tipped off and so he conducted his ico for trx you know his king making token and he finished it off the next day the ban went into effect and he was afraid sources told me he was afraid that he would be caught for this because it was a sort of shady maneuver potentially illegal maneuver it's hard to really say how the authorities would have dealt with it and he must have felt the same way apparently felt the same way and decided he'd be better off leaving the country as quickly as he could and so this scene that unfolds in seoul incheon international airport is him you know awaiting his flight to get out of you know any potential reach of the chinese authorities and he landed in san francisco where he he hid out for a bit and bought bittorrent for that matter shortly after and as you mentioned earlier you got your story from 15 sources who did not speak to you on the record you also were able to get confidential documents why did these people not want to use their names and then what can you tell us about those leaked internal tron documents you were able to obtain these 15 current and former employees are all very very intimidated by speaking frankly about the behavior and potentially illegal conduct of a billionaire this is sort of the reality of working for a billionaire they have enormous financial resources to chase you in court should they wish to should they wish to try to hunt you down and sue you for defamation they can do that and justin's son does have quite a few lawyers in his army to do that and uh sources were afraid from that perspective they were afraid of not being able to work in crypto again if that was the field that they chose to work in or what they were sort of in love in with but then on a more basic level there's some who were just fearful for their life so given the risks that these sources faced and the fears they told me about we granted them anonymity i know who they are i know exactly who they are but to the reader they're anonymous they're referred to as former employees or employees as for the documents i can't really get into the sourcing on that but what they told me is quite a bit about the financial dealings of justin's empire a lot of focus on tron itself but also his personal finances so i was able to learn quite a bit from cobbling together and getting this big old leak from a source when you say that people were worried for their lives is that because of justin's uh temper which is also mentioned in both your previous article and this article i have to be careful here temper could be part of it but so as not to imply what he might or might not do they believed that sun had the resources to potentially harm them that was their belief as they expressed to me wow so you wrote speaking about the financial aspect you wrote about some eyebrow raising but who your son engaged in regarding tron's trx token certain market-making behaviors as they were called what was he doing there and what's your sense of whether or not that was illegal that's a really good question so the illegality or potential illegality i'll get to that second but first of all here's what i learned from sources the person who led the market making team was this guy zhu bao long like sort of quiet technocratic worker at tron uh clearly a finance guy and um he had this one-on-one lunch with one of my sources where they went to the seafood restaurant they were eating this river fish called crucian and the source begins asking jubalong so what's the market making team do and he says it's to keep among other things we keep the price the value of trx at a certain level that justin wants and so the source goes oh well how does how do you go about doing that and he said well you know we know when good news is going to be released by tron and so we'll buy trx and wait for the good news to be released it comes out to the public the value of trx almost you know always rises as a result of the good news and then they would sell the trx and this was something that the source as they heard at the lunch became fearful because in their mind they said this is the so-called market making is insider trading and they're doing it all the time so to your question is insider trading they're clearly using material non-public information that is the key part of the law if you're using that to trade on securities and make money off of securities that's that's a problem but the question is sort of like has that law been extended to crypto before and the lawyers i spoke to who work at the intersection of crypto and finance said they their opinion was unanimous that their a case can be made that insider trading law applies to crypto the key thing is whether a crypto's deemed a security or not you know a security old-fashioned word for an investment and if it is a security in their opinion indeed insider trading law applies to it however it's not well tested it's really not something that's been widely tested so it's one of these realms of the law that crypto sort of you know piled into and everyone's looking around wondering is that sort of enforcement going to happen or not yeah this comes up in my book as well clearly there are behaviors that people would recognize sort of as insider meeting but because these are considered commodities or or are not clearly defined as securities um technically it's not illegal but um i'm i'm actually pretty sure that most crypto people know that this is going on because you'll often see those tweets where it'll be like look at the look at the trading volume and the price action on this token before they announced their liquidity mining scheme or you know whatever and then it's very clear like insiders were you know banking on the the price pop after the announcement so it's one of those things all you need to do is see the timeline it's one of those very elegant things that you can show in data pretty clearly um so it's i agree it's very interesting when stuff like that happens and and to your point like the the source who told me about the meeting with juba jubalong also said you know this is not just a gray area this is a black area we don't know a whole lot about yeah yeah i found that to be such an interesting quote [Laughter] um all right so in a moment we're gonna talk about how sun tried to obtain sort of like regulatory approval whatever that might be even if it's in air quotes um but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible join

legitimacy and regulatory approval was something that justin's son was seeking how did he go about trying to obtain that well going back to sort of the theme of the story this idea of escape you there's physical escape running from china uh for example but then there's this other sort of trap door he sort of sussed down detected in the us and that's quite simply legal arguments you can sort of forestall the consequences against you if you have a complicated or clever or just you know a bunch of lawyers who support you or at least write legal findings for you that can limit your liability potentially and so justin was detected this and he began approaching lawyer after lawyer after lawyer asking for legal findings that would deem trx or btt which is bittorrent token which used later ico'd in the us and these legal findings were to deem that they're not securities that's what he sought and so he approached among them that the sort of most notable one is this guy david labhart who was a former sec compliance officer and that was a big reason why justin hired him he thought you know wouldn't it be great if we had someone from the sec that would look awesome and so david labhart had this sort of tense strange job interview with justin where labhart was proposing to just overhaul the compliance process at tron and justin would sort of go no no no you don't understand i just would like a sort of decisive legal finding that trx is not a security and of course that was a bit confusing for lab part but uh sun sort of continued to push and push and eventually laphart resigned expressing you know reservations to put it mildly about how justin was approaching the ico with btt and how he was just thinking about the securities law and trying to navigate securities law in general yeah i actually have to say i found those passages kind of funny and there was another one with a hong kong lawyer where he finally did obtain the letter stating that it wasn't a security in the us the commentary was like can you do that can you get a letter from a hong kong lawyer where it's not even clear if they practice in the us to make a statement about u.s law so that was just hilarious when i heard that source say that i i was like these are all great questions so that's why it's in the piece exactly you know and part of the article also goes into the corporate structure of kind of the poloniex bittorrent tron set up what was your finding there well poloniex when it was purchased by justin was moved you know the main corporate entity was placed in the seychelles and you know distant island which is known for being quite crypto friendly is one way to look at it or you know not aggressive with regulation against crypto is another way to say it that's where they set up shop and then poloniex itself which he had just acquired became this blandly named llc called august tech so august tech was owned by poloniex and seychelles but really all of the politics employees in boston who have always been working for poloniex were just working for this blandly named you know corporate entity now and it was sort of puzzling i asked sources about why and one of them pointed out you know it's just a very confusing corporate structure potentially to just obfuscate responsibility potentially but um one thing that several sources pointed out is that if you're a user for poloniex and you had some type of injury not physical injury legal injury that you wanted to adjudicate you would likely have to go to the seychelles to be in the correct jurisdiction to you know solve your problem so would you do that i can't think of a whole lot of people who would you know book a flight to seychelles to take up their grievance so it was it was complicated a bit odd and uh the sources always found it found it off-putting that it was reorganized that way one of the craziest stories in your article is something called operation couch cushions tell us what that was operation couch cushions was sort of the baby of a brainstorming session for alternate revenue for poloniex and in this brainstorming session engineers had just sort of talked about how there's this stuff called dust in the exchange and dust were just you know slivers of bitcoin or other tokens that had just for whatever reason or another been forgotten by users or were sort of locked up in the exchange's code in some unusual way and it should be said poloniex is a very odd exchange coding wise it's quite a mess it was it was written and created by this polymath named tristan dagosta and he legend has it that he got a coding book over the weekend and began building poloniex at the same time so i was going to say i have a whole thing about poloniex in my book and yes multiple people said tristan built the whole thing himself and they were just shocked because normally for an exchange of that size the information of the code would normally be distributed amongst a whole team but everything was in tristan's head like all the kind of weird nooks and crannies of the code and idiosyncrasies of it it was all in his in this one person's head yes you're you're absolutely right your reporting is spot on and in fact like when they wanted uh later on when they wanted to ask questions you would employees would have to go through this complicated process of like using some pgp key to email tristan and then he would have some window of time to respond and he would respond and then you would have to wait like another 10 days before you could ask another question because it had been written into the deal is just very strange but indeed yeah it was all inside this guy's head and he was learning how to code you know as he made it so it is a mess and you know and i mean that in the most complementary way possible because multiple people say this guy you know is a genius but in any case money or dust would get locked up in the exchange and so engineers had identified this one pool of dust and it was all bitcoin and justin encouraged and directed this project called operation couch cushions you know like you're fishing around between the couch cushions for extra change that's stuck in your old couch that's sort of like the joke of the of the operational name so all what they had found is these old tether wallets that ran on this thing omni and basically users had accidentally deposited bitcoin to wallets that would only take tether and so these fractions of bitcoin were sort of trapped and suspended animation outside the wallet they weren't actually in the wall they were just neither fully deposited deposited or you know this strange state so they identified it and they said you know this is about 300 bitcoin and so justin began saying where's my 300 bitcoin and the understanding among the employees was the plan is now that justin's going to take the bitcoin so eventually the operation went into effect and this is something that is amazing because you can see it happening on the blockchain i was able to track it down with the help of great sources and identify these transactions in the blockchain that showed all of the money being siphoned out of these problematic wallets instantaneously you know hundreds thousands of wallets and then put into an anonymous wallet and then forward it on to the one of poloniex's hot wallets one of the communal wallets and that's sort of where the trail goes close goes cold i have to be clear we couldn't trace it back to justin personally and part of that is just because these hot wallets have so much user money being deposited and withdrawn that it's really hard to do the forensics the the chain analysis and forensics to figure out where it went but uh what we do know is that it ended up in the polonique's hot wallet and as one uh lawyer who specializes on financial crime and cryptocurrency told me after i told him the story his name's andrew burstein there's likely not a big difference between poloniex and justin at this point anyways because he is the sole owner and thus whether he took it personally or whether polo took it is sort of a moral distinction the legal distinction first teen is saying is that there's not much distinction it's basically the same thing and uh he he clarified to me yes theft by conversion is a crime wow that's i mean it's just shocking so you know with everything that justin son has done he seems to have an awareness that he probably will need some regulatory cover somewhere and you write about several countries that he seemed to be wooing malta saint kitten nevis guinea bissau or i don't know how to say that and even he somehow seems to have repaired his relations with china and yet it does seem like the us government's after him so i i literally just combined four questions into one because we're running out of time so can you just wrap up kind of like what his regulatory picture is at the moment and also relate this to his recent bombshell which is that he's now an ambassador for granada to the world trade organization right so the simple short and long of it is sort of boiled down to one moment in a meeting where he was announcing a risky business decision and wanted to pursue it and people in the meeting pushed back and he said well what's the worst thing that can happen if if i get in trouble i just won't come to the u.s again pretty straightforward right and so this got me thinking and by talking to other sources i learned that indeed he had pursued citizenship at other places in the world namely malta is the one that i had the most information about very interesting he sent this representative from tron to go meet with government officials in malta who welcomed his so-called investment as part of the individual investor program you can essentially buy a passport from malta for the if you go through the process and he did and he was also looking for citizenship for his mother and father which was very interesting it was sort of an indication that this could potentially be one of these you know hatches they can escape through should things really get bad for him in any and you mentioned some of some other countries he either said he had citizenship for or said he was pursuing citizenship for so he had built this picture again of a man on the run or at least setting up escape routes should he get in trouble and it appears indeed that he could be in quite a bit of trouble i learned that there's a grand jury investigation by the southern district of new york which typically handles financial crime on wall street and they're conducting this grand jury investigation into him for a list of a long list of financial crimes you know wire fraud money laundering spending the ill-gotten gains of the crime and defrauding the united states selling security and lying about it these are the charges they're exploring i should be clear they're exploring he has not been formally charged there's no indictment so far as i know but in any case this is a multi-agency investigation the fbi the irs southern district of new york looking into this and so they've been interviewing people and you know in the story there's a little anecdote of an interaction between the irs irs agent fbi agent and one of my sources which was revealing for what they were searching for and many of their questions seemed to link back to concerns that he had maybe broken the law when it came to taxes tax evasion is a is a potential thing that they're looking into so that's where where things lie at the moment okay well we will have to see how things pan out for him and just before we close i'm sure you reached out to him for commentary what was the response i asked him for an interview and gave him quite a bit of time to reply and then eventually we sent a long list of questions addressing every factual assertion that's in the story asking for comment from him and we gave him 24 hours as is you know standard practice we received a statement from his law firm representing him are the lawyers for vox media and the lawyer we've retained from ballard's bar they received this message in the middle of the night and they included a statement which we put into the story which is that um none of these allegations are true and uh justin's law firm harder llp accused me of yet another attempt to impair his reputation and so that is his final say on the matter aside from him tweeting the day the story was released what did and what did he tweet um he didn't push back particularly hard on specifics but uh he said that you know long story short this is a fabricated narrative fabricated storytelling false allegations a couple claims about poloniex basically running things in a legit way but not really replying to some of the largest accusations in in the piece that that sources told me about in any sort of substantive way huh okay all right well this has been such a fascinating conversation thank you so much for coming on unchanged thank you laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap biden's executive order leaves regulators with tons of homework on wednesday president biden signed the much anticipated executive order on ensuring responsible development of digital assets the document requests preliminary research and policy proposals from various government agencies on digital assets defined as cbdc's cryptocurrencies and stable coins by the executive order the white house described the executive order as the first ever whole of government approach to addressing the risks and harnessing the potential benefits of digital assets and their underlying technology the attorney general secretary of state secretary of the treasury the secretaries of labor commerce energy and homeland security appear to be spearheading the research along with directors administrators and chairs of various other agencies financial regulators like the commodities futures trading commission securities and exchange commission federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the controller of the currency will also add commentary topics expected to be covered include cbdc technology which the biden administration says it is considering with the highest urgency along with the environmental impact of digital ledger technology and the potential money laundering and illicit finance risks associated with digital assets coin center's executive director jerry brito felt the executive order struck a good tone he tweeted the message i take from this eo is that the federal government sees cryptocurrency as a legitimate serious and important part of the economy and society the blockchain association's jake schravinski agreed with brito anyone worried that president biden's executive order would spell doom and gloom for crypto can fully relax now the main concern was that the eo might force rushed rule making or impose new and bad restrictions but there's nothing like that here it's about as good as we could ask based on crypto price movements the market reaction to the order was also positive with the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies rising 6.2 percent on wednesday from tuesday on a related note the u.s labor department's bureau of labor statistics reported that the consumer price index a tool gauging inflation rose 7.9 over the past 12 months ukraine is using its crypto dollars to buy non-lethal military equipment data from blockchain analysis firm elliptic shows the government of ukraine has received nearly 63 million dollars in crypto donations to ukraine's blockchain addresses and the ngo come back alive which includes a one million dollar gift in eth from the board ape yacht club nft collection this week a report from coindesk which cites ukraine deputy minister at the ministry of digital transformation alex bornayakov estimates the number is closer to 100 million dollars when factoring in money sent from other small funds it appears donations will not stop at 100 million dollars because on wednesday cryptocurrency exchange kraken announced a 10 million dollar package for ukrainians that will see one thousand dollars in bitcoin dropped to any account based in ukraine created before march 9th additionally kraken will donate an amount equivalent to the total trading fees paid by russian clients in the first half of 2022 and a later package to ukraine according to coindesk the funds are being used for fuel food and other non-lethal supplies such as bulletproof vests with the suppliers directly accepting bitcoin and eath and ukraine holding the funds in a multi-sig wallet with five potential signers it is easier not complicated transparent and faster in comparison to a swift transaction which could take more than a day explained deputy minister alex bornyakov to coindesk on paying with crypto in related news coinbase the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world announced on monday that it had blocked 25 000 addresses related to russian individuals or entities it believes to be engaging in illicit activity coinbase said that many of the addresses were identified prior to russia's invasion of ukraine and that the exchange has not seen a surge in sanctions evasion activity in recent days coinbase reported that it has also shared its internal block list with the government to further support sanctions enforcement this payment giant now supports crypto businesses stripe launched crypto support on thursday for exchanges wallet providers and
