[Music] you may have heard about interpop a super team laser focused on the emerging landscape of fandom they are tapping into the latest innovations in nfts to revolutionize gaming collectibles and comics on tezos learn more at hello interpop dot io today's guest is gil lauria director of research at d.a davidson welcome gil hey laura good to see you nice to see you on um a big a big week for crypto as the first wall street analyst to cover bitcoin what would you say is the significance of coinbase being public it happened it worked the direct listing worked there were there i was i was anxious going in but here we go 85 billion dollar company that all they do is crypto the listing was successful they're trading nicely it's starting to stabilize i would call that a great success so the reference price was 250 trading quickly searched the price to around 400 but coin did close the day at 328 what were your takeaways from that first day of trading the the direct listing is a not often used way to start especially for a company of this size to start listing on an exchange it is a very high risk way coinbase took a really big risk doing it this way there's benefits we could talk about those but what that means is there is not an investment bank or an investment banking syndicate that controls the trading that day that controls the marketing ahead of time and that's a really big risk because the the firms d davidson at our scale but goldman sachs and morgan stanley are the bigger scale they have refined the craft of the ipo over many decades and so deciding to not have them lead the process to go to a direct listing was actually pretty risky move i understand why they did it but it's a pretty risky move it's what made me anxious but it worked it worked because there was so much supply so much demand the market found itself the reference price was was a good reference price it was the right reference price where the stock trades now is uh is pretty close to some of those late private company transactions that happened in the weeks leading into the listing which is which is good because it doesn't have to go that way um and what i like the most as a stock analyst that recommends stocks is it didn't go too high if it closed yesterday at 800 or a thousand dollars i wouldn't be able to recommend the stock and that would be hard yeah before your target price for coin was 440 dollars and so since it didn't quite reach that what did what did that say to you well a few moving parts for me yesterday so what i did this morning was increase my price target from 440 to 650 and there were a few moving pieces the first is actually that the eve of the listing they disclosed that their share count they consider is 261 million and maybe we could talk about that a little bit more later so that's more than i thought i originally had about 206 million shares so that's one moving piece the second moving piece is that the listing went well had the stock traded down or down significantly yesterday the whole momentum would have been uh impaired not just for coinbase but i would say for crypto that didn't happen so that was great that removed a really big risk that allowed me to treat it more like an established public company as opposed to a not yet listed public company and the last thing i did was say well okay if these guys have all this growth that i believe they have they just reported a fantastic quarter and they're listed and all went well then i can put them in the most exclusive club of stocks these are market leading open-ended growth stories and i would consider there's there's a handful of stocks in that category zoo snowflake octa crowd strike and shopify those stocks trade between 25 and 70 times this year's revenue i put coinbase pretty much in the in the middle to lower end of that range at 40 times revenue and that's how i get to 650 a share wow and um just to go back to your earlier comments when you said that the direct listing did go well even though it was risky so what does that say to you about the demand for coin well it's what we talked about last time which is there's just a tremendous amount of excitement about being able to own a liquid established company that all they do is crypto a pure play crypto company that's that's large established has a great brand and and and people were looking forward to that and one of the interesting things you saw yesterday was that other public companies that have been a quote-unquote play on crypto they lost some steam yesterday as people were selling that exposure to gain exposure to coinbase and because it's such a good pure play investment and i think that's one of the things we saw yesterday again the supply is substantial direct listing means everybody gets to sell their shares there's no lock lock-up periods there's no controlled selling there's no market stabilization everybody could just sell their shares in the open market and so that's a lot of supply the demand was there people wanted exposure to coinbase and they were able to get it and earlier when you talked about companies that saw their stock prices drop a little bit are you talking about kind of like the micro strategies the world or other companies that are viewed as gaining exposure to the price of bitcoin yeah even uh riot marathon but but even companies like square square stock was down yesterday a lot of people invested in square of the last year or two because of how it made it possible to get exposure to bitcoin it was it was a big part of the stocks out performance over the last year or two was uh the tremendous amount of revenue they report based on uh based on bitcoin based on crypto i'd argue their accounting is a little needs to be questioned a little bit but it's it's been a big part of that story and so that stock also underperformed yesterday and so now let's talk about the coinbase market cap um shortly before recording i saw it was at 62 billion you did mention an 85 billion dollar number i'm not sure it was that what it was at yesterday or so that goes back to that share cap question okay if used 261 million shares times 330 or wherever it ends up closing today then you get the higher number right if if you use the 200 million or 206 this is still somewhat subject to interpretation it won't be for long then you get to a lower enough yeah so on twitter i did ask people why they thought the coinbase market cap wasn't in the 100 billion range that people had been talking about earlier and jeff dorman of arca tweeted that the media has been using the wrong share count 261 million where um he says that there are actually 198 million class a and class b shares outstanding so i just wondered you know what's your take on kind of what is the better number to use yeah so let me take you a little bit into the inside baseball of stock research there's a lot of things that we as analysts try to predict ourselves and we only consider what the company tells us as input how much revenue they're going to generate how much profit they're going to generate those are the kinds of things that we our job is to predict and and the company's input is just an input there's things that when the company tells us we don't really question they put out an 8k an sec filing um the night before the direct listing saying our share comes 261 million just like if they told me they're going to pay 20 taxes next year i wouldn't question them i'm not going to question them on their share account that it will get reflect conversation will get refined as they file their next report so as they start filing 10 key reports and 10k reports there's going to be even more detail and there's going to be a consensus formed about which share count to use that consensus is formed by cell side analysts people such as myself and the other analysts at d.a davidson and analysts at other firms we all decide on these what share count do we use again what tax rates we use subtly and and the aggregators thompson reuters facts at bloomberg then decide which one to use so a lot of detail to say as long as the company says it's 261 at this point of the game of a newly listed company we're gonna go with that but we'll find out more about what the right number to use is as they file more filings now there'll still be multiple numbers there's a basic share count there's a diluted share count that they report anybody can do their own calculation about which of the warrants to use at what strike price etc you can always refine that as you go but the other day there's a consensus number what cell side analysts decide on and when they said that they're guiding us to using 261 that's the number we're going to use all right so in a moment we're going to discuss coinbase's outlook for the rest of the year but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible meet interpop a super team redefining the future of nfts and fandom from comics and trading card games to digital collectibles and everything in between they are building the architecture of an entirely new landscape of fandom using technology built on the tazos blockchain to drive their vision visit hello interpop dot io to learn more back to my conversation with gil lauria ellie frost pointed out in her frostbite newsletter that in coinbase's q1 earnings the company only gave its total revenue which was 1.8 billion as well as trading volume which was 335 million and she said that this translates into a 54 basis points take rate but that that doesn't necessarily mean that retail users came out in force since assets on the platform grew from 90 million to 223 billion between q4 and q1 and then she made the point people could have bought on coinbase two quarters ago but kept their assets on the platform and coinbase may certainly may simply be earning more revenues from those people because the subscription revenue is based on the you know the assets on the platform so what does all that say to you about coinbase's ability to smooth out its revenues amidst any of the ups and downs and the in the crypto markets those are all great points and and we're going to get again over time company just listed yesterday over time we're all going to get much better at utilizing numbers we have and the numbers they provide to being able to forecast their results going forward to parse things a little more finely so i'll make a couple of points on that one is a majority of their assets and majority of trading volume are already institutional those come in at much lower take rates so the interplay between institutional trading and retail trading is going to be very important and hopefully at some point they start disclosing that they've already given us some hints and hopefully there's continued disclosure that will allow us to model that well the point about subscription revenue is spot on subscribing overview is often going to be based on the level of assets that's the case for for money managers like fidelity or t row price their their revenue even if it's recurring is is still based on the level of assets so that will be volatile not as volatile as trading volumes but it will still have ups and downs as as crypto goes up and down and we and even and that's a small part of the revenue at this point anyway right so as you know as we spoke of last time their results will be much more volatile than other companies but as long as they grow with the crypto economy they'll grow a lot over time and and that's what is getting people excited among the many eye-popping figures in the q1 earnings coinbase showed that monthly transacting users grew 118 percent quarter over quarter whereas verified users only grew 30 what's your takeaway from that and what does that say to you about where coinbase will end up this year well so those are interesting metrics for us for them to emphasize the the monthly active users that's going to be a function of volatility as as we keep saying these coinvested results are going to depend on how volatile crypto assets are one of the reasons is the more volatile they are the more active traders there are which is how they generate revenue right on those trading commissions so you'd expect in a time of great volatility the number of active traders would grow faster than the number of overall um of overall users and there would be the reverse as volatility goes down if volatility goes down the price of crypto assets stabilizer stabilizes the lower place the number of monthly traders has tended in the past to decline not just growth slower but actually decline and that's something to pay attention to what i found interesting about them guiding to that metric for the balance of the year is that i'm not sure that's a great metric because it doesn't capture that interplay between retail and and institutional retail is paying a far higher take rate than institutional that matters to me a lot more than the number of active traders that number of active traders counts me buying a satoshi hero there the same as elon musk buying a billion and a half dollars all at once and and so that's not a great statistic that you shouldn't be counting those two things the same all right so so then for you what numbers kind of will you be looking for that that mix of trading volume between retail and institutional and as we get our analysis refined how are the take rates within those categories changing are the consumer take rates being pressured as people are expecting i'm not sure about that are the institutional take rates holding up as more and more offerings come into the market etfs grayscale is becomes more competitive etc i think those are if we're going to focus on three or four metrics those are the ones that i'm going to be focusing on coinbase ceo brian armstrong said that over the next five to 10 years he expected 50 of the company's revenues to come from non-trading products and services this was in a cnbc interview what do you think of that projection it's good for him to put that as a stake in the ground right he's starting at four percent so he's got a ways to go but he needs more products like custody like managed staking there's going to be applications that they provide they're invested in the crypto economy they're invested in crypto companies they're going to incorporate those kinds of products the goal is for those products to generate more revenue but that's a long-term goal for for the foreseeable future it's still going to be trading commissions and but do you think he could achieve that fifty percent well within five to oh wow okay absolutely because again the crypto economy is developing at a rate that we haven't seen and uh you know the analogies you know i like to go back to or the internet and how the internet developed and what was amazon doing in 1997 when they went public they were mostly selling books themselves right and and did none of us was expecting them to figure out that it's actually the 3p business the helping other people sell and and the the prime business and and increasingly the cloud business that we're going to be the most important ones jeff bezos may have imagined it but we sure didn't we just knew that amazon was way ahead of the pack they had tremendous leadership and they were so customer-centric which was the absolute key to their success and i see a lot of parallels with coinbase they're well managed they understand the game they're participating in it they know how to how to address the the crypto community they know how to address the uh regulators they know how to address the investment community they're in really good shape to be the ones that help bring to market more and more products in the next several years most likely there will be some margin compression and trading fees what do you think is coinbase's best bet for navigating that and when do you think that might happen so they have to make sure that they stay focused on their value propositions on both sides so on the consumer side their value proposition is ease of use it's the security it's um it's the fact that they're the the pure play right i have somewhere i have more than 10 financial applications on my phone i have paypal venmo i have this bank i have that bank and and so the fact that they're focused is very important for them so they need to stay focused they need to stay safe and and they need to continue to offer more and more tools like coinbase wallet for those people that prefer my key my coin on the institutional side it's it's the same in terms of security again that's going to be the most common aspect compliance is going to be tremendously important institutional investors visibility the fact that coinbase is publicly traded is part of what's going to make them attractive to institutional investors going forward they're the visible company the company that has to disclose of all of its financials they're the company that that their hurdle for compliance is so much higher because if anything wrong happened it would be so much more visible so if they can stay focused on the consumer side on some of those elements on the institutional side on those elements they will continue to have some pricing power but competition always happens and especially in categories like this that grow so fast and are inherently competitive right in in in a decentralized economy a decentralized market it's inherently more competitive than centralized markets and they need to understand that and continue to focus on those elements yeah i agree with you i i do think security probably is one of their top ones and it's just one of the like i noticed in your disclosure you cited that as a risk and it's one of those things that that's hard to quantify but coinbase obviously is pretty much the only exchange in the space that hasn't been hacked which is quite nice yeah last year coinbase notoriously stated that is that it is an apolitical company do you see that harming it as a public company especially at a time when more public companies are being more vocal when it comes to issues like voting rights boy that's that's really tricky all all companies all corporations public and not public have to contend with how to deal with this much more complicated political environment in the interplay between politics and and corporate life i'm not sure i agree with how they handled it i wish they handled it differently we had d.a davidson sure handed it differently we're we're very much internalized the effort to uh to increase diversity and inclusion make that part of our strategy i wish coinbase did the same but i don't think of that as being an investment criteria i think of that as being a civil responsibility and a corporate responsibility but to me as a sell-side analyst as a research analyst trying to make a decision about the stock i i'm not going to hold them to that standard when i covered etsy who is the the polar opposite right a b corp super environmentally friendly i love that they did that i didn't give them any credit for that as a stock though i have to i have to keep those things separate i can be a citizen and a civilian on one side with an opinion about corporate behavior and corporate responsibility but as a research analyst that evaluates stocks i have to keep that separate from my opinion how do you think the coinbase direct listing affected the price of bitcoin and going forward how closely do you expect the coinbase stock price and the bitcoin price to be correlated so let's talk about um causation right um because because the correlation is one thing but the causation is going to go the other way right changes in crypto assets are going to drive coinbase results so coinbase will very much trade like crypto assets which is primarily trade like bitcoin going forward with what they have to prove the burden of proof on them and what i believe it makes coinbase unique is that i believe they're diversified play on crypto so even if it's not bitcoin that wins they'll still win which gives them an advantage if other assets perform very strongly and at the expense of bitcoin they'll still really benefit so that what we're going to really have to watch is they're going to be correlated but is coinbase less volatile or or possibly positively leveraged which is what we saw in the first quarter right we saw these this extraordinary profitability number as coinbase as bitcoin was going up as crypto assets were going up that showed positive leverage if they can show more positive the negative leverage that's what's going to make coinbase an interesting way to invest in crypto are there any other crypto companies you have your eye on as being good candidates to be publicly traded well you know i i have a tremendous amount of respect for grayscale i work with those folks i i think the folks at kraken do a great job at circle uh very good strong companies uh the the miners are interesting there's a couple of publicly traded companies there and uh i'm hoping and expecting more public company formation if for no other reason because it's it's going to give us more information about what's going on more results and more ways to invest in that in this fantastic growth of the crypto economy all right well this has been so fun discussing all this with you thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed always good to see you laura

on early wednesday morning amidst the current bull run fueled by institutional investment nfts and coinbase's direct listing it seems a new bitcoin peak is barely even meme worthy what is noteworthy however is that one crypto investment firm projected a year ago that the price of bitcoin would break 62k this month in its april 2020 investor newsletter at a time when bitcoin traded at roughly 10 percent of its current price pantera capital correctly projected bitcoin would cross 62k this month pantera used projections based on a stock to flow model which assumes that bitcoin's scarcity drives demand and value pantera ceo dan moorhead noted this bitcoin rally is exactly like previous havings bitcoin is likely to reach 115k by august pantera also correctly called when bitcoin would break 30k 40k and 50k in previous months in a tweet plan b a prominent stock to flow bitcoin analyst estimated quote btc capitalization will continue its straight-line historical path first towards market cap

didn't overlap there reported that 24 of forbes's blockchain 50 symposium attendees say their companies will buy bitcoin this year a trend that could provide the institutional capital necessary to

not to miss my interview last summer with historian neil ferguson and coindesk's michael casey which touched on this issue as reported by forbes michael morrell a former cia director who spent 33 years at the agency published an independent study which concluded number one worries about bitcoin as a tool for illicit finance are overstated and number two blockchain analysis is a highly effective tool to mitigate crime his conclusions may catch the attention of treasury secretary janet yellen whose recent remarks have focused on how crypto could be used for money laundering or terrorist financing he told forbes quote we need to make sure that the conventional wisdom that is wrong about the illicit use of bitcoin doesn't hold us back from pushing forward the technological changes that are going to allow us to keep pace with china on cnbc when asked about secretary yellen and fed chair jerome powell's approach to bitcoin congressman kevin mccarthy had some powerful
