hi everyone this is a great conversation I have with Austin Griffith from burner wallet and argent ppattani of connects network from ethereal 2019 we discussed a topic that's been on lots of people's minds after a huge a speculative period in crypto how do we get usage I cover the ins and outs with two down in the trenches builders about what they're doing to get everyday adoption if you're not yet sign up for my weekly newsletter go now to unchain podcast calm to find out what I think are the top crypto stories of the week also if you're interested in spending a weekend discussing crypto but also doing yoga enjoying the outdoors and eating healthy food check out the show notes for the link to a crypto workshop I'm teaching at Omega Institute in September and now here's my conversation with Austin Griffith and Arjun photography cipher trace makes it easy for exchanges and crypto businesses to comply with crypto currency anti-money laundering laws avoid illegal sources of funds and maintain healthy banking relationships cipher trace is helping you grow the crypto economy by keeping it safe and secure welcome to our panel Defy and evan passeth and paths to everyday usage I am happy to welcome all here and I've got Arjun and Austin here as well mister why don't we kind of set the stage for why we're talking about this particular topic I think most of you know died pretty much so far what crypto has been used for is pretty much speculation and not much else other than like maybe a little bit of actual payment activity and dark market activity and I think after the 2017 bubble we got to this period where the prices started to crash and people were like oh nobody's using this stuff and I think a lot of people now are interested in how we can actually get people to use cryptocurrencies and crypto assets and this technology and so we've got a couple people here that are working in different ways on that issue and we're gonna discuss how they're doing it and also how they think about getting adoption so um why don't we start with you Austin um people might already be familiar with what you're working on because they're using it here so why don't you tell us about burn our wallet yeah so I'm Austin Griffith I'm the director of research at get coin I built the burner wallet leading up to eat Denver to do the same thing we're doing here where you get a little token or a card that has a private key on it you're able to use that you scan that and you get a wallet instant wallet right no wallet download no seat for a stead of that you go directly to having a wallet with funds in it you go up to the food truck scan a QR code buy food we also put a prediction market in it this year so you can open up your wallet that you got your card with and participate in the prediction market by just tapping your thumb no no downloads no seat phrases and can I ask you did not hold this part of the mic down here like thank you I don't know if that will affect the sound but just in case I just wanted to make sure okay and so Arjun one is you talking about connects network sure so I'm Arjun I'm one of the founders of connects connects is building a state channel network which is a scalability solution on top of it there iam the goal is at some point when a lot of users start using it their iam this is going to become a very pressing problem and we sort of experienced that back in 2017 and that was when we realized that if we're ever going to get to any sort of mainstream usage we need to have some way to scale transactions to the point where you have feature parity with existing solutions like I like peanut networks and things like that yeah so scaling is definitely a big issue and Austin I know that you had kind of like a different entry point to how you came to work on burner wallet like what was the inspiration for that so yeah I started by building games and I built like these things that I really loved and they were a lot of fun for me but I could not get anybody to come play the games it was the onboarding was having eat Madame asked understanding you know a lot of the concepts within this space so I kind of transitioned to meta transactions and figuring out how to abstract some of that away to abstract away gas costs and E's and then that kind of led to the burner wallet where yeah so now it's kind of coming full circle well now I'm trying to build games on top of the burner wallet so it's a weird it's I feel like I got in in winter and I've been just kind of quietly building in winter also um there was a discussion that you had with somebody about problems in Venezuela and how people there might take advantage of this technology can you talk a little bit about yeah so my buddy Alejandro is working on I think it's the open money initiative I think that's what it is yeah and they're trying to figure out how to make crypto and it's sort of the intersection of needing decentralization and also having really good UX and mass adoption to get mass adoption you find like that intersection and so he was trying to figure out how to get crypto into Venezuela and actually build a wallet it's just really really easy to use and when we were talking I said well let's let's put it into a web browser and he wanted to go the the app route and so we kind of are working in parallel on a very similar thing where he'll have a wallet that will work on Android 4.1 and I'm trying to get it like working in a browser on anything the same way yeah and why did you why was the browser the browser would be like if you have this old old phone like if you have an old phone from 2014 it still has a web browser on it so it's it's kind of more of a guarantee that those features will still work they're there in Venezuela yeah because you're thinking about that particular audience that they may not have like the latest technology exactly yep and actually just to kind of keep going with you know what happened I know that you introduced or I don't know if you introduced that like definitely one of the places where a lot of people first started talking about what you're working on was at East Denver so can you talk about kind of what you did there and what happened yep so we we did the same thing we did here where we hand it out but we did solid coins they scanned the coin they had a wallet they were able to buy food I think the numbers were like four thousand four hundred meals were purchased at the food trucks we offer amped about 38 K in dye to the food trucks so they they basically earned their money and it was all in crypto and the the fun part was it was about 20 cents in transactions which is a little bit better than probably a lot of other payment networks very cool and Arjun you've been working on the dai card can you talk a little bit about that yeah so the dai card works really similarly to the burner actually we were inspired by the burner wallet and and then the spank card it's kind of an amalgamation of both of those ideas but what we wanted to do was show that you can get the same quality of user experience through scalability solutions that are available today which are still on the native ethereum chain we mostly wanted to kind of inspire people to go and build more things using that afterwards which generally like we found has been really really effective and so how does that work on the back end because you talked about scaling and so obviously we know like the regular aetherium chain is kind of hard to scale so how are you making that happen yeah so the the I guess the primary difference between the burner and and the die card is or at least like next I dot IO and the die card is that X dot IO runs on the XT sidechain which because it's a sidechain because like there's less people on it and because of the way that it operates has much lower fees in transaction times the on aetherium to achieve that kind of capability you need to use state channels or payment channel cities and so what we do is we build a lot of people to when they deposit into the dye card in the same way as when you deposit into the n2x dot IO you you're depositing into a payment channel which allows you to batch up your transactions so you know the number of on chain transactions that you're doing is dramatically reduced but you still have the same sort of you know trust minimization security outcomes and effectively looks exactly like Ben though and I know that sort of similar to how Austin made this choice to try the web browser in the beginning just to you know have more adoption you also kind of made a choice where you're starting off in a slightly more centralized way so can you talk about how that is and then why you went that route yeah that's a really good question so we sort of said a lot of the difficulty of building like scalability solutions I mean even even in general etherium infrastructure is that you have this like pipeline of data that you're collecting and it's data that's collected over this life cycle that goes from like research engineering and then to actually real users using it and unfortunately that like that data pipeline in most development situations ends up being this incredibly long three year process where you do a bunch of research develop formalized specifications and then put that you know end engineer and then put that in front of users we sort of realized that that wasn't gonna be fast enough for us to actually collect the data that we needed in order to build the right kind of solution especially since so much of the research ends up being informed why what happens at the engineering end user feedback stages and so we ended up deciding to build iteratively where we said okay let's build a microcosm of the network where you have just one node and you start building apps on top of it and we have users interact with those apps so that we can figure out what things actually matter and as it turned out a lot of the things that we thought mattered really didn't it turned out that you know like a lot of really really basic things that that most people overlooked just things like you know integrations things like you know where would you even integrate with connects those those are the sorts of questions that we need it to be answering rather than optimizing on a couple of the smaller research bits yeah so let's talk about that sort of pragmatic aspect and both of you guys are using dye as well the staple coin um you know why are you guys using that and why did you choose that out of all the sample points it low cognitive overhead right like when when I send my mom five tokens she needs to know that that's just five dollars if I send her point zero zero three that's just harder for her guy understand so it for me you've got the fast side chain or a fast state channel you've got low transaction fees and then on top of all of that then you've got low cognitive overhead because she doesn't have to know what the you know what the conversion rate is or anything like that if I give her five she's got five dollars it's easy to understand yeah exactly the same thing it was just two things one is that where most of the early testing was done with my mom's friends the man anyway really works yeah exactly it was just a bunch of people who knew nothing about crypto I we got to the point where we got to this unanswerable question which was all right now I have this money in my wallet I know how to use it I know how to send to my friends what can I do with it where can I spend it and so that's that's kind of the problem that we're working on now but you know it's having that all happen in dollars is just makes so much sense to people even within the industry we've realized we're you know you you wanna hold eath and as an investment but then when you're doing day to day payments you you sort of want to have it in something that you can understand and and rather than doing the like mental conversion to dollars before you buy something with this this just sort of solves that problem and it but I so I am curious about the choice of dying in particular as a stable coin because as we've seen it's actually not stable to the dollar and there are other sample coins that are built on aetherium so why why die so partly ubiquity die has the biggest network effects right now and there's a lot of like attraction happening with the maker ecosystem which means and it's all sort of like bill like buying into these network effects right because if if more like applications on aetherium start accepting diets it means a payment then that means that more and more people can use the burner or the dye cart to pay for them and and then the other part of it is just that it's like part of the way that maker works is that liquidity a sort of guaranteed so you like it's true that the price is fluctuating and right now at least recently that was because there was not enough demand for using dye but at some point in the future when there is demand for using dye there's this enormous incentive for people to start creating more and more CDP's and so I think in the instance where demand for dye skyrockets even even if it is sort of a stepwise function you you're not gonna have a situation where people are suddenly like ok I want to use dye to pay for things but I can't get access to it did you know that if money laundering were an economy its GDP would be the size of Canada's large volumes of tainted crypto assets move through financial networks often below the radar of banks cyber criminals use unregulated crypto exchanges to avoid detection no wonder governments around the world are rolling out tough new anti money laundering laws for crypto currencies complying with those laws isn't easy banks and exchanges need the best cryptocurrency intelligence available to avoid penalties now you can use the same powerful AML and compliance monitoring tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy to learn more visit cipher trace comm slash Unchained so if people are trying to build these products that actually get used and you know you're talking about how you're using dye because you you know know that people want to transact in dollars and stuff at the same time we have these other companies that are also working in this space and they're much bigger so how do you think about that how do you think about trying to develop something that will gain adoption and meanwhile Facebook is working on something where they could easily roll it out to their more than 2 billion monthly active users and that would be adopted right away so how how do you think about you know how to build and then how to kind of get activity they'll still have to deal with the same issues we do right like if they if they run the chain the same way ours or aetherium or our side chains run they still have to worry about block x they still have to worry about key pairs if they do it that way and so I don't know a ton about it yet but they'll have to go through the same research that we go through is you know how do we present a seed phrase do we present a seed phrase how do we present gasps how do we talk about it so to me I just see that they'll they'll have to if they go our same route they'll have to learn all these things like we like we are right there's also something that I think not a lot of people consider about like having some large centralized entity talk like create a currency that everybody uses we like this already sort of happens where the US government creates the dollar right and and there is still resistance to using the dollar for everything outside of the US even though they're like develop there's dollar ubiquity in most countries and I think that that would only be exacerbated by the fact that there's you know one single company creating face coin or whatever it is and and then trying to get that used with a bunch of for a bunch of other use cases so I think people could use it internally for payments people might even be able to use it for like merchants to merchant payments but every single jurisdiction that they go to they're gonna have to have the same conversation where they say okay how are you gonna regulate Facebook as an organization how are you gonna regulate all the people that are you know validating in this ecosystem and like buying into interface coin and and I think that that it sort of comes back to the the core idea of a lot of this stuff which is social scalability at some point if I'm hoping that at some point the light bulb goes off in regulators minds where they say okay wait atheria manned projects built on top of etherion that are decentralized will work the same way everywhere Facebook and their cryptocurrency and projects that build on top of that may not and that's that's a big difference so but so how do you guys think about which partnership do you want to make or which communities you want to target when you know that there is this company out there that could just roll something out to such a big community like are you like you know you I know you have some partnerships with like you Joe and I think sting chain too is well yeah and obviously you're you know you were kind of doing these tests kinks as I get the guests at these conferences but is your end goal to somehow introduce in Venezuela or like cuz the other the other it's not even actually just I don't want to make it sound like it's only Facebook coin but like in general especially in the US where you're trying to compete in this environment where people have PayPal and venmo and credit cards and so just in general how do you think about getting adoption with your small or small at the moment projects yeah I I still think that they have to tackle the same issues we do like are they gonna hit the user with the wallet download are they gonna hit all 200 you know if they hit all those users with the same thing they're gonna see the same drop-off that we see so I think that adoption still works the same way like you still like that's why we have the burner is because you could just pull up a website and use it and it works quickly right it's it's not something you want to have a bunch of money and it's something that you use to transition you to something else and I think the burners like a lowercase B burner not an uppercase I don't think it's a product itself it's more of a an idea or a mechanism to drive onboarding and I think I've out that Facebook has something similar with their coin if that's how it works like they'll use something similar to move it around because they'll find that if they try to get their user to have to download something and they hit them with a seed phrase upfront they're gonna lose users yeah I guess like so so I will say that from from the conversations that we've had outside of the space with with like end users who have nothing to do with crypto we really really have our odds like stacked against us the existing payment system and like existing payment networks are very very very entrenched I think that's also going to be true for Facebook and for any other company that likes like creates a currency and wants to scale it globally but I think one thing that a lot of people miss is that it's like it's not just about you know whether or not you're using this technology it's also about like all the things that get built along with it like there's there's historically open systems have just always succeeded and on a long enough time scale because open systems just allow for this exponentially compounding innovation to happen on top of them and and like it may actually be the case that's something like Facebook or some other you know currency comes along and wins the market but I'm very very bullish that in the long term and open me and some some like some open platform will win so in the interim though I do think in the short term there will be kind of an advantage that more centralized services have so how do you think about just competing over the long term I mean like it just does feel a little bit like okay I mean cuz honestly both of your answers we're like your answer especially was a little bit more technical rep but I'm asking really just about how do you get the users like yeah ok you can build the thing and maybe it can scale or maybe it you know has the right block times or whatever but then how do you get people to actually use it like are you thinking about that or is it more just about making sure that technology works or it seems like there's like a spectrum of decentralization right it's like I don't think you want to hit person hit someone with like full decentralization upfront I think you kind of ease them into it so so I think that in terms of getting users it's okay to have a little bit of central that like your node its centralized right now that it won't be eventually and like it's okay to have a little bit of you know I don't want to say against our ethos but you a little softer version of what we have and that's how we bring in users and we get them involved in me once they once they kind of see the value and and kind of create a narrative behind their account then they're much more likely to take those next steps to to get into the system more so if I'm understanding correctly basically what you're asking is how can we get users when coming up against on some large organization that already has a very large footprint of users that has in like history of retaining those users for a very long period of time yeah so small startups beat large companies all the time a lot of the time they beat them badly enough that the startup gets acquired for a lot of money and a lot of time they just beat them outright and then the startup exists and the large company dies the reason is that startups have a much closer relationship with their users than large companies ever can because you as a founder literally have to be in front of a user and doing customer support all the time and that means that you get a very in-depth understanding of what your users actually need and what their problems are I think kind of what Austin was trying to say is that like we're all like even even Facebook is gonna come at this from the same from the same level of understanding as we are right they they know their users very well but they don't fully understand how their users will react to the stuff and so they're gonna start collecting data in the same way that we can I while they have a larger data set to draw from the the level of intensity with which like we need to operate because it's for us it's like a key survival thing is is has to be way higher and and like that historically is the reason why startups have won and so at this moment are you just pretty much focused on the tech because I do also want to ask like so when it comes to on the ground like actually just getting people to use it do you have any for that yet because I do remember during the ICEA craze a lot of people were saying that there was this like light bulb moment where a bunch of teens realized like oh the community manager is super super important but I feel like that's kind of the same concept here if you're actually trying to get real adoption like you need somebody who you know it's kind of like a non-technical person who can talk to everyday people who don't know anything yeah so how are you are you guys thinking about that at all yet or is it kind of off in the future so we we and I think Austin does this as well we have constantly been talking to people both with inside and outside of the space and it's like we we I like I personally end up talking to at least like three to four people a day that that use our stuff and and that I get feedback from that are not necessarily that aren't even like users yet and a lot of the time it's people who don't want to use ourselves and we specifically go after those people to figure out what it is that's broken about our stuff so that we can make it better similarly we we went like we for the last six weeks what we've been doing is actually not as much more just user research outside in space so we went and talked to tons and tons of people within the indie gaming industry and like indie content in general just understand more about how those how those like ecosystems worked and we found a lot of really fascinating things like for instance you know there's this really big misconception in our space that a big part of the reason why people will adopt this is that the you know the cost of doing transactions through crypto is lower and it turns out that just doesn't matter to people right like in in indie gaming people happily pay 30% fees to platforms and and even though they have PayPal as an option which takes 3% fees and the reason that they do that is because you get so much other stuff with platforms like DRM management like an existing community to reach out to things like that which you wouldn't get at all with like a direct sales model so it's that kind of stuff that like I think more people need to do I just get out of the building go talk to people but but but you know the Dyk part of the Berner of whatever it is that you're building in front of them and say hey like try using this and and prepare to have your ego shattered a little bit for sure yeah that's that's the same thing we did like leading up to eat Denver we we would just go to bars in northern Colorado and just drop paper wallets on people and just like watch their eyes and watch where their thumbs went and like one of our buttons our main button was like too far away for the thumb so I just I was oh we got to iterate on that we got to get that in a different place and it's just like week after week we would we would go to the bars we would drop the paper wallets we would pay right like I would pay a $200 bar tab at the end of the night but it also have a note books of all these scribblings of all the things that we needed to fix for the next week and we would do that over and over again and tell each Denver some of these other events and it runs a lot smoother when you do that and it's all about like compounding I sort of mentioned this earlier but it's all about like the rate at which you're getting data right like it we don't we don't know what product it is that we need to build yet if we knew what product it is that we needed to build what we could just do is raise you know fifty million dollars higher like a huge team of the world's best developers and just tell them okay go build this and then it's just a matter it's like a deterministic process where we can say okay in three months we will know exactly we will have this product and we can sell it to this exact market but like what we need to do is collect data to understand what product to build and what what the market really wants and what the market even is and so that's that's like it's just collecting that data faster faster and faster and faster so that you can compound your own learning okay so we're like almost out of time but just really really quick last question how does the uncertain regulatory atmosphere here in the u.s. affect like how you guys are developing all is it because I just want to know like if you're gonna get adoption you need to I guess have some security you're not gonna go to jail so how are you guys thinking about that that's my products called the Berner wallet so I think you got to answer that one yeah so so I think a lot of people might have heard about this but a few days ago like FinCEN released like some new opinions on money transmission law for this industry and like that had a lot of really interesting consequences for the way that people are thinking about like defy and about building gaps now it isn't clear from that to to most lawyers that like there's anything specifically wrong with like scalability so or anything like that but that's that's the exact sort of thing where we we have to be really careful because we need to understand what consequences does this have how does this affect our users do we now need to target a different subset of users because you know are we targeting users that like would if in the United States would now have to be regulated and they can't afford to be regulated so I think not having certainty or not having like I'd rather have an answer like a bad answer than no answer and and so not having certainty just slows down that the rate at which we can collect data because all of a sudden we could spend months and months trying to talk to a certain group of users and find that hey we can't even serve those users yeah yeah and Esther first the SEC Commissioner did come out with a speech a few days ago where she kind of said the same thing actually so that's kind of good for you so not positive note we will end it here thank you guys so much and yeah I guess we'll see you around thank you profit you [Music]
