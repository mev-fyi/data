I don't know no that's what they chose to highlight how to follow it um I still think it's a really good time to build an exchange to be honest and like are you building an exchange not at the moment simply because it's just it takes a lot of focus and I have a lot of other things to focus on primarily in the core business of intermittent it's just I cannot afford to lose this focus at the moment maybe in two three months time maybe but like currently I just I just don't have mental capacity and frankly like the team like you need to do like building exchange is just such a massive undertaking that yeah I just cannot like take it lightly if you ever do it hypothetically if you were to build an exchange what would be different about it versus existing income and exchanges so I think like what's would be I think this exchange if you were to build an exchange that would be much more similar to CME than to binance coinbase like I think it would be focused much more on the matching engine and basically like this Central clearing part basically stripping away all like ayc ml for retail people stripping away managing leverage taken away like all the horrible things about running your own centralized Exchange encrypta uh and just making it much more seeming like and basically focusing on one hand and it's like what does BF try to do with FTX like making this Central clearing run a very efficient cross margining uh kind of like engine and on the other hand kind of like Improvement on CME side it would be basically running on the stable coins instead of Fiat so that you can do settlement Cycles faster and if you can do settlement Cycles faster you effectively can extend more leverage to the clearing members as a result have you considered hiring 20 kids feeding them a bunch of speed and sending them to an island [Music] yeah yeah they probably built something with that like one big change for us over the last year or so we we started and we started like slowly incubating those products inside the interview like we did Bebop which was really just I'll play on RFQ uh like well you had Lawrence the other day uh who is built in Wildcat so we we started like dabbing into building products and like slowly moving into become a product company and basically what I learned is it's a very different gig like building a trading companies especially if you just train a centralized exchange this is kind of straightforward like all you need is a former Traders and then like as it becomes more complex you like gives them more support with back office operations terrorist and else and like I have better developers and everything that that's great but ultimately yeah product is very different because as a train company you don't have customers like it's very easy right you just need to build big Algos or smart Algos as a product company actually it doesn't think about a lot more things and that's what I'm kind of learning for myself and exchanges like ultimate ultimate boss to conquer because there is just so much to build well so speaking of product companies let's get into the news of the week so coinbase has launched of course this product that's getting all this attention now which is base they're L2 now base uh I think last week we talked about how bass out of developer mode that was initially getting some traction getting some meme coins and rugbulls and all sorts of crypto chicanery um but finally this week I believe as of uh August 9th base finally launched their mainnet basically meaning that now there's a nice little interface and you can you know jump across the bridge and start playing around on top of bass a bunch of protocols have been deployed there so compound uniswap of a you know a lot of the big Protocols are now living on base the base numbers actually look pretty strong so the tvl on base is about 230 million uh as of right now which makes it the number five L2 by tvl behind dydx and then do idx behind uh ZK sync their daily active users seem to be our daily active addresses I should say seem to be around 100K they were growing quite a bit and now it seems like they've mostly stabilized although you know who knows there obviously could be a surge of activity but as of right now it doesn't seem like it's going vertical from there uh the transactions per second is around seven now that's not like Peak throughput that's like the sustained throughput that it has over the course of the day which is again it's pretty high um if there was a while actually I think yesterday it was actually higher than both arbitrum one and Optimum
