there will be quote no opportunity to invest in the company prior to that direct listing she revealed however that coinbase had researched the idea of a security token a digital representation of a

positive last friday the cftc fined the exchange 6.5 million dollars for allegedly providing misleading information about the trading volume on its platform gdax now rebranded as coinbase pro between 2015 and 2018. the cftc pointed out two in-house software programs that traded with each other inflating the asset prices and volume on gdax the agency also alleged that a former coinbase employee participated in wash trading using litecoin bitcoin trading pairs in a tweet thread evan lorenz deputy editor at grant's interest rate observer speculated that coinbase which now based on his revenues would not be defined as an emerging growth company quote skated under the emerging growth deadline based on when it filed this means that along with other emerging growth companies it is now only

volume for uniswop reached its highest point since september 2020. next headline fat f changes the definition of nfts and dapps the financial action task force or fat f the intergovernmental organization tasked with developing anti-money laundering and other financial surveillance policies released draft guidance with two changes that could transform d5 first it expanded the definition of vasps virtual asset service providers to include many define applications or dapps that could require decentralized platforms to conform to the same anti-money laundering laws traditional financial institutions follow secondly fat have changed the phrase quote assets that are fungible two quote assets that are convertible and interchangeable the new terminology would lump certain nfts under the same regulations as virtual assets if the tokens were used to facilitate money laundering or terrorism peter van valkenberg director of research at coin center a blockchain advocacy organization called the proposed changes problematic in a blog post he wrote quote classification as a vasp would obligate these non-custodial persons to register with a local regulator collect and report to government masses of information about their activities and the activities of others and to know the names and physical addresses of everyone with whom they interact those requirements may be reasonable for banks and other financial institutions where most money laundering takes place but they are absolutely inappropriate for private persons participating in open computer networks ian

relations that aren't intermediated fatiff will be accepting public comments on the draft language until april 20th next headline elon musk minds btc through tesla sales you can now buy a tesla with

converted it to us dollars in an interview with fox news he called the recent search in nft prizes a bubble though he does believe that the technology behind nfts will outlive the bubble much like what happened with the internet time magazine offered up three non-funchable tokens inspired by time's most iconic covers this week one is god dead two is truth dead three is fiat dead the nfts sold for 241 eth or 385 000 on super ware thursday jack dorsey sold his original tweet as an nft for 2.9 million dollars dorsey converted all proceeds from the auction to bitcoin and donated to give directly to africa response the new york times released a recent column as an nft and is auctioning it off for the neediest cases fund the article ironically about nfts sold for 350 000 eth or 550 000 on thursday time for fun bits bitcoins energy consumption rationalized as criticism over bitcoin's environmental impact heats up the community has banded together with ways to rationalize the energy used to power the proof-of-work blockchain nick grossman general partner at union square ventures use crypto mining as a battery transforming electricity into value in the form of digital assets he believes bitcoin as battery will shift the narrative from quote crypto mining is a dangerously large consumer of energy two quote crypto mining is driving the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables square crypto also chimed in releasing the first volume of a bitcoin mythology series the pithy introduction reads quote since there are no more prominent or prevalent myths about bitcoin than those having to do with its environmental impact we started there while thought-provoking and quirky both the bitcoin as a battery concept and the idea that bitcoin's environmental concerns are mythological lack a quantitative foundation which will be necessary in the coming years for the marketing war over the environmental impact of proof of work this week i will allow bitcoin's creator the last word on proof of work the marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold gold mining is a waste but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange i think the case will be the same for bitcoin the utility of the exchanges made possible by bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used therefore not having bitcoin would be the net waste all right thanks for tuning in to learn more about miami mayor francis juarez be sure to check out the links in the show notes don't forget we are now on youtube subscribe to the
