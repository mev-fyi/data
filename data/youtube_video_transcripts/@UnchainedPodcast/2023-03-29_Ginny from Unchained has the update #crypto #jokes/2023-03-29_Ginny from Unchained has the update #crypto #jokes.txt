an update on dokwan who continues his year of World Travel Juan has been on the run from an inter-paul red notice for months which does explain his outfit it's exercise Chic he recently got arrested in Montenegro and South Korea has requested he be extradited from there however South Korea faces competition as the United States has recently requested that Quan be extraded to America First and while all of this was going on he started a new company in Serbia which means maybe they're owed a piece of him too so many countries involved I literally feel like I'm at a model um tournament they're going to have to figure it out because dokwan obviously can't be in two places at once it's not possible for him to just instantaneously jump all over the map he's not the value of the Tara stablecoin montenegrin Justice Minister who has honestly never had so much attention in his life this is truly like a sweet 16 a bar mitzvah and a wedding all-in-one has said that for now Quan is being held in covet quarantine in Montenegro personally I doubt he has a contagious coveted infection though if his business record is any indication he's not known for his capacity to successfully grow things
