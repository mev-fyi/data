powers anti-money laundering blockade analytics and threat Intel meeting exchanges virtual currency businesses banks and regulators themselves use cipher trace to comply with regulation and to monitor compliance today's guest is Jeremy lair co-founder and CEO of circle welcome Jeremy thanks Laura great to be here this week you announced the launch of a new subsidiary and Bermuda you also received a digital assets business act license from Bermuda tell us about the new subsidiary and license and why circle decided to pursue them sure so you know as you look at the crypto markets there's obviously a tremendous amount going on and we operate a number of different businesses we have an exchange business a trading business we have retail products and we have a you know we have a product roadmap to build quite a quite a number of different crypto finance products and as we you know looked at the business and looked at the regulatory environment in the u.s. one of the things became very very clear to us which is that and this has been for some time I think this has been really amplified more recently is that the you know the the kinds of products and services and digital assets that can be offered in the United States is just becoming significantly more restrictive and at the same time the innovation in the space the number of new projects new digital assets new blockchains innovations in the models of the blockchain is proliferating and so it was very important from our perspective that we be able to offer as broad a set of crypto finance products as possible to as many customers in the world as possible and it became clear that the way to do that was to really have a u.s. specific business that's regulated within the context of us regulations but perhaps more limited and a international business that is also regulated and supervised because we do believe ultimately customers whether they be individuals or institutions want to know that the firm's they're interacting with have supervision and I'll come back to that in a moment and so we really starting late last year began looking to you know figure out you know where can we set up this international operation and as you probably know there are a number of countries who have really looked at embracing digital assets as a new type of financial asset and and also the kind of market participants that includes countries like Singapore or Switzerland Malta Bermuda and some larger countries are pursuing things as well like France and Japan as we looked more closely what we found is that what Bermuda had put into place as a national crypto policy which is this digital assets business act was one of the most thoughtful and comprehensive frameworks for crypto that we had seen and the things that we really were attracted to were a few things so one was it was comprehensive it was a regulatory framework that spanned kind of the full suite of different types of financial products and services that we build at circle everything from payments and custody to trading and both retail and institutional products as well as the exchange business and so it was a comprehensive regulatory framework I think a second piece which is really critical is that it was a framework that had a high bar around it Bermuda has given out very few licenses and we're the first company in the world to receive what's called a class F license which is the the broadest and the bermuda monetary authority has a very high bar on the types of firms that they will ultimately accept for registration licensing and supervision and that was attractive to us we think it's important that there there is a high bar around this and then most maybe most critically is that I think Bermuda has defined digital assets as a new class of financial asset and rather than just trying to you know define digital assets in the context of currencies or commodities or securities or to apply you know pre-existing banking and payments law or Securities and Investments law they took sort of the core features of their banking and payments laws and securities and investment laws and integrated them into a new framework for digital assets and this is critical we think it's critical that digital assets be able to be issued and offered and utilized by people and they may have financial contract features they may have utility and commodity features they may also function as payment tokens and currencies and that's a good thing that kind of combination of those so the framework they're really embrace that and what we found was a government both you know on the policy-making side in particular that wanted to work with this industry that wanted to that acknowledge that the technology is moving incredibly fast and that they need to be responsive with policy and they want to learn along the way as well and so it's very attractive from from all of those perspectives and that led to a process that has been ongoing for many many months and then ultimately receiving the license and announcing new operation well there's so much to unpack there and some of my later questions we'll get to that just one note before my next question for listeners who missed my interview with Gabriel Abed of bit we do talk a little bit about Bermudez friendliness to crypto companies and projects and premier David Burt there who I think really has been the champion of this industry in that country so Jeremy you've expressed frustration in the past with the SEC for not providing enough clarity to the crypto space and I believe that led you to geofence some assets on Polonia X so how do you think in general how do you think lack of clarity around regulation has affected Polonia X's business yeah I mean I think and this is you know broadly the case if you look at the last couple of years you know first there was sort of some very broad kind of guidance around hey we think almost everything is a security and you should look at the Howey test and I think what that led to over the course of you know a lot of the last couple years was it put us exchanges and and projects as well in a really difficult place with all this uncertainty well where do we fit in that and can we can we be competitive and so you know largely what you've seen happen is you've seen market share shift from you know many us-based players to mostly Asian based players and that's very real and that has happened and that's incontestable I think it's also led to of course you know more and more projects have to jump through all kinds of Hoops to you know domicile in other places and you know really and as we've talked about I think you know the the u.s. is is missing out on a lot of things as a result of that I think what one of the critical things that happen though was the the more recent April staff guidance from the SEC which in some ways did provide more clarity but in our view it was going in ABS the opposite if not you know wrong direction it expanded the scope of how digital assets might be deemed securities and our view and it's this has been consistent for a very long time is that it does not make sense to attempt to fit digital assets into just you know are they a security are they a commodity are they occurrence II but it really makes sense to establish a new set of definitions for digital assets and these these digital assets can be have features that are securities like commodity like and currency like all at the same time or in different contexts and that's a really powerful thing and so you know that's what we're advocating for you know that's what we think is necessary for major nations around the world is to us adopt a national crypt of policy that embraces and defines digital assets as a new thing with the appropriate supervision around intermediaries and firms and market participants that's necessary we're gonna discuss more about what crypto regulation in the u.s. should look like but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive

download the crypto comm app on iOS or Android now back to my conversation with Jeremy al Arif circle so something that I was wondering about was that I noticed a circle sorry I noticed Polonia axe hands you know pretty small market share at this point two years ago it had about 58 percent according to the block and now it's 1% and I also was checking the bitwise Bitcoin trade volume site where they rank the different exchanges by real Bitcoin trading volume after weeding out what they believe our fake trades and their Polonia X's BTC trading volume for the last 24 hours was about 10 million and of course so we know by Nance's you know the the biggest of these and that was at 500 million but coin base in Kraken and coin basin kraken were at 200 million and 190 million and you know those companies are kind of dealing with the same types of regulations that Polonius has been so why are they not hindered in the same way that Polonius has been yeah well I think a couple things so the first is you know when we acquired Polonia X a year ago or a little over a year ago this was a a company and an operation and an infrastructure that was that needed let's just say an enormous amount of help the platform was falling over the infrastructure needed to be completely rebuilt and is continuing to be you know completely rebuilt you know there were a constant you know wallet failures people getting fun stuck there was a 200,000 ticket backlog of customer support requests so this was you know really we took over something that that that to some degree was on life support million dollars for it so that suggests so the the headline number that was reported that is never a number that we've ever confirmed so we've never confirmed what the actual transaction was that was a rumored a rumor number in any case at the time of course you know Polonius has had you know a very large customer base over the 2014 to 2018 millions of customers have grown to use the product and so we've been in a you know we've been in a process of rebuilding an enormous number of pieces of it and that's been significant now one critical thing is that you know clearly there are a number of exchanges including the likes of Kraken and coinbase and bitstamp who have had Fiat connectivity into their markets for a very long time and the kind of core Bitcoin trading on a global basis you know you really see an enormous amount of that volume come from exchanges that have really good on and off ramps for Fiat and so that was clearly one of the things that we knew we needed to do and in fact just in the last few weeks we launched direct Fiat support with wires from 80 plus countries with card support from over 50 countries and so we've literally you know been able to put that in place and we think that's pretty important in in growth as well I think the other pieces you know Polonius's you know was very much you know known for its you know support for a wide range of altcoins it was sort of the preeminent old coin exchange for a very very long time and you know two things happen one is I think the SEC environment in the u.s. you know pretty significantly restricted what we could do in that space and Asian exchanges surged ahead so the alt coins share very much shifted to exchanges that were launching more and more assets constantly and that certainly has been impactful I think we do intend to become significantly more competitive in terms of the markets that we support and our international operations are going to be really critical to that and you know those are those are certainly significant factors the other is that you know when we took over Polonia acts we needed to have the KYC and AML policies and the compliance policies be in line with us regulations which required full identity verification and you know some of the other exchanges around the world have not imposed those standards so you know on Finance you can sign up with fake email address and a fake phone number and you can use a VPN to get there from from other countries and that's with you know $20,000 a day kind of limits sorry but my yeah but I was asking about I mean you know for coinbase and kraken they have had those policies in place for a long time yeah absolutely and they've been I think historically very strong as for the core Fiat Bitcoin pairs and literally we weren't able to offer that until even you know literally just a few weeks ago yeah actually one other thing I meant to say with that last question was that bitwise has sponsored my podcast and Kraken is this is a sponsor currently so that's my disclosure one other thing that I wanted to ask about was you know the Polonia control box was a hugely popular feature and polo shut that down in June 2017 and I noticed you guys just revived it which Symes seems to someone indicate that closing it was a mistake do you feel like maybe kind of closing up down that community was also part of Polonia access troubles yeah so I mean a few things on that so obviously the the closing of the troll box significantly predated our acquisition certainly as you note but what I can tell you is that there was a about a 30% decline in usage immediately following the ending of the troll box so it's definitely important however you know it was a challenging back then for the company to to moderate it and keep up with it I think ultimately there was a decision that was do we have you know the limited resources they had applied to customer support did they apply that to customer support or did they apply that to moderating the troll box needs moderation it needs a scalable moderation model because you need to ensure that you know there is an you know market manipulation or other forms of tactics deployed there so it was also with almost without exception the number one feature requests from customers after after acquiring the company and so we did ultimately prioritize it rebuilt it made it more scalable built a scaleable moderation model and it also launched once you know we had what we felt were robust market surveillance capabilities in place on our platform that would make it safe so there's been a lot of enthusiasm for the return of the troll box and it is highly active these days which is which is great good luck I always find forms to be somewhat challenging but I think if they're well moderated they're like such a such a wonderful benefit I frankly love reading online conversations that are well moderated so I saw that next week you'll be speaking at this Senate hearing titled examining regulatory frameworks for digital currencies in blockchain what do you plan to say in your testimony you know I think there's really a few key themes that I would like to address to the committee you know one theme is really just around helping to articulate and and communicate and educate the the Committee on the diverse types of digital assets that exist I think you know the there's been a sort of kind of peripheral awareness of things like Bitcoin there's been obviously a front-and-center awareness of this new stable value token and blockchain project from the Libre Association but the you know I think the policymakers in particular sitting senators congresspeople do not really have a broad understanding of the different types of digital currencies blockchain platform tokens stable coins so one one thing I really want to do is is really just help provide a better understanding of all the innovation how to think about these things and and what are potentially some of the different policy implications of these different types of digital assets so that's one I think significant piece I think a second is I'd like to you know paint a picture of what the economic opportunity is from crypto what does a robust marketplace for digital assets and for innovation in the space look like and and and what's at risk for the United States economically and and and you know from a financial market perspective if if we don't figure out how to get this right and and supported and ultimately we think it's a competitive issue for any any country I will also speak some very specifically about stable coins providing more context on that through our work with coin base on the center consortium and u.s. dollar coin and then you know I think finally our perspective on the regulatory environment what we believe is is needed from a national crypto policy perspective and in the context of that of course shed some light on some of our decisions around different approaches to how we're going to operate the business given some of the you know I think limitations in terms of policy of the United States one last question about your time in Bermuda did you enjoy wearing what's called the Bermuda rig I had to Google this which it was the you know the suit jacket with the shorts and socks absolutely I think they've figured out something there that I think we can all learn from which is that if you want to dress sharp and it's 90 degrees and humid you know there's a way to do that comfortably and it's great I'm sold on it yeah I noticed that that the rest of your team they were all in normal suits I was like geez where's the Solidarity yeah yeah all right well it's been great having you on the show thanks for coming on confirmed thank you
