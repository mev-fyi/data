some people would have said what you did was a hack or Market manipulation you called it a highly profitable trading strategy so in general how do you view these events when the way the code actually functions is different from the intent so first of all I think a lot of these uh just speaking in generalities sometimes it's very unclear what the intents might have been sometimes the codes doesn't match stocks sometimes the docs say something and it's just not implemented and uh sometimes the code does exactly what was intended it's just what was intended isn't what anyone wanted
