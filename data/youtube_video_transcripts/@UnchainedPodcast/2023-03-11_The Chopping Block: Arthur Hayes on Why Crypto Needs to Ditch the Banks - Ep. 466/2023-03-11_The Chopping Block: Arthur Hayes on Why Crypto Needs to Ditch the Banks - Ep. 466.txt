not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping blog every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day first up we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound next we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet today we've got a special guest Arthur Hayes the black ghost of bitmax and then we've got myself and the Steve the head hype man at dragonfly it's a thing it's a thing Arthur do you want to explain the black ghost it's a phrase in Cantonese uh it means black ghost it's like a derogatory it's not derogatory it's a term for foreigners there's squilo which is the white ghost and uh hawkwai is the the black ghost I'm pronouncing that terribly because my Cantonese sucks yeah exactly so I did I did just make that up I just make that up it's a deep reading anyway the four of us uh or yeah the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block.xyz for more disclosures Arthur it's great to have you my man I have never seen you with that much facial hair what is going on are you okay I am perfectly fine I am in the mountains of Japan and as tradition I usually don't cut my hair or my beard for the one to two months that I'm skiing so this is my last day of skiing actually so I will be uh chopping all this off once I return to the steaming hot Southeast Asian jungle because I haven't facial Arts it's too [ __ ] hot that makes sense that makes sense so either there was an amazing uh expose on you and your life and travels in New York Magazine that dropped just about a week ago I recommend everybody read it there's a there's a beautiful photo a cover photo of you with a stuffed animal sitting on like a like a luxurious Chez uh in your shorts and uh one of the one of the things that they detail in this piece is that wherever you travel you always carry stuffed animals with you and you have a tremendous collection of stuffed animals please explain this for our audience what's the significance of these stuffed animals and what do you have on you in Japan so yeah I I like Lessing stuffed animals my two favorite brands are jelly cat I probably have close to 100 of those and I should probably should own some of the stock to be honest I've seen them grow in terms of prevalence and globally I see them everywhere now and this French brand called big stuff they make these like really big whales and octopuses and crabs and my standard go-to baby gift is like one of these toys but I actually collect them as well so uh yeah so today I have um two of my oldest toys I have my my frog and my my zebra I think I got these guys back in like 2009 so they're chilling here there's about another 10 toys that I brought with me again half a suitcase to a suitcase full of toys wherever I go um wow and you know across my different residences around the world I have rooms full of them wait so is this like is this like people who collect wine where it's like a combination of consumption and investment or is it just pure like definitely not an investment and I don't think anyone is purchasing this frog from me even if it was like the uh the most rare frog ever you love saying the word muppet so seeing you with the Frog I feel like is this is fitting it's fitting to see the Frog amazing okay so the other thing if you read this if you read this uh this expose it's striking there are a lot of really striking you know tones in this in this expose one of them just seems to uh be I'll just read it aloud for everybody uh there's there's a couple Choice sentences in there uh they describe meeting you in uh in some of your some of your travels he says uh Haze who had just returned from stretching out his hips in a yin yoga class was not sweating he spent much of a sentence lifting and stretching and his chest was so broad his soldiers so built and sculpted that they gave the illusion he was wearing armor and it's like holy [ __ ] this journalist is doing overtime that is very uh this question journalist yeah that's yeah journalism yeah I was very it was great I mean I can't I can't lie okay okay I'm I'm glad to hear that but a lot of the a lot of the the piece was about uh in a way the contrast between yourself and SPF because you know almost all of the news cycle over the last couple years like all the people who came in in 2022 and 2023 uh well I guess I don't know anybody came in 2023 but people came in 2022. The Only Name They Know is SPF SPF is like the exchange bad guy and you are the exchange bad guy before SPF was even you know in diapers so you you wrote some amazing pieces uh one of them being white boy I believe it was called white boy talking about the the strangeness of the way in which SPF was embraced by The Establishment and the way in which he fell from Grace talk us through just for the sake of I mean a lot of people on the show might know your name but they don't necessarily know the whole Saga what your perspective is given what you can and can't say about seeing what's going on with the SPF news cycle so I guess you know SPF has been around in crypto since I guess what 2017 is is what he uh you know publicly proclaims when he had that hedge fund doing sort of Arbitrage trays between different countries which a lot of us started out doing you know from you know probably 2011 up until today uh there's different shops doing these these sort of Trades and he was very good I know he's very smart guy uh he was very good at building this Allure that he was a very very good Trader he went to MIT he worked at Jane Street um and then he you know started trading uh crypto but I guess you know Testament to humanity and our uh lack of depth in terms of researching things because we get to read the headline of something and take that as gospel everybody said okay yeah he went to the right school you know he worked at some you know very successful Chicago Prop Shop he was from California you know his parents are professors he must know what he's doing right and I think he latched on to that as his thing but okay well there's always other people over here and in Asia doing these crypto things um and I'm going to appeal to a particular segment of the world that wants a champion that looks like the people in power where they're from right which is you know old white white dudes who you know grew up in either New York or LA or which is similar sort of East Coast prep schools or West Coast prep schools and went to ivy league universities or a few of the big name text schools and so he applied that as his his Edge right and I think that there is there is two factors here that led to his success one the the people who are in The Establishment right Western Financial system see this crypto thing they know it's not going away the individuals who run projects and firms don't look like them don't have the same opinions on world events as they do and honestly you want to make something completely different and don't want to include them at all and you know if we believe that crypto is this like you know once in a few thousand years sort of revolution in terms of the way humans communicate about money at a deeper sense you know as much as they sort of poo pooed in the public I think these are very smart individuals you recognize that this thing is super super important and they need to get a piece of it but okay yeah go buy some Bitcoin if that's what you want to do but that's usually not how uh they won't operate they want to co-opt someone or affirm whatever into their orbit and then use that as a way to take over the industry because you know Bitcoin is one of the only assets where it started out as a Grassroots movement where individual people own the network it's not like a large firm like Standard Oil you know revolutionize how oil was um discovered and drilled and so you have this very large company that fits within a particular Regulatory and nation-state environment that can be controlled um from from the top down this is from the bottom up everybody owns crypto or you know a small amount of people around the world it's not like you can go to one individual and say oh you're the Bitcoin person now and now I can run Bitcoin because I can control this person it's just not how it works um and so he was a great spokesperson because he fit what they are used to dealing with and from what he said it seemed like he wanted to be ingratiated with them and so he spent all his time with the you know who's who of celebrities he went to the right conferences I think was it the FTX was the SALT conference or whatever the one in 2021 he's on stage with former presidents you know supermodels all the right you know climate change davilus type people were at his conference and you know he he looked like okay this guy is he's the one who's going to be our you know our establishment dude in the crypto space and he wants to engage with us and then on the crypto side it was like okay well you know it's we don't really want to fight a real Revolution it's kind of hard why you know if we can be accepted by The Establishment that's great so if this SPF guy is out here doing the dance then maybe he's a good guy to get behind because he can advance our agenda because he's got the ear of the of the people that are opposing you know what the what crypto is all about and so yeah both sides sort of backing this this thing the central figure and obviously losing sight of the whole point of this is that no particular person or come company should be the one that advances the crypto agenda it's it's all of our job to do whatever we can at a Grassroots level and you know decentralized level and all that kind of stuff to make crypto a thing and so that's why Sam had buy-in from both the crypto side and from the traditional you know Western Financial um ecosystem side and so he was able to um you know take his company and not going to diminish the success of what FTX and the really good employees they built over the years um but he was able to take that and leverage it to an entirely new level and you know as it comes to light it seems like he was in you know secret conversations with people all around the world to get special treatment for his firm and their products that he was going to roll out and sort of create this Juggernaut of a a crypto One-Stop shop Financial player and unfortunately as it appears from you know what we've seen Safari he basically was bad at trading because his hedge fund that he supposedly didn't run lost 10 billion dollars in the span of I don't know let's call it six to 12 months and again it's extremely hard to lose six no it's 10 billion whatever it was it's hard to lose 10 billion dollars like you look at all the financial scammers around the world like at Banks and all these other different places like 10 billion dollars is a [ __ ] ton of money to lose in like months span of months um it just La it just reeks of an organization that was successful because people thought they were successful rather than actually having real trading acumen and then unfortunately they made the bad decision to take customer funds to try to plug the hole and help the market turned around and then there are liquid coins that they own would rise in value and then you know that it would have been okay right if the market went up he would have been fine if the problem was that the market went down for the Terra Luna and then it continued falling uh and then it put pressure on on his you know sand castle and it came all crumbling down and now everybody who backed him is super [ __ ] embarrassed right because it's clear from the things that we've heard from the public I don't really know what actually happened private at FTX in Alameda that this was you know pretty much a bunch of people doing bad things from the start and it's very good at hiding it and now everybody's got egg on their face and it's not just you know Western establishment people it's also crypto folks as well who stumped for FDX uh and you know a lot of people lost a lot of money you know whole funds was it multi coins on 90 I mean obviously part of that's part of market and also part of that's part of keeping all your funds on an exchange it strikes me as absolutely ridiculous that so-called these decentralized projects raise a bunch of money and then kept it all in FTX and then lost it all it's like what the [ __ ] you guys doing um and so like it's it's not just like SPF [ __ ] up it's we we also [ __ ] up too by like not actually living the thing that we're trying to build so that's that's my monologue I you know I your your story reminded me of one thing which is somehow Bill Clinton seems to be associated with so many Deca billion dollar losses like Mark rich SPF like we can just like he's somehow always there near the top the Crescent of when people are about to have their Fall From Grace which maybe is a maybe is a a representative story that whoever the hero is whoever's chasing them is usually yeah about to also fall with them but somehow I guess Clinton still keeps getting new gigs well it's it's an interesting perspective that SBF was sort of this Faustian bargain between the crypto world and the kind of you know the elite the powers that be that wanted to find some way to kind of shape crypto into uh some kind of organism that they could manage and which they could effectively assimilate and unfortunately you make a deal with the devil and you you're hanging out a lot with the devil and that it seems to be basically the story of of what happened with FTX it's funny because actually Arthur you reminded me of something that that Sam told me at one point that uh did you tell me maybe maybe he said on a podcast I don't remember actually uh but he said at one point that the thing that's weird about crypto is that it's the only industry he'd ever seen where everybody was long like usually in most Industries like there's some people who are like yeah it's gonna go up something yeah it's gonna go down now it's gonna go sideways but in crypto like fundamentally you don't come into crypto unless you actually believe the numbers gonna go up eventually right you might believe oh it's gonna be you know six months of this and that but then then we're all you know Bitcoins obviously can be eventually worth 100k and that leads to a lot of weird decisions and a lot of weird positioning relative to most Industries ironically this was the basically the description of Alameda strategy right an fgx strategy which is that they basically assumed the same thing that he was that he found so strange about crypto like as a Jane Street as a Jane Street guy like he's always like I don't know the Bitcoin should be worth I don't know what ether should be words like I stuff goes up and down who the hell knows what's supposed to be worth but at some point like when the number just keeps going up and you keep making more and more money you just start to believe that maybe these people are right maybe the number always does go up and you should just build your business with that assumption in mind and that seems to have been the formula that created Alameda and that created FTX was this idea that prices only go one way and when they went the other way the whole thing collapsed yeah I mean and to be honest maybe the market recovers in the next six to 12 months and he literally had if he lasted another 12 months then we wouldn't be having this conversation right it's just it's literally a function of the price of of Bitcoin and the associated illiquid things that he had on this balance sheet is which undid him it's not that anyone asks actually asked any uncomfortable questions of what how he did did his business right this is all predicated on the price which is true you know good and a bad thing it's good that it's a free market and you know the market punished someone who took too much leverage and punished Genesis and that punished I mean we can the list goes on and on and on and of that the people who built these businesses built on Leverage uh and hope the prices went up in One Direction so thankfully that we don't have people bailing anyone out we've expunged Bad Business businesses from our ecosystem and the decentralized products that are around they flourish and they showed like what the why we're here and what we're doing this for well so Arthur you're one of the few exchange Founders that has survived a tussle with the legal system and with U.S Regulators uh it's hard not to notice that as the basically the only black guy who has you know basically built anything of of uh substance in the exchange world you're the one person who's actually went through that before collapsing but you you recently uh you know you you've recently exited house arrest and you're now starting your own family office called Maelstrom which I believe there was a headline that announced uh Maelstrom I believe the quote was is ready to [ __ ] [ __ ] up so tell us tell us about Maelstrom what made you decide to start your family office and uh what what you intend to be investing into yeah so I mean I guess if family office is a big grandiose term it's basically a pot of money in crypto that we do a lot of early stage stuff right and so I've hired one person who used to work at bitmex with me I really like the work he's done and sort of bitmex's wand on its corporate Venture stuff and so he's able to pick him up and the thesis is okay this pot of money is already long crypto right so it goes up it goes down whatever can we beat Bitcoin uh in East return profile by investing in very early uh projects particularly we like tokens because I like liquidity have a very very strong liquidity preference I don't really like Equity because I don't know how I'm ever gonna get [ __ ] paid okay I can wait seven years and maybe they could do IPO and the stars have to align and then I finally get my money back versus you know tokens go in a cycle right this is the time this is in my opinion the time is now to be putting money to work and then you harvest it in two to three years when you know the project does a tge and the tokens unlock and you can actually sell them and we actually have knowledge of what's going on versus like the equity processes it's a opaque process that's run by a bunch of Banks and you know it's the market is the market and you take what you can get so that's kind of our thesis and then decentralization right the whole point of why we're excited about this and why things have these traded these ridiculous multiples like a team with no product can raise tokens at you know 50 60 70 80 million dollar evaluation is because everybody whether it's you know the establishment or it's the native crypto folks understands the decentralized things are better right they are worth more if you have a Network that has a lot of different participants that might not agree on everything but they agree on enough things to make something happen and it's really really really really really hard to build truly decentralized products that solve things you know as we've seen a lot of products start out with the great ethos and then they start taking shortcuts because they want to get achieve a certain thing with their product that maybe the decentralized way wasn't wasn't the right way to go in the first place but that being said our goal is can we find enough of these projects at an early stage who actually are living this value that are creating real things that people are going to use in a big way in the next two to three years and thankfully I have this megaphone and so that lets us get into deals that otherwise you probably shouldn't be in um given that we're just a no-name family offense there's lots of family offices in the world it's a lot of people who are not a no-name family out there are some no-name family offices that invest in crypto yours is not one of them right so that's that's sort of our value add to projects like hey we can come on board if you're doing cool things we can help amplify them and and so that's why we're you know mostly the guy in his Ox shot he's running around at conferences and speaking to Founders and trying to find the the cool things that are really going to you know move this forward so that we do have a truly decentralized computer in ethereum or some other L1 or the Bitcoin ecosystem you know continues to flourish like these are the things that we want to support by investing in teams that are actually building real stuff and then also you know in the time of the cycle when dog [ __ ] flies less than dog [ __ ] too like we're here to make money so we're not going to be dogmatic about like oh it has to be this like you know deep Tech pure whatever blah blah blah right if if you're if it's if it's if it's time for you know 10 million dollars on a PPT and it goes to tge and it goes up 10x like I'm there I'm in let's play so we're we're playing at all points of the cycle for the founders listening what's your average check size uh 50 to 100K so we're various Angel we're not trying to be leading around or anything like that so we're just coming alongside you know some of the other major funds out there that are going to be putting in the majority of your round and the token the pre-sale tokens do portfolio Founders get stuffed animals I don't know maybe they will now that this has become such a thing this definitely has to be your thing this definitely has to be your thing now is that you ship a stuffed animal to each founder I'm a fan so all right are there that's enough of a commercial let's let's jump into the meat of it because it's been kind of a harrowing week one of the big stories this week uh and I want to get your take on this has been the collapse of silvergate so silvergate for those who don't know it's a Regional Bank in California and it made a name for itself basically in the last five years by being the bank of crypto so um most people know that if you're a crypto company it's generally difficult to get banking there are a few Banks such as silvergate signature a few others that have been positioned as quite crypto friendly signature is probably one of the most Central in the industry uh silver they run a network called sen uh The silvergate Exchange Network I think is what it's called where basically they allow you to 24 7 move deposits or balances at silvergate so if you if you and the counterparty also have a balances over gate you can basically you know transfer funds instantaneously so silvergate they've basically experienced over the last six months what you might call a bankrupt there was a banking partner of FTX when FTX went under a lot of people got scared that bad things were happening across the board a lot of ftx's deposits were coming from silvergate and so when FTX ran for the hills everybody else ran for the hills a lot of people started pulling their money from anybody who's associated with FTX uh and that caused silvergates uh deposit base to shrink very rapidly now there was a little bit of a scare about them uh soon after FTX collapsed but then things kind of normalized they were sort of around they were okay seemingly and then they had some regulatory filings that noted that they were potentially under investigation and maybe Kai disorder slightly under capitalized-ish we will let you guys know shortly which just caused everyone to freak out the stock to tank over 50 in a single day uh they're now trading I think somewhere in the order of about 200 million market capitalization which is very thin for a bank so it's things are things are looking bad uh pretty much all of their banking Partners in crypto so uh coinbase you know the big desks Circle they've all pulled their relationships with silvergate no longer accepting deposits from there now silvergate is not dead yet you can still withdraw a deposit from silvergate and uh actually Matt Levine did a great write-up on the situation at silvergate basically saying that actually you know they didn't have anything that weird on their balance sheet they had just you know a bunch of bonds they had a giant Bond portfolio they had a little bit of Bitcoin lending but the Bitcoin lending actually was fine seemingly but it was just that as they were getting more and more withdrawals they had to basically fire sell a bond portfolio uh in a time when liquidity was not amazing and as a result they just have experienced more and more of a drawdown and kind of it seems really that it's not a story at least yet of malfeasance or something you know them doing crazy things like it's not an FTX situation it really just seems like a good old-fashioned All-American Bank Run and that that might spell the end for silvergate if it does it seems like it's going to be really bad not necessarily because people aren't going to get their money back very good chance that you know the the balance sheet is actually pretty reasonable um it's more that Banks don't fail very often and if a bank fails because of crypto that looks really bad well the news that came out after hours on Bloomberg maybe right before this show started was that silvergate announced that they are going into liquidation oh game over oh wow let's go to Bloomberg I think it's like I did not see this yeah okay wow so somebody is going to live conditions this is how fast the industry moves you know right before the show started okay well all right I did not have a chance to prep for that um all right well so somebody gets going to liquidation guys guess what this is what we got to talk about now it's over that's really bad that's really bad I was looking this up uh the other day so Banks the last time a bank failed was in 2020. they were very there are very few bank failures in the sort of modern era the bank failure generally is a big story it's a national headline kind of thing and this is going to be even more so because they were you know banking crypto and they were associated with FTX so this is gonna this is probably gonna play out of the new cycle and also accelerate some of the you know anybody who's claiming that crypto has systemic risks I mean in reality nobody else was using silvergate right like this was really a crypto bank but the nominally the story of hey a bank got destroyed because of crypto is a really really bad headline yeah that goes straight to the arguments of the industry's you know most scared critics who rightly or wrongly believe that crypto is a threat in some way to the traditional Financial system and being able to point to a bank failure directly resulting from crypto is just going to give them ammunition whether it's a fair argument or not that they're going to continue to hammer the industry with Arthur what's your take on the silver Gateway so I mean I guess first of all I think people need to understand what banks are there to do like a a good bank CEO okay let's a backup probably the best bank CEO of our you know last two generations is probably JB Diamond of a commercial break right and Jamie dimon for all his you know goodness and greatness as a banker [ __ ] up real bad I forget what year it wasn't maybe 2012 or 2013. essentially JP Mark was accumulating all these deposits and they didn't really have a lot of good people to lend the money to so they had this massive just pot of money just sitting there so they had this group in London run by uh it was called the London whale I forgot his name and what he did was he was able to use essentially free funding from the JP Morgan commercial arm to punt credit default swaps in massive notionals he was the market for the particular indices that he was trading and he was responsible when he was good for a large for a meaningful percentage of quarterly net income for the bank because the bank didn't have anyone to lend to and he ultimately blew up because the timing the market wrong and a few things and JP Morgan lost billions of dollars and this was a massive scandal at first diamond came out said it was a tempest in a teapot there's nothing to see here and then as he had to write down two to three billion dollars of loss due to this thing he had to eat a bunch of humble pie out there now essentially his job as a CEO is to manage duration right I have all these deposits that are short term I need to lend them out long term right and if everybody wants their money back immediately then I need to be able to make good on a certain percentage of of that book at his level with the trillions of dollars that they have on their marriage and he's managing these massive numbers of what's the strategy in the bank going to be for what we're going to take these deposits and move them into there wasn't anywhere loans so we started punching derivatives right they've survived obviously because they're a much larger bank and you know better managed but silvergate had the same issue they said okay we're going to be a crypto Bank all right so we're going to get all these deposits that are very flighty right because we in crypto we don't trust anyone with our money we're like okay well we'll give you a centralized entity with a Bitcoin exchange or or a bank or money but any hint of trouble we're [ __ ] out of here right because at the end of the day we know that we can go back to bitcoin it's a centralized knock on wood ever since 2009 things have worked and there hasn't been any issues right and so super good has this deposit base that literally in a day's noon I say I want my money back give it all to me right now right and they built a whole business on this now what what they did was they raised the majority of their deposits and I haven't done the research on this but I'm assuming that they're the Delta of change in deposits was the highest after covet up until probably late 2021 right massive bull market FTX is booming everybody's making money send is ballooning all the major exchanges are on it and so their dollar deposits are going through the roofs and so they have a few issues with that number one a bank gets charged money you know I think it's basil-free regulations after 2008 uh these Global things they get charged money for the quality of their deposits meaning if if the regulator thinks that you have really really flighty deposits they're saying if you have a dollar of deposit I'm gonna charge you you need to have five cents of equity versus that deposit so taking a deposit is expensive especially one that you know is going to can go out the door within a day's notice and so they have this issue okay we have these billions and billions of billions of deposits we need to put millions or hundreds of millions of dollars against these you know per our regulator whether that's you know Equity capitalization or they have to raise money um to back that and then at this time there isn't really any good risk-free options that are going to cover that cost right so back in 2020 2021 interest rates get taken down to zero so you know you park your money with the FED you're getting I don't know five or ten basis points reverse repos five or ten basis points it's not really gonna to cover the charges that they have to take on all this debt that they have so what do they do they reached for yield and took more risk now they didn't take more risk in the sense of investing in junk credit they took my risk in investing in mortgage-backed Securities in longer data treasuries uh and if you do do your bond math you'll know that the longer the duration of meaning the longer to maturity of the asset the more sensitive it is to interest rates if interest rates are zero or close to zero the five thousand year low in human civilization I mean anyone would probably say well the most obvious thing is they're probably going to go up in the future right so if I buy if I raise deposits at the time and zero interest rates are booming because everybody wants to get into crypto and all these crypto companies and major making a bunch of money the only way that I can cover my cost is to invest in longer duration paper at 5 000 year lows and interest rates I'm setting myself up for a massive failure because as interest rates rise the debt becomes worth less even if it's liquid it doesn't matter how liquid it is if I'm buying a 10-year bond at zero and then it re rates to four percent a year and a half later I'm sitting on a massive Capital loss 2022 was one of the worst years for fixed income securities right because the the whole world moved off of zero interest rates and everyone who had bought a lot of bonds in 20 and 21 reach for yield took more risk either by having a longer duration or taking more credit risk was massively down right so the and silvergate was no and it was in the same position because they put all my money in this stuff which is you know safe ish right it's a US Government you know Securities treasuries mortgage-backed Securities say from a credit perspective not stay from a interest rate and duration perspective and so in comes the FDX drama the the crypto meltdown all these issues and understandably their customers like give me back my money and when they went to go and sell their portfolio they're sitting on these massive unrealized losses now the funny thing about Trad fire accounting is Trad fire accounting has all these little quirks and rules where you get to hide things legally right and so they were I'm sure that they've reported their accounts in a very legal fashion uh and they probably marked a lot of these debt Securities they held that's held to maturity which means if I buy a bond at 99 and it's worth 110 years I get to mark that Bond at 100 even though it might trade down to 70. it doesn't matter I don't I don't need to book that Mark to Market but if I have this Bond as available for sale then I have to mark these to Market that's what a lot of games at Banks play is oh okay Market's going down for fixing Securities oh these are all helped to maturity now we're not going to sell these don't look at it don't look at that massive loss that we have right underneath the surface and so everyone's okay cool yeah your internet income is you know positive net income when you're sitting on these toxic you know debt pieces of [ __ ] that you bought at the at the height of the market now they're down 20 points this is how how people game their accounting statements so that we think that they're solvent when if they had to liquidate these things at the market they'd face some issues and obviously that's what happened to silvergate now as a hypothetical I think that what the CEO should have done back in the day is said okay interest rates are the 5 000 year low I have I have all these flighty deposits I'm gonna take a bet and he could communicate this you know very clearly to his investors of what he's doing uh I'm gonna take a better in interest rates funded by uh crypto deposits I know these crypto deposits are super they want their money back immediately so what I can do is I can say okay I'll take these crypto deposits and at my bank you get your money back not in t plus one or one trading day but so you get your back and say t plus two or t plus three two or three days which is and I'll explain why you do that in a second then I take all this money and I get stuff it up at the Federal Reserve I say hey fed here you go the FED is the risk is is risk-free essentially they they basically print money to pay pay me back and the fed's going to pay me interest rate on excess balances back in 2021 and 2020 it was close to zero but you're taking the bet that they're gonna have to raise interest rates at some point and therefore as they raise rates I'm essentially going to participate in that so you know interest rate on access reserves went from close to zero the last time I checked is about 4.6 percent right and so the silvergate CEO and a lot of these CEOs will run these crypto business could say okay I'm going to lend my money at the FED I know that if I ever need it back the fed's gonna give it back to me within one day I told my customers I'll give it back to them in two days so that I'm sweet right I I there's very basically no risk of default on this loan because it's at the Federal Reserve the person who can print money and then I'm going to take a long interest rate bet and to fund the charges on my balance sheet for all this excess cash I'm going to sell stock at a premium because I'm viewed as a crypto bank right silvergate stock and a lot of the other stocks were flying in 2021. they were probably trading at I haven't looked at the chart egregious Price to Book multiples versus JPMorgan City and a lot of the other global commercial Banks who usually trades slightly below a book and so they could issue stock at a much higher valuation than their peers because they reviewed his crypto when crypto was going up they can take that cash put it against their deposit base satisfy their regulators and take this massive bet on interest rates I think that's what he should have done as opposed to had knowing that he has this problem of I have these deposits I could leave in a day and then buying debt at 5 000 year lows right and then you know unfortunately the market turned at the time in which this customers wanted their money back and now they're bankrupt one thing one thing I want to add about the timing because like I think you know Jose brought up to this point that like why did it happen now versus like a month ago so we had this crazy yield curve in version over the last month which is like at the record your current version since 2020 and that means like the long out of the out of the money bonds are sort of like lower in interest rate than shorter term duration bonds like the yield curve is not strictly increasing I noticed all the silver get news is actually extremely correlated with that like it seems to have happened around that time but February 9th or 8th it was like when inversion was around two percent and between the 30 and the 10 and it sort of seems like they they like caught they they walked into this like cascading spiral where like they had to keep selling into this thing that was like constantly widening against them and there was no way of getting out and I think the timing timing is like extremely close to this like the last month of really crazy bond market fluctuations because when FTX happened the it was probably they were probably able to do enough to get out of this but to some extent what you're pointing out is like the rest of the market just would completely eviscerated in February and I can imagine that well I think the issues go back earlier so you know the issues that they were experiencing was you know when you know whatever eight billion dollars of deposits rolled off from silvergate they had to sell eight billion dollars of assets that had fallen a couple percent in value right you know long duration treasuries because rates went from really low to not really low you know they were realizing a couple percent losses on every dollar of bonds that they were selling you know they suffered close to in aggregate a billion dollars of losses on the crypto withdrawals last year and that is a crazy number you know I'm sure you know Arthur attorney you guys can go through the bond math but if like you buy a 10-year treasury the duration's like eight years you know for every percent interest rates move against you you lose eight percent roughly on like the value of the instrument in America right so if rates went up two percent they could have lost you know close to 15 16 which is crazy numbers to lose on bonds if you buy long duration stuff right before rates exceed everyone's expectations due to inflation blah blah blah blah so they lost a billion dollars on like close to 10 billion dollars of withdrawals which are crazy numbers but and all of that happened last year as I understand it the thing that's like happened recently is they already had already lost the money you know massive losses it came down to since year end since they disclosed that they lost a billion dollars the situation was continuing to worsen in that people were still withdrawing their funds from silvergate to the point where they didn't even have the ability to produce accurate annual financials and submit them and that billion dollars of losses going into your end and then January and February probably hundreds of millions of dollars more of losses you know I'm sure the numbers will come out as all of this unwinds but just you know it didn't really start in February all of it was last year and then it's just continued to drip drip drip until then and the real acceleration of its unwind came like a week and change ago when they filed a going concern warning at the same time that they didn't publish their annual financials yeah I assume part of that story as well is that you know as they were meeting the redemptions late last year the part of their portfolio they're selling is the part that's most marketable right like so as Arthur was saying you've got the pile of like absolute garbage that you plan to hold to maturity and you've got the stuff that like okay I can like I can pretty sensibly sell this off and get some liquidity on it and so what you're left with is kind of like album it's in a way kind of similar to FTX where like you know what they or Alameda what they have left as they as things are getting sold off it's just like more and more kind of toxic waste uh that's what's left of your balance sheet and so or you know stuff that you'd have to basically realize extremely steep losses and that forces you to basically say look look guys we're we're we're we're no longer solvent like we can uh we can't keep operating with uh with the state of our current balance sheet I mean what do you guys think happens here okay so they're going into liquidation that's bad news you know I was I was scanning the the Bloomberg article and you know we have some comments from I think it was Sherrod Brown who said uh uh when Banks get involved with crypto it spreads risk across the financial system and it will be taxpayers and consumers who pay the price what do you guys think happens from here what's the kind of Ripple effects of silvergate going under this makes it a bit harder to get a bank account if you're a crypto firm I think it's pretty is it gonna stop all together probably not but will it be harder yeah in some respects I think that removing this crutch of we're gonna have all these Banks help us out just intermediate them is a good thing because then people focus on like what we're actually here to do which is build a financial system that is parallel not in conjunction with um that system and so the stablecoin ecosystem needs some changes uh there's nothing particularly I find wrong with the fact of you know a tether a circle a busd it's just that we have these things that people rely on to trade and yet these things must have a banking partner to hold the dollars and so you're saying hey I'm going to issue this token that completely destroys your Global transaction Banking and FX businesses because it moves 24 7 and essentially for free versus your nine to five Monday to Friday thing that you can charge egregious spreads on but oh by the way we need your help custodying all these dollars please help us out like are you [ __ ] like why why would you why would you think that they're gonna be okay with this and if I was a shareholder of any of these Banks and I'm like a large speaker you're you're banking these stable coins whose entire goal is to basically remove large percentages of our net income like are you [ __ ] crazy and so I think this this fundamental disconnect is finally going as I think makes sense that people have like this doesn't make any sense that we face all our Hope on these things that require the pipes of the organization that we're trying to displace to help us with there's an interesting take on stable coins but at the same time at the same time right look I think in an environment of zero percent interest rates that's basically correct that like stable coins are this like wild banking hack that allows you to just kind of do things that Banks can't normally do in an environment of basically five percent you know overnight rates uh that's just not that's just not true anymore right stable coins don't pay interest stable coins are right I guess the thing is that pure debt this the stable coin you can raise a bunch of deposits but you can't lend those out long term we just saw what happened to a bank who lent money to the U.S [ __ ] government and they went bankrupt because the crypto the crypto deposits left in one day and they had long duration debt lent to the [ __ ] US government and they went bankrupt right so how are you supposed to lend to a regular business or you know to another less credit worthy borrower than the US government who runs the US dollar and they went bankrupt it's not this isn't a like I take it but I will I will push back because that actually stable coin supply has been surprisingly resilient over the last six months obviously it hasn't gone up but it hasn't collapsed the way itself against deposit-based collapse like silver gets deposits collapsed I think for a very different reason because of their connection to FTX and all those other all this other [ __ ] that's happened uh but if you look at Global stupid coin Supply it's actually been it's actually been pretty solid that's conflating the issue the the thing is that Global stable coin we people in crypto want a stable coin right if JP Morgan or city or Wells Fargo or one of these large Banks said hey here is a token that rise in ethereum that's backed by dollars in in my bank there would be no tether there would be no binance there would be no Circle because everyone would use that because that is a a bank with a fed you can access to the Fed and they're too big to fail they're not going anywhere right why would you use a private company that that needs a correspondent bank to put their dollars in it doesn't make any sense the reason why stablecoin is this is because it's because none of the banks want to launch the product why don't they want to launch the product because they make over two trillion dollars a year in FX and transaction Services why would they put that at risk by launching a solution that costs a few dollars to move as much money as you want whenever you want to use it that's why they in my opinion the Commercial Bank would never launch their own stable coin even though the first one we did it would make some money absolutely they'd make money but the businesses of theirs that they completely destroy that's the outperformance making a few hundred basis points net interest margin lending to the Fed I mean a few hundred basis points net interest margin is a big deal for a bank okay like I think and I'll take the counter perspective here I think a bank should launch a digital bank account coin or stablecoin or whatever you want to call it when it's not you know the way we think of stable coins today you know if they're paying roughly zero for deposits you know that is an incredibly lucrative business opportunity for any Bank especially to do it at scale right like silvergate was special in some way because it was paying its depositors crypto businesses zero whereas most banks are unable to borrow money at zero percent now and deposit rates across the whole banking sector have been going up both for retail and Commercial especially as interest rates have been going up so if there was the possibility that a bank could launch asset Gathering product that could bring in tens of billions of dollars look at Heather Circle you know a hundred plus billion dollars at zero expense and then they can deploy that into whatever mixture of interest bearing things they want I mean I think that's unbelievably lucrative and I think you know it's not you know oh it's going to chip away at some transaction fees if they have the opportunity to make billions of dollars you know of incremental profit per year I think they should well I I would say that's not the case for most of the largest banks because if you um take a look at deposit rates at least you know let's say in the west right you go into your large tier One Bank you're getting on a 10 20 30 basis points on your under your deposit per year right versus the FED funds lower bound is that I don't know what 450 475 whatever uh where it is right now banks are telling the market we don't need deposits the the Central Bank solved the deposit issue in 2008 we said you you all [ __ ] up so we're gonna stuff you with reserves there's record of the check yesterday three trillion dollars of excess Reserve sitting at the FED which is the Fed member banks have parked three trillion dollars with the FED because they have no use for it is that we don't we don't want to loan it we don't want to take any risk on any individuals or companies and and the aggregate so we're just going to give it to the FED they don't need deposits they don't need to launch a stable coin they generate 100 billion when they have three trillion parts of the FED a Silver Gate does though a a small no-name Bank from who other [ __ ] knows where they're from they need a stable coin now if that's the bank that should be the ones that are launching a stable coin that are you know properly licensed to whatever jurisdiction they're in and going up against their competitors all right let me let me try to come at this from a different angle you know you you spend a lot of time in Hong Kong I remember when when Circle and usdc first started coming up talking to a lot of folks in Asia and trying to understand you know what would it take for you guys to onboard onto uscc because obviously usdc it's you know regulated it's you know the U.S compliant coinbase Circle these are you know sort of reputable companies that are that are you know blessed by or relatively blessed by by the US and everybody I talked to in Asia was like no we don't wanna we don't want to we don't want that we don't want something that's regulated by the US I was like why not now you know you know it's got access to you know a regulated uh New York Bank like isn't that desirable uh there's more there's more visibility and transparency into their deposits and they're like well look we're in Asia right like we the US doesn't like us we actually prefer to be banking with tether uh quote-unquote banking because tether is you know not that close to the US right seeing what's happened with basically you know what happened with Russia and basically you know the the U.S banks cutting off Russia or the FED cutting off Russia Russian deposits um and just the way in which the US uses its banking system as a puzzle to beat senseless anybody they disagree with you know if you're a you know a Chinese National your first instinct is like well I want to be as far away from that as possible I want dollars but I want to be far as far as I can from the reach of the US government and I think for those people that's part of the reason why tether is still so desirable is because actually yes uscc is growing yes it has all these Partnerships yes you can mint it and burn it on any chain blah blah blah but that's not what I care about what I care about is that like tether is my guy tether's not gonna sell me out uh no matter what it is I'm doing no matter how U.S China relations evolve tether is not gonna have a dog in the fight tether Switzerland whereas Circle you know from their perspective circle is the US government and they'd rather not hold usdc knowing that Circle can get in order of any any day to say hey delete these guys addresses because uh we don't like them anymore so I think that actually makes it difficult for that role to be served by a U.S Commercial Bank I was going to say that they then whoever thinks that doesn't understand how Banks work because tether is a you as a US dollar stable coin the whole US Dollars which means that ultimately some bank that has a um a direct license with the FED holds those dollars I don't know the name of the bank that tether banks with wherever it is [Music] let me get to my point they don't understand how baking works so that bank it doesn't matter where that bank is the bank could be in Vanuatu for all I care if the bank and wherever the [ __ ] outside the US wants to wire money to another country it must go through their correspondent bank was a account with the FED that is going to move these dollars and so whether it's tether Circle busd blah blah whoever their bank if even if they don't have a license directly they have to bank with somebody who does and that's why if you send a bank transfer to a bank that doesn't have a license with a particular Central Bank where they are from you see they have that thing called an intermediary bank that's the bank that actually has the clearing license in that currency with that Central Bank that's how correspondent banking Works in in the Fiat system so if you're a Chinese National and you think that you're somehow you're getting around something because you have a tether wallet versus a circle while you don't understand that they both have dollars with the same institutions and at some point that institution is okay with holding all those dollars on behalf of tether right because all it takes is a few phone calls and if the correspondent Banks doesn't like those transactions they call up the other big they hey who's this from they tell them like well we don't like that so if you want to continue to have your fed license to wire US Dollars you need to drop that client wearing a new thing to drop the [ __ ] client right and so it they don't understand what they're they're trading and they're sending themselves to get wrecked if that's what they believe I understand your point I think it's a I don't think they're wrong but I think your point is correct which is like look if it gets bad they are wrong they are understandably wrong that's true for Euro dollars as well right your dollars are also connected to the U.S banking system through correspondent banking relations exactly but like but Euro dollars are still further from the reach of the FED like they're so further from the reach now it's it's not impossible for itself a direct phone call is two phone calls it's uh there's more than one phone I think the thing though is that the enforcement of these things is kind of a little bit weird right like Futures contracts on Euro dollars are settled completely different than say Futures contracts on bonds and people's speculative second order things to these products which is effectively most of crypto if we look at most of the stable claim using crypto the second order products are like completely very hard to control and so I guess the question to these Banks is like how much margin do they actually really are they exposed to indirectly by the second order of products I think that that's the part the US government is probably going to have to Grapple with after the silver game thing because they implicitly have these dollars in a bank account that are backing margin accounts on chain or at particular exchanges and silverget actually sort of is holding some risk to those in the cases that those entities don't aren't are either all withdrawing at the same time or redeeming and so I suspect we're going to have this kind of change in banking licensure where these like second order things somehow have to get reported in the sense that like if silvergate say was was holding circles USD they would basically have to having a report where all the usdc actually is and that would be a very bad outcome in my mind like if we get to the point where like the banks are actually sort of forcing these second order reporting to be included if that were true like euro dollar is basically impossible to report on like even though it is technically possible to go call Euro dollars it's it's extremely hard to actually know where it's used as collateral everywhere in the world and I think we're gonna it the crypto version of the world actually has a very similar property where the second order pieces of how where the dollars end up is is just a little too hard to control fully you can control a lot of it without everything well I think maybe that is I guess maybe an issue but I'm just going to go off of what Yellen specifically said which and I believe it is a real concern for them which is okay if let's call that 100 billion is in stable coin deposits in dollars of the major ones right and because again these are for-profit entities what do they do they buy debt and they earn an interest margin cool nothing wrong with that they're basically buying treasuries they're handing the money back to the US government um the issue is that let's say that a not a run but everybody says oh I want to redeem all my tether uscc and busd today right and as dutiful custodians I say oh cool we can do that and they go and they dump 100 billion dollars of bonds on the market in a day Market order give us a [ __ ] money back right that's what they care about that's a big amount of short-term pressure on the market the only Market they really care about which is the US Treasury Market and this is something that she said publicly of why they care about civil point it has nothing to do with you know Banks having this and that deposit it's they buy the debt because they need to to earn yield and to make good on their customer you know promises they have to liquidate it as soon as a customer wants their money back because that's what they're supposed to do and if they do that and we see what happens then they have to dump bonds and the liquidity in the treasury market has demonstratively diminished since the global financial crisis and all the regulations on banks have forced them to exit Market making um and primary dealing responsibilities in the treasury market and so that's what they're worried about and so you're in my opinion and I I wrote an article about this coming out I think now is that the the upper end of how large an aggregate US dollar stable coins can get is going to be massaged to be a certain level whatever they think is the market can handle in terms of short-term stress of selling these bonds I know that some people have a theory that the crypto total crypto market cap is positively correlated to the size of you know dollar stable coin balances right so if you believe that then you can't have this thing dollar stable coins being the anchor of the connection between crypto and tradfi from a you know banking fish perspective in and out because it's going to get limited because it produces too much risk for the U.S treasury market for a very understandable reasons and we need to find an alternative um I'll leave that as a plug for reading what I've wrote about in my article that came out now but that that that is that's the that's a sort of the thesis interesting observation of that is like if we do look at sort of the history of Bitcoin trading there was you know at first the basis trade and Quanto you know sort of these weird Quanto derivative but obviously as you are extremely familiar with Ponto trades that have these weird interest rate behaviors and you could kind of scrape percentage points you know pretty reliably but in Bitcoin terms and you you couldn't get out until tethering some sense you know the current version of that which is the main sort of organic source of yield seems to be you know ethereum staking derivatives how do you how would you feel if that becomes sort of like the the natural source of single origin organic on-chain yield versus say yeah Bitcoin basis trades because that's amazing that's great that we have our own native reason for people to lock up Capital which is to secure the network I think that's perfectly natural you have people with eth taking eth to earn more Eve for providing a service there's no connection to the the the tradify banking system there's no risk if eth goes to zero who gives a [ __ ] right and from there my point of view there's no like okay cool whatever they created this newfangled thing and you need to stake this magic internet money to earn more magic internet money to secure the network that makes the magic internet money move from place to a to place B great I don't see a US dollar a Euro again the CNY uh you know give me a fiat currency involved in that that's just us in our own Community um creating value where value needs to be created that's that's excellent what's not excellent is let's see let's believe that our whole entire uh ecosystem depends on a bunch of banks allowing some US dollars to be stashed in them so that a few companies can make 300 basis points and interest margin that's not a good solution for us that is not no that is nowhere near helping the long-term viability of the entire Community it helps some Traders and I understand the reason for the product but there's some fundamental flaws in how it's constructed and how the feedback loop between the two systems for sure but I I will say I I I'm happy to to point out that you did give a compliment to the two-digit [ __ ] Point as you yourself called it a Once Upon absolutely I I I trade both ways just wanted to point that one out all right well Arthur we're we're up on time I I appreciate you coming on to the world's best banking podcast as I guess we are now like Jesus Christ um hopefully next time that's why I brought up the single origin organic holy unchain yield of of State ethereum yeah we almost avoided being the most tradify podcast out there but thank you for uh bringing it back I mean I think people need to understand this [ __ ] because if if you're trying to create a system that's doing something different and you don't know how the [ __ ] other one works then you're just gonna do you're gonna make solutions that have already been done that complicate the problem further which is the problem with a lot of the things in our ecosystem and hopefully and as we see as we saw what failed everything that was centralized required a lot of Leverage was basically just a play on the FED producing interest rates of zero I'm just going to go along a bunch of dog shoot and hope it never goes down every one of those booking Muppets is out of business as they should be plus one to that very well said well Arthur it's always a pleasure to see you and your sculpted suit of armor uh thanks for coming on and uh we hope that you're gonna be enjoying the the slopes in in Japan thanks guys yeah everyone go read Arthur's new piece that's it from us thanks everybody [Music]
