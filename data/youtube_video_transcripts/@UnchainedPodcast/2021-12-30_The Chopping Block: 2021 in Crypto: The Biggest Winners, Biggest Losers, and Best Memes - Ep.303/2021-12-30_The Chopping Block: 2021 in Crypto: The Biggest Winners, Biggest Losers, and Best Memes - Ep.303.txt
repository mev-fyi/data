okay yeah i can see the countdown very professional hi all laura here we're trying something new at unchained we'll be doing live streams every other week of a new show called the chopping block between four crypto investors haseeb qureshi and tom schmidt managing partners at dragonfly cup i'm sorry managing partners at dragonfly capital and robert leschner and tarun managing partners at robotventures in each episode haseeb tom robert and tyrone will discuss recent events in crypto we will also release these conversations on the podcast so you can always tune in later but the live streams will be the earliest you can catch the shows and in general the videos will have all the visual content whereas the podcasts will obviously only be audio i've already watched a few of their discussions and they're fun plus they give you a wealth of insight into the many happenings in the space i just wanted to pop in why number one there's a live stream going on and number two why i am not a part of it so with that done now i will turn it over to haseeb thanks laura and uh thanks for chaperoning making sure that we're behaving ourselves so um without further ado let's let's kick off the show so uh hey everybody welcome to the chopping block uh every couple weeks the four of us get together and we give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick round of intros um i'll start with tom tom is the d5 maven and the master of memes uh whoa did you just did you just do this there's a little there's a little power surge over here so sorry about that wow you say his name and you know the d5 yeah yeah i was yeah yeah you got your own light show going on over there um then we've got robert krypto connoisseur and captain of compound uh robert is also for whatever reason he's hanging out in a little girl's bedroom for reasons that he cannot fully explain where i popped his family was that it's where i podcast from it's oh god i gotta go that's your studio that's your studio um and then we've got taroun the gigabrain and gran puba at gauntlet and uh lastly there is myself haseeb i am chief hype man at dragonfly so the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice so um taking everything you hear here with a grain of salt because it's crypto and you should do your own research how is everybody doing today uh also tom you just got back from taiwan how is it being back in america after spending like all of code in taiwan yeah it's been uh mixed i would say i obviously like the kobe situation a bit better in taiwan but it's nice being back and you know seeing my friends and family and eating mexican food and i'm feeling i it's not my office but you know i got the very patriotic like poster in the background so people always ask me about that it's bruce springsteen so anyway it's good to be back nice nice and um overall verdict on taiwan uh taiwan a little bit over here yeah taiwan number one you know it's it's number one for a reason um yeah it's awesome there's a great crypto scene there um and it's really blossoming a lot of cool new projects coming out and a lot of great entrepreneurs and people are just really great you know food is amazing it's beautiful i have nothing but good things to say i really miss taiwan i'm hoping to go back next year as well nice nice and overall guys has been your has been your holidays well new year's is in two days and i'm about to get away for a very short uh r and r and so you know we'll we'll see you soon but you know happy new year to everybody uh in advance guys everyone i know has i am honestly um so i i could not get a booster because uh all of the all the places i give booster shots here are super backed up so i am kind of terrified of omicron i actually took a flight a few days ago and i did not get sick i think maybe i'm asymptomatic but um i'm i'm i'm just like at this point i think so many people i know have omicron or recently got omicron that it just feels to me like everybody is going to get this thing it's just like going to be this is going to be that scene this is going to be how it ends it might well be it might well be that's how it seems right now here's my here's my dark contrarian take on covet and then we can go straight into the crypto stuff i think that covid in a twisted way is actually pro crypto and it goes to the argument that i think a lot of people are losing faith in government governments based on the response or mis you know response to covet in general and distrust in governments equals a search for alternate approaches whether it's monetary systems or government forms of you know communication and consensus and i think long term this will be one you know major you know footnote in the history of why crypto succeeded i could see that um i remember early when covet first started being it was really not obvious at that time how coveted was going to affect crypto and in retrospect i feel like maybe it should have it should have been obvious that crypto that like everybody being at home and just being really antsy and bored and going half crazy was gonna cost a lot of uh it was gonna be very bullish for everything going on in crypto um but i totally agree with you that in retrospect so many of the trends that kovid kicked off have been really really good for the adoption and the growth of the crypto industry yeah even just living online being digital right like the fact that fundraising and team building and like everything that we do now is happening remotely like this was not a given you know three or four years ago certainly some people were pushing for remote work and remote investment but people were still used to you know fly to the bay area to like do all their fundraising grounds and like it was weird to like have a remote team and now that's almost kind of becoming more than norm yeah i mean you know you'll you may you may always see me say this on twitter but i am so happy that crypto and kovid killed san francisco [Laughter] it was like yeah it was great it's true i mean we we recently did our uh team offside for dragonfly and um we it used to be that like 30 to 40 of all of our entrepreneurs were in the bay area and uh during our offsite we invited a bunch of entrepreneurs there and we're now down to like less than 10 of all of our founders are in the bay and i i just don't know that it's going to come back so it does feel like the world has fundamentally changed and the allocation of capital has fundamentally changed and i i don't think it's going to revert now that all of that intellectual capital all of that sort of movement freedom and the the inability to extract rents from forcing everybody to be in the same place and pay the same landlords and pay the same coffee shops and pay the same taxes all that is kind of gone now and so many i mean even out of new york like i just heard that there's a a lot of folks leaving new york now going to miami for similar legions people people have realized that like okay the bit license and the new york state tax is just like so onerous as long as we have the crypto people together we don't really need all the other stuff that is bundled with living in new york i don't know have you been have you been have you been to miami and found anyone who isn't an investor in crypto that's the that's didn't that's the that's the where's waldo that's true didn't you the offices in new york they still they had they have an office in soho yeah oh i thought they i thought they got up and moved there's like 30 people in that office no he's traveling a lot but he he's he might be the exception what i'm saying is that maybe like the investor or like the ceo is moving to miami but the teams are not yeah my bet was that the first oh so go ahead tom go ahead i feel like that is the trend it's not like oh like austin and miami are killing san francisco new york it's like no like you know one founder is in the bay and then there's like a you know edge lead in new york and then they have a designer in europe and then they have like a data person in asia and it's kind of like yeah like that that's the the sort of profile of team that i see these days not like everybody's in miami miami's the new san francisco yeah no that sounds right it does um i mean miami just has such a different vibe than either new york or san francisco like you you import people into miami you don't you don't hire people from miami generally speaking if you're a tech founder so a hot take i will have is that i think magic leap failed because they were based outside of miami burn just uh just one i don't know enough about magically to be able to weigh in there but okay fair enough all right so let's let's get into the meat of it guys um so i wanted to take this get a semi-inaugural episode to look back on all the craziness has happened this year because as as we've been talking about it's been a totally bizarre and wild 2021 so i wanted to look back at biggest wins biggest losses biggest lessons from 2021. so without further ado uh let's get into it the way we're gonna do this is uh we're going to announce the particular um sort of the topic slash competitions like biggest winner biggest loser et cetera and uh we're going to each go around and explain our choice a lot of people in the audience might not know what we're even talking about so explain our choice uh in just a few sentences uh and then we'll go around and uh each share so we'll start with biggest winner who wants to go first biggest winner of 2021. i'll go first i think um when we were doing your reflection for this i think one thing that's always difficult in crypto is to not like you know just choose like okay who like what asset went up the most in price and what went down the most in price because that's obviously like a part of it but it's also part of the story of like product adoption right and like what actually success looks like for some of these these these products and these protocols and so for me biggest winner in in uh 2021 was alternative l ones or different smart contract platforms to ethereum um so obviously people are super excited about um solana and avalanche and luna and those really seem to be um doing well in the in the market but also just in terms of developer adoption but i i even think about stuff like bsc which kind of kicked off the year um as sort of this whole like you know alternative edm chain uh sort of mania kicked off or polygon or even phantom um or you know even increasingly like we see uh you know different exchanges developing their own uh chains and things like that and so i think it you know 2020 was i think all about ethereum and d5 summer and everything was happening on ethereum and this year obviously stuff was happening on ethereum but increasingly it was happening on alternate l1s and so that's kind of been the story in my mind over the past year or so it's just been increasing adoption and traction and also you know price has been part of the story for these other uh smart contract platforms that's a good point i think you i think you covered a lot of ground there actually in uh all the other sorry i imagine there's some no there's some there's just some overlap i think in some other people's uh answers too robert you guys wanna go next i'll go next i i think the biggest winner um is actually publicly traded crypto things um you know i think we're there's two great examples of things that really did not exist in the public eye a year ago but came um into the public eye this year so coinbase and microstrategy i think both have come to the forefront as publicly traded crypto companies that in their own ways are acting as huge legitimizing factors for the space that are creating a lot of awareness from investors that weren't as aware of you know crypto financial markets previously but i think those two in some ways are the biggest winners um and create sort of a winning halo for the rest of the ecosystem i think they're going to set the groundwork for a lot of public companies to follow and if you ask me you know 12 months ago are there going to be like lots of public crypto companies i would have said no not really they're going to stay private for a really long time you're going to see a lot of crypto existing truly only in private markets but if you ask me now at the end of 2021 i think the answer is yeah i anticipate next year the year after the year after there would be a lot more publicly traded and on equity exchanges not on crypto exchanges publicly traded crypto based businesses that are real you know we had long island iced tea blockchain or whatever years ago but they were all you know they were jokes right now we're starting to see overstock.com was a real business true but i think this was where that the public equity markets won by having two flag bearers for the hazard class where do you think that's going to come from do you think it's going to be more like existing public companies adopting you know crypto like block or square um or do you think there's going to be companies going public do you think we're going to see like spot etfs yeah i mean and this also goes to having at least future space etfs and public markets you know i don't want to include that because i think it's more negative than positive at least in a lot of people's minds but i think we're going to see more exchanges go public over time there's a lot of really solid you know domestic and international exchanges that i think have an opportunity to go public over the next two years i think we're gonna start seeing custodians going public over the next two years and i think we're just gonna see a lot of crypto native businesses you know becoming publicly traded instead of existing publicly traded things adopting crypto although visa was a big you know player this year that's already like an extremely large well-known publicly traded company that very seriously has been going into crypto obviously facebook meta has been dabbling for years and years and years but never really went live and so you know i think we're going to see a lot more crypto native businesses go public over the next two years fair enough yeah i think in very robert fashion it's like you're the only one advocating for the tradfi uh companies yeah the rest of us are all picking like random meme coins uh what was your pick yeah so i didn't have one pick i wanted to actually give like a category kind of three things that broadly were like the biggest winners in their category and like they're not comparable in some sense um but i i guess i have a little a tiny different take um on the l1 season um i i actually think that there's this class of l ones that did do well and there's a whole slew of ones that were quite disappointing relative to what they were billed as in 2017 and 18 and maybe in 19. so i think the ones that really stood out the the interesting thing to me was you know the layer one with the hardest on developer onboarding process period uh you know really one which is solana i think you know obviously avax and uh luna had crazy good times too but but solana was really out of the dark i mean in my mind it was always extremely hard to write smart contracts for them you know but they sort of willed their way into into kind of you know winning the all l1 war um the other two i want to mention were of course open c i mean they obviously had kind of this record-breaking year maybe they'll be you know i know it's not exactly robert's tradfi public company pick but they could be very easily in my mind you know one of these public company um picks and you know you you're not successful i feel like at an equity business in crypto if you don't have tons of haters and the fact that they've been vampire attacked should already tell you that um vampire attack refers to basically people dropping a token to your users to try to get them to move to a new platform and the last one i want to say was lido so staking derivatives were you know a theoretical uh murmur uh in in in 2019 you know there are some academic papers written 2020 but in 2021 we got a ridiculous percentage of ethereum and now solana in different staking derivatives and i think that is going to be a really big market uh over the next five to ten years nice those are great choices well so i'll um i'll wrap things up on biggest winners so my i in i wasn't i was a little too non-committal and so i i gave my answer as a tie uh between dogecoin as being one of the biggest winners i don't think originally i had elon musk and i was like well he's one on too many other things so i'll just i'll just put dogecoin instead as being uh the biggest winner in his in his stead um and i mean dogecoin kind of came out of almost nowhere i guess it's always been around it's always kind of been a thing but like the just the absolute staggering levels of demand and excitement around dogecoin just blew my mind um and probably like the one breakout crypto story of the year if there's one from a mainstream perspective it's probably dogecoin um which is which is bizarre to say because of course it's not the largest play market cap but it does feel like it was the you know like the word cloud of crypto this year i feel like dogecoin was the biggest and then um second on winners for the year uh i put kyle simani so not everyone might know who casimani is but uh he is the he is one of the co-founders and managing partners of multi-coin capital which led the seed round and led the series a of solana and so he is now a very very wealthy man and um he uh i i understand that he uh now does all of his uh conference call-ins from his uh from his lamborghini and he's he's just like it's funny because one one of the things i'm i'm going to talk about uh later is about eos and uh he was somebody who the entire crypto community not the entire but many people in the crypto community basically on in 2018 2019 particularly for his call on eos uh and claiming that he thought eos is going to be really successful it was going to be the super high performance level one you know it was going to make these trade-offs around being less decentralized in order to get better performance and eos didn't really become that uh but he took a bet on solano saying like no no no okay but maybe eos wasn't it but solana is going to be it and turned out he absolutely nailed it and solana has been a smashing success and and kudos to him for for sticking it out and believing in his uh thesis so yeah everyone needs a redemption yeah absolutely yeah pound for pound the by far the most successful investor of 2021 i mean i i heard someone uh claim that the solana seed round is the highest irr investment in venture in history i don't know if i haven't checked that number but it could very well be yeah that sounds right that sounds right okay so that's uh biggest winner let's move on uh next up we have best mechanism so this was a uh this was requested by tyrone and so i thought all right why not let's throw it on their best mechanism to roon given that it's your category why don't you take it away for sure yeah so i think um you know there was a very weird website that showed up in in about march uh or april late march early april 2020 um which used a lot of greek language and linguistic uh you know loose linguistic uh technique uh and you know it was completely written about the the temples in greece and you know different types of uh different types of goddesses and gods were associated to the pieces of this protocol but this protocol turned out in spite of the fact that the docs were kind of impossible to read and in spite of the fact that it seemed like it was a scam it turned out to be one of the most successful and most copied and forked smart contracts on ethereum based chains uh a sort of rough quick uh analysis that i did uh showed uniform v2 uh is the most copied contract uh most forked and redeployed contract uh and then synthetics mentor contract is number two now i'm ignoring things like open zeppelins like safe math and stuff because those get inlined and there's all sorts of technical details this is more for for deployed fully deployed contracts um and number three is oh which is this protocol and it really took me at least three or four months to wrap my head around why this thing was able to grow and get forked so much um but you can basically think of it as you know our first step towards a system where a protocol manages its own liquidity by issuing um debt-like instruments to people um and it was a smashing success i mean it's it's there's been you know probably tens of billions of dollars in in the um contracts uh on multiple chains um and so i i think they deserve best mechanism uh i'm working on trying to analyze it formally because i think there's something a lot deeper there that like is a good lesson for people because you know i think there are a lot of other other mechanisms are extremely you know you would think like fixed interest rate loans that maybe would like catch on but none of them have been able to and part of it has to do with sort of some of the things that are hidden within them good mechanism sounds like a detective novel yeah yes yes i i of course have deep inside the olympus dow there is a secret that we're going in that's awesome i like that the hiddens of the temple the hidden secrets yeah it feels like a dan brown uh just like a dan brown novel somewhere in there i like it okay i i'll go ahead uh best mechanism uh i chose esd so actually i just looked up the price last year well no so it was last year but it collapsed this year and then redefined itself so it was actually collapsing right on jan ones when it slipped below 90 cents and so i was like okay you know what i'm gonna count that as this year and um so for those who don't know esd stands for empty set dollar and basically it's it's probably beyond the scope of this podcast for me to explain how esd worked but suffice it to say it was absolutely batshit crazy um it was a stable coin that is kind of sort of stable only if you squint and really believe in it and uh and that's esd it was not it was not stable at all but in a way it was a predecessor i feel like to own and um kind of inspired more of the um modifications around what a stable coin can be and what he means to be a staple coin like for example the the notion that you can call something a stable coin and not have it be worth a dollar i feel like esd invented that and so i think ohm owes a big tribute to esd for the idea of yo we can just call this thing a staple coin even when it's like not stable and not worth a dollar but it kind of aspires in some loose way to be worth a dollar um i thought it was great and i think it also a big part of mechanisms in crypto is teaching and i feel like esd was probably one of the most teachable moments of 2021 uh is teaching people that uh hoping that something is true is not sufficient for actually making it true and that mechanism design really matters i feel like esd i think actually internally at dragonfly for us it was one of these moments where like a lot of people at the firm learned how much mechanism design matters i i as as one of the people at dragonfly who is into esd i will say i think the the spiritual successor to esd is actually axe infinity um because the lesson here is that if the mechanism sucks it doesn't matter as long as you get enough people to believe in it and then you have an amazing warchest that you can use to build something better down the road and i don't know if they actually executed super well on it um on the idea um but they did sort of generate this idea that like you can sort of hype first and and build later and i think that's honestly kind of like what we're seeing now like olympus is now doing like v2 axis working reworking the game like you can sort of build a community and then like get this war chest and then back into something good as opposed to like you know nailing something off the bat and being sort of perfectionist at v1 launch well to be clear esd right now i'm just looking at it has a 2.6 million dollar market cap yes yes i think i think you know there was there was a concept and there was an idea and there was a an execution on the idea but you know the concept is is is what happened fair enough uh tom what's your pick best mechanism uh i forgot we were doing this category but i'm gonna go ahead and say uh unity three i feel like um unity three was hyped and rumored and people all these these sort of uh ideas floating around are like what it could possibly be and i feel like it actually kind of blew everybody's expectations out of the water there was a lot of um fud and a lot of concern and a lot of criticism when i think it first came out but i think as always you can just look at the market and look at the data and see what works and what doesn't work and just empirically univ3 is crushing it uniswap is like running away with the the dex market especially the amm market and certainly you know there's there's some concerns around lp profitability um but i think if anything has sort of you know created this amazing ecosystem around uniswap around like what can we do with this new tool like uh the there's there's teams that are using the univ3 positions to represent options so you can get different or that's like primitive and brahma that do basically like options type type payoffs but with lp positions or people adding you know automated vault managers and so i think like this will just continue to pay you know dividends down you know in future years as we see people uh you know build ecosystems and get really creative on top of univ3 in addition to just providing you know sort of the bare essentials of being a really great you know amm and providing really deep liquidity on chains so um i think univ3 you know the team really crushed it and i think we've just seen it like just do extremely well in the market as well so um that's gonna be my pick solid and robert so i'm gonna go with um a um maybe more controversial but i i think you know in my mind the clear winner uh mechanism design for 2021 which i think is convex finance um this dovetails with i think last year's best mechanism which is v tokens or locking up tokens to vote in a protocol which is coming back into vogue very quickly this year and next year i'd say um but the two of these go hand in hand really well as a combined mechanism so curve is you know a very simple trading protocol and they have a governance token that you can stake for some amount of time to change really like how the liquidity of the different markets evolves what are the incentives to each market therefore how large is these market how liquid is each market convex basically takes advantage of this mechanism design you could say it's cannibalizing it or it's parasitic or it's completely symbiotic or it's completely value accretive to it but what it does is it allows people to exert more control over curves ecosystem and what's incredible about this is this symbiotic relationship has created a massive amount of value for convex as well as curve convex today this is the freak stat which i don't think people appreciate convex today has a higher floating market cap than curve does um as a tool built on top of it which is wild and it's been i think one of the most successful things at um creating an exuberance and you know new experimentation from dozens of other protocols that are now playing in this ecosystem playing in the curve wars through convex it's starting to integrate with lots of other protocols and interesting ways i think convex number one mechanism of 2021. oh yeah i i on the chat someone someone thought i said ohm's number three i i meant home is definitely number one in mind he said ole miss three comma three that's what he said exactly but i will i will i want to give a honorable mention to to robert's point uh abracadabra mim which is basically doing what convex did to many other ecosystems at this point okay let's move on i'm realizing that we're gonna have to move a little bit faster we're gonna get through all these because we've picked a ton okay we're moving on to biggest loser now biggest loser of 2021 tom go uh this would be controversial uh i have bitcoin um bitcoin i feel like has really just fallen out of the conversation um like new people i talked to internet crypto we're about to ask you about bitcoin new investors aren't asking about bitcoin from a price action perspective it has really like just done super poorly i think you know year to date it's done really well because it started so low but in a few weeks time will basically be flat year over year and so i think there's just so much enthusiasm has has left from from bitcoin and it kind of like struggled to sort of figure out a a narrative to define itself now because i think because now it actually has competition right like for the past 10 years or whatever everything else was kind of vaporware nothing else really like you could make promises you could sort of make narratives around things they were working on but bitcoin was bitcoin it had the legacy and it had sort of you know the understanding and now now like and sort of talk about this later like there are really comparing compelling alternative narratives to the bitcoin narrative um and there's a lot more just frankly like things to do that are a lot more encompassing than sound money and i think um that has kind of sucked a lot of the air out of the room uh for for you know uh bitcoin sales that's a that's a bold but very reasonable choice bold choice um i only have one tiny question which which had which was lightning or bitcoin in your mind so this is actually what's weird lightning is actually doing really well i don't know if you've looked at like um lightning channel capacity in bitcoin terms but it's gone crazy over like the past six months um so the thing that like i never thought would happen is happening which is like bitcoin is not done well and lightning is doing super well so it's a very strange sort of yeah world that we're living in right now but um yeah it seems like el salvador has actually been and strike in particular has actually been a big catalyst for that yeah that's what it seems like yeah okay robert biggest loser so this is an esoteric one but i think the grayscale arbitrage trade which was at the heart of a lot of activity in the crypto markets in general it drove huge flows of capital for years and years and years was the biggest loser this year so to walk people through what happened and why this is important there used to be a trust called the grayscale bitcoin trust and this thing for years traded at a premium to the value of the bitcoin that it held because there was really no good way for a lot of people to like buy bitcoin they weren't going on coinbase and buying bitcoin they were like sitting on their e-trade and they were like how do i get bitcoin let me buy the only product that's available through my brokerage account which was like this publicly traded trust and for that reason the trust always traded more than the value of the bitcoin inside well this year it flipped from a premium to a discount and now it trades at a fraction of the value of the bitcoin that holds and this thing has like 15 billion dollars of bitcoin in it and so for years hedge funds were feasting on this mechanism they were basically like subscribing creating new shares of the bitcoin trust and then selling it to retail at a premium taking their money back and doing it again it drove huge amounts of borrowing demand for bitcoin and stable coins and all of these different things so that you could do this trade you know at the end of the day it's one of the like the primary causes of like what was a lot of the borrowing demand in the ecosystem well this year it flipped to a negative and it stayed negative for like a real for the entire year the discount gets worse and worse and worse and all of the different traders that were participating in this trade and had been doing so successfully for years all got smoked on this and it changed i think a lot of the flows of the capital markets of crypto in ways that people notice in ways that people don't notice but underneath the surface i think this was the biggest event of 2021 for you know the crypto native institutions yeah notoriously block a lot of blockfish business was built on the gbtc trade oh and that's the majority almost there right exactly when that when that trade blew up i mean thankfully they've managed to diversify into other sources of revenue but that was a lot of why they could offer really high rates is that they were able to make it up on the other side through doing the gbtc trade so nowaday and it also reflects very much in interest rates as you pointed out this is like you know the the net that you can make on your crypto um is just down a lot more when that trade stopped right when people ask like why does crypto do what it does like this is one of the big you know drivers of what happened everywhere else in the crypto markets was this trade right yeah that's a great that's a great answer very inside baseball but i loved it yeah uh well hopefully someone listening learned one thing there so learned one thing that they couldn't trade on that's exactly what the show is telling you things you can't make money on well actually now you actually can make money on this so if you're naturally long bitcoin and you expect that one day you know the trust is going to get converted to an etf which grayscale has been like publicly like saying they want to do you can sell your bitcoin for let's say you know forty six thousand dollars and you can buy bitcoin for the equivalent of like you know thirty eight thousand dollars in this trust and have more bitcoin wait a discount that high yeah it's like twenty percent yeah i mean i can give you exactly wow it's huge right and so you can basically rotate out a physical bitcoin into trust bitcoin and when it becomes an etf or more freely you know convertible you'll have more bitcoin um you know not many people are not investment advice but not investments obviously but if you feel like becoming extremely sophisticated on how some of these like basis trades work you know someone's loss is someone else's gain groovy okay well my answer is a lot less sophisticated i said biggest loser this year was eos slash block one uh eos i alluded to them earlier as the uh the original darling of multicoin there's dan larimer's uh you know kind of it was his magnum opus i believe was the way he described it um unfortunately eos being the solana before solana uh it didn't really quite work uh it was super janky the economics were a complete mess and it eventually got abandoned by block one in that block one kind of went off to do bullish exchange which is this big crazy exchange that was capitalized with a bunch of the bitcoin on eos balance sheet um and they just kind of were hanging out i don't really know what they were doing um but eventually what happened relatively recently is that so eos contains in it a perpetual block reward for block one as kind of like a thank you and a you know kiss on the cheek from the eos community so thank you for birthing us father and recently eos decided to fork out the blocker award to block one because they felt that they had been abandoned and that block one was no longer holding up their end of the bargain and instead was off you know doing all this financial engineering with bullish exchange and voice and whatever else they're doing um and so block one to be clear still very very rich they own a crapload of bitcoin they're worth i think like two billion or something some crazy amount of money um but i'd say biggest loser this year feels to me like yost one of the only layer ones that feels like somehow managed to avoid all of the lift on their ones this year um i have a very esoteric one so i apologize but please perfect form the number two nft platform in march 2021 what do you think it was after a blizzard foundation number two by volume nifty gateway oh nifty gateway there was nifty gateway but there was actually in nifty had like uh the big bump in like april may i think like in march it was open c and then hen which was uh this open santezos it was 98 of like tesla's activity for like a couple days but the interesting thing about hen was it attracted a completely different type of uh artist that you you had an ethereum um so hen hen was really focused on generative art and on-chain art so like the you know the nft would change itself every time it got transferred or there'd be something uh you know kind of more game-like and they were really at the vanguard of this and then their founder ragequit um earlier this summer and like abandoned all these artists and like how a lot of money that was owed was like stuck in the contracts and like it was a huge nightmare and so now it's like sort of being like revived by the community um but it was kind of a big blow up for the generative art world um and and so you know i think actually one of the catalysts for um moving to like solana and matic for a lot of nfts was was actually hand dying uh because hen was really really a big big source of alternative t-volume hmm that's yeah that is very esoteric um but hen is coming back a lot right i heard that the volumes are actually quite good now yeah yeah yeah the community is trying to take over take the brand back for sure i mean like look other people that you've heard of who are have more marketing behind them like zora and foundation and stuff have less volume than often so it's worth it's worth considering that they're like kind of this weird dark horse that um artists like a lot more they invented the green this green nft yeah steak thing that was their that was their i actually like i feel like tasers like kind of seeded all these like blockchain has this terrible carbon footprint discussion to like push tasers and green nfts which is annoying because then it's like it just becomes this cloud they have to discuss over every other every other blockchain but i guess that's how they get you know carve out their niche right it's like like why why else would you mind at nft on tezos versus ethereum it's like well it's like proof of stake so therefore it's green i guess but even even like that idea is sort of it has to be sort of forced and created enough okay let's move on to biggest surprise so i'll go ahead and start on biggest surprise um so biggest surprise of 2021 for me was the rise of the one-bit pools on uniswap v3 so this was something that like i always thought fundamentally about unit swap the unit swap um so i'm not going to try to explain swap very briefly but with the uniswap v3 you had this ability for different uniform pools to charge different prices um that that basically get collected as a fee for the lps and my assumption had always been that by the nature of uniswap they're not going to be able to charge super super tight fees super small fees for most these markets because uniform just doesn't have enough fine-grained ability to price things really effectively it's just too gas inefficient you know just the natural nature of amms that you need some significant fees to charge in order for the whole thing to work and one bit pools have emerged now on unison b3 they were they were voted in i think originally it was like five bip was that was the smallest uh fee range and they upgraded to now have one bit pools and they're now doing insane amount of volume so i think it's both on stables and also isn't it also on uh um etfcc or something i think it is but i i'm looking at the here i'll look at the site right now i think it's mostly still just stables but that kind of makes sense right um i think it would still be very hard for them to be uh profitable yeah yeah what's your non-stable pair what's the other dominant there was another dominant one-bit pool maybe it's actually come down a lot because people realize they can make money on it okay but then the five bit usdc eth yeah i also found that quite surprising that uh five bips was like a really stable fine if you look at volume outperforms five bips us 30 basis points on the fees you earn yeah crazy absolutely crazy yeah um so that that really blew me away i found that that was definitely not what i anticipated was going to happen uh with the advent of univ3 but um univ3 really proved everybody wrong so incredible stuff yeah that's a good one rob you want to go which category are we on biggest surprise oh my biggest surprise i think biggest surprise was this topic okay i was you know researching one bit pools i was on uniswap.info um the biggest surprise that i had was actually in nft land and there was a couple surprises one is that people 5000 days sold for 69 million dollars and it feels like 20 years ago doesn't feel like 2021 second is board apes flipped punks huge surprise i never would have thought that even a couple months ago right huge surprise i think the floor flipped not the not the aggregate right yeah we're not talking aliens versus you know some names but the floor which most users consider to be the the primary price because for most people that's the on-ramp to the asset right so the floor which is what most people would use to get into the nft flipped um huge surprise mostly due to two extremely different approaches to ip and if you count people it's like a third approach to ip but apes verse is crypto punks really i think explain for people two different approaches one is a very corporate approach we'll call it crypto punks and one is more of a bottom-up approach which is apes still with like a top-down like creation of new assets and community building but one in which you know it feels like you know top-down versus bottom-up and i think it was a primary driver about why this year saw apes exceed punks which i never would have thought at the beginning of the year i never would have thought that larva labs would have been restrictive of ip and tried to monetize it for themselves while apes would give ipv rights to their owners and users as well as lots and lots of air drops of new assets to their owners to make it feel like owning it had like iplus plus plus but in terms of the outcome of these two strategies um i was surprised by the fact that it worked so effectively to take what was the bitcoin of nfts and have the ethereum of nfts flip it i very much agree with you it's surprising and not something i would have anticipated but i don't think it's because of the ip thing um i think it's it's just purely like a like art and sort of like what vein of culture have you tapped into like larval labs i think and i think crypto punks like just aren't don't have that sort of like mainstream accessibility we've seen like obviously some some artist agencies are like pushing you know apes through their uh um you know through their celebrities so like uh athletes a lot of entertainers getting into apes and that sort of becomes a sort of like you know memetic desire thing on top of everything you mentioned around just like engaging more with the community larval labs is like this like orphaned child or uh crypto punks like this orphan child that larval labs just doesn't really want to deal with it seems like but um yeah boo lover labs yeah um so yeah i i agree with you very surprising but i think the ip thing again is like it's an esoteric take it's like crypto people care about that but i think if you go to the board meet up in new york people are like they just think it's cool and they and it's like the artwork is maybe more accessible or more interesting or like more varied and for whatever reason yeah there's probably some random processes to like making it you know more accessible to people you want to go up next big surprise yeah yeah i think that my biggest surprise was sort of uh the luna burn how effective that was um and like how like luna just like you know the soul luna avax uh contingent really sort of bloomed but luna grew in a very different way than solana and um avalanche avalanche and sauna really grew from a ton of yield farms um which are basically places where people could put up assets and earn sort of percentage ownership and use smart contracts that are being built um as protocols luna has very few d5 protocols on it there's very there's very little app activity outside of the main payment transfer and crucially their staking derivative so their staking derivative drives like 60 to 80 percent of the volume um demand for the stable coin that is native to the luna's platform ust and luna had a bunch of apps earlier in the year that had a ton of success and then that kind of got crimped by regulatory stuff like mirror so you i don't know if you even you guys remember this but all the dexes front ends like the official ones removed mirror and uma um because of like the sort of regulatory stuff around synthetics but in spite of that luna building these staking derivatives and building this kind of sort of like almost a little bit like an om style uh liquidity mechanic for borrowing against your steak um really was able to bootstrap like crazy and then they did this burn where they burned a gigantic portion of the supply and historically when chains have done this like stellar did this burn where they burned 50 percent of the lumen supply did not do anything right the luna burn is the er is the exact opposite you know both of them have astronomical names but that's the only thing they have in common so i i think that that's like a really interesting thing of like how staking derivatives can actually bootstrap staking derivatives combined with a burn can like five extra market cap on a on a big cap coin yeah no a pretty incredible success story for token economics being able to really drive the value of uh of a token tom biggest surprise uh i guess sort of going along with robert just like the nft renaissance i think um like the d5 kind of wave and d5 summer 2020 like we kind of felt that it was coming for for a while and we sort of saw this gradual build-up of projects that were building in the space and and developing and it sort of you know it sort of felt like there was there was there was a trajectory behind it i i was looking back before um this this show like okay what were people predicting in 2021 and like what did people miss and basically like obviously people have been excited about nfts for a while you know myself myself included um and sort of investing in in the nft space but no one was really like like and if there's no nft section of people's 2021 you know predictions it was like oh nfts are a thing like maybe they'll people will be into digital art next year and so i feel like and if the nft renaissance and specifically the different waves of it i think just got me by surprise and i got a lot of people by surprise like how mainstream it was um it's kind of a weird idea and like i feel like it's kind of nerdy but um like you know there was sort of that wave in march that was all celebrity driven like nifty gateway like grimes nfts and like that was when it was on snl i was like okay i kind of get that like celebrities want to like sell you know digital representations of themselves that that makes sense but the fact that all these like crypto natives like pfp things have gone so popular um i just would not predict it it's kind of crazy to me that there's people on tick tock explaining how to like set up meta mask and like switch it over to like polygon and then like it's people are really really getting in the weeds with it and it's like very mainstream so i never would have predicted that i think i thought it would have been kind of you know a nifty gateway style forever but um yeah it turns out uh those are 2021 surprise crypto comes at you fast man yeah exchange sooner than you uh than you think they can okay we're running low on time so we're gonna we're gonna skip forward to um best meme so what was the best meme slash moment slash event of 2021. um tom can you throw it can you throw these up on the screen because i think we're gonna we're gonna need yes yes so um rob why don't you go first robbie muted important award category right here this is obviously the most important this is one we're going to we're going to we're going to make a trophy for great meme i love this movie no i don't need an nft of this yeah yeah okay um so i'll i'm going to go first so my pick for best meme was the uh spf sam bankman freed the shoes that he was wearing at the capitol hearing i thought this was absolutely amazing and uh i still i still remember this so this is the look of somebody who they have so much money that nothing matters anymore that is how you tie your shoe when you don't care what anybody thinks other than that you don't want them to shut down crypto those are the shoes of a superhero yeah yeah it's very on-brand yeah all right tom what's you i interpreted this very differently uh my my top meme for 2021 was web3 i think the rebranding of crypto and like cryptocurrency to web3 sort of inadvertently has been super genius like for whatever reason that has sort of made it click for people and now like it feels a little weird to tell people i work in crypto or i'm a crypto investor i think that kind of almost has like a little bit of a strange or negative connotation but you tell people you work in web 3 it's maybe a little bit pretentious but i feel like it sort of made the entire value prop and like the entire ethos of like the whole space click a little bit more for from for mainstream uh even even like sort of you know web to normal tech type people so that's my vote for for best meme actually is like web3 sort of almost sort of supplanting uh uh crypto as like how people refer to everything that's going on in the space that's a good choice i've also noticed that web3 has become much more high highbrow i feel like the greatest crypto crypto sounds like you're trying to get rich quick it sounds like whatever whereas web3 is like no you're trying to remake the web and this new kind of enlightened more socialist image yeah there's nothing better than feel that there's nothing better than venture capitalists saying they're socialists thanks to web3 like that's the ultimate 3d chess oil escher impossible staircase move it's true and it's it's a little bit more inclusive right it's like you get the nfts you get the file sharing you get the decentralized twitter like you know it's weird to call like like file coin like cryptocurrency it's like well kind of but also kind of not not really so yeah i feel like aoc does not like crypto but she does like web3 yeah it's a good work it it it expands the tempo you know allows us to bring in so actually i just have a question of a nuts right i always just thought gavin wood came up with it for describing polka dot but never marketed it that way because it's the web 3 foundation right they they actually had the term way way back five years ago five years ago but someone then and i suspect it's uh you know a16z plus a couple other people who are doing more like lobbying stuff in congress uh but like someone revitalized it and ripped out the polka dot part and said like everything else like nfts equals web 3 not polka dot and i thought that was also there's some like interesting dynamic there of like how did that transition happen because polka dot had had that name forever and they were hitting the circuit really hard being like this is the new internet this is decentralized web in like the bottom of the bear market and no one gave a like literally zero people gave a about that narrative then and somehow now nft has made it like tangible i couldn't tell you but i i'd love to see some sleuthing on where exactly the web 3 term got popularized from 8 16 z four characters that's the answer probably probably true uh what's your pick uh you know in in in my uh camaraderie with the omi is it's three three but i think the best moment for 3-3 was when grimes after the elon musk separation thing and elon musk was like nft suck he she just like posted this tweet 3-3 and i thought that was that was like that was the meme of the year for me yeah i'm going to go with the real counterculture picks right here i think all the dog coins not dogecoin but all of the fly by night like pop up for a week dogs named after elon musk named after some other meme the recursivity of these memes with the dog coins has gotten so deep that i think they went just in terms of total amount of energy captured by the retail public these worthless pointless dog offshoot of dog offshore of dog coins i think one just based on their prevalence and the amount of market caps that they created off of absolutely nothing but me uh this year like the fact that sheba is what floki and all of these things are what they are i hate it i think it's dark it's depressing it goes against everything i like and believe in in crypto but the crazy ass dog coins i think we're the best meme this year a choice solid choice okay in the very short time we have left let's do rapid fire 2022 predictions so i'll go first i'll just listen through my predictions for 2022 one the game five bubble pops two we get a d5 bull market again three i think we're going to see synthetic assets actually start to work in d5 for those who don't know synthetic assets are assets that are tracked the price of some underlying real asset like you know the s p 500 or something like that um and then lastly i think we're gonna get a spot bitcoin etf those are my predictions for 2022. tom what are you uh i got dow boom i think constitution dial was just the beginning i think people are going to figure out how to make crowd funding and daos work well and make it work super simply and we're going to see dows go out and doing more real world things and buying stuff so i think that's going to be a thing um i think crypto native gaming is going to kind of replace game phi like kind of stuff like dark forest where it's like you're using a blockchain to do game mechanics and pvp and like you know you're playing something through like a smart contract as opposed to just like taking items and put them on a blockchain i think um we're gonna see more stuff like that anything identity um a lot of teams working on different ways are sort of you know now that people are actually doing things on chain those real economies and you know people trading nfts like finding ways to sort of tie identity into what you're actually doing on chains so i think that's going to be more of a thing going forward in 2022 and beyond okay tyrone predictions uh yes so yeah to tom's uh point on dallas i think dallas purchases will get wilder than they were this year you know like the uh tom robert iron pleaser now and you know you know it's kind of crazy that that was march where we were like trying to negotiate buying wu-tang from the government uh but you know i think it's going to be like 10 times crazier like a sports team maybe a tiny nation i don't know that that one might be a little bit harder but i think there's going to be some very very crazy purchases over the next 12 months um by collective units and uh i think privacy preserving their twos are going to have a moment uh because i think bootstrapping something like tornado chain is kind of hard uh getting a lot of liquidity getting like kind of the mechanism working um and there's clearly a demand for a tornado on eth so i think that there will be demand for such solutions but i think it'll be easier to do it as a privacy preserving layer too and there's a bridge from multiple chains to it and things like aztec and stuff you know have been making some crazy strides uh very impressive on the zk side i think that was like the biggest surprise for me how far aztec has gotten um i think there's gonna be a hundred million dollar plus hack on solo and avex i'm just calling that as the one so live at the application layer or at the protocol saloon solutions which sounds like a really bad uh poorly made uh coveted vaccine but uh that's true but uh you should call it sla i feel like it's a good acronym we gotta start popularizing uh i i think on the application layer i i think like we're overdue for some some big hacks there there's just too much money sitting in these unaudited yield farms on those that like that can't last forever um nft finance is gonna have its moment people borrowing against their nfts getting leverage on their nfts i think fractional obviously having such a big year was the first part of that but like that is going to expand into other types of financial products uh and i think blockchain gaming thumbs down most game fight i don't think you survive sorry i think like i think there will be games that are made i just don't think they're going to be this like you know softbank throws two billion dollars at something and like it like becomes popular shots fired by softbank if you're out there please sponsor our show all right robert last word 2022 predictions so i think 2022 is the year that we get crypto native legislation in the united states where we have two houses of congress and an executive branch that ratify legislation around crypto doesn't mean it's going to be huge doesn't mean it's going to create clarity in all different ways but i think we're going to get um real crypto legislation um in 2022 i think that we've reached the boiling point i think they're starting to be an awareness i think they're starting to be a conversation entering the national stage where i think 2022 is the year that we start to see some real legislation and you think the legislation is going to be good or bad or neutral could be either could be both but obviously i'm hopeful that it's come on today robert this is 22 predictions yeah good batter or do you think that there's going to be legislation all right you're not invited back to the next one robert um all right i think that's i think i think that that's true it is a doubt we gotta put up to your vote yeah um all right well guys uh this was a lot of fun thank you to laura for having us and thank you all of you for for listening uh i think that's it for us you'll see us in in the new year in 2022 and uh we look forward to djing with with the rest of you but uh thanks for having us salunavex everybody everybody
