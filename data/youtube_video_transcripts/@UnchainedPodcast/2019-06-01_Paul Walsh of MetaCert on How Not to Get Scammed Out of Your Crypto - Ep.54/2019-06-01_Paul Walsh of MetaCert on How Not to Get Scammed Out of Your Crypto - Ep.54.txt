today's guest is Paul Walsh the founder and CEO of crypto security company mega cert should I call it a crypto security company oh that's ok security company in the crypto world security company it's all good well welcome to the show Paul thank you pleasure to be here is it what is the problem in crypto that you're trying to solve cybersecurity and it's white a sense but very specifically word I see a world where you feel safe opening a link so how do you know that but is not a malicious but how do you know the application is not malware how do you know the website is not a phishing site and how'd he know that the website really oh is owned by Laura shin how do you know the Twitter account is not a fake account or a malicious but also and how do you know the website is not going to mine mineral cryptocurrency by hijacking your CPU through your computer or your mobile device so these are all the kinds of questions that people ask themselves every day before opening a link or unfortunately for some people after they've opened a link and so meta sort does is it has a cyber threat intelligence system which is basically a massive database of the world wide web split into 65 categories and the categories that we care most about our websites and you are eyes to Twitter accounts and other social media accounts we care about whether they're classified as malware phishing xxx crypto mining and so on and what's a URI I know what a URL is but I don't know what a URI is so URI is a a link and a URL is a type of URI so a URI the last bit just stands for identifier so you or I could be when you're inside a Twitter application you click on a link and it opens up the Facebook application so that's called a deep link I'm in the iOS world but it's also called a URI a URI could also be a MAC address or an IP address or other type of link that you would open up without thinking about it so a URL goes to a web page whereas other types of you or eyes could go to other kind of applications and BOTS or IOT devices or an API sorry I used to using the term URI and we can say URL to keep things simple even if it doesn't mean it restricts the kind of links that we talked about no no that's fine now that we've defined it but and keep going all right you were saying something more about you know how you define these divided and categorize these your eyes etc not all security companies have their own threat intelligence system only a few of the security companies have them the other security companies would license the data owned by the security companies that do have them and meta starts just happens to be the world's most advanced classification platform with the world's biggest database of classified content and to put the numbers into perspective Open DNS which is a very respectable DNS service which protects people from malicious links they've categorized just over 2 million domain names into 65 categories and medicine has categorized over 7 million unique domain names just for pornography alone and then you know more than 60 categories on top of that so that's at the heart of meta cert as a security company is that cyber threat intelligence system and then we have a number of security products that people use to protect themselves or their communities from malicious attacks so one good example specifically within the crypto world is we have a security application for slack we really recently launched a security bought for telegram and we have a number of browser extensions so in 2017 phishing insights slack was an extremely serious problem for most crypto communities and very quickly they installed our security application and it was almost like turning off the tap in that it significantly reduced the number of phishing right across the industry in fact for the communities that install the application it was like turning off a top literally but at the time before some communities got a chance to install our application they started to migrate to telegram where there were no phishing scams and at the time I predicted and said look at guys either stay inside slack and install metasearch or when you go to telegram at some point you will become a phishing target because the bad guys will move to the platform of least resistance and now in 2018 we're finding that you know we don't read about phishing inside slack anymore and now we're reading about it inside telegram and other platforms so more recently we launched a bought four telegram and what it does is it takes about three seconds to install for a group administrator and then it listens in the background to every link posted to the group and it doesn't do anything until it finds a phishing link and then as soon as it spots that it sends an alert to the group to say hey beware don't click on the link that's a phishing link and then people are less likely to fall for a phishing scam and then the browser extensions are actually twofold one is to add a utility and the second was a social experiment and the utility is you install the extension for Firefox or Chrome and it does two things it blocks phishing websites and also fake social media accounts but then the most important thing is it actually turns our shield from black to green whenever you visit a verified crypto website or social media account because the problem is that consumers are looking for the green padlock in the tool bar of the browser and unfortunately they're falling for phishing scams because there are certain companies that issue though those ssl certificates for free and the the process is automated and there's one company in particular that has issued over 20,000 ssl certificates to domain names with the term paypal in it and so consumers are falling for phishing scams because they're looking out for the green padlock that is only a measure of encryption it's not a measure fortress store authenticity or domain name ownership and so by installing our browser extension kryptonite whenever you visit a crypto website the shield will turn from black to green so that even if there are new phishing websites out you'll know that you're on a safe website or even a safe social media account whether it's Twitter LinkedIn Facebook github you know when it's green you're safe and the reason that was a social experiment was because we wanted to see if people would really rely on that shield instead of certificates and they are not only our users coming to us asking about specific websites that are not verified we now also have exchanges and wallets from around the world coming to us asking to be verified because their community members are not logging into their website because of the shield staying black and that kind of leads me on to where medicine is heading which is we're moving that entire cyber threat intelligence system to the blockchain and that was a decision we didn't make lightly it took us probably at least six months to make that decision last year in 2017 people would come to us and say why don't you decentralize meta cert why don't you decentralize your database why is it centralized why should we trust meta cert as a security company why should we trust McAfee or semantic or Verisign and some people were nice about it how full saying hey dude we think this is an amazing idea what do you think and then other people who are kind of more right-wing and open-source extremists who think everything should be free and everybody should use open-source no matter what the repercussions are and so we kind of we thought about it over a period of about six months we engage with community critics and got their feedback and then we came to the conclusion that actually we need to move this entire system and open it up on a new kind of protocol decentralized trust and reputation for the web and the reason we thought it was a good idea was because we couldn't possibly scale the very creation of every crypto size and social media account and then scale that to the web beyond crypto there's no way we could and you know various honor Symantec couldn't possibly scale that either and so by opening it up on a blockchain introducing a reputation score and a token that incentivizes good behavior it's actually possible because I've been around the web since the 90s when I worked at AOL and I was part of the team that launched technologies like AOL Instant Messenger 56k modem speed and a bunch of other technologies and I built my first website in 1996 and between then and now it hasn't really been possible to crowdsource trust and reputation particularly if you want to classify websites for phishing because how do I know Laurie Sheehan isn't submitting this website as a phishing site when in fact it could be a competitor of hers so kind of get that right has been difficult to impossible there are some open source lists out there that do okay but they're not fantastic and by being able to use the ethereum blockchain in a reputation score which is based on you know how many websites or accounts have you submitted how many of those were accepted how many were not accepted by the community and then by offering a token we can then incentivize and reward people to add to that database and kind of just finish off on that point imagine a world where you're using either kryptonite or parental control application or an extension that highlights fake news imagine if you could submit or validate websites or social media accounts or BOTS or applications that end up being used by those tools to improve the protection that you're looking for and then at the same time you get paid in tokens so that's kind of we have a self-contained economy this whole thing is extremely fascinating and you just said so many things and I have so many additional questions I actually want to go back a little bit because I started asking what problem it is encrypted that you're trying to solve and you listed a whole bunch of problems you know it's like the fishing links the fake accounts on social media just whether or not URLs for wallets and exchanges aren't legit things like that do you have any stats on how big the problem in general of security and crypto or fake accounts and security or fake accounts in crypto is or fake you are eyes hi oh I should have written this down because I've written about it so many times and medium I believe the latest report from Ernst & Young was about a hundred and fifty million dollars a month being lost through fishing but I would have to double-check on that so it is significant we hear about hacks in the industry all of the time because they're big-ticket items they're big headline items but actually the number one problem within the crypto world is phishing scams because it's less money but more people losing it and some of the hacks actually start with a phishing scam but you don't hear about the phishing scam so one example is it's not just the crypto teams themselves that are now a target it's the suppliers that they use and now hosting providers or find themselves on the end of that attack we're a member of a staff member at a hosting provider has had their account compromised through a phishing scam so that the bad actor can access the DNS records of a specific crypto company and then change the DNS records so that they can actually send people directly to the legitimate website where when the input the wallet address it's actually going to the wrong place oh well so you mean like the web hosting company like if I'm a crypto company and have a website hosted somewhere then the attacker goes to that company and it changes the website through through someone who works there exactly I mean I could summarize the problem that we solve in the crypto world is we help prevent people from losing their money and we also help crypto teams from reducing the risk of their end users their communities from losing so unfortunately some crypto teams are better better than others I spoke on a panel recently and then attended a panel after that and I listened to a couple of people who launched crypto last year and they just seemed to be very laissez-faire about the fact that their communities lost some money and they and they didn't refer to investors or enthusiasts losing their hard-earned money in their savings they actually refer to those circumstances as lost investment lost opportunity and that's not how I look at it so but most companies aren't like that so we work with a lot of crypto teams to first of all help them understand how they can reduce the risk of their themselves being compromised through social engineering how they can improve their own personal security and so that they become less likely to be hacked or socially engineered and then also help them understand how to protect their communities and social engineering is sort of like this way of hacking without actually using fancy computer skills it's just getting somebody to believe that you are someone that you are not or something like that it's like it's like calling up a customer service agent and being like I'm Paul Walsh but it's actually me and convincing them that I am Paul Walsh and then getting them to you know do something that gives me your access to your funds exactly you actually wrote you wrote one of the best articles I've ever read on this subject and actually you may or may not have realized it but social engineering is the technical term given to one example of your SIM card being hijacked or sim splitting as it's called so nuts importing to a different network but it's where somebody pretends to be you calls your cell network provider like t-mobile and then gets a new SIM card with your phone number and then they'll go to Gmail or another account and do a password reset and of course the password reset code is not going to you because your phone number doesn't work anymore and it goes to them yeah I wouldn't article on that and the sad thing is it's still going on it is but t-mobile is good doing a lot in that space right now thankfully with 18 T but not before being taken to court by an individual who believes that they're responsible for it Oh interesting recently I huh I know a lot of the victims were thinking about doing a class-action lawsuit and I said to them hey if you ever you know file this like you should reach out to me but they never did so I don't know who that individual is I guess if somebody who wasn't in that group um one of the pages we actually could sorry Laura we actually got a call from the t-mobile CEOs office shortly after that because we actually put out a call also just like you we wrote a medium post after that legal case started and said if anybody wants financial aid to take t-mobile to court medicine will actually help fund your legal aid as a result I'm not saying that resulted in them working with AT&T to do a new campaign and changed her practices but hopefully it would have contributed a little bit Oh interesting I don't know if it has any but I have been written about I feel like somebody should Chronicle someone or some obscure publication somewhere wrote about it I believe maybe other mainstream did but I got it through Google Alert interesting yeah if I were still writing I would I would jump on that because back when I wrote that story it was a little bit amazing it was completely clear that they had gotten these calls for months from desperate crypto people and I'd like totally ignored them and then the second a reporter called then they like that so the the when I wrote the story the person who had most recently had their phone hijacked who was the first person I found out about because I named that person in my query in my first query to them that person got their phone number back faster than anybody else never had there were people who had been trying to get their phone numbers back for months months had been completely ignored suddenly everybody's cases were going like to the president's office and like they were being told like call the president directly if you ever have this problem and stuff like that and like they were just so scrambling when I read that start was really kind of crazy to watch but anyway I actually wanted to just make a comment earlier which is that I think that what you are describing here in terms of the problem and how you're going about solving it I I sort of feel like what the fishers and these scammers are taking advantage of is that there's this moment in time where this phenomenon of crypto or or just the interest in crypto has taken off but it really requires a shift in how people treat their money right in terms of security because normally we're used to thinking oh the bank is going to keep it secure but in this case obviously especially and if you're working with us and then to decentralize manner then you are responsible for your private keys and it really requires that change in behavior and a lot of people may have gotten in because they want to get rich quick and whatever and they may not be thinking about their security practices and I feel like you know just while we're making this transition to this new form of money that does require a different mindset I feel like they know that like you know probably the window is only a few years is gonna be open a few years before people realize like oh I need to do different things or before there are good solutions to preventing these sort of attacks from succeeding and medicine is a great example of a company that now has pivoted and is helping to to fill that need but actually then that's the perfect segue to my next question because you guys did not start out as a crypto focused company so how did you get into this business in 2017 Matt from singular DTV reached out to me and said we have this phishing problem in the crypto world is this something that you can help us address and at the point at that point in time we were simply the number one security company for messaging platforms because a number of years ago we predicted that if people are reducing the reliance on email in favor of messaging platforms such as slack and HipChat and Skype and messenger then it stands to reason that the cyber will migrate from email to messaging platform so we focused on that and we doubled down on that and we had customers and still have like 80 at NTT Security f5 IBM sage s ap a lot of companies install metasearch to protect their companies when using platforms like slack and HipChat and when we looked at the crypto world they thought oh my word we've gone from predicting this is going to be a problem at some point to the houses are on fire literally because of a flood point I knew what blockchain and Bitcoin was of course but I was not I'll be totally honest with you I was not a cryptocurrency enthusiast I didn't even know what aetherium was truth be told and I was absurd and this was last summer like the summer 2017 yep 2020 17 just before the summer and at this point for example inside slack when you install our security app it listened to all of the links inside the public channels because we didn't think for a second that an attacker would think about or use the incoming Web Hawk API or direct messages or the slack but reminder system and that's what was happening so even though we had a great product they we didn't have a product fit for the crypto world so we doubled down on that for three months because what happened was I remember very specifically one night late at night I was inside a community that invited me and they bite the team and I witnessed a number of scams happening live in the channels where people literally were complaining that they just lost all of their life savings and then I started to get direct messages when they realized that I was in the security world but medicine wasn't installed in there and I had conversations with one particular guy in Mexico who just lost $20,000 and it was his entire life savings that he invested in this cryptocurrency and I knew then at that minute that I wanted to address this issue because you know solving the problem for IBM or sage from a compliance perspective wasn't the same as solving the problem for a real individual in real time and then they started to install Metis art I could literally see people say in the channel oh my word I was about to click on that link until I saw the alert from metasearch and then we knew ok this is definitely going to be a bigger problem moving forward as crypto evolves and it grows over time and we just have to try and solve this issue and that's that's how we got involved in crypto and so what did what is that what do these attacks look like you sort of kind of glossed over this you you said something about like using the slack bot reminder and then something about API is like so what are these attackers doing so they would set up it's technically impossible for the community administrator or owner to disable the slack bot inside slack and an attacker would set up an account and then they would set up a reminder to send a reminder to every single person in the community to say don't forget about our magic airdrop or special offer or whatever it is and they would hyperlink the text to a phishing site which is a web site impersonating the crypto currency and then when they log in they're asked for their private key and then they lose all of the crypto assets and that was happening literally every five minutes and just what what triggers the slack bot reminder like how would it is it just you just send it up it takes five seconds you can go into it's like community right now and you do like a slash slack bot reminder five minutes and ten seconds and put it on repeat and then it'll send a message to everybody that you've directed it to if you've said do this in a channel then it'll send it to the channel and keep sending or you could pinpoint specific people by direct message and the way that they would like entice people to click on the links was sort of like saying you're gonna get free money if you do this and like there's this you know you had to do it now or there's this time window before which like you won't be able to get these free coins stuff like that exactly exactly and one of the things that I say to crypto teams and I don't know how much they listen to this I empathize with the need for marketing and time-sensitive promotion in order to get the momentum going in your project but it needs to be balanced with the fact that we're creating this world where we're encouraging people to quickly click links log into websites to get this special offer that they need to get now and they're not thinking straight especially when it's on a mobile phone they just happen to I don't know why but people just happen to trust links more than if it's sent by you know email on your computer you're less likely to believe it if it's coming from your bank but when it's coming from a crypto team they're used to them saying you know get it now and so they're just kind of just used to opening links very quickly without thinking and it's not it's not dumb people falling for these as a lot of people say a lot of smart people for phishing scams because they could be you know no thinking about it or whatever the circumstances are I would never make fun of anybody falling for a phishing scam yeah yeah I've interviewed some of these people so we're gonna and I agree with you they're not idiots in fact there are people who know the rules but one of them was like oh I did it on a morning when I was a little bit hungover we're gonna discuss more around your customers who the scammers are and also how you plan to decentralize this solution but first I'd like to take a quick break to

and how many users like everyday users you have signed up for for meta cert within the crypto world specifically some customers include big chain DB Ocean protocol Mercury protocol costs Raven protocol enigma and a Hello gold and quite a lot of communities actually would install our software either for slack and more recently telegram and the number of people that we protect in the crypto community specifically would be over two hundred and fifty thousand so meaning those are people who have downloaded the extension or those that's the number of people across all those communities that's well first of all it's the number of I would say over two hundred thousand people across the communities who've installed either slack or the telegram bought the telegram but was released end of March and after about a week it's been installed in at least 15 communities that we know about and some of those communities would have over 30,000 members and just so I understand how this works you are just putting all the sketchy URLs in a database or so like it doesn't it require isn't it sort of a little bit more like whack-a-mole where this scammer gets a link out there and somebody may fall victim to it and then you add it to your database and prevent others from falling victim to it or can you be more preventative than that all of these all of the above actually fishing is like playing whack-a-mole but come back to it it's not just a simple blacklist we have an extraordinarily advanced threat intelligence system I'm one of the two people that co instigated the creation of the w3c standard for URL categorization and the w3c is the internet it's the standards body for the worldwide web that was started and still run by Tim berners-lee and I did that in 2000 for and it became a ratified standard in 2009 and replaced an old standard called picks which is still used in part by Apple parental controls and internet explorer so I've been working on the whole content labeling URI categorization since 2004 and that platform that cost about a million dollars in about two and a half to three years to build and tweak to get it to where it is today which is why it's very easy and quick for us to build applications on top like a telegram bot or you know a Skype but because of the backend technology so we also we do with fishing specifically we take a feed from nine different open source lists we put that into our database in machine readable format and then we add to that all of the suspicious links that are reported and validated by all of the people across all of the communities and then inside our own slack we actually have data scientists from some of the biggest security companies in the world reporting to us on a daily basis many dozens of new crypto phishing websites so there's a number of different ways for us to add specifically phishing websites and fake social media accounts to our database but that's why I go back to the so that they added to that adds a lot of value to the telegram and slack BOTS but that's what that's why we also encourage people to install kryptonite for their browser because even if we don't catch the fit yet because even if we don't catch the phishing site then at least if it's not green you know that you should go and look for more information before you can trust the website or social media account that's where we think the future is it's not just necessarily creating black list but just providing more information about the content and providing better visual indicators so I would like to see brave Chrome Firefox Safari and opera provide a different visual indicator provide a different icon on the toolbar so that they can read the information from the medicine or protocol or other protocols that are created in the future so that they can actually provide users with more information about the content before they open it so this would be the perfect segue to finding out how you to centralize but before we get to that I'm just so curious to know have the scams changed over you know you've been working this for almost a year now so I was just curious to know how the scams changed in any way or is it kind of just the same thing over and over again and just in different applications I would say yes and they're getting a little bit more sophisticated they moved from platform to platform in 2017 it really was almost like turning off the tap for phishing inside slack because so many communities installed our security app that we just didn't read about it anymore and in fact actually do you remember when you and I had a conversation you said Paula not really hearing about too many scams anymore and that's because we were installed in so many communities and then those communities that weren't installing mediscare they had already migrated to a different platform and I predicted back then that these scams would move to whatever platform didn't have security and long behold never seen more scans and telegram because nobody had built it but designed for the crypto world to protect them from phishing but is there any change other than just moving from platform to platform well they're doing that but then I guess the change is they're becoming a little bit more sophisticated they're spending more time as these attacks on crypto get more media attention as crypto gets more media attention through news about regulation and companies raising large sums of money then the cyber criminals spend more time if they know that there's a housing estate going up and they don't yet have alarms installed or they've never actually bought a house before so don't have to protect them then the cyber criminals will go directly to that housing estate & tack the houses that have the least amount of security and we're hearing about kidnappings we're hearing about blackmail I think blackmail is going to be a big problem where crypto team members or high-profile enthusiasts will be targeted through spyware and malware through applications or BOTS or websites then either their video or their sound will be compromised and this all sounds like double-oh-seven stuff but it's really not this is stuff that's happening and will happen more their sound or video will be compromised they'll be recorded saying or doing things that they'd rather not be recorded at that and then they'll be blackmailed through a cryptocurrency that can't be tracked so the attacks are becoming a little bit more sophisticated the social engineering is on the rise that's becoming a little bit more sophisticated and I think you know 2018-2019 it's just going to get more advanced and more prevalent it's going to become exponential as I predicted in 2017 yeah well definitely the physical attacks have been increasing even if it's it kind of sporadically and a lot of it is abroad Nathaniel popper wrote an article about that for the New York Times and Mike Bell she and I discussed it in a recent episode so people should listen to that but so now let's get to how you plan to decentralize your network this is very interesting to me how will that work will users just add to the database or and then get paid every time they spawn a phishing link or how does that work think of our threat intelligence system as not just a list of phishing sites but as a huge look up because we've categorized over 10 billion you are eyes into 60 between 60 and 65 categories where phishing is one of those so when we pick that up and put it on the blockchain and we create a smart contract we're working with in partnership with consensus so we're supported by consensus they're helping with the token economics and other mechanisms in other areas of the token economy so imagine a world were through kryptonite or one of the BOTS or somebody else's application you can submit a website or submit information about a website whether it's fishing trip lex sports religion if it hasn't previously been classified you can submit it and then other people will validate that and through the reputation score of each of the individuals we will then that's it the Ichi War I will be classified so let's take a sports website for example when one person submits that then it might take two people to validate it or three people to get the consensus and then once it's validated each person gets paid in tokens if it's something like xxx or phishing or malware or another link that adds a little bit more utility to society then it may require more people to do the validation work and in the case of phishing it may require one or two experts to actually evaluate and validate the submission and we just happen to have people who were passionate about different types of data sets and you know when it comes to submitting and validating xxx for example we have a number of parental controls we have safe browsers for iPad and Chrome but we haven't updated them in many years because we focused on messaging platforms and they have probably a about a hundred thousand active users and throughout the years we've had parents submit websites to us but the technology can automatically identify xxx and if it doesn't identify it automatically it then puts it into review queue so we have over we have about a million domain names in our review queue there's no way medicine could actually go through that and valuate what category website each one is so by putting it out onto the blockchain everybody can come pick domain names to validate and then you get that consensus algorithm going on and people get rewarded in tokens how do you prevent what we're seeing with these pump-and-dump groups where maybe I'm a scammer and I create a phishing link and then I get all my buddies who are in on the same scam to then validate it as legitimate on your site and then we all earn tokens from meta cert plus we earn all the tokens that gets said to that phishing link and then I you know divvy it up amongst everyone how do you prevent something like that well first of all it's not easy but let me story to demonstrate the history that we have and the experience that we have not just with categorization on the web but actually human behavior from many different facets imagine where we have parental controls where kids are submitting when when you try to access at a xxx website using the safe iPad browser for example you get a block site saying that you're not permitted to access that website but you can report it as a false positive imagine the amount of kids that would continuously report the same web sites as false positives when clearly they're not clearly they're trying to unblock websites they'd like to visit and so as a team we got together and said okay how can we reduce the number of times that our databases opening up these false positives so we put in some business logic and checking so that if you try to submit a website that was previously validated after it was reported as a false positive you then get a message to say thank you very much but we've already evaluated this and we really believe it really is pornography if you still think it's a false positive for it our website that shouldn't be classified then please open a ticket so you still leave it possible for them to get in touch but you make it a little bit more difficult so we used to that kind of human behavior trying to be a little bit malicious or a Koi when it comes to fishing there are a number of different things that I can't go into detail on obviously for security reasons but we do want to open it up in as much as possible so that the community participates in you know what that validation looks like but well let's say actually that okay yeah because it doesn't sound very decentralized then it sounds like the ultimate kind of backstop will be this centralized service it's like just a portion of the of the process will be decentralized no so well there's there's always it's like if you ask me how do we handle security and privacy I'll give you some vague answers I can't go into detail obviously for security reasons so this service is decentralized the trust and reputation is decentralized but just of the cogs and wheels you don't necessarily have to open-source every piece of the code to let people understand how the interests intricacies work so for example to answer your question very directly if you submit a website the people the websites that are reviewed by the community are randomized so you can't get ten friends to validate the same link because when they log into their dashboard they may or may not get the websites that you've submitted for evaluation and validation they may get an entirely different set of your eyes to validate and then there will also be the ability for us to record the historical data so there'll be a ledger an audit trail of who validate who submitted what who validated what what is the web between what is the relationship between submitters and validators and there will be ways to see patterns and you know the relationships between the first group and then the validators the metadata not not the physical relationship between you and somebody that you might know but you know if there's a pattern where every single link that you submit is validated by a guy called Chris and he happens to say that you're correct in every one of your validations but other people ended up end up disputing those because once something is validated other people can still dispute those and that's where the token comes in in order for you to submit validate or dispute you have to stake some token you have to put in some skin in the game and so you've got an added incentive to not try to be malicious because if other people dispute and then their disputes are validated then you lose that token but when everybody agrees then everybody gets paid in token okay so the scammer would basically lose money in order to try to make the scam work and then it might sort of defeat the purpose of the scam entirely exactly okay exactly and then also we just happen to have people who are about different data so one example to demonstrate a point about the data imagine a world where advertisers and platforms could use the medicine protocol to avoid placing ads on fake news websites and undesirable websites while at the same time targeting websites by category type on a granular level that's one use case of the medicine protocol now that's not one that we're particularly passionate about but that's an application that may or may not be built in the future the areas of concern that we're really interested in are the following protecting people from phishing we happen to have hundreds of thousands of people who are using products that protect them for phishing so imagine medicine with the products they're just a customer of the protocol so medicine or protocol is a new entity that for the purpose of building the medicine or protocol met assert with those security products is just one customer we will encourage other people to build competing products other security BOTS and applications or other applications we haven't thought about we just happen to have good use cases to demonstrate how the protocol can be used through applications and so we already have people within three days of opening up our own telegram group we are we had 3,000 people come into the telegram group all very enthusiastic because they all came from our products they all came in knowing that oh if I submit links for phishing that means I'm gonna get paid and meta token and then the same phishing links are gonna be used to protect me from phishing links so I'm gonna get paid to protect myself and it's in my best interest not to try and submit bad links because then I'm not going to be protected or I'm gonna be blocking myself from innocent websites now copy and paste that to brand protection when it comes to verified accounts and then also parental controls or news reputation we happen to have products for each of those areas of concern with enough end users and customers to know that there's a real need to solve those problems and people who will be able to get involved on day one and just so I understand so I get how I can earn tokens it's by maybe I don't know about submitting but definitely verifying or validating and then how do i suspend them like what would i spend these tokens on first of all you'd be able to unlock or subscribe to meta cert services in a way that wouldn't have been possible in the past also we're working in partnership with a number of companies I can mention one of those and that's rocket chat rocket chat is the biggest open-source messaging platform that's a competitor to slack and they are going to integrate the medicine protocol together we're going to build an open-source security module so all of their customers guess the option to click a button and then get anti-phishing security or security against other malicious links and they've also agreed to adopt our token to incentivize people in their world to submit and validate links that they care about and there's a couple of other platforms that are more abstract than that that will adopt the protocol and the token but I can't mention those at this time but we envisage a world where it's not just people who use tools on top of the protocol built by medic tools and applications built by other companies that will use the token to incentivize their economy and there's many different ways to use the token within a household if they're using whether it's parental controls or in use credibility software or anti-phishing add-on so basically I can either use it within the system maybe to like I don't know what you mean by parental controls but maybe it's like someone who wants to kind of like you yeah I still don't fully understand how I would spend it within the system like I could see earning it and then just you know converting it to eath or something but like I don't understand okay so you're a parent and you pay $12.99 a month dollars for parental controls whether it's a browser add-on or a DNS service and in order to offset the cost of that you get a choice to pay in tokens our tokens and to offset the cost of that you may want to submit or validate links that are used to improve the software while at the same time reducing or negating the cost of the software but then maybe and I'm not sure you know I maybe you'll be able to give your kids tokens that they can then use for accessing the web for a certain number of minutes in the day okay yeah that okay now now I see that makes sense and one other thing I wanted to ask you about is so so just so I understand this is going to be a decentralized protocol that is for detecting false links or or scammy or phishing links and different companies can build services on top of that and then charge or have their users earn tokens through that but no one company will control this this protocol is that correct yeah but not just fishing people will be able to submit and validate information about websites bots applications and social media accounts it's any web resource so you may want to submit or validate ownership of a particular Twitter account or a particular Facebook account or LinkedIn or bought or application and that goes into one big database it's not necessarily just phishing or pornography or other categories it's basically a big Whois database with more information than what you would get in the Whois database and information that's validated or at an IMDB for the web where you can find out information about the website owner the social media account owner is suitable for children is it suitable for mobile phones is it phishing and then other companies you could be an ISP public Wi-Fi hotspot bihter router a browser company you would want to use that Medus or protocol in order to be able to protect people or highlight information on the web when people use your products and services well this this is pretty all-encompassing one other thing I just realized is it sounds like this can also be used for the what what we're currently seeing and in the crypto space which is that a lot of the social media accounts for various I guess crypto personalities are being imitated and then they're popping up and saying if you send me point one if you will get back a full eath things like that it sounds like this would be useful for that as well it would be very useful for that I mean Civic is working on verification of identity for me identity is something new it's and when we're moving everything to the blockchain we're not just copying and pasting what we've learned in the past we're actually asking ourselves if we were to invent what it means to get a green shield for a website or social media account what does that actually mean and actually the answer to that question is being opened up to the community will create the baseline but the community will answer it for example a Twitter account you don't necessarily want to prove you really are Laura Shen by demonstrating evidence by way of your passport or your license your driver's license in fact you may not even hold either of those credentials you may want to actually have an alias so we have a great guy on our team who has just joined our administrators his name is virtual growth and nobody on the team and nobody in the crypto world actually knows his real name he's just known as virtual growth yet that would that would that would be for me and so he shouldn't have to prove his real name so identity is more about personas you may trust a particular twitter account that you've been following for a quite considerable period of time to talk about crypto without actually known who the identity of the person is you may they may be linked to a github account or some other type of account maybe you want additional information but the verified symbol may just mean in some instances you're just not going to be scammed it doesn't mean it's a legitimate eye token or a legitimate whatever it just means that they're not going to scam you it really is what they say it is you know if they tell you they're gonna scam you and they then you can verify that but it's really medicine doesn't have an opinion about what's good or bad on the Internet we simply open it up to the community to classify the entire of the worldwide web and then other companies can do what they want with that information not everybody thinks pornography is bad or should be excluded some people may want to look for that information so we don't have any small percentage of the Internet it's not for us to decide and when it comes to decentralization I am so excited by the fact that meta cert and other security companies can be removed from the equation of trust because you know why should you trust meta cert to verify all the crypto exchanges in wallets aside from the fact that we couldn't possibly scale it globally we need help from the community but why not have an editor protocol that actually is owned by the people so that if meta start was attacked and brought down or whatever happened then you still have that network you still have that self-contained economy of people who just constantly submit validate dispute validate links that have a lifespan of maybe six or twelve months and then people evaluate it again and it's constantly evolving and constantly growing now the database itself can't be decentralized because we don't have a technology we don't have a blockchain solution that could give the performance that's needed but we're talking with a number of companies like ocean protocol for example who were working on that decentralized marketplace of data so we do want to do send as much as possible I think it's really important to demonstrate intent so I've contributed to eight technical specifications at the w3c I mentioned my URL categorization background I'm also one of the seven original founders of the mobile web initiative at the w3c and I was the first person ever to rewrite Tim berners-lee's vision of the one web whilst we were drafting the first best practices charter for the mobile web initiative and my CEO Oh in Hayward he was one of the first 25 contributors to the Mozilla Foundation and started and fostered the growth of the entire Mozilla evangelist community which contributed to the success of Firefox so we really care about open source and open standards and an open web and decentralization we will open source the products owned by meta cert when we get the time and effort at the time and resource to do so and we will decentralize as much as we technically possibly can Green so when we're running out of time but I actually want to ask you just a few more questions one is do you have any sense of who the scammers are we see a lot of attacks coming in from Ukraine China and Romania but we don't really know who the are they could be anybody because I gave a talk at a blockchain conference in LA last year and one of my main points was don't use your phone number as a password backup and recovery mechanism otherwise known as we've discussed as two-factor authentication and an hour after that my own phone number was compromised and text message from t-mobile I can't wait to give a talk at the same conference in San Francisco this week because it's going to be a screenshot of what happened the night after my last talk which is mine was compromised but it you know everybody can be hacked the good thing is I don't have core access to anything meaningful so I knew I would be a target so I don't have access to anything that would compromise meta search or any customer data because I don't have root access to anything and I knew that would happen so it's easier to attack than it is to defend and when do you plan to launch your decentralized network we plan to have a basic token functionality working on a test net by Midland mid to late April and so we would be able to distribute tokens to all of the end users of the products that sit on the protocol so for example kryptonite the browser extension I told you about each user is going to get 360 tokens which would then effectively allow them to use that software for free for another year okay so you plan to do some airdrop oh gee okay that's right it'll be possible it'll have a small wallet built into the extension not big enough to hold a lot of tokens for security purposes and so they'll be able to unlock those tokens as soon as they're available and we will be selling tokens privately around end of April and publicly about six to eight weeks after that okay and it sounds like you're you're offering them as a security when you say privately no there's a there's a private sale to big participants so there's no discount or a bonus for purchasing the tokens for future use within the network so you will be able to buy the tokens privately but you have to buy a certain amount and then you assert how you're going to use the service in the future so it's not a security token absolutely as a utility token and we're doing a number of things to demonstrate best practices within the industry to for the longevity of the project so the first one I mentioned was no bonus or discount for people who want to purchase the tokens privately the tokens will already be in use by then as well to demonstrate that there is real utility for the tokens and real demand for the token the team will have a 75 percent lockup so after the platform is live seventy-five percent of Medicine's tokens will be vested monthly over a three year period okay and this is maybe the most important question for the sinners what are your tips for users so they don't fall victim to any of these crypto scams install one password there are other applications that are great if you use someone that's brilliant but just install one password if you're not use that to automatically generate very long difficult passwords it's a fantastic solution remove your phone number as a backup and recovery to passwords call your cell network provider and ask them to put a double opt in to change in the SIM card which reduces the risk of that happening if you're a crypto team take the time and the money and resource to hire security personnel instead of just community managers sales and marketing people when you've got the funding security is very important not just for your own team but for the purpose of protecting your communities install all of our free software particularly for telegram and slack and just be mindful that it's not double-oh-seven scenarios you know don't leave your computer on the table at Starbucks and ask the person next to you to look after while you go to the bathroom they could be sitting there because they're spying on you because they know that you're a high profile target within the crypto world the higher the profile you are in the industry the more of a target you will become and they will go to any degree to access and compromise yourself or your company or your your family I'm constantly getting password email saying my passwords attempted changes on Facebook and other social media accounts so everybody is a target and just be mindful of that green it's been so wonderful having you on the show where can people learn more about you and meta cert go to meta cert protocol com for the project Meta Search com is the separate company if you want to install one of those apps and come join the
