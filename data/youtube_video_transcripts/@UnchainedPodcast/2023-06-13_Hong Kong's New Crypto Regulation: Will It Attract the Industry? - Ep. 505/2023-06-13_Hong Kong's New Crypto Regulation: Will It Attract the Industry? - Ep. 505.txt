Laura Link in the description today's topic is the state of crypto regulation in Hong Kong here to discuss are Angelina Quan CEO of Stratford finance and Adrian Lai founder and managing partner of Newman Capital welcome Angelina and Adrian hi Laura hello good to see you on June 1st Hong Kong implemented new crypto regulations that are welcoming to the industry in various ways we're going to unpack these and what it could all mean for crypto but first let's give everyone your backgrounds so they understand your perspectives on the market and know your experience with crypto in Hong Kong Angelina let's start with you thanks Laura um I've spent most of my career either in compliance roles uh setting up compliance functions as well as coo roles I spent a number of years at the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong as a director of enforcement as well as a director of supervision of markets and I set up the compliance function at Hong Kong exchanges and clearing so I've spent quite a bit of time in the regulatory space and work very closely with the sfc and Regulators around Asia Pacific and how did you also come to like know about crypto or work in crypto well it was really funny um after my after setting up the compliance function at hcox and and setting up their Foundation I was approached by Headhunters who asked me um did I know anything about Bitcoin and since I had advised bitfinex in early 2013 about setting up an exchange I did say yes I knew and I was recruited by that Headhunter to become the global CEO for bitmex so I was thrown into what was probably one of the most interesting jobs in the world at the time to set up everything for Arthur Hayes and his team and I was a global CEO with there so that's how I got even more deep into digital assets so yeah and with one of the true ogs of the space which um yeah is amazing and must have been really fun um I'm I also got the licenses for hash key which is another licensed digital asset Exchange in Hong Kong and I advise a number of stable coin as well as traditional finance companies in Hong Kong I see and Adrian how about you well thanks Laura probably my experience is less interesting but I I was working at BlackRock um until I left in 2016 and I joined a space in early 2017 I started to a bit of prop trading obviously lost most of my money actually of trading in Ico Eve was going up to a thousand four hundred dollars I held it to 80 actually listen to Albert Hayes as well average is saying that it should be double digit uh for Eve and um kind of losing hope a bit of in crypto and looking at from different perspective I started a company called liquify doing tokenizations it was a time for stos so back into 2017 I think I was too early for that but I actually looked into a lot of regulations quite early developed regulations around Asia uh for stos and until 2021 I decided to re-enter as a investor and I started Newman Capital mostly doing investment and Venture side of things in U.S southeast Asia and looking back to Hong Kong because of what is so exciting over the past 12 months in terms of regulations evolving not just in Hong Kong but overall in the region so uh portfolios of us in well as in U.S or elsewhere is trying to move to Hong Kong and that's sort of why me and my team is looking much more into uh how we can help out not just talking to regulator but also the government side of things but Angelina has been the Pioneer in this space so happy to be on this podcast with you thanks Adrian yeah so I know we're gonna go into these regulations that you know were implemented on June 1st but before we get into all the details on that latest development why don't you both give us a brief history of the crypto industry in Hong Kong and the rules there and how they've evolved over time so as early as 2013 when uh Giancarlo and Jean Louis came to me as two young men and said we want to set up an exchange and I said I'm sorry we don't have rules in Hong Kong for a crypto exchange because they were telling me how exciting crypto was and just to clarify these are the executives of bitfinex yes they were the founder the two founders of bitfinex and they were very excited and wanted to set up an exchange in Hong Kong and since I had come from um regulating exchanges at uh the sfc the Securities and Futures commission I was introduced to them to help them set up and I said I'm sorry we don't have any regulations such as this but I guess if you wanted to start I guess it's something that you can think about so they did end up starting their infinix exchange and that was the start of one of the major exchanges and you know that of course other exchanges started elsewhere Mount Cox and Japan and so on and so forth but what happened was we didn't have any legislation at all and that was the start of with bitmex starting its derivatives exchange and then other exchanges like FTX also took the lead in Hong Kong roughly in about 2016 2017 all of the these Founders started work on their exchanges there were no regulations whatsoever and in fact when I joined bitmex there was a lot of derision uh by market participants or Regulators that why would a ex regulator join digital assets like me oh my God has she gone crazy because again um Bitcoin was looked at as a negative thing it was looked upon as a scam and so on and so forth but what happened was you had the ascendancy of digital assets and interest in it and bitmex of course took the lead binance also was growing FTX was also growing at the same time then crypto.com so going into 2018 2019 almost all the major exchanges had set up in Hong Kong because of the low tax regime again Regulators started looking at it but they really didn't want to do anything about regulating it nor did they really know about it the cftc did try to get the sfc to take some investigations forward but they were not successful because it was so hard to investigate digital assets so it wasn't until roughly 2020 did things start getting a little bit strained I should say the sfc started to put in an opt-in regulatory procedure whereby you could actually put in an application and possibly get a license the first one to do that was OSL and the second was hash key at the time so the sfc had issued these rules and other firms started uh looking into getting into it but the first one of course that was approved later was OSL and then about a year later hash key was also approved so finally the sfc started getting I won't say worried but more concerned and started to publish more legislation in this area and one of the initiatives that was proposed was to ban all retail investors from investing in digital assets now at that time I was at the fsdc and we brought up this issue to the financial services Development Council and at that time we also told them that if this would happen most of the houses the golden unicorns that had started in Hong Kong would probably move away and that included bitmex crypto.com who did eventually move away finance and of course bitmax and and other houses so the fsdc under King AO and Rocky Tong undertook a review of the digital asset business we had a very high level meeting which all the houses came and basically told everything to them about their difficulties in opening accounts and so on and so forth Insurance lack of insurance visas that weren't able to be gotten because the company did not have licenses so all of these were taken into account and I'm sorry telling you a longer story but in the beginning there wasn't much interest later when Chris hoey became the new secretary for financial services he took a very big interest in this area and convinced the sfc to start looking into this and take it as a real asset so by 2021 there was discussions of whether or not to allow retail at that time again the door slammed and they stopped allowing retail to trade that that thought process was still there um but then just last year as you saw with the consultation conclusions there was a vast sea change and I think what really was the major decision maker was that John Lee came into Power Chris and the secretary for financial service worked with the new Administration to speak to China to allow Hong Kong to be the regulatory sandbox and as such the sfc also about faced and allowed um retail to be traded and because of this we're seeing a huge enthusiasm back into Hong Kong where a lot of digital asset players are coming back to Hong Kong and you're seeing web 3 and a lot of new innovation coming back in and I think this is something that both the Hong Kong government wanted and I think of course China is very Pro making sure that Hong Kong can succeed and will succeed so I think these are two very positive pieces of news sorry a little bit longer than unexpected sorry Adrian one question when you said that they put a stop to you or banned trading or whatever it was you said in 2021 was that at the same time that um China banned trading and Mining uh for crypto or is that are those separate I think it's roughly 2018 when my name was banned yeah it was different and also um China has always banned crypto they didn't enforce it as much but it became more and more enforced in terms of the selling of crypto in or digital assets in China but this room 2021 right in 2021 yeah in back in 2020 even they had already banned it so many of the big exchanges through the great firewall you could not actually get access to bitmex for example in China okay and Adrian did you want to add anything on the history of crypto regulation or the crypto industry in Hong Kong well I think Angelina have given a full download basically for the past 10 years in terms of regulations well I I think Hong I'll try to come from a different perspective more from the community building and overall the commercial perspective because I was in touch with crypto back to 2013 actually went to Han Chu from kinetic brought vitalik to Hong Kong so he called me and said there's an interesting beat up you should go and I went there there are just five there were just five people so Hong Kong was as early as when Vitality came to Hong Kong we have no one really heard about ethereum but it was one of the targeted cities for the early OG's crypto ogs actually and and going back to 2017 so fast forward 2017 because I was in front of the screen trading crypto in October of 2017 which China ban crypto trading and Bitcoin mining at that time so there was an influx of players from China whereas okx uh whether it's binance or be to Hong Kong so I think for two three years Hong Kong was traded as a place that you want to be there because there was no regulation ironically the regulation is clear now but at that time people come came here because our regulations was much slower much slower than other jurisdictions so people is ironic that some of the biggest companies whether it is FTX at that time including Alameda crypto.com [Music] um not any more credit that time yet but but you know okay x4b all of them actually had kind of like the high quality in Hong Kong and the main people in Hong Kong until I think Angelina already mentioned some major uh consultations or a kind of videos represented by the regulator so companies in cryptos realize that Hong Kong is going to do something well it's good or bad at that time I think the sign of being good a sign of a positive positive sign from regular regularly that just was presented last year but before that it was confusing for the industry but confusing sometimes is good for for the industry because they kind of feel like uh we are not going anywhere extreme until last year obviously there was a good sign in the Hong Kong theater we announced on the Hong Kong Phoenix week uh it was so different from before because if if Angelina and us we were in the industry for a long time there was no another time that whether it's the sfc or the financial secretary or Chris ho or any level from the government came out and say we are going to you know push referee in a bit uh conservatively but also positively last two weeks I have some inside uh closed door meetings with the government as well uh with senior levels I think one major question is that everyone wanted us all the time is has China and those Hong Kong pushing were free so there's obviously not a public answer out there but I think the government official already talked to Beijing quite a lot on this and have the kind of go for it um sign from the Beijing government which is very encouraging because at commercially every portfolio as we will be different from before that uh you know or is it the same from before that a band will happen if some you know illegal activities or something negative happen for the industry will Hong Kong just do it 180 degree turn if something happens so I think it's not the case because the government really has a positive view on pushing it I agree with Adrian um completely I don't think there's going to be ever again another 180 degree turn but there will be enforcement actions by the sfc if people break the rules um once once the licenses are in place so um we can expect that it's going to be a thriving industry but one that takes care of its investors and grows to be a real asset class which we've always known it's a real asset class but um now it's really going to be a developed asset class in Hong Kong which is highly exciting yeah so let's let's dive now into these new rules so on June 1st the Hong Kong Securities and Futures commission as we've been discussing began accepting applications for virtual asset service providers to serve retail customers um what is it that these new rules say I jump in at any time Adrian but in a nutshell uh basically if you wish to offer digital assets in Hong Kong you must be licensed the licensing regime is based on same product uh same as what is being done with Securities and Futures you will get a license and you will have to comply with rules and regulations you will need to put in internal controls that are documented which to me are best practice in any ways that you would want to put in place you will need to take care of your customers they will need to be suitable to be able to understand digital assets there will be segregated accounts there's security over how the firms run you will have a number of uh requirements to keep minimum Capital so the firm will not go bankrupt uh and there will be requirements for responsible officers that will look after the firm and be responsible for the firm so very much the same way that Securities firms are run in Hong Kong the sfc will require the same of digital asset firms that are getting licenses and already it's proven the system works we already have licensed companies in Hong Kong both in the fund management space as well as OTC broking those that are Brokers can uplift their licenses to be able to offer digital assets through a licensed digital asset provider like OSL for example and then the the new trading firms that are coming in the digital asset exchanges people from binance from what we hear all the way to new firms that are setting up in Hong Kong will be able to get licenses or already have put in licenses yeah and one other requirement that I just wanted a flag for those people who have been scarred by things like Mount Cox and FTX is that there's a cold storage requirement of 98 of the coins need to be held in Cold Storage which I think is a really great regulation um so Adrian can you describe what it is that they can list in terms of the tokens or like what requirements the tokens have to meet I believe the tokens need to have a 12 months track record uh so listed probably Elsewhere for 12 months issue for 12 months and um well but jumping back a bit well the regulations it's a bit is I think it's encouraging because they actually make quite exactly what the traditional security law in Hong Kong serves so basically if you are a traditional broker or traditional asset managers in Hong Kong obviously you have a standard way to deal with sfc in terms of your activities so when you look at the guideline issued by not the guideline but the new law issue by sfc in terms of lesson seven which is the trading trading facilities in Hong Kong I think it's pretty similar to uh traditional way of dealing with uh the sfc but also in the same time take care of specific things that you will think about in crypto just same as the question that you ask in terms of the token uh whether you have I think it has to be a travel and trap record including in certain two indexes I think at least two indexes when you look through that universe and obviously with the query requirement but one thing pretty interesting is they always require the platform operator to do due diligence so that is one key thing so you can never you never think about you as a as a company getting a license and you could do whatever right you you basically have the fiduciary to do the due diligence same as any kind of broker if you get a license as a broker you need to do due diligence in terms of what you're selling uh to your clients so I think that will impose certain uh requirements on exchanges even licenses trying to list the token so you heard some of the exchanges in the market already say they're gonna at least 16 tokens whether it is true they already get approval or they talk to a regulator at the end I think they have the discretion but up to whether something happens and if they haven't done the proper due diligence they will be punished by the regulator so I think the regulator has given a kind of a pull and push approach so given a bit of flexibility out there with the guidance you need to follow but at the end you have to bury your responsibility as the operator yourself and so I mean to me that seems like a high bar to have uh you know the the coins need to be um listed in two different independent index indexes and one needs to be a provider that has experience in the traditional financial sector so how many assets like you mentioned 16 like so which assets do you expect will be offered like how limited do you think it will be compared to you know what we currently see on like binance well Angelina obviously you you have your own comments as well but I have questions when I look at uh 15 16 coins uh I think it was it was announced by one exchange out there some tokens I do have questions on why they could be listed which tokens were those sandbox tokens I I would do have questions on in terms of the uh volatility liquidity um and whether it is should be traded on platform day one well I'm not sure I'm not saying that it's not gonna it shouldn't be traded for that four five minutes later but from from an investor perspective I think it is for the first five tokens Bitcoin either and probably some of the bigger bigger ones except stable coins because stable coins are not allowed to trade now on on the Hong Kong exchanges but some of the tokens like send is probably a bit dangerous for day one as I mentioned it's a discretion for a platform operator to to to list them as long as you know you you have the license approved finally so if you were an operator which you were saying that you would be comfortable with five which five Bitcoin ether and then which are the other three well let me look up the top ten now actually you know Bitcoin ever is obviously the choice but you know uh not if excluding a stable coins probably not BNB for now uh the Solana polygon or top 10 that could be safer choices than uh listing some of the application based tokens so I think Foundation based token probably is the easier ones to get listed initially and is the less volatility compared to some of the application based tokens as well so um Laura one of Laura and Adrian one of the new areas which is quite novel that has been introduced as a part of the regulation is the fact that the onus has been put on the firm um to take responsibility so therefore a new Criterion has been put in place that requires the firm to have an admissions committee so that admissions committee has to meet it if it wishes to list a specific token Adrian has mentioned some of the characteristics that can be used as a part of the diligence process but the most important thing is the firm will need to take responsibility and the responsible officers will need to take responsibility for this so a due diligence list of why the firm has made these decisions to allow Bitcoin and ethereum to be listed that the fact that they were listed on two or three exchanges or different products or they're approved somewhere else all of that that information and background has to be in the report that actually is tendered to this admissions committee and all of that needs to be minuted by the licensed person and why is the sfc taking such a stance on this is because they do not and they did not approve the product unlike any other product in in Hong Kong if you offer a fund in Hong Kong that has to be licensed by the investment products division of the sfc it will be authorized and there will be all sorts of documentation on why the sfc approves that product but for Bitcoin for ether none of this has been approved by the sfc it's just appeared because of Satoshi Nakamoto or vitalik butcheren and it's up to the firm then to take the responsibility and if the firm lacks that documentation and that due diligence I think the sfc will take action maybe in the beginning giving a bit of leeway but firms will need to get their paperwork and due diligence in line to make sure that they protect investors and I think that's a very novel way of making sure that firms make sure that they have the analysis before allowing a sand or a doggy coin or whatever it is to be Unleashed on invest officers and investor protection is in place so that's just building on what Adrian was saying but this was a very unusual and new way of looking at things which I thought was quite interesting and I asked Elizabeth at length Elizabeth is the young lady who did the policy and wrote the policy and what's her last name Elizabeth Wong was the team he lead that actually drafted much of it of course within the commission everybody drafts policy together but she actually was the lead person taking that and I had interviewed her through another interview at the Hong Kong Securities Institute to ask about this and other questions so I mean it seems like this is kind of um a tempered way of inviting crypto right it's like very much we're gonna license the exchanges um you know there are these certain standards about listing tokens and some of the other things uh that I think I saw discouraged like one of them was airdrops like what are some other kind of like parameters they've put around these things so you know it's like inviting crypto activity but only within a certain boundary that the people running it um will be licensed and be held accountable and you will know exactly who is running the firm and that they will be located in Hong Kong so it's very clear um whether or not they're going to be licensed or not and it'll be very clear unlike what happened with FTX of where are you going to get recompense if if you've opened an account in Hong Kong then you can take action in Hong Kong the regulator will take action if you complain um and there'll be a a way that you can grab onto something whereas if you know with FTX now for those of the people that have taken losses the Hong Kong investors because they didn't sign up with a Hong Kong licensed company were at the last in the line to get any recompense if anything from the FTX proceedings that are going on in the United States but in the United States and Bahamas they will actually get the first bite of the Cherry in terms of funds going back to the aggrieved investors so that's a very very big difference to protect investors so I am talking a lot Adrian did you want to add in stuff or um yeah I think I think it is really you you actually strike a really good point in terms of the io because our old responsible officers again same as any type of regulated activities in Hong Kong they I have response visible for any actions you're going to take it is it reflects on the role level also reflect on the company level which is quite unusual as Angelina mentioned that you you approved internally based on due diligence and certain tokens that get listed but at the end is the company to be blamed it's quite a different approach from rest of the other kind of companies to be regulated and for those of us who are Ro's I'm also an RO or a responsible officer it's criminal if something goes wrong um it's my head my license so I'm going to be very careful with the decisions that I make I'm going to make sure that the company is protected as well as investors are protected because I don't want to be carted off to jail and you have seen actions being taken against responsible officers who have been derelict in their duties and um I mean that's a firm is as strong as the people that run it and that's why that regime is in place and this is to make sure that digital assets as a licensed activity will be good for investors and will protect investors and I think that's the great part of all of this because we're on our pathway to become an ex really an accepted asset class at least in Hong Kong and in Asia Pacific yeah yeah I definitely see this as being a good model for other jurisdictions as well so in a moment we're going to talk about other areas of Regulation that we could see coming out in Hong Kong but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 000 attendees for this year's

Hong Kong monetary authorities even urging Banks to open accounts for crypto companies which given everything that has happened recently in the US with silvergate and um Signature Bank and um even Silicon Valley think a little bit um and you know the debanking of a bunch of crypto companies here um it just seemed like a geopolitical play I guess you could say so I was wondering you know um is that kind of activity actually drawing crypto firms um and you know given what we were talking about in terms of this sort of limited kind of space in which to play with all the different regulations is is all of this actually attracting crypto companies I think it is what about you Adrian well definitely well but there's always a question so when these things happen on the news and uh her portfolio asking is that real because usually people have a pretty skeptical towards what's happening in Hong Kong because over the past several years we've been talking about how we can prepare crypto but at the end of the day we know that it was real this time but people outside Hong Kong doesn't always grow so pray this way uh I think it was there was a Bloomberg article coming out uh when silver gaze of those bands got shot at that time and uh when Chinese Banks is trying to recruit crypto companies uh for bank accounts and Bloomberg was was doing that news actually I was contacted by Bruno on that as well but I was not sure whether it's real or not because when I talked to all these Chinese banks at that time I think there was there was conversations for not too senior level with the RMS I mean relationship managers with clients in terms of getting open and bank accounts so I was still not convinced it was more policies in place or a narrative in place that banks are gonna open up crypto accounts until I think some of the even virtual banks in Hong Kong talk about it so you you see there's um there's a spread of this kind of messaging across news outlet and Banks start to talk about that I think portfolio started to get comfortable and even even uh until last I think last two weeks some of our portfolios want to open a bank account just operating by account so it's not crypto in and now all days but just a crypto company is trying to open up my account with banks is actually getting easier so believe it or not I think the relationship managers three years ago you talked to them not as a crypto company you talk to them and tell them you are technology consulting company or your technology advisor company to get rid of that even though your whole website is all blockchain if you get a as a RM then you probably could still make it happen that I think this these days if you open up as a crypto companies operate bank account the RM actually takes your call so I think it's pretty encouraging Adrian's right it is a bit more encouraging and the hkma and the sfc have actually met once already there's a second meeting which I've just received an invitation for uh that will be held in a few in a few weeks I think um I forgot the date but um uh this will also be to expedite bank accounts and I think the hkma has taken it very seriously so if you're definitely licensed or on the road to being licensed you will be able to get a bank account it's for the ones that are in the process of getting a license that will take a little bit longer but I'm sure that if you showed evidence of your license application or things like that I think banks will probably start move moving towards getting you banked up the other area that was really really difficult for licensed companies was to get insurance so you had to think of really unusual ways to get insurance to fulfill a requirement of the licensing regime so you'd get specie licensed that was pretty much useless if you could show an insurance policy at least that fulfilled it now the insurance Regulators as well as the Federation of insurers are actually working with fsdc to talk to insurance companies so that digital asset firms can get insurance so all of these are slowly working through the system and I have to say thanks to work from the fsdc as well as the ssvc and hkma working together to move this with invest Hong Kong all of this has just pushed it along which has been a lot better and I think the government realizes that hey people the smartest of smart the digital asset firm owners are leaving Hong Kong that means tech people are going to get pulled away and there were a lot of people going to Dubai there were a lot of people going back to the U.S Austin Texas and I think now we sort of yeah I know well maybe it's the other way around now with the thing with Gary gensler's newest case but nevertheless I think that stem of leaving has sort of stopped thankfully and people are thinking about coming back which is very very good for Hong Kong so so something else that looks like it's on the horizon is stable coin regulation in Hong Kong so what do you think that will look like and when do you think that might happen the hkma has already announced uh that they will put out consultation for the regulation of stable coins they've already self-consulted a number of stablecoin issuers some of which are very interested some of which are not so interested so because there is a huge level of not huge but there is a level of Regulation and some of those stable coin providers will need to be located in Hong Kong for and I'm sure Adrian can sort of explain it better than I can some of these stablecoin people are worried about their safety in Hong Kong because of where the coin and how it can be used and who's buying it and so on and so forth so there are concerns even though we're one country two systems so some of them have already indicated they will not be licensed or they will not seek licensing and will prefer to be outside of it I don't fully understand their their concerned about their safety because of where you just said where the coin meaning like because there was they could be used to try to get access to the reserves or what do you mean by that no I mean basically if they're systemically important um I'm just echoing what some of these stable coin issuers have talked to me about that they're slightly worried about being in Hong Kong because it's so close to China and even now and even though there has been a clear regulatory path for digital assets uh crypto people are very shall we say conservative in terms of security and um there are there are worries by certain crypto providers that their safety may be threatened here but but I don't understand because some physical China is that what you're implying I don't understand what you're saying yeah it's just in general overall people are skeptical whether the Hong Kong policies will be will be reversed because of China's negative view towards crypto because we all we all know that if we're clearly in the industry we all know that Hong Kong is pro-crypto now is not that clear whether China is pro crypto so that one country two system uh you know not everyone knows clearly about one-time radio system if you are outside of Hong Kong you're just worried oh actually Hong Kong's part of China if China doesn't like crypto something happens to Hong Kong will I get arrested so that's basically uniquely related to stable coins but just overall the crypto sentiment in Hong Kong thank you for explaining that a lot better than I could so sorry I'm just realizing like I I've always heard this expression one country two systems but I suddenly realized I don't know what it means because if you have a country uh there should be laws which generally will come from one place right I don't get what yeah I'm I'm all of a sudden realizing I literally don't know what that means and I know this is like off the topic of crypto but if you could just briefly explain that so we can understand it in this context of what we're discussing like what does that mean largely one country two systems is basically China has promised in law and in documentation to the British government when Britain handed over Hong Kong in 1997 that Hong Kong would be run as a separate country separate to what China how China runs it it has its own Constitution it has its own laws and rules in place in so one country because it's part of China yeah but I thought it meant was Hong Kong is one country but it has two governmental systems other way around China Hong Kong and China make up one country yes but Hong Kong has its own systems yes I literally thought it was the exact opposite but anyway okay keep going Hong Kong follows cummins or common law right so basically Sim is UK and and uh some of the other countries so well but but obviously Beijing does have the directions in terms of how Hong Kong should should work towards economic policies and all that but we have an independent system to decide the details and all of the legislations and stuff we have our own legislative Council independent from China okay okay but interpretation works that like Hong Kong is its own place but there's two governments that have influence over it no um Hong Kong has its own government and China has its own government Hong Kong's government reports into China and largely we are that's what I mean yeah we are segregated um but of course with the greater Bay Area uh working together there are areas where we work very closely with parts of China for example Okay so discussion around geopolitical issues with China but before we do that I just want to ask so you know we've talked about the licensing of the exchanges we're talking about how the stablecoin uh regulations are going to come down so are there any other areas of Hong Kong crypto regulation that you foresee maybe um happening in the future could be around I don't know like nfts or trying to track developers or I don't know tokens do you see anything else on the horizon I think I think even for so even for stable coins we were talking about that as well you know not as well as digital Hong Kong the I'm not talking about existing stable one provider outside of outside of Hong Kong whereas tether or other stable and provider but digital Hong Kong or uh offshore room and B so cnh whether they will be in digital format uh I think it is gonna be something happening for for sure a digital Hong Kong for sure well as offshore cnh uh not sure and when it's done by Hong Kong companies or Chinese companies but we all know that the ones there's a stable coin in place and and the government actually has been trying out over the past several years uh whether is with the Thailand uh Hong Kong equivalent on testing out the the settlement with digital stable coin or digital or stablecoin is to connect the greater Bay Area right because Hong Kong Shenzhen and Guangzhou if imagine and at one world that that stable coin being regulated and being endorsed by the government our stocks could essentially be settled instantly by having digital Hong Kong directly buying a stockings engine so that's something connect the whole region and creating another powerful economic zone but one way that I see it is and it's also not something that I think record later we would do but something I hope regulator will do is after having the digital Hong Kong in place and how it should be regulated but then also to the Enterprise stable coins so meaning that if new world as a listed company a pretty big property developer in Hong Kong can launch a digital New World stable coin actually it will totally transform the equity market and um I see actually happening I heard conversation around that already within the government but not sure when that would be launched for Angelina with no better than I do besides all the stable corn stuff I think the Riff derivative Market is something gonna be regulated pretty soon and uh good and bad as well it is much bigger than a spot market so I think if it got regulated in the pretty clear way similar spot market now huge opportunities to Hong Kong as well so just building on what Adrian was saying um I think the first step that the hkma has taken has been a great step in terms of um they will be issuing consultation for a stable coin regulation so that one step is one step further the E Hong Kong dollar um uh the hkma has announced a competition or a group of people have been selected to come up with use cases for the E Hong Kong dollar and how it will be used in terms of Hong Kong so there have been some very novel cases that are being worked on right now for final presentation to work with um hkma as well as liskos and companies in Hong Kong to start launching use cases so you can see that the government is really actually finding use cases for the E Hong Kong dollar and echoing what Adrian's saying the cooperation between UAE Thailand Hong Kong is really working together as they study how to come up with a e a stable coin that works amongst all these different parties so that's continuing and then you asked about other products that are probably going to be launched the sfc has already committed to issuing a paper at some point about tokenization and which is very clear rules and this has really been lacking which is why tokenization has not taken off as fast as it should be taking off so they've committed to say that they will issue a consultation paper on tokenization to just need a bit of time so that's one area that's going to be looked at and what an oil World asset tokenization of assets and and or other products uh which could be possibly moving into stock who knows but I can definitely say that real estate is very hot um and and in an area that people are very very interested in seeing some kind of consultation on so I think that's going to be coming out nfts the sfc has said that they are not going to regulate it at this time but their view may be changing because of the use cases of nfts are also changing the original art based nft wasn't really that interesting in terms of as a product but as the use of nfts grows that could be another area where the soc will issue additional guidance in terms of products so I think all of this development is going to be interesting but as Adrian said I think the most exciting will be how the Chinese uh the E Yuan 22 000 companies worked on developing this whole system in China for the EU on so if 22 000 companies in China are working on that you can imagine how important it is to the to China and then for Hong Kong the E Hong Kong dollar will be very important because of course our neighbors China and we're one country two systems so I think that will grow in time especially with trading and it's trading trading partners with Hong Kong and China the e-dollars will definitely be a important part of growth for all economies around the world so as we alluded to a few times throughout this episode there's been reports that China is sanctioning this increased crypto activity in Hong Kong Bloomberg reported quote representatives from China's liaison office and other officials have been frequent guests at the city's crypto gatherings in past months the low-key support shows that officials are keen on using the laissez-faire city as a testing ground for digital assets as they keep a tight Reign on any such activity on the mainland so how are you interpreting this like are you kind of prognosticating that this could mean the opening of crypto activity in China or where do you see this headed well I when I when I was um I was in a trip with uh invest Hong Kong to Japan actually I think in April one of the questions by the Japanese government is exactly uh when China is doing this Hong Kong is doing that uh it's a completely different policies and I think that it was answered by uh certain government officials is exactly the proof of one country two system in terms of what Hong Kong is encouraging referee activities that China is actually Banning quite a lot of stuff and and you would I think both of you have read the news uh people got arrested in in China uh for doing something crypto as exactly we're seeing tons of Chinese companies not just in financial companies actually I think the government is also talking to Chinese gaming companies if you want to set up crypto fund or crypto arm to just do it in Hong Kong it's a very clear direction that Hong Kong now is the city for you to have free and uh but that's exactly if you if you translate that across the supply chain I think most of the not just custodian exchanges but also projects now I'm moving to Hong Kong cyberport has I was talking with Sarah for vetting committee Sapphire is kind of um I'm not sure what is non-profit but they're basically the incubation Center endorsed by the government government owned as well to encourage entrepreneurship uh they have received over 200 of companies from China just to enter incubation program historically uh if you want to get incubation program you're a startup that is probably need monies but they receive a lot of proposals from Chinese companies which are Super Rich they just want to be in Hong Kong because they want to be in crypto so I think that message is getting direct now tours even Chinese companies and if you notice um Laura this is not um unusual so if you look Hong Kong was given the stock market and it was the market that was um shall we say developed for trading and for fundraising whereas if you look at Macau it's very much uh the gambling and was specifically given gambling for its revenue and for its businesses and that's how it's developed so again in in the case of Hong Kong because I think the Hong Kong government did push uh very hard to be able to have technology as well as digital assets as well as web 3. moving forward as a technological advancer for China I think this is this is proof that it the system is working and that's how China makes sure that these test Labs work before other things are allowed to move forward so I think I think you're going to continue to see this type of test cases in terms of uh new areas being tested in different parts of the realm of China and so while all this is happening in Hong Kong at the same time China has really been moving forward with a ton of private government initiated blockchains and I wondered yeah like I you know I don't know if you have much awareness of that but do you see if they're getting uptake like are they being used just in that way of like the government trying to push it on people or is it like actually kind of getting more organic usage as well I think um the blockchain and remember I talked about the 22 000 companies for the EU on those were part of the blockchain companies and one of the companies that I worked with was owned by wanchang so hash key is owned by the wanchong group which originally was a car parts maker that moved very quickly into the blockchain space moving into development technology and web 3. so um you're seeing that happen in China and there is uptick as the blockchain technology evolves not just in digital assets but also in use cases for payments in use cases for parts and tracking of parts for example tracking of livestock it's amazing some of the things that the blockchain can do to keep track of livestock and and car manufacturing I've seen the most amazing prototypes of of tracking devices that actually watch how uh how livestock is growing how fast it weighs them automatically and monitors their systems for example their life system so you're seeing use cases that are moving from what was imagined into real areas and this is where China is excelling because they've got so much sought power in the blockchain to push this forward so it's moving into real life uses in terms of everywhere from watching livestock to growing plants and or crops for example um I did see a report though that a former Chinese Central Banker said that two years in the digital one you you on usage had been low it was only 14 billion dollars in two years and he called these results not ideal um but do you sense obviously this is from December so it's uh six months ago do you have a sense of whether that's changed at all or you know do you still do you still think it's like fairly low or well I think the cbdc was in the Bank of beta to be to be fair is launch I think much faster than a lot of different countries as well considering the one point four or 1.2 billion people in China so I I feel like when we talk about blockchain application as well in China cbdc obviously is one huge use cases but I heard a lot happening around two things uh one is nft equivalent they call it digital collectible in China so you can use the word nft in China you have to use digital collectible uh well is the fundamental difference is probably nft could be mined on public blockchain but digital Collectibles have to be means on private blockchain endorsed by China or you know part of the China ecosystem and the second thing is actually metaverse so metaverse is China uh the difference between the usual metaverse and these metaverse in China is They are promoting digital properties and digital properties could be you know xrar VR could be holograph it doesn't necessarily relate to crypto but the idea of open world and metaverse actually has already reflected in the gaming World reflected into a hosting concert in the metaphor setting on open world digital format setting in China so I think China is pushing uh I would I would put it this way I think they are pushing the feces behind um uh web free not necessarily with a public blockchain but they they believe that some of the services should be accessible easily at a cheaper cost by quick be on the private blockchain well ironically even sovcr I don't necessarily think it's wrong because when you have a mass of 1.2 billion people it's different from launching a private blockchain among 8 million people so so um I think China is pushing that front and using Hong Kong as the city of tester really work with front and at some point where it will integrate not sure but but I think that's the way pretty clear Direction what it why they're doing this as well so it sounds like it's going to be the way the internet is today where there's like China's internet and then the rest of the internet and so in the future it'll probably be like China's blockchains and then we have our public blockchains to is that where you think it's headed key question is well at the bot that the public blockchain and China blockchain will integrate some point or composer for some point I think that's the key question whether whether it reflects down to the application layer uh uh infrastructure as in a Shenzhen style exchange at some point could be composable with in the ideal unit swap well we I I don't think it is not impossible but do you think China would want to give its citizens access to other kinds of money I mean the reason that they have the current Internet is they don't want people to have you know the information that the rest of us have and I don't think they would want to give people the freedom with their money well Angelina have different view my personal opinion is I think it's not about the flow of information anymore is is really about controlling the outflow outflow okay that's exactly and Asian Spot on that's why I'm saying do you think they'll want to just have it all integrated with other blockchains because then people can yeah easily send their money out of the Chinese system as long as if kyca mail is imposed on both sides so uh you know at some point well I think it is it in ineffortable that unit swap or other decks at some point will have to impose uh uh digital ID uh that's that's going for a D5 world and at some point uh China has launched CBD successfully across the whole country it will be composable because you know where the capital is Flowing going around the blockchain and obviously in the open world uh uh we know that where this money is going and Tech with the digital ID so as long as the money flow is clear I don't think China will have a complete 100 ban but that's just my own View and probably in the future as well yeah and I I would probably push back on what you said about the information because obviously with the pandemic they were suppressing all kinds of information and even trying to censor non-chinese people about that so that was interesting to watch but anyway but China has actually put in what is the common reporting system so they've already put in a number of controls in place in terms of making sure that um that information is tracked um and then if you look at some of the things that are going on in terms of um how things do work in it there's a very good test case which is the stock connect and Hong Kong's Hong Kong exchanges and clearing works with China's exchanges and you can buy if you're a Hong Kong person you can buy directly uh stock from Shanghai and other exchanges directly so that's an example where China has connected and using Charles Lee's description where Hong Kong ex is connecting China to the world and the world to China because you can trade directly so China is already moving into the space in terms of testing in possibilities for a closed circuit but you can invest into China directly as well as Chinese investors can directly invest into Hong Kong and I think in time as as China gets more comfortable they're probably going to enlarge that that stock connect to other markets and certainly I think because hkx owns the London's Metals London Metals exchange and had aspirations to move into the London Stock Exchange at some point before there will be opportunities for China to connect more outwards also but they're already doing it in terms of owning International companies but it's just been Limited in terms of how open that common person in Beijing can can access the the uh foreign markets so I think it's going to be a little bit slow but the world is opening and Hong Kong truly is a conduit for China and opening it up to the world so that's just my view so let's zoom out um here we've been you know talking about Hong Kong then we added China but meanwhile just generally in crypto there's a lot of change happening right now in terms of uh jurisdictions either becoming more welcoming to crypto or less um you know if you're uh in the US I think that's what we're seeing where even an extremely compliant company like coinbase is getting sued by the SEC which is sort of interesting to watch um but I was curious for your thoughts on you know where you see things going kind of globally uh Dubai Europe Singapore they've all sort of been you know adding regulations that add Clarity for crypto companies so kind of um you know where do you see companies going um how do you see Hong Kong within that larger Global field and then of course because the big elephant in the room is the US and right now it is uh taking a very unfriendly stance I was just wondering what your thoughts were on how this would affect crypto globally okay I'll just talk about the right regulations and maybe Adrian could talk about what he knows the crypto Bros too better than I might and women they're women too yes crypto girls too yes yes um what's been happening is as well it was a projection prediction that I made that within five to ten years from within five years from 2018 that almost all the Regulators around the world would start doing some kind of Regulation and sure enough you're seeing that exact thing happened so in particular Dubai has moved forward with a Innovative regulator called Vara virtual assets regulatory Authority and um there uh I we met with them when we went to I went with a group recently to Dubai Abu Dhabi and Riyadh so Abu Dhabi and and Dubai in particular Have regimes and Have licensed digital asset firms binance being one of the main ones that the Abu Dhabi financial center and Dubai already has issued in principle approvals for um licensees and a lot of people find moving to Dubai interesting uh and it has been attracting Financial players so the Middle East is an area that has become very interesting because of course the emirati money as well as the Investments uh that uh Riyadh Dubai and Abu Dhabi are making to attract investors have really brought in a lot of people uh relocating there then you've got Europe which has put in Mika and Mika there's still a lot to be studied uh and in fact iosco will be meeting next week in Thailand so I'm sure the digital asset agenda will be discussed amongst all the global Regulators but you're seeing Europe now has a regime that's starting to come together but it's too early to tell how that will attract or or not attract people Asia still seems to be the hot area then you're looking at the U.S I I understand that our Republican government has actually issued some sort of draft legislation um that and has put it out there uh in the United States for regulation of digital asset digital assets but there hasn't been much coverage but it was it was mentioned in the news that a draft has been published you're looking at South America some countries have actually started issuing legislation but it's very um sparse so you've got Salvador El Salvador for example that does embrace Bitcoin Africa the Last Frontier is also looking at putting in regulations there are firms that are pushing the frontier there to get regulated and start operations in the African countries but no regulator has really taken a firm push except for possibly Nigeria and Uganda so there is definite interest in Africa as the next Frontier of growth um so that's sort of a Whistle Stop of some of the countries that are looking at it but I think aside from Asia I think um the Middle East is probably the second most interesting place to be I don't know if you agree with that Adrian but well I I have a uh from a firm perspective we're looking to moving headquarters obviously the same as a lot of different companies over the past two years and we decided base in Hong Kong and um I think it is a key setback several key factors but the key question the key thing is globally they're just free uh cities with uh a huge in the financial Market to to support the activities is New York London and Hong Kong just three of them and London been doing quite a lot FCA has been doing quite a lot of sandbox and all that you don't see a lot happening actually uh New York obviously with all this uh things happening now it's going nowhere uh come relatively to Hong Kong so it is I think the view that we have formulated as a company is if you want to grow truly into your web freehub maybe licensing and the capital formation is quite important at the beginning and it comes down to whether you could attract not just funding but also developers and you know Builders into the city so Hong Kong has been quite weak to be honest in terms of developers and Builders but we have set the stone in terms of capital fundraising and so it should be easier to attract talents in but I agree with Angelina when I look at different jurisdictions because I because I personally I got a license approval I think back in 2019 in Abu Dhabi so when my previous startup we've got a principle and approval and for being OTC player customizing asset and you could uplift the license for trading so it's a quite early stage for adgm to do that my first experience with middle is is you have much less uh added to a political concerns when it comes to crypto you know obviously Hong Kong the reason we discuss a lot about China and Hong Kong is because there are multiple factors influencing people perceptions on Hong Kong the mid to is usually it's pure business so you don't really hear about whether Midwest is particularly related to China or Hong Kong when it comes to Crypt of China and U.S when it comes to crypto you just hear about where you should raise where is it Dubai Abu Dhabi uh any kind of UA part of the UAE so my view is uh I think most of the builders or uh um decentralized Finance projects they likely will move towards the Middle East and for now the centralized companies exchanges Brokers investment Banks which specialize in crypto likely it will be in Hong Kong and I I am very pessimistic towards Singapore because because from a from a primary uh primary perspective myself I deal with several communities whether it's token 2049 as a conference has fought about Hong Kong as a place in South Singapore just because they signed a contract with Singapore that's sort of why they have to be there just this year uh some of the even for nft eight fast for part A actually thinking between Singapore and Hong Kong so there's not gonna be two cities as well free Hub in Asia it's gonna just won so if it's just the one Hong Kong is 10 times bigger Financial Hub than Singapore people always forgot about Singapore is just a tiny country so uh so think about if I if I think about that for a few for three or five years you need as a firm you need a presence in Hong Kong midways whether you have to be in Europe I think I agree with actually namika is quite early developed but very positive uh but Europe to me fundamentally is quite passive in tourists pushing crypto not from a regular point of a commercial point of view U.S um to be honest I don't know I I don't advise portfolios to now put much resources there for now yeah yeah I think um just one note is at least from researching uh my first book the cryptopians um there's a lot of developers in Europe so that would be like the one uh yeah after that um all right you guys this has been such a fascinating discussion where can people learn more about each of you and your work I'm on LinkedIn and uh I'm going to launch a website uh soon I hope and about some of more of my work but happy to take part in any of your conferences and and be accessible if people have questions we I Adrian and I would probably say you also love Hong Kong and I love Hong Kong and this has been my home and I really hope it will succeed as a crypto Financial Center um not only being a massive International Financial Center so I'm committed to it and uh hope you'll come out here and visit us yeah I'm I would like to put that on my list as well Adrian how about you well I I um LinkedIn Twitter I'm quite active in Twitter but even though I talk a lot about different stuff as well on Twitter um and uh we'll be as my firm will be co-hosting ethereum Hong Kong in October uh announced ready as on 14th June and um so I would love to invite both of you yeah sure because uh the main reason for me is for to do it as a firm is because uh we want to do something developer driven so not necessarily just a financial Market or licensed product driven but more at trading Builders and developers I think most of the people remember Hong Kong as an International Financial Center but didn't remember Hong Kong actually actually grow as an Enterprise yeah and support is not necessarily related to finance but the way to connect the East and West is actually Hong Kong's natural Advantage physically geographically we are at a very good good position to be the place and being an entroper meaning we also have to attract talents uh capitals and everything back to the city and as a as a boy uh born and raised in Hong Kong I I am very passionate to make that happen alongside Angelina and everyone in Hong Kong perfect well it's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained [Music] French fermentation yes thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Angelina Adrian and how Hong Kong has been embracing crypto check out the show
