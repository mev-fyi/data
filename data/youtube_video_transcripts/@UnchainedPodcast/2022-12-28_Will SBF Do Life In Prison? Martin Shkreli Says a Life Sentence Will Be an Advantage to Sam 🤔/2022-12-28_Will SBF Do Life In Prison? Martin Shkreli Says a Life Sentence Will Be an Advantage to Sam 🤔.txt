to be careful it means can be very sensitive about especially with respect to things like power or respect or notoriety or things like that the one thing he has going for him which is extremely interesting is that he's facing the life sentence many other prisoners are not so my advice to Sam is if he gets into a bit of a tiff one of the things he can throw out there that will will win the respect of his fellow prisoners is I'm facing life I'm not facing what you're facing you're probably facing five years or ten years I'm looking at you know you can even use hyperbole here but it's true they could calculate his guideline sentence as a hundred years or 200 years or 300 years and he could throw that out there and you know that will turn a lot of even the most thoroughly prisoner Stone Face when when you say something like that they will realize that maybe he's right you know and I think that that is the one thing in that prison environment for now that he kind of does have going for him is that he is kind of a financial gangster
