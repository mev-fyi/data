and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the june 15 2021 episode of unchained which makes it the five year anniversary of the podcast i was originally planning a five-year anniversary event for the show like an in-person event but it's not really possible to wrap up a book plan an event and also produce two podcasts a week and a daily newsletter so i will be planning an event for the fall and what's even better about that is that we should be more fully passed covet at that time which means we could have an event with few or no or no restrictions so stay tuned for news on that tasos is smart money that's redefining what it means to hold and exchange value in a digitally connected world discover how people are

an ama because i'm also wrapping up my book as we speak and just needed to um you know use the time that i would have used to book a guest to finish up the book so today's first question is a poem from ben lawson who some of you might remember for making this amazing video that we used in the live podcast recording with vitalik buterin back in 2019 and for this episode ben has written a lovely poem with some really deep questions take a listen thanks and praises lord shin it's an honor to visit your show again please forgive me for being so blunt but a controversial answer is what i want not to put you on the spot but we all know your takes are smoking hot do you think crypto has a role to play in the battle for drug peace could crypto philanthropists change the laws and get non-violent prisoners released should worshipping mother nature be such a heinous crime for loving her healing gifts should we be staring down hard time has there been anything else like the famed pineapple fund have giveth and bit give projects fought for drug policy reform with more trauma now than ever it feels like the medicine work has just begun amin solimani is proudly outspoken about scoring shrooms on the silk road charles huskinson has wild masculine stories to tell of his own peter mccormick bought cannabis oil with bitcoin to ease his mother's pain thanks to ross ulbricht minnie a psychedelic seeker could avoid the street and be more safe ayahuasca may or may not be your cup of tea perhaps you're uninitiated into the wilds of dmt i wouldn't expect you to wave a golden black flag like vin armani or espouse all of the tenants of cypherpunk cryptoanarchy but as a former yoga teacher and enviro reporter you might agree a fair and balanced story is in order as memesters and fudsters troll the socials over which blockchain is more green you don't have to be on joe rogan to know higher consciousness is what we need i'd rather smoke a joint with the heroic peaceful warrior alex gladstein talk about uprisings against police states and authoritarian regimes but laura you're the smartest off-chain oracle in the room maybe you know best if crypto's psychedelic liberation is coming soon is this the year when a swarm of cryptopians joined the fight to make access to plant medicine a universal human right so ben this question is actually really um outside of my area of expertise i will have to say however one thing that does come to mind when i was listening to your lovely poem is that certainly a lot of people in crypto are very interested in psychedelics and we also know that this is a trend now in v silicon valley and just generally kind of in tech for anybody who listens to tim ferriss i'm sure all of you know that he is quite active in this space and also in the startup world and also into crypto so i would say that there's probably going to be a lot of people with a lot of money who have an interest in this space and you did mention some of them in your recording um i also know uh like back when i thought that olaf was gonna be one of the characters in my book and i was kind of doing some early interviews with him one of the questions i asked him is you know oh if you really make it and you become wealthy i mean i was literally asking this in like 2016. so it was like right after he launched his hedge fund and um and he one of the things he said is that he would like to donate to psychedelic research so there's that um i will say in my book psychedelics do show up a few times in the book because it's just something that a lot of people in the space are interested in and you know to the extent where i would say it's kind of probably what i would guess is of a greater prevalence than in the general population um there is an event where people kind of make that observation uh that you know the group of people assembled there kind of had a greater interest in it than than the wider world and i would say like if i compare to my friends then yeah i would say my sources generally are are more interested in this so um you know if people end up putting their money into what it is that they're personally interested in then i would certainly guess that we would see that money going toward legitimizing um you know drug use of of different kinds probably mainly frankly from what i can tell in the area of psychedelics all right so the second question comes from sweden and i will let you all take a listen to this hi there laura eric here from sweden always enjoyed your podcast my question to you is amongst all the guests you had which one was the most entertaining one thank you and god bless so which guest was the most entertaining one that is a good question i the honestly the first person that comes to mind is melt him to mirrors simply because as many of you may recall she she swore a lot basically and um i ended up using one of those words in the episode title and so that was just kind of hilarious frankly and um and she's just like a funny person so i feel like that and actually in that episode she was paired with jill carlson who's a good friend of hers and yes i think the two of them just have really good banter and as we all know they went on and started their own podcast which was really really great and so um so she comes to mind and another person who just was such a good storyteller like if you listen to that episode i barely asked a question in the beginning because um he just kind of went into storytelling mode and it was just sort of a sit back and listen moment was gabriel abed of bit who talked about kind of like his journey to you know help um the barbados government i guess uh create their digital their their central bank digital currency so um yeah so he was kind of like a fun and entertaining guest and i'm sure there are others um but there are other questions that kind of touch on the subject so i will i will save those guests for those other questions the next question comes from ben zhang who writes in financial venture history we saw the rise of the pal mafia where discontent and network went on to create many new ventures and projects from which group do you see a similar trend unfolding in the crypto space for example ethereum or coinbase where they continue to help each other in the network and um and he mentions that you know he's thinking about how some of the ethereum co-founders went on to develop cardano and polkadot and how coinbase people have now started things like polychain and dydx etc and a coinbase i actually think may have even more because you know there's like linda shea who went on to do scalar capital nicktomeno who does one confirmation yeah there there's just a lot i think diego monica i think may have worked at coinbase and now he does anchorage um so there's there's actually quite a few i mean coinbase is you know the ethereum co-founders there were only eight of them and then for coinbase people there's you know tons more coinbase people so um you know i think obviously we are seeing that happen um i think what's interesting with the ethereum story is that i'm sure people know that there's a little bit of bad blood amongst the co-founders and so in that regard i think some of the other blockchains are looking to be competitive um or at least they're perceived that way um even when sometimes they're actually not that similar um to ethereum so so that's kind of an interesting thread that i do see but for sure i i think you know because the space is so young that if somebody has experience at a successful company early on then it's just it just gives you so much more of a leg up in a way than anybody who's kind of coming in now even though even though there's still so much green what do they call it green fields uh where you know they're like a lot of stuff just hasn't been created and so i don't want to discourage anybody who has um only just entered the space but you know for somebody who kind of really has already lived through all the ups and downs especially early on when there really was no infrastructure in place it like it kind of reminds me of how i started working at newsweek.com back in 1998 and i learned a little bit of html and i know it sounds so stupid but in a way like that just helped me as the industry kind of kept changing against maybe some of the older people who weren't familiar with those things oh and by the way speaking of the coin based mafia um fred ursum the co-founder you know is another obvious example because he went on to found paradigm which is you know one of the very active venture capital firms in the space okay next question from steve strong and actually so i lumped three questions together because people have a lot of curiosity about this um so i'll kind of let them all ask it in with their own angle and then i'll answer so steve strohn asked i understand you have not purchased bitcoin or any other crypto asset in order to avoid a conflict of interest under what circumstances would you begin to purchase bitcoin or any other crypto asset is there a point at which not owning bitcoin but owning usd may be seen as a conflict of interest that may creep into your reporting and scott wrote has it been hard to remain a no coiner knowing the roi that top cryptos have produced compared to other markets and also has this been an obstacle in building credibility and then terry so asked for someone with such an amazing upfront view what's really stopping you from going all in on crypto so um so just to correct the record for steve um when so when i worked at forbes the policy was that if you covered something that you could own it but you had to disclose it so i did at that time own a little bit of bitcoin and also a little bit of ether and then once i was out on my own and i wanted to write some freelance articles the first place that i wanted to write for was a place where like you they didn't have that policy you just couldn't own it if you were gonna cover it and you know so this this maybe goes to the other questions like from terry who asked you know what's really stopping me from going all in on crypto or from scott asking if it's been hard for me to remain a no coiner so here's the thing you know as much as i am completely obsessed with crypto and have lived and breathed this for like over six years and just from the moment i learned about it became super super obsessed at the same time i'm a writer and journalist first it's just it's just who i am you know i wanted to be a writer since i was nine years old and there was a period when i kind of left journalism for a little bit i was super unhappy during that time and once i came back i mean i've just been like this is my place this is what i'm meant to do this is who i meant to be i just have no question about that and so if some of the rules of my industry are that you know in order to cover this for certain publications i can't own it like you know what that's it it doesn't bother me it's like that's just that's just what my place is and um you know when it comes to like seeing the roi of course i mean it's like it's not it's not obvious to me that oh right if i had kept that little bit of bitcoin like oh it would be worth whatever now it's not like i can't figure that out um but at the same time i just feel like if the price of of enjoying those monetary gains would be that i can't write about this thing that i've had more professional fun doing than like anything else in my entire life then no way like you can't pay me enough money to not do this work i love it like i'm just having so much fun so in that regard has been hard no it's not been hard because i just am enjoying what i'm doing so much and if that's what i have to do to do it then like it's totally fine with me um you know the other thing though is as i have mentioned on twitter like i work for myself right it's like i could i could say i don't want to write for those publications and so therefore i'm just going to own these and i'm just going to disclose what i own and it's going to be fine and you know at the moment i personally would rather just write for those publications um if there comes a day when maybe i've written for them and i feel like okay you know i've got that notch on my belt and i don't really need to kind of like follow their rules anymore then yeah maybe at that point i'll just buy and i'll disclose what i own and you know whatever but i honestly like a lot of people seem to think that this is like something i might struggle with or they can't understand how or why and i'm like do you not have anything that you love so much in the world that like people couldn't even pay you enough enough money to to like give it up and and honestly that's how i feel about covering crypto like that's that's really that's really it you know so no it doesn't bother me um okay next question this comes from dylan bricks how do you think about dows what applications of daos are having the most impact what do you think is the trajectory of the evolution of the space so some of you i think have seen my tedx talk and um that kind of really was about dowse in a way the the angle that i talked about was a little bit more what i was calling like user ownership meaning um that instead of this business model that we currently have where these big tech companies kind of use our data and then sell that and make money off of that like i do think that crypto networks could create a different sort of business model where the users are also part owners in the network and that is that is basically a kind of doubt you know i didn't really focus so much on the organizational aspect in that talk um but that's really what i was talking about and so um frankly i think that's so revolutionary i know i've said this well i don't know where i've said it maybe on twitter or even on the show i'm not sure but um the truth is that every time i think about this i'm just like whoa this is such a big idea and i really feel like ultimately when all is said and done like this is going to be the big thing that kind of comes out of crypto frankly that's just my personal opinion um but you know i feel like the space is probably too young at the moment to really get a sense of what that's going to look like but essentially my kind of theory about this is that over you know the last 20 odd years we've just seen that our communities are moving online and you know i think this was really underscored during the pandemic where for a lot of people um in a way i mean obviously i mean it really depends kind of like um just yeah how your life is generally structured but for a lot of people their communities you know are online and so they were able to kind of like keep up certain aspects of their lives or connect with you know people around those interests in an online space and you know it just feels like so much of our world does already happen online but there's no way for us to govern those spaces and that's why you know we saw these controversies with facebook and twitter and how they were intersecting with things like our own government and you know who should hold the power uh when it comes to certain questions uh you know where the digital online space intersects with um kind of you know like what people tend to call meat space i i really think that we are going to see crypto being used as a solution to address some of those issues um you know i don't know how long it's going to take i feel like so many things will need to happen for that to work um for instance i think that blockchain-based identities will need to be a much bigger thing um or a thing rather and i do know some people who are thinking about interesting things when it comes to dows and how they intersect with the real world and you know i'm so curious to see where all that goes um but frankly at the moment i really feel like the tech is just so far in its infancy that um this thing which i truly think is going to be the big big big idea that comes out of all of this is kind of a ways off so um frankly i will just keep covering it until we get there because i am so interested and um and like i said i do think that this will eventually be the way that we govern ourselves in what so far has been this kind of like a borderless internet well except for one other internet over there in china which is different from ours um and or uh also shout out to you know the land of my ancestors north korea where it's also a different internet but anyway okay next question from gene martino who were your most favorite and least favorite guests so i'm gonna have to go with most favorite and not talk about any least favorite because the most favorite ones come to mind more easily than the least favorite um but i think some of you know you've heard me talk about how cz is one of my favorites and only because you know i'm known for asking tough questions but he is really good at giving good answers back and i really really enjoy someone who just like really engages and isn't afraid to to just say what they think so so yes um definitely cz milton who i already mentioned just because she's so entertaining um another one which i know a lot of people you know have told me that this was an impactful episode for them was the one with janmi park the north korean um defector who now is a human rights advocate and works a lot with the human rights foundation and um she you know just kind of like talked a little bit about what it was like going up there and it really gave you a glimpse um into how um you know it's just a world that's so separate and and this was in the context context of explaining how you know if virtual griffith from the ethereum foundation really thought he was going to help north koreans uh what he was doing was the exact opposite um royal maboob was also an amazing guest and as you know some of you may know either her or some of her more favorite famous projects such as the um i think was the girls was it oh the robotics team from afghanistan um where i think something happened with their visas but then uh you know they the visa situation got resolved and they were able to participate in a competition here in the us and you know she's done all kinds of really great tech entrepreneurial things in afghanistan and also worked with bitcoin for some of her companies there and so she you know just really talked about how bitcoin was able to change the lives of a bunch of women that used her startups and so that was really great um olaf carlson we have poly chain capitals another one just because um whenever i talk to him you know as a reporter i feel like i'm kind of like looking out a certain amount and when i talk to olaf i can always tell he's just like a few steps ahead which i really enjoy um and chris bruniski is also kind of in that same bucket and he's got this great analytical mind and he has been one of the people to kind of you know formulate some of the great models for us to think about crypto assets and so you know for him um i just really enjoy how he takes kind of his traditional financial background and that analysis and applies it in this space in fresh and new ways oh and also speaking of vietnamese park i would have to say alex gladstein as well of the human rights foundation who i'm sure many of you know just is such um kind of a cutting-edge thinker when it comes to thinking about how bitcoin can be applied in a human rights context and so i always enjoy talking with him and learning a lot more about um kind of arenas that i'm much less familiar with some of the others are willie wu who um many of you know he was just on the show and hilariously there was like a previous show i did with him where one of the youtube commenters was like laura's making eyes at willy and i was like what um but i think the reason was because the the coin price was like going up and up and up and we checked it right before the show and we were like shocked by the number and so we started the show we were like laughing kind of um a lot when we started so i don't know if that's what that was about but anyway um some other people kathy wood um who you know she was the mentor to chris burniske and she's just one of those people you get her on the show and she's just like a firehose of data and information and like really backs up everything she says and she's such a big macro thinker and such a kind of futuristic thinker so i always enjoy hearing from her um hester purse the sec commissioner who um is also very forward-thinking especially for a regulator and really gets this tech and is yeah just somebody who doesn't make a knee-jerk response to things but a very thoughtful one and really um you know is dedicated to learning about the technology and thinking in deep ways about how that intersects with regulation and i could go on and on and on because there are so many people um shout out to andre cronia who i really had a fun conversation with andrea santanopoulos who is obviously one of the great communicators and so nice to boot and haseeb qureshi who i would also put in that spot and taylor monahan who's highly entertaining and also just really incisive so anyway on i could go on and on and on but those are some of my favorite guests what are you most fearful and most hopeful about in the crypto d5 space and this question is from chuck wilde um so let's see fearful um i would say at the moment uh and and because i've been working on the book so intently i really have not been able to keep up on news anywhere near as much as i would like but you know i've tried to report on this a little bit i don't know how much people are paying attention but these new fat f roles as they might apply to d5 they definitely have me concerned because um to my mind they don't there's something you know it's really a change in philosophy um in my opinion from the uh kind of previous fincen rules where you know that kind of regulation only applied to companies that were custody in crypto assets and so in this case where they could apply uh these kinds of aml and kyc requirements to developers and things like that that's something that to me you know signifies a significant change and i don't know how clearly it's been thought through and i do wonder how that would affect the crypto space and frankly just the development of this technology so um you know i actually basically think they might be um meeting about that sometime very soon so as soon as i turn my book and i will try to do a little bit more reporting and and let people know about that and what i'm hopeful about is dowse as i mentioned um but along with dao's quadratic voting i think is such a great idea you know i've been wanting to dive into some of the projects that are using that i know git coin does and i think there are some others and i really think that that is a great way to kind of work as an anecdote against what some people see in our society as a lot of inequality or um kind of like the ability for the very wealthy to um kind of own lawmakers and um and we can also see the same thing happen when people do on-chain votes but i do feel like quadratic voting would be a way to counteract that and as i said my tedx talk i do think that user ownership is going to be a really cool thing and it's going to allow a lot more people to work for themselves which i think a lot of people really would want to do um you know for me i've done that for most of my career and you know just every time i'm kind of in a space where i'm my independent self working like i'm just so much happier than i am working for somebody else so um i feel like a lot of people would enjoy that and i um do hope that crypto enables that next question from charles what are some missing catalysts that would ultimately encourage more people to adopt crypto so um for those of you who listened to my episode with nick tomano recently where he said all he looks for when he goes to invest is great products i i you know that i don't know if i would have thought of that before hearing that from him but it makes so much sense when you just look at simple things like how in 2017 you know even even though the ico craze really you know was drawing in a lot of new people it wasn't until cryptokitties that kind of like everyday people really got into ethereum and in a big big way and that's because that was a user-friendly product where you don't already have to be into crypto to be interested in it and that's why i think cryptokitties and nba top shot are such great ideas and um really something that can get you know just any random person interested you know i think nfts in general are really good for that and jake brookman came on my show and talked about that about how he felt like nfts were bringing in normal people and it's true when it comes to me and my friends um once the nft crazed like a bunch of my friends are creative people and so once that took off i was kind of texting them and calling them and being like hey you have to check out this enot thing like you should put your artwork out this way you should put your music out this way you should you know blah blah blah and so you know in that regard i do feel like really the the main um you know missing catalyst to more people adopting crypto is pretty much frankly just more user friendly products obviously on ethereum the gas fees are a problem i think multiple people probably have heard me discuss now how when i went to buy the kings of leon nft i made 90 dollars in gas piece which was terrible um so yeah if you know if that could be result then i'm sure a lot more people would participate um but the other thing i would say is that i also still feel like the wallet situation is not fully figured out and you know i mean i here i am just speaking from my few little forays and actually using this like even though i covered this well personally also because of the book i just haven't been using the technology anywhere anywhere near as much as i would like um i think that's gonna change soon now that i'm really wrapping things up with the book but um you know even with a few times that i've been working with this i've had bad experiences and i think some of you heard that i lost like 500 worth of like within 15 minutes of getting the money so that was really terrible terrible um okay next question from mike i'd love to hear your favorite projects in define how you perceive the defy space i think i'll have to go with why wi-fi or wi-fi um maybe right now uh just because the origin story of that was so great um but another one that these are two frankly that i love are uniswap and sushi swap and me also i love them because of that whole story about the vampire mining um that to me was just like such a gripping moment in crypto and i feel like i watched every moment of that and was just really really fascinated by the whole thing and um and you know uniswap you know now is so dominant and and v3 is obviously doing amazing and so i you know i i just yeah it's it's just frankly fascinating to me to see kind of how um crypto loyalty works and um yeah and just kind of how people just fall in love with certain tokens or certain projects um and yeah and how really um as long as people keep innovating like that's what will draw people in so um i think those really interest me um yeah in general what i will say about defy is that i really think that that will also draw in a certain type of person you know even as much as i was talking about the nfts i remember that i was explaining kind of like some of the coins on coinbase to somebody and um and pointed out like oh yeah if you hold this coin like it gives you some x percent of interest and like you know it's a large percent of interest compared to what you would get at a bank i mean granted it's because you know these are like untested coins and it's kind of like risky or whatever um but that person like just you know their eyes like lit up in a way where they got it and um and so in that sense like yeah i think d5 definitely will also get a lot of people interested um so lee quinn asks she said that she'd love to hear more about the business aspects of podcast production okay so let's see what would i say about that well probably the main thing is that when it comes to the actual podcast hosting it can be pretty inexpensive like i literally don't even remember how much my mic was it might have been like 80 bucks or something um and uh the hosting per month i think is like dollars or so i don't even remember um you know but just a lot of the basic things can be pretty nominal um however what i will say is that random things can be very expensive like um there was kind of this weird and random issue that came up around the trademark for unchained and um the person that i was like tussling with over this they so they had never even used the trademark okay so i don't know why they like cared so badly because i had actually used it but anyway or or used the name um but then this person actually literally said to my lawyer at one point something implying like i just want to rack up the bills for your client like like they just wanted to kind of make me pay these lawyers fees and my lawyer relayed this to me so um you know i i would have to actually tally of how much that costs but it probably cost me i don't know i'm just gonna i literally don't know but it might be like you know three or four months worth of what i normally pay out to my staff so that's like a lot of money um so yeah so i just would say for the basics it's like fine it's you know not terrible um probably depends on how big you go you know obviously at the beginning i didn't have um as many people working for me um and even now actually thankfully i've been able to trim it down because i have kind of one person who like there was one role that initially i wanted to be one role but then i couldn't find like one person to fill that so then i had split it out into two rolls for a while but now it's back in a one so now i have a smaller group of people working for me so um yeah so that's those are kind of my major tips but i would say you know write from the get-go like it doesn't have to be a huge investment all right so we're going to take a break just to hear from the sponsors who make the show possible but we will be right back with my ama tasos lets you easily exchange smart money throughout our digital world a

memorable thing you learned throughout these last five years from doing the podcast um so okay the number one thing that i remember learning was that the power of one's voice is much greater than just from writing articles and having people kind of like see your byline and the way that i figured that out was i started the podcast in june 2016 and in i forget what month it was but it was basically like spring 2017 i think i remember going to some conference and multiple people came up to me and said oh i love your podcast and you know by then i'd been writing articles on crypto for two years and i'd only been doing the podcast for one year or slightly less but they associated me with the podcast and they weren't mentioning the articles so much and so you know and not only that but you know i've been writing articles for like decades before then so when i kind of figured out that oh they're suddenly just associating me with this podcast um it made me realize like oh yeah you know when it comes to me and my relationship to the podcast that i listen to all the time and really love like yeah i feel like i kind of know the host like like my one so one of my favorite podcasts is the new york times book review podcast and um you know it's like i i know the host i kind of like know a little bit about her life and then there's at a certain point they have these different reviewers that often come on and they talk about what they reviewed that week and then there's like different book editors that also come in or a different like book beat reporters like there's one who always talks about the book publishing industry and so um you know i just i know all their voices and i kind of know a little bit about their lives and like what they like to read and stuff like that and so anyway um that for me that was probably one of the main takeaways um but you know what's fascinating is as much as i've loved doing the podcast i would still say writing is my first love um but i do feel that in a way this mix of doing the show and the book writing is just perfect for me and it sort of reminds me of the days there was like a long stretch where i was a freelance writer and also taught yoga and it was like perfect because you know i would get my kind of private creative time when i was just doing my own thing and then i would have this other time where i was interacting with other people because i'm an extrovert and you know that's what i like to do so in that sense yeah i feel like um i feel like the mix is good for me okay another question well oh three questions from victor boone and i'll i'll start with the first one if you have time to start another podcast what topic or area would you cover so i've i've thought about focusing uh like doing something whether it's i don't yeah i don't know if it would be a show or a newsletter or or just a series of articles or i i don't know what what this would be i literally have not had time to think about anything except the book the podcast like sleeping eating and exercising for a long time so um anyway uh if i were to start another podcast maybe i would do d5 or dowse um as i've said you know i i am very interested in those but it might just be a little early for that um defy is kind of like another virgin area that just has a lot of rabbit holes within it and i feel like i would easily get sucked into that and be very fascinating so um could be that or if it were to be kind of non-crypto i'm sure a bunch of you have heard me talk about my interest in like meditation and yoga and spiritual things and i also talked about how when i meditate i um do chanting in pranayama and somebody was like you're more indian than me and i he was indian but um that's all hold over from my yoga teaching days which victor also asked which of your contributions to crypto are you most proud of so i would have to say it's uh when people come up to me and say that because of my shows they now work in the space and i've had a bunch of people over the years who've come up to me and and said that and um yeah it just i have to say it makes me feel really good that um you know they found something that they were passionate about and that through the work that i've done that i was able to kind of like give them enough information and comfort that this would be an area that would be worth jumping into um you know and this is just a general message for everyone you know as i've kind of pursued what i just really loved these last few years meaning you know as i became completely obsessed with crypto and really didn't want to do anything else ever again um i've had so much fun doing this and so yes if you find something that you love and if you are listening to this and you don't currently work in crypto but you love it then you should make the leap i'm just gonna tell you right now um okay and so let's see victor's last question is what would need to happen in crypto what level of success must it reach for you to feel mission accomplished and to do something else so for me it wouldn't be that something happened in crypto that made me decide to leave covering it um but it would it would definitely be something like you know covering it didn't feel like a challenge to me anymore i didn't feel like i was like learning new things um or that covering it became too easy for me the general history of my work is if something becomes easy for me to do i kind of lose all interest in it so um if that were to ever happen i probably would be like next [Laughter] um okay ed rodriguez asks what the most surprising answer is to an interview oh um there are a couple one which i don't know if people caught this but when i interviewed vitalik in the live event at one point he kind of like offhandedly said that the ethereum foundation really didn't talk about the the price of each very much because like early on because they were worried about the sec and i he may not have used those exact words i should have used it looked at the exact words or maybe he just said they were worried about regulation but i was like oh he's like full on admitting that um another surprising answer was when cz was trying to say that binance is decentralized and he was comparing it to bitcoin okay that doesn't make any sense and i'm sure he knows that and i don't know how he thought he could pull the wool over all of our eyes with that but yeah uh a couple others there was somebody who at one point refused to go on with the show when i said something and just was like i quit i'm not doing this anymore we managed to convince this person to continue it took 35 minutes but we did and um so that has been deleted out but i was like what is going on here um and then the last one again i'm not gonna say this was but i asked somebody uh what their organization did as their very first question and they couldn't answer and so i had to change to ask about their background first and that was also a surprise to me but it must have just been nerves um so okay next question in your time as an interviewer have you ever had one single moment that felt like an epiphany or a change in paradigm and this is cryptalista who's asking me this um you know the only thing i could really think of when um i saw this question and maybe this is just because this was like a pretty recent show was when i interviewed mark cuban and i opened by asking him about some comments he'd made where um you know he just said he kind of thought he could see it being more likely that eth would end up as a story of value and when i asked him about that and he was kind of talking about how he felt that if because it was used for more things like more people would want to buy it and hold it to use it for all the various things that they might use it for and um and that that made sense to me um you know i think the reason why i had never thought of it that way before was because the digital gold narrative and the strength of bitcoin's monetary policy all of that makes a lot of sense and it's like very easy to grasp that and so what mark cuban was saying was just kind of a like a really different way of looking at at these crypto assets and it wasn't something that i had really considered um you know because obviously eth just at that time at least you know in a month we're going to see a change in the monetary policy but at that time um or even now which is now he he only came on the show a few months ago it it doesn't really have that kind of monetary policy and so um i think the idea of it as a story of value was kind of like a little bit more nebulous um but i do think now yeah i i can see what he's talking about and i'll be interested to see how this whole thing plays out with the adoption of eip 1559 um next question from david stearns which will be the three most important cryptocurrencies three years from now so good time frame that you picked there because it's a little tricky right there's going to be a lot that's going gonna happen in the next few years um i would probably still have to go with bitcoin and ether as the top two most important frankly um i think it's for obvious reasons you know bitcoin obviously has the greatest adoption ether has the second greatest adoption and those two aren't exactly competitive so in that regard they're yeah that i just feel like they're gonna keep going kind of maybe in the way that they have you know obviously if it does have the scaling issues but in a way those are being resolved um i'm sure some of you heard that kane warrick and kyle simani do look at solana as being a potential real competitor to ethereum and definitely taking put you know potentially taking market share and you know for sure i will be interested to see how this plays out i did see a bunch of tweets recently about a a lot of interest in the solana hackathon and a lot could change in a few years but at the moment you know just with the whole ethereum ecosystem and the developer um activity there um you know right now it definitely looks like that would still maintain its number two spot and so for number three i i actually number three was the tricky one right it's like what could that be and hopefully this isn't cheating but because you you did term as cryptocurrencies but my thought frankly was it's going to be a stable coin and so i was i think i'm going to put my money on usdc i know that at this moment in time it makes more sense to put your money on usdt and it very well could be usdt actually now that i'm thinking about this more i'm like i should put my money in usd because um so okay let me just back up so the reason why i initially was thinking maybe i would say usdc for the third spot is because i do feel like you know obviously more regulation is coming and so that's why we are seeing that usdc is kind of becoming more widely adopted uh like the the pace at which it's being adopted is accelerating um but then you know if you look at things like finance where um the regulatory status is like a little bit less clear you know i would say usd team maybe falls in the same bucket then um you know that a lot of people want to play in that space so it really could be usdt and um and right now usdt does kind of like at least have um the regular reports that they have to make to the uh to the new york ag and so in that regard like um there's just there's there's probably going to be a little bit more comfort using it i i mean granted i know some people when they looked closely at what exactly was backing it and it's not at all what what it was originally promised to me i i'm sure that gives some people pause um but you know because of what i was saying about how a lot of people kind of want to play in that more nebulous regulatory space who knows it could be usdt still so we'll have to see um okay sledge asks how do you land your guests is it easier given your success or harder than ever with crypto economy and culture on fire you know i will say that honestly in recent months i have probably put a little bit less effort into the podcast than i would normally and so um i do feel that since i haven't given my full effort that i might have more success if i was giving my full effort and so yeah i have been kind of looking for like people that are a little bit easier to book frankly just because i kind of needed as much time as i could get for for the book but i don't know if my success has changed at all in terms of or changed the uh changed my ability to get guests or not um i i think what i will say is that there's a lot more specialization and i haven't really specialized and so in that regard i think that in certain circles if somebody's like an eighth then they may not know me so much as you know a podcast that only covers eth or if somebody's like really only into bitcoin then they may know um another outlet that only focuses on that as opposed to me so in that regard i'm sure it frankly it helps me with some guess and it hurts me with other guests but it's not something i really think about because i just have to do what i am comfortable with doing and um you know just pursue my own vision of things and uh frankly you know it's working out fine um i am looking forward to you know not having to spend so much time on the book and to really kind of get back into the show and kind of into the news happening now because i do feel like i've been a little bit out of the loop compared to you know previous times all right gabriel asks i'm looking forward to your book will you be featured in any more documentaries in the future okay uh at the moment no because you know i had there there have been a lot of requests actually but i have not really been doing anything extraneous beyond the book and podcast so as far as as far as things being in the works now no roman asks do you think you already interviewed satoshi no and also asked do you think he would recognize satoshi if you interviewed him her or them so if so if it were just kind of like a random show and i was just interviewing them and i was interviewing them for some other reason and you know not because i thought they were satoshi or something i may not um if i i have thought oh would i ever want to try to investigate who it was the only thing is that would just take so long and um yeah i just i don't know so i i'm i have a feeling i probably won't um try to investigate that so yeah you know what i probably will not recognize this person over because i would need to do a lot of research and come up with a theory first um and i do not have that now so if i ever end up interviewing satoshi i will probably not know it all right song says if you could be anywhere in the world right now where would you want to be and why so i i can't actually uh give too many details on this but let's just say that there was something that happened in the book and it took place at this very fancy nice place in a very very optimal location and um my fact checker and i were looking at this and i i was like whoa like this is kind of like a paradise and um he he made a joke basically saying because the person who shared this with me you know said like that it is possible to to book this place and um and so yeah so i now the joke is like oh when i finish the book i'm going to go to this you know lovely spot on the planet and just live this decadent and luxurious life so we'll see um okay manu asks how would you advise someone without experience looking to get into the industry so the main thing and i think i've said this before on other shows is that this whole space is just being built right now right it's not like there's all these rules that have been set up in these structures and it's not like things have been done this way for a gazillion years um like i don't know for i like to go to italy a lot but sometimes when you're there it's kind of like this funny thing where you realize that they're you know it's like made in italy means quality right and so they're kind of like they have this set i know mindset about how things should be done and it's very funny to an american but anyway um but here when it comes to crypto everything's really new and so you just you know talk to anybody in crypto they were working in some completely different field not that long ago so just think about how your skills are transferable i mean pretty much from any other industry your skills are going to be transferable in some fashion yeah i'm a journalist and you know what does writing have to do with cryptography and tokens and whatnot like nothing but you know i can cover what's going on so um the other thing i would say is like just get started don't be picky you can kind of scan the landscape from whatever your first purchase and move into the perfect spot later if you have ever heard linda shea's story she started at coinbase in compliance and yeah now she runs crypto hedge funds so um you know it's a really different type of work that she's doing now but she just got in learned about it from where she was and then made her move into where she wanted to go after that and the other thing i would say is if you jump in a crypto be creative and think big nothing's set in stone yet and so don't think too hard about following the rules or just don't get caught up and stuff like that just be creative let's make something new let's let's not do things the way that we have done in the past well i kind of answered this already but i'll just quickly cover these dan hannum asks what the most impactful episode was that was definitely the one with yanmi park where she talked about her life in north korea and escaping hugely hugely impactful and the most enjoyable recording as i mentioned was the one with melton chill they just had me cracking up zw asks who in crypto has been the hardest to interview slash me or someone you wish would return for another episode but it hasn't returned your calls rohem garrogosly this is a shout out to you i've made a few different requests and been turned down for reasons i don't understand even though he and i also shared like personally friendly messages over something totally unrelated so i would love to have you back um all right jor law says what has this experience meant for you and what are your best memories of the last five years the main thing that i would say is what i've learned is if you really want something you should just go for it don't be afraid just just do what it is that your heart calls you to do you don't know where it's going to lead you and you know i see a lot of people who kind of are in jobs that make them unhappy and they're kind of scared to leave and blah blah but what's the worst that's going to happen you know okay so maybe you try something and maybe it fails well you can always get another job or you know you can pivot and do something else and you know i like i don't know how many of you are also a fan of the writer elizabeth gilbert but she gave this great talk that i have listened to multiple times and you know in it she she just says like you know if there's something that you want to do uh i mean for her the way the talk is frame it's like she's talking about creating if you have something that you want to create you know what's your alternative it's to just keep your life the same as it is and and to not grow and not change and not have this experience and you know frankly my attitude is like why did we all come to this planet if it's not to create and take risks and have adventures and in my mind there are no failures they're only lessons so that's my big takeaway frankly from doing this podcast and for those of you who don't know the story there was a moment you know forbes started the podcast for me and then they dropped it after the first season and i had to keep it going and i loved doing it so much i worked really hard to find a sponsor i i was sure that i would find a sponsor and i finally did and you know it was that for that year where i had that sponsored that was for the year 2017 when the whole crypto space took off and you know the downloads really grew on the show so um it was i'm really really glad that i just there was something in me i was like i love doing this i have to keep doing it i'm not gonna stop and you know i'm glad that i did that so and look where i am five years later oh and jor also asked my best memory the last five years this is very recent someone emailed me recently and said that a podcast episode i did not that long ago inspired them to change their job so that was that was really lovely what has surprised you most about how the space has evolved over the last five years this is from show me the crypto um i will say the nft thing kind of came out of nowhere for me but maybe i was wrapped up in my book and not really paying that much attention what was going on i mean i did cover the first people sale in the fall the first big one for i think was like 3.6 million and i knew at that time like definitely something was happening but i still feel like i kind of lost track of it before just all of that uh you know came out of the woodwork in the winter what i would say also about the way the space has evolved in the last five years is just it's gotten so big and diverse in terms of the types of things that are going on that i definitely have think have been thinking a lot more about specializing in certain areas at least for certain products in a way that i never did before all right last question from jackie t other than covering crypto what journalistic pursuit slash goals you have in mind for the future i want to write more books and i will all right i think that wraps it up for the five year anniversary episode thanks to everyone who sent in questions and thanks so much for listening to my show throughout these years i cannot say at all um what this show and what you all have meant to me meant to me i really truly appreciate that you all have taken the time to listen to me and to support my work i'm thankful to all the sponsors as well who have supported the show all these five years and frankly you guys i'm super excited for you all to read my book which is where i've really been putting most of my effort these last few years and so yeah i'm excited to share that all with you thank you all again for listening these last few years and here's to more fun crazy and intellectually stimulating times in crypto unchained is produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel ness and mark murdock thanks for listening you
