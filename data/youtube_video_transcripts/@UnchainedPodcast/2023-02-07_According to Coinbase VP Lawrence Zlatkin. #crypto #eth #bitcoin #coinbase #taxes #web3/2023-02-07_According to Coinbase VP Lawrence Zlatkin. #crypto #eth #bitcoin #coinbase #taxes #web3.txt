don't make the mistake that just because you didn't receive a report or information from someone that you if you have income that you derive from crypto on D5 or elsewhere that you don't have to report that because you actually do and uh so and the most important thing about owning crypto unfortunately is record keeping because it's essentially decentralized it puts more of the burden on you to keep track of your assets that's benefit overall because of the better you track them the more you can evaluate when to trigger gains or losses what those gains losses otherwise are otherwise at some point you may receive a report from a brokerage which has a zero base this is just like a blank because it doesn't really know what your basis is so it's really on you to sort of keep track and keep good records for associated with your assets
