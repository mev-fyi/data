today's guest is JW verret associate professor of law at George Mason law school and of council at Lauren's law welcome to JW good to be here Laura longtime fam on Monday coinbase filed a court action seeking to compel the Securities and Exchange Commission to give specific rulemaking on crypto assets can you explain what this court action hopes to do and what brought coinbase to this point well this is a culmination of a number of years in which coinbase and other exchanges other crypto exchanges have been looking for a pathway to fit into the current regulatory regime so they've tried a number of things they've tried to get a special broker dealer license they've tried to get a regulation ATS license which is kind of a mini exchange license Kraken strike to do the same thing and they've all been denied in their efforts to do this so another thing coinbase tried to do was uh request for public rulemaking any member of the public can file one of these with the SEC and request a formal rule be proposed usually the SEC ignores them sometimes you know some of those you can imagine when you allow anybody from the public to do a proposal some of those are kind of crazy town right they're kind of like the worst blog comment you've ever seen some of them are very thorough I actually did one in January last year calling for something very similar to what coinbase asked for the coinbase had a lot more detail about what they're asking for so anyway they filed that and then now we're we're just after a situation where the SEC is sent a Wells notice to coinbase it's kind of a threat to Sue it's a shot across the bow and some notice about what's coming it used to be an opportunity to negotiate with the SEC and 10 20 of the time you could talk them out of suing you they've cracked down quite a bit under against those so that's really not the case anymore and after the wills noticed that that that incentive to negotiate with the SEC has kind of disappeared so uh what coinbase has done is they've said okay we're going to take the initiative we're going to sue first we're going to sue you you're going to sue us we're going to assume you counter suit is often uh sometimes a useful strategy it's pretty rare to countersue your Regulators pretty bold but I think it has some interesting strategic thinking behind it I can see some deep chests behind this move so I'd be able to kind of go into that but hopefully that lays the basics of what what the suit's about I'm sorry you said you said D chess like the game chess I think there's some chess moves going on here some short-term intermediate term and even long term just strategy being laid out here you know what do you mean so what are those different strategies so in the short term coinbase in the SEC are posturing with each other and the SEC the SEC Center Wells notice to coinbase between that and the things they've already revealed about their discussions with the SEC it seems the SEC has threatened as sort of a kitchen sink strategy for what they're going to sue coinbase about about staking and about token listings unregistered the claim of unregistered token liquids and something to do with a wallet I'm not quite sure what but kind of a kitchen sink approach they put in something much much broader than the case that settled with Kraken so now the esses the sec's threatened that but maybe the complaint Narrows down a bit maybe I think in the short term coinbase is posturing and saying you know what rather than going in to negotiate with you and meet with you we're going to publicly sue you and do something that's going to help a long-term strategy maybe that discourages the SEC from a kitchen sink approach in the complaint we'll see but I think it's worth a try in the intermediate term and the longer term here's what I think is going on here just with respect to the writ of mandates the we asked you to do a a rulemaking on tailored exchange rules for crypto exchanges the SEC can say you know what the SEC has a legal obligation to respond they don't have a legalization to do it just to respond under the law the SEC can simply say you know what here's our response we reviewed it and we're not going to do it so they can it's that simple for the SEC and they can win that particular case but I think it sets up strategic advantages for coinbase in their defense against the ultimate enforcement action that we all know is coming in some parameter or other whether it's tailored toward maybe just staking or wider toward kitchen sink everything I think if the SEC does that and it's the easiest way for them to win the man Davis a Curt kind of response yeah we looked at it we're not going to do it I think that builds a record in the enforcement action for coinbase to say you see judge we tried we tried to get a pathway to register and it helps to build a record in a court case which I think is better than the kind of public record in crypto we know we talk about all the time the kind of obsequiousness of ginsler speeches and come in and register but we know registration is impossible uh under the current dynamic in the current regime it puts all of that at a court record and I think that helps build in an intermediate term maybe a fair notice defense for coinbase kinda like the fair notice defense that ripples uh arguing in their case and in the longer term and maybe this is for to get into it a little bit later if this goes up to the Supreme Court I think this builds a record that maybe allows the Supreme Court to change the how we test itself which is which is could be how this case ends up playing out if coinbase wins wow wow wait main takeaways I'm hearing are first um when Gensler says in public uh crypto companies are not being compliant they should be coming in and registering and they're not doing it part of this court action is to have a record showing that there isn't actually a way for crypto companies to comply that's step one but then you are saying the ultimate goal is to actually change the how he did that I had not heard before so expound a little bit on that sure let me just I'll mention a little bit about the last question just a few things to kind of add on to that so I I think the the kind of snare trap that coinbase is laying here is is they're laying up a case where the SEC could easily win with a Kirk response we looked at it no we're not doing anything and if they step into that that helps coinbase's defense If instead the SEC says okay we looked into it and gives a really substantive answer then that gets into some pretty complicated questions involved here which again helps I think their defense so I think it's an interesting strategic move okay so long term when we talk about the Howie test there are a lot of Securities lawyers some who come on your show who who take the view that if they take them the one District Court opinion with the most liberal interpretation of the Howie test then that's the law and everybody has to comply if that's the way you look at it there's not much future for crypto right now right I mean if you take the if the library case for example which is a pretty liberal approach if the library cases is going to always be the law then man there are a lot of tokens that are not going to survive that but oftentimes the Supreme Court will change this Doctrine we'll change the law or we'll tailor the alarm or shift the law it happens a lot in Securities Law the SEC in fact loses a thought in front of the Supreme Court where the doctrine changes I think in the last five or six cases they've lost three or four of them and some of them have been nine o votes so a fairly divided politically divided court but 9-0 it's a heck of a defeat when nine of them say you lose SEC all right that's that's kind of hurt It's gotta hurt uh so here's here's here's what's interesting so last year in December there was a case called West Virginia versus EPA this is a really important case for crypto so this is a case that expanded on a Doctrine in the Supreme Court that's been growing called the major questions Doctrine so to go back into history in the 1970s 1980s Justice Scalia created this Doctrine called Chevron I'm saying the case involving Chevron it was fairly deferential to administrative agencies independent agencies like the SEC and other agencies that regulate across the spectrum of policy issues that was fairly differential this is during the Reagan Administration there's a lot of deregulation and it was kind of helpful to the cause of deregulation to have some deference to agents then that changed over time and that difference led to some real increases in regulation so the code of federal regulations has grown by millions of pages since then kind of the idea in conservative and libertarian judges has been to take a different route to administrative law and more skeptical administrative law and a Doctrine that's doing that is called the major questions doctor so this is something that Justice Kavanaugh has written about and Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch are big proponents of the major question of Doctrine so here's what it is the idea is when the Supreme Court sees an agency trying to enforce the statute and they see a situation where an agency is trying to regulate a major national question of significant National political or economic importance but they're using some provision in an old statute that doesn't seem to quite fit what they're trying to regulate sound familiar right sound familiar already is going to be very skeptical of that effort so a few cases where it's happened before the doj tried to regulate physician assisted suicide through the through the criminal scheduling of Narcotics so you use those scheduled narcotics to do physician assistant suicide and the court said no no that's not the purpose of that law the purpose of that law is to stop illicit sales of drugs it's not to regulate Physicians and so though it seems like you could kind of fit the statute into what you're trying to do the frequency no that's a question of national political importance major questions Doctrine stops IT same with cigarettes for the FDA there was a case where the FDA said we should be able to regulate cigarettes uh because we can regulate drugs and let's face it nicotine is a drug Supreme Court said no no no that's not what is meant by drugs that's not what the Congress really meant right so there's a number of cases like that a similar case that came down last year involving the cdc's effort to do a eviction moratorium right what does the CDC have to do with eviction and and Rental regulation well that's what Supreme Court thought as well they're trying to take a statutory language and twist it to regulate something they don't really never Congress never explicitly intended for them to regulate I think that's a that's an incredible parallel to how we test and regulation of Securities with application to crypto this new kind of asset that purely exists digitally doesn't exist physically in any way uh and it's unlike anything the drafters of the 33 act would have ever anticipated it's kind of funny that a few commenters who were very much proponents of the SEC and against this approach immediately were tweeting after the case came down well obviously this has nothing to do with crypto it was like whoa you're protesting a little bit too much there I really I was like so you're telling me you're worried that this is going to apply to crypto so I think long term that that might be a defense at coinbase maybe Ripple maybe others can use it they can get to scotus for scotus to change the wide applicability of how we test the digital asset Securities that's a long-term fight but I think it's something that could be Victorious and this initial move this initial Gambit by coinbase can help to build the record for such litigation the ironic part is who's representing coinbase in this Eugene Scalia Justice scalia's son so the person who who takes down uh helps to take down this deferential law and administrative law uh developed by Justice Scalia might end up being Gene Scalia but I think it's a heck of a thing also that Gene is on the brief uh he's on the complaint against the SEC because he sued the SEC a number of times when they happened to the Chamber of Commerce and won so I'm sure in the SEC general counsel's office when they read it and they looked at the end geez Scalia they were like oh no not him again right let's be honest so I that's a strategy I think that I'm that I'm that I'm trying to figure out here I see some chess moves some deep think chess moves you know Paul gruel is a former judge so he's thinking pretty deeply about what to do here they've known this was coming for a couple years so it's going to be an interesting case to watch the unfortunate thing for those of us in crypto who want to see this industry generally Thrive and want to see it regularly in a smart way it's going to take a long time this litigation is going to take years in a moment we're going to talk about you know just how

advisory committee and so I was wondering and it seems like you're highly sympathetic to coinbase's allegation but you know they kind of are saying that the SEC is trying to not respond to their uh requests for the rulemaking last summer in order to not have what they call judicial review meaning there's like no record that can be reviewed um do you think that their description of what the sec's strategy is here is accurate well I think the SEC generally doesn't respond to requests for rulemaking at all unless it's something they kind of already want to do even from a company that they're already regulating yeah oh generally speaking Yeah but in coinbase's case I mean I I think that they just they are hoping to build up successful cases against tokens and they're hoping to use that as president so that's a lot of what their strategic decisions in the wahi case and the bitfinex case are about so I think strategically that's what they're doing and the coinbase is might kind of upset that upset that apple cart I like that they're they're following uh Sun Tzu here right you don't let your enemy pick the place of battle you pick the place of battle you Retreat until you find them or go on the events that's what they're doing so I kind of admire it but uh look here's my my real qualm with this you could look at say for example the Kraken some there were some strategic choices in how they designed that custodial staking platform that increased the risk of power application sure uh particularly the guarantees of returns the penalty for that though first of all shouldn't be a 30 million dollar penalty when there's no fraud that's those are penalties you reserve for fraudulent activity this was this was a non-registration settlement usually in normal Securities Law world pre-ginsler a settlement or a case involving non-registration the result is maybe a small fine and then you register right that was the case with the Kraken settlement they weren't allowed to register the the settlement said pay a huge fine and shut this whole thing down and don't do it anymore that's incredible overreach to me I think if Theta told Kraken spend 30 million dollars developing a registration system for staking they'd have done it uh but that was not what the SEC wanted and I think that's not what you expect from a good faith regulator yeah that term again which is what Tom emmer said that cancer was not a good faith regulator um so one other thing that I wanted to ask about was uh you know this issue about the status of crypto assets chair Gensler has been saying that all crypto assets besides Bitcoin are securities the crypto industry says that's not workable to have almost all crypto assets be Securities why not what would that look like and why couldn't the crypto industry work if most crypto assets were Securities as it exists now full compliance with the 33 act would have a whole host of weird consequences that Protocols are not designed to comply with just because the 33 Act is designed to register where the registrant is executive officers at a company who control all of the assets that they're disclosing about and I would say that's not doesn't happen for crypto protocols there's no CEO of ethereum or board of directors or anything so you have to tailor a registration proceeding now that can be done that could be possible that's happened before in the past with asset-backed Securities the SEC created a regime for asset-backed Securities there's no CEO or board for the those entities but the SEC created an adjusted regime for asset-backed Securities to register one question because I imagine chair counselor would say that vitalik buterin is um serving in a CEO like function and that the ethereum foundation is serving in functions similar to that of a centralized company so what would you say if that was his argument he still can't comply with all the rules for CEOs that in in the disclosure system uh executive compensation all kinds of things like that they just don't fit vitalik might be very influential but you can't even describe him as the CEO of ethereum even though he's influential because that would be a fraudulent disclosure so that the regime just doesn't fit the SEC has adjusted 33 at registration in the back so what they did for asset-backed Securities with a kind of a quasi registration where you register to security but it wasn't a stock in a publicly traded company it was some it was a stock in a kind of an ass weird asset had publicly traded stock he could develop something based on that framework he could develop something based on other things they've adjusted for the 40 act for real estate investment trusts for master limited Partnerships they've allowed those kind of hybrid things to list that could all be that can all be fixed tomorrow if he snaps his fingers uh and that's what we're still waiting on I think that's what could make this all make the circle round we're playing enforcement games right now and as much as it's interesting to think about the long-term chess strategy of the cat and mouse game here there are a lot of developers and and there are a lot of asset owners who are being as virtually affected I mean I just full disclosure I'm one of them I mean you know I yeah I've taken a hit from against third regime uh a lot of crypto owners have things I'm investing in to help find my kids college perfect case is the case between the SEC and ripple what's the status of that case and why do you think it's important for the crypto industry I think we might get a resolution possibly uh of the district court case uh relatively soon in a matter of months or weeks it could end up being important for crypto I'm not sure it kind of depends on how it resolves on the one hand no matter how it resolves there's a good chance it'll be appealed if River loses they've said they're going to appeal and they've invested a ton of resources I think at the red estimates of 100 million dollars so they've already invested a lot in the Discord case so they've said they're going to appeal all the list Supreme Court The General Counsel I think has been pretty vocal about that if they lose if they win it kind of depends on how they win uh maybe they win on the basis of uh the fair notice defense in which case it wouldn't have a lot of implications for the rest of crypto that would be very much on their specific facts uh and if they win on that basis maybe the SEC lets it lie if they went on the basis of how we test the SEC certainly going to appeal it so all right well then I guess we will have to see what happens and again for so if you were saying the coinbase one will last years then for these appeals for ripple what timeline are you looking at similar timeline wow and what do you think will be the status for the industry during that time just continued uncertainty or the same uncertainty we've operated under for the last decade wow okay well that's a bleak note to end on but the major question Doctrine offers us hope okay all right so maybe that will that will settle things all right well JW it has been such a pleasure

her own take on the SPF bail monitoring situation SPF is having trouble photographing himself which seems like it should be a good thing however one of the conditions of his bail is that his parents phone is supposed to be able to photograph its users every five minutes players say that his parents are having trouble installing the monitoring software on the phone it's not like there's anyone in that house who's good with technology however if they need someone to convince millions of people that the software is actually capable of doing something it can't do I think that they should have even considered this order until they confirmed that both SBF and his parents can shower in under five minutes the legal workaround right now is that every keystroke on his parents phone gets monitored so basically it's like a regular smartphone last week it was reported that FTX and Taylor Swift were in talks to sell tickets to her concerts as nfts but the Taylor Swift backed out because she thought that they might be unregistered Securities rejection must have gotten to SPF though there's apparently parole footage of him in a dark corner of his parents basement living alone eating
