app today my guest today is jake chevensky general counsel ex-con pounds welcome Jake hey Laura thanks for having me you've become known on crypto Twitter for your incisive commentary on crypto legal and regulatory issues how did you come to be involved in the space great questions so I actually got interested in crypto mostly as a personal passion back in I would say early 2017 and you know really didn't think I was going to turn it into a profession or do any legal work in the space but I was actually getting information myself about the crypto industry from crypto Twitter it's a very interesting place but a great resource to find out what's going on and I came to realize as I was consuming news there that there were a lot of people who were very important figures in the industry who were asking fairly basic questions about the application of rules and regulations to the industry but they weren't getting any answers and it seems like there just weren't any lawyers who were willing to get involved on Twitter and and talked to these people about what they were seeing and so I decided to jump in and play that role myself so I think the first time I actually tweeted something that got some attention was about a year ago when everyone was talking about the van Hecke Bitcoin etf proposal and everyone thought at the time that the etf proposal was gonna get ruled on by the SEC within like 45 days of when it was first filed and of course that's not how the SEC operates so I jumped in just to explain sort of in general how the ETF approval process works and overnight I think I went from 300 followers to about 3,000 and I guess the rest is history I love it cryptic Witter is so active and I also had a similar story with my following just people are hungry for information but can you also describe your legal background because I actually think it intersects really interesting with a lot of the issues in crypto yes definitely so I graduated from the George Washington University Law School and went straight to a very large law firm called Baker McKenzie I was working in their compliance and Investigations practice and also doing some litigation so a lot of my work was around risk assessments and compliance strategy dealing with anti money laundering and anti-corruption issues mostly for multinational corporations but also for some individuals so a lot of work around the finance industry around financial services I did that for a couple of years and then left to take a federal clerkship a position in the chambers of a federal district judge in Los Angeles and then after I completed my one year term clerkship moved on to a different firm Cobra and Kim where I was doing a lot more litigation and especially government enforcement defense so responding to subpoenas from regulatory agencies like the SEC and the CFTC defending individuals and companies prosecuted for crimes by the Department of Justice and then also doing some civil litigation around that much of it dealing with the financial services industry so yeah definitely my experience sort of primed me to deal with some of these sticky and novel legal issues that were handling in the crypto industry you just mentioned the SEC and obviously that's been such a huge issue in the space meaning how the SEC regulations intersect with the crypto fees so I want to ask about one of the major topics there and we're gonna kind of go into a lot of SEC issues just to start what do you think of SEC vs. kick which side to you has the better case that's really hard to say you know it's it's always hard to give an opinion about a case that is at such an early stage because there are so many facts out there that we just don't know and I mean that's the beauty of the litigation process and the American justice system is it's designed to get all of those facts out as time goes on so um you know I'll give you that disclaimer that you know who knows how this will all turn out I guess for me the question is more a legal one than a factual one there's not a whole lot of dispute about what kick did or why I think all of the questions are about how the federal securities laws apply to these public token sales so I think that the case is a really great opportunity to dive into the Howey test and look at some of the nuance of the different prongs of that test and and how they come out when you're talking about tokens with with very different types of characteristics so you know I think I think in many ways it's gonna come down to how the court decides to interpret the Howey test and there's really no way to predict how that's going to go so you know it's kind of hard to answer that question do you think it was smart of kick though to not come to an agreement with the SEC and to force things into court also really tough to say because we don't know what kind of offer they were made so I guess stepping back for a second the assumption with any type of government enforcement action like this is that there's a whole lot of discussion between the target of an investigation in this case kik and the enforcement agency here the SEC before you ever see something like a public complaint filed in a federal district court and almost always those discussions result in some kind of settlement offer from the SEC so you know depending on what the SEC offered kick to make this whole situation go away you know it's really hard to say whether they made a good or a bad decision by deciding not to take it and by deciding to move forward with this openly contested proceeding the interesting thing though that they decided to do was to make this whole process public which is very unusual so we know almost all circumstances these investigations whether it's the SEC or some other regulatory enforcement agency these investigations are kept confidential and we the public usually don't find out about them until there's been a settlement and the settlement is announced by both sides and in this situation kik decided instead of letting this whole process stay confidential they actually published some of the materials from the investigation and from the negotiation process what they published is called a Wells response which is basically their argument to the SEC of why they should not be targeted for an enforcement action that is a very unusual thing to do it's sort of like an open challenge to the enforcement agency to go after you and that I think was an interesting and very unusual tactical decision and with a smart in your opinion I mean it depends again on you know what kind of offer they were made my guess is they they refused to accept whatever offer they were given by the SEC either because the dollar amount was too high or because the SEC wanted to require them to do something that they felt they couldn't do like register their token and treat it as a security which has all these other follow-on impacts like needing to do disclosures and you need to do auditing and needing to treat the token itself as a security which means that there are some restrictions on how it can be transferred so you know all these sorts of things I'm guessing that that kick wasn't willing to do I guess I would say I have never advised a clients to publish a wels response and I'm not sure that I would have advised kick to do that because basically what you're doing is the equivalent of slapping the SEC in the face with a white glove and saying I challenge you to a duel right there's no way you're not going to get targeted for an enforcement action once you've done that and why kick didn't want to just stay quiet like the dozens and hundreds of other companies that issued tokens and have survived without being targeted for an enforcement action I'm not totally sure so you know as a lawyer I hesitate to pass judgment on the advice or work of other lawyers but I would definitely say it's an unusual and usually not advisable strategy to take and why do you think the SEC chose to go after kick as opposed to something like aetherium which is so much bigger and they've kind of hinted that they had an unregistered securities offering as well is it literally like I I was also trying to figure out how important the fact is that kicked it it's token sale after the dow report was like is it simply that you know aetherium did this well before the dow report would have given any clarity or guidance yeah I think you've nailed it I mean the SEC has said this in a number of the orders that they've issued settling other enforcement actions so like the Paragon and arefox and Gladius settlements which were other token issuers that the SEC worked out a deal with basically what they said was the reason that this violates the securities laws in part is because the token was issued after the Dow report came out and as of the time that the Dow report came out everyone in the industry should have known that doing one of these public token sales was going to be treated as a securities issuance so I think the big reason why the SEC would go after a company like kik and not something like the etherium foundation or anyone involved in the etherium sale it's just a matter of time and you know the fact that if yeoreum came out before the dow report ah I would also say though the reason the SEC goes after kik has opposed to the other hundreds of companies that have put out tokens after the Dow report I think is exclusively because of kik publishing their Wells response you know I think that if any other company had done what kik did they also would have been targeted for an enforcement action and you know we all know that there are lots of other companies that the SEC has sent subpoenas to that the SEC has been investigating that have gone through the wells process and have sent Wells responses to the SEC but have not been targeted for a public enforcement action and I think that's just because they played by the traditional rules of the road here in Washington DC which is you don't publicize these things because if you do you force the SE C's hand yeah something that I find interesting about this case is like I feel like it's not a perfect example for the SEC and I feel like kik isn't a perfect example for the crypto industry so in that regard like I feel like it's a good case for kind of getting into the weeds a little bit let's talk about the no action letters that the SEC has issued so far they've issued two for tokens that a lot of people are saying didn't even need no action letters such as SEC Commissioner has her purse who said in this speech quote this transaction is so clearly not an offer of securities that I worried the staffs issuance of a digital token no action letter the first and so far only such letter may in fact have the effect of broadening the perceived reach of our securities laws she was talking about the turn key jet no I letter do you agree with her in that like how useful do you think these no Martian letters have been I completely agree with her I think that the no action letters are basically useless III think there's two ways of looking at it there's there's an optimistic view and there's the pessimistic view which is frankly the one that I take but just for fun let me articulate the optimistic view which is that the SEC is trying to work with people who want to issue tokens and that by doing these no action letters the SEC is essentially saying look we're willing to work with you if you're willing to work with us and we're willing to tell you that we're not going to go after you for issuing a digital asset so please come work with us and just like these other companies that got these no action letters maybe we'll give one to you too and now I think would be a very positive sign um it's not really my view my view is is the second version which is the message that the SEC sends by doing these no action letters is basically these are the only types of digital assets that we are confident do not warrant an enforcement action and when I say these types of digital assets what I mean is tokens that basically don't resemble a cryptocurrency in any way that we would we would think of them right both of the no action letters that we've gotten have been for what looks like a reward point system not that different from typical airline miles where the tokens are truly pegged one to one to a dollar or to a specific amount of fiat currency not through some kind of reserve system or how eager if mixed system but rather because the company issuing the token says literally this is worth one dollar or this is worth one quarter the tokens are not transferable there's no trading or exchange of those tokens they're useful only within this very closed system that the issuing company has created and and that basically doesn't offer any of the interesting characteristics of what we think of when we talk about crypto currencies so to me the message from the SEC is either we're not comfortable approving anything that you guys actually think is interesting or we just haven't gotten there yet so I you know I don't take it as a very encouraging sign one thing that the SEC has done however is that they've given their blessing to a couple of tokens who registered under the Reg a plus offering which is what enables even non-accredited investors actually to participate in these sales one was for blog stack the other for the props token which is used in the U now you now app and I was wondering though like what does it mean for a blockchain based network to have a token that's a security like how does that affect a the functioning of the network and then be the ability even for these tokens that start this way to actually become utility tokens great questions I think in general we're gonna have to wait and see what the real impact is and whether it's even possible for a token to exist in a meaningful way as a security I think in terms of how it affects the network on the main restrictions especially if you're talking about reggae plus is restrictions on how the tokens can move between different individuals so there's a rule under the federal securities laws that for most types of securities you need either a broker dealer or some kind of transfer agent whenever you're moving the security between two parties obviously very different from the type of decentralized krypton network that we think of when we talk about digital assets so there's a question for for these reggae plus tokens whether it makes any sense to have them regulated as securities when they can't really be used in the way that you think of traditional crypto currencies or typical crypto currencies being used in terms of whether they can sort of decentralized their way out of security status I definitely think that's the goal I know if at least four blocks tack which was the first reggae plus qualification that their leader Mooney Bali has definitely said the goal is at some to decentralize this network to where the token is no longer a security I think the the question there is how will we know when the token has reached that point at what stage does block stack no longer need to comply with all of those obligations under the securities laws to do auditing and disclosures and you know manage the network in a compliant way and I think that what seems like a great progress now may turn into just a different problem in some number of months or years when a company like blocks that wants to say that the SEC look we think this network is decentralized now we don't want to treat this token like a security anymore and then the SEC does what they've done for most tokens that have come out in the last couple years which is it said well we're not so sure about that we'll think about it but we're not really going to give you an answer do what you want and if we want to launch an enforcement action after the fact then we'll do so so I think that you know it's it's nice to see some progress on the Reg A+ front but I think it just opens up a whole new can of worms that we're gonna have to deal with down the road yeah I was reading that decrypt media article I think that interviewed you for this story and they were pointing out that even just simple things like how do you distribute the tokens to miners on the network becomes like a huge hassle in this kind of situation and so it is you know that's like so fundamental to things like network security and in all kinds of issues so it it is yeah somewhat confounding right yeah no that's a great point and the way block stack is trying to get around that is by issuing all new tokens into a separate basically an escrow account and are not going to distribute those tokens to miners until they've completed kyc checks and so again you know that doesn't really look like the type of decentralized krypton network that we're used to you know let's also talk about ripple which is another one of these tokens that falls into this camp of tokens where it's not clear whether it's a security and ripple is facing multiple lawsuits to that effect you've we did about this a lot what what do you think are the different the various suits could play out and what do you think is most likely to happen so right now ripple is the defendant in a nationwide class action in the Northern District of California so the the class action asserts that XRP is a security that ripple violated the federal securities laws by failing to register XRP before promoting and selling it and that this illegal conduct continued until at least 2017 when ripple was continuing to sell XRP and I think as far as we know that they're still doing that today yeah right so um you know that's kind of an interesting point they made something like 200 million dollars on that last quarter so look it's interesting in a way because until we have some resolution to the securities class action or the SEC decides to take some action against ripple basically nothing happens to them they can just keep operating the way that they've been operating from the start but how so how does the class action resolve and then what happens with the SEC so the class action is still in its very earliest stages and ripple has very good lawyers who have executed a very effective delay strategy to drag out this class action as long as possible it started with almost a year long argument about whether the case should go forward in state court or federal court and it literally took almost a year before the case finally landed permanently in federal court and now we're sort of working through the early stages of the class action process we have now officially appointed class counsel so the lawyers who represent the putative class which means the alleged class it doesn't actually become a class until after a motion for class certification is filed and then a judge may grant that motion so the next stage is for the new class a putative class to file a consolidated complaint so they're going to have to file yet again another complaint setting out all of the allegations about how ripple allegedly violated the federal securities laws after that ripple will have an opportunity to file either an answer or more likely a motion to dismiss the complaint in which they will argue that even if you accept that every fact alleged in the complaint is true it still doesn't add up to a technical legal violation of section 5 of the of the Securities Act of 1933 which is the basis for the suit and then there will be arguments about that motion for probably months if not another year and assuming that the class survives that motion to dismiss then we have a very long and drawn-out discovery process we have the motion for class certification that I mentioned we could have a motion for summary judgment which is an argument that based on all of the facts that were disclosed during the discovery process there's no material dispute and regarding the facts and as a matter of law ripple should win the suit so we have to litigate that out that probably takes another six months to a year so you can see that this is a very long process that I think is not likely to resolve at any point soon probably the way it ultimately resolves is after one of those rulings on one of those big important motions like the motion to dismiss the the sides get back together and start talking about settlement and ultimately ripple has to pay a certain amount of money to the class in order for the class to just drop the suit and disappear so I think probably in the end that's how the class action gets resolved through a settlement not something that is really going to affect XRP or resolve this question about whether XRP is a security I would assume that the SEC won't take any action against triple' until the class action is resolved so I think the SEC is probably just sitting back waiting and watching to see what happens in the class action and then once it resolves one way or another then maybe the SEC jumps in say okay now we think that Ripple violated the securities laws so we're going to launch our own enforcement action or reach our own settlement or I guess in theory they might decide you know what we don't think that Ripple violated the law or we just don't care so we're gonna leave this alone so I think probably that's how it plays out and it's gonna take years before we have an answer to those questions wow that's intense although I guess if we're saying that they made 1.1 billion dollars from selling the tokens they have plenty of money to fund all that litigation all right so I actually also wanted to ask about another kind of big trend that raises questions around securities law which is staple coins do you think so I so I know there's multiple models of staple coins in which cases do you think they are likely to run afoul of securities laws in which in which cases do you think they're probably okay so I think the only case where it's fairly certain that there are securities issues around stable coins is with a model like basis so you probably heard about basis originally called base coin which had an algorithmic model that would try to maintain a dollar pay for its stable coin through the issuance of bonds shares and I forget now exactly how it worked but basically what they were doing was explicitly issuing types of tokens that were designed to be securities that were designed to be shares equity shares in this system I think that if you're trying to design a stable coin that explicitly uses the issuance of the security in order to make sure that you maintain your peg well you're gonna have some securities issues and sure enough basis at least reportedly decided after talking to the SEC that the way that they had designed their stable coin model was going to violate the securities laws and they didn't want to try going through the process of registration or compliance so they ended up shutting down the entire the entire project I think that it's an open question in terms of whether any other model of stable could qualify as a security when you're when you're thinking about investment contracts which is the type of security that we think about the most in the crypto industry it's kind of hard to frame any stable coin as an investment contract just because there cannot by definition be an expectation of profit by purchasing a stable coin so if you look at these fiat backed stable coins like US DC for example it's pretty hard to argue that that is an investment contract there are of course other types of securities other than investment contracts like demand notes which is one another type of regulated security under the 1933 Act and there are some similarities between stable coins and what you might think of as a demand note but you know I think it's gonna take a long time for us to really figure out how we want to treat stable coins and I think that the spirit of securities regulation the policy goals and the reasons why we want to impose these compliance obligations on securities issuers just don't make sense in the context of stable coins so I would imagine that even if you could spin up a hyper technical legal argument why have Fiat back to stable coin qualifies as a security I don't think it makes a lot of sense to do that and I think eventually we'll get clarity around that yeah I've seen in different interviews that Valerie's japonic has who's the crypto czar at the SEC has kind of indicated that she thinks a lot of these to run afoul of securities laws and I'm interested in I've more into that but yeah I mean I agree so something like basis is pretty obvious but for the others I'm curious to know what they think all right so there's just so many questions to ask about so we're just gonna take a quick break to hear from the sponsors to make this show possible but right after the break we will talk about all things Libra and kyc AML and all kinds of other issues what in

please go to Kraken calm that's KRA kem calm back to my conversation with Jake servants key you're someone who lives and breathes crypto but you will also live in DC and you understand the ins and outs of that world down there so I'm so curious to hear your take on the week when the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell you know mentioned that bitcoin is like digital gold and president Trump tweeted about Bitcoin and Libre and Treasury secretary Steve Newton gave a press conference on crypto currencies and then of course the Senate and House held hearings on Libre - you like has somebody who knows that world like what did you think was the significance of of all that activity uh it was very crazy around here because crypto really took over a Capitol Hill for a couple of weeks it was uh it was very interesting to see you know people who usually don't talk about these issues starting to wrap their minds around what digital assets mean and how to approach you know regulation and also the developments of new legislation and policy toward crypto um I thought that the main takeaway is is really just the acceleration of the timeline for the crypto industry to grapple with these issues as a result of Facebook jumping into the position of at least arguing that they are going to launch a cryptocurrency my personal opinion about Libre is that it really isn't a cryptocurrency at all and I'm not the only one who thought that that was kind of the mission for most of the crypto world here in DC was to run around telling as many people as would listen about the differences between true crypto currencies like Bitcoin and a digital currency like Libre which really functions in a very different way I thought that by the time that process was done there were some very positive signs from Congress at least if not some of the folks in the executive branch and and chairman Powell about embracing the promise of cryptocurrency and the benefits that it can offer so you had Facebook arguing that they should be able to launch a new fairly centralized payment system where folks personal data would be exposed to a variety of corporations and where those corporations would get to decide who can participate and who can't and there was a lot of pushback on that from Congress which i think is very positive and is a good sign for the crypto industry because what we can do and this is very much how DC works is we can then sort of slide in and say hey Congress you're really concerned about these big corporations being in control of a new payment system well let us show you our decentralized open version of what they promised which has all of the benefits but not the drawbacks so I thought that was very positive you know obviously less positive in terms of the president's tweets and secretary minuchin z' statement about about cryptocurrency both Bitcoin and then also the comments about Libra but you know honestly I think that that in many ways is more of a political issue between the presidents and the Fed and crypto sort of got wrapped up in the fight between President Trump and Chairman Powell over what should happen with interest rates and so when chairman Powell said well there are some values you know there's some value to something like Bitcoin has digital gold there may be some reason why we should consider this as a positive force I think the immediate reaction from President Trump was simply to take the opposite side and and you know say negative about cryptocurrency in response I'm not sure that that's really his position and I'm not sure that he would hold it strongly if if there were some other reasons why crypto would benefit the country or his personal political position but definitely a very interesting couple weeks here in DC you made the point I in a tweet after the Libre hearings that crypto so far is not a partisan issue so you know you just mentioned kind of how politics you know may have affected Trump's tweet but for you know Congress right now like how do you think the lack of partisanship will affect their approach to crypto well I think I can go one of two ways I think either eventually crypto will be adopted by one party and then you know a very sort of typical but reflexive action for DC the other party will have to run away from crypto just to to show its distinction from the opposite party right if the Republicans like something the Democrats have to dislike it and and the same the other way around so I think that is one possibility I hope that we will be able to avoid that but I do think that if one party were to really in a full-throated manner embrace cryptocurrency then the other party would probably have to run away from it and it would become a partisan issue I think the second and and what I hope is the more likely scenario is that we're able to build a consensus across the aisle in favor of innovation and also in favor of the characteristics and the aspects of cryptocurrency that not only benefit the US but also benefit both political parties and I think this is something that both coin Center and the blockchain Association are doing a really fantastic job with which is articulating to both political parties the argument in favor of cryptocurrency that speaks to them and it's really two very different arguments so if you're talking to a Republican politician you're gonna tell a very different story than if you're talking to a democratic politician for a Republican you're probably talking more about about monetary economics and sound money and you know things like auditing the Fed tend to play a lot better with a Republican audience when you're talking to Democrats you talk a lot more about Wall Street and you know things that politicians like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders are trying to get at from a very different perspective which is breaking up the big banks and preventing them from continuing this sort of rent-seeking behavior that they've been using to make quite a lot of profit at the expense of the public for a very long time so there's different arguments that I think you can get both parties to align behind a pro crypto stance and it's just a matter of whether we can get to that point before crypto becomes one of these sort of toxic political issues where one party likes it so the other party has to hate it you kind of mentioned that there is this argument going that if US regulators are too restrictive to crypto that innovation will move out of the u.s. do you think that the like both lawmakers and regulators find that argument compelling or that they would care I definitely think it's a compelling argument in many ways it's the most compelling argument when it comes to politics so you know there's there's a saying in politics it's the economy stupid right everything ultimately comes back to the strength of the economy and creating jobs so I think that if you can tie innovation in the crypto industry to the creation of jobs in the US and also overly restrictive regulations to the loss of jobs and a negative impact on the US economy then you can definitely convince regulators and politicians that they should allow this industry to grow and develop in the United States I think the problem right now is that it's sort of hard to articulate a strong argument why innovation in the crypto industry will contribute to the US economy or will create jobs because right now there aren't frankly that many folks who are working in the crypto industry it's still very small the economic impact is also still fairly small and it's a little bit hard right now to show actual proof about how allowing this technology to develop and grow in the US will benefit politicians in terms of convincing their constituencies that the politicians are doing a good job for them so I think it might take a while before we can really articulate that that position effectively but again you know this is why I'm thankful for folks like you know Jerry Brito at coin Center and Kristen Smith at the blotching Association who are spending all of their time day in and day out trying to figure out how to articulate that argument better than I can so I do think that it will be effective in due time let's talk about AML kyc issues and why don't we start with Libre I saw in a tweet you pointed out that David Marcus had said that calibra would handle those kinds of things but that other wallets might not so in general like how do you think AML kyc should be handled when it comes to Libre which you know as we pointed out isn't exactly like the other cryptocurrencies yeah it's um it's hard to say I mean first of all I'm not sure that Libre will ever launch so it may be that that answer never needs or that question never never really needs it really wait you really think that it may never launch um I think it's practically certain that it will not launch in the form that it was proposed I think it's I think there's too much pushback from frankly from regulators all over the world it's not just the US there are so many people who have come out and said we don't trust Facebook to manage our money that I think Facebook will will eventually if they are able to launch something will be forced to simplify the system in a whole lot of ways to make it look a lot more traditional and a lot less interesting than it already is which in my view is not terribly interesting anyway but yeah that's that's kind of my take on what happens with Libra in the end oh well okay well so then let's go to a stickier issue because you did also tweet that complying with anti money laundering laws and knew your customer laws is even harder in crypto so how do you think it should be handled there yeah it's it's um it's a very tough question because the true answer is it kind of can't be handled in the traditional way right so if you wanna if you want to comply with traditional hansi money laundering requirements but you need to be able to do is you need to be able to perform customer due diligence and and know your customer diligence on every single person who has access to the system that is in many ways the opposite of how a crypto Network functions which is that a crypto network is permissionless it's not supposed to require that people satisfy certain criteria or prove their identity in order to access the system so in a way crypto is sort of anti AML by by its inherent nature I think that the way that this will be handled and is being handled now is that anti money laundering controls are implemented at the on ramps and off ramps with fiat currency so if you're an exchange that allows people to get access to crypto currencies because you're taking their dollars or their euros or their pounds or what have you then then you are going to be required has that on-ramp to perform customer due diligence and the same thing is true for the off ramps if you are taking cryptocurrency from people and giving them fiat currency in return you're gonna have to do some form of kyc I don't really think that there is a way to enforce AML requirements on transactions that are purely within a crypto Network technologically speaking it's just not possible unless those transactions are going through an intermediary like a transaction from one exchange to another exchange on behalf of a shared customer but otherwise you know I think we're going to have to real grapple with this question of will governments be okay with and will they be able to wrap their mind around a new financial system that is inherently resistant to identifying all the individuals who are using that system and that's that's a very hard issue but definitely one that we need to address yeah and I think shape-shift would be another example where they're just allowing crypto to crypto trades but even then you know they now started requiring accounts and things like that so I think it's not even necessarily about exchanging Fiat with crypto right yeah I think that's right and I think that ultimately essentially any intermediary that is holding digital assets on behalf of a customer will eventually be required to perform some type of kyc and I think that in many ways that might be good enough for governments I don't think that they will try to destroy crypto networks just because it is possible to have non kyc transactions outside of the context of those third-party intermediaries but essentially I think that if you take custody of a customer's crypto you're gonna have to identify that customer and you're gonna have to be subject to some type of compliance and reporting requirements to the government whether that's in the US or in any other developed country so a lot has been made over the years about how all these different regulators treat crypto currency differently like the IRS treats curve to currency as property the CFTC is a commodity FinCEN considers it money obviously some of these tokens as we've been discussing are considered securities by the SEC and then there are these other jurisdictions recently an unconfirmed Jeremy lair was talking about how they are launching a subsidiary in Bermuda which has laws specific to digital assets some other jurisdictions that are doing the same or like Switzerland Singapore etc do you think that the u.s. just like these other jurisdictions should create laws specific to digital assets rather than trying to fit existing laws around securities commodities etc to two currencies at this point I don't think that's necessary I mean I you know we're still trying to figure out I think at this point what digital assets are actually good for right so we haven't really figured out our our digital assets good vehicles for issuing securities or not are they good vehicles for tokenizing other real world interests like the title to a car or the deed to a house or you know any other number of things that you might consider doing with digital assets I think until we figure out what this stuff is actually good for aside from money which I think at this point we've we've basically figured out that block chains are really good for money until we figure out what else they might be good for it would be a mistake to to create any new types of regulatory regimes or laws around digital assets and I think a good example of this is the token taxonomy Act which is you know an interesting proposal that was submitted by I think representative Davidson to create a new definition for a digital token and then exclude that definition of a digital token from the jurisdiction of the SEC right to basically say digital tokens by definition are not securities and I think that would be a mistake and the reason I say that is because there are some digital tokens that fundamentally are securities and should be treated that way and that's why we see some companies doing these token issuances and seeking qualification under regulation A+ or you know that are viewing those tokens very much as equity interests that would normally be regulated by the federal securities laws and so I think to say we are in a position now where we understand this technology and the value of it well enough that we can create brand-new laws to govern how it will develop I think is a mistake so I wouldn't say it will never be a good idea but I think right now any jurisdiction that is creating laws specific to the crypto industry is doing so not because you the best policy position or because they really understand the safest and most intelligent way of regulating this industry rather it's it's a commercial effort it's basically marketing to try to attract as much attention and as much business activity as possible and for a jurisdiction that's a little bit smaller and is looking to get an edge and maybe you know is otherwise struggling in terms of its economy or in terms of attracting outside investors that makes a lot of sense but for a very well-developed and maybe the the foremost capital market in the world for the United States I think it's too soon for us to do something like that and what about how some of these other jurisdictions just have one regulator for crypto I've had so many different entrepreneurs and Jeremy lairs testimony to the Senate also mentions this that it's just so much easier to deal with do you think the US should adopt that approach I think it might make sense to have a regulator that focuses on digital assets but again I think it might be a mistake to say we're gonna create one new entity that entity will handle everything imaginable that can be done on a blockchain because again right you could have digital tokens that indeed are securities and if they are securities then the SEC should have jurisdiction over them and similarly you could imagine creating a token and I think there are some companies that are doing this now that resembles a futures contracts or some other type of derivative like a swap or you know something else that the CFTC would have jurisdiction over and in the same way I think it would be a mistake to say well if this was in traditional finance the CFTC would have jurisdiction but because we're doing it on a blockchain we're going to deprive the CFTC of jurisdiction and give only this brand new regulator the ability to regulate this type of token so I think ultimately what we would end up with if we created a brand new entity is just another alphabet soup agency that we in the industry have to deal with in addition to the existing regulators that we're already talking to and so I think that would be probably a step backward not forward okay we're gonna try to move through a whole bunch of topics slightly quickly let's just talk about taxation how do you think cryptocurrencies are crypto assets should be taxed ah I think the most important thing right now that we need is a de minimis exception for small transactions in in crypto currencies so I think that you know we've for a very long time talked about using Bitcoin to buy your everyday a cup of coffee and you know we're thinking about this similarly now with stable coins whether they're you know algorithmic like die or fiat backed like USD C that we want to be able to transact day to day with these instruments and until there's a de minimis exception that's really not possible so I think if I could wish for one thing to change in the tax code that would be it um beyond that I think probably they should be treated just like any other investment asset you know in terms of the capital gains structure but you know as a non tax lawyer I guess I'll leave that to the experts you work in D Phi what do you think are the main regulatory issues in the D Phi space that people are not thinking about um I think that we're still not clear on the obligations of a software developer that writes a piece of software and then launches it on a decentralized crypto at work and no longer has control over the functioning of that piece of software you know we've been having this discussion for a while now about whether coders should be treated as fiduciaries and most people I think view this somewhat skeptically because we've never treated coders as fiduciaries before right if a piece of software doesn't give you exactly what you're looking for you really can't go and sue the software developer and say you owed me a fiduciary duty of care and you violated it by you know not producing the software in a particular manner um but we are now dealing with with a brand new type of financial system where there's more at risk and so I think there's a new discussion to be had about how we treat coders who are producing software that then gets launched onto these decentralized systems there was a lot of buzz about backed when it was announced last year but licensing and some other I think regulatory issues have clock have caused delays recently they did announce that they started accepting user acceptance testing but they still have it don't have all the regulatory approvals in place to take the platform live can you explain what needs to happen for an exchange like back to get the approvals that it means and why there's been so many delays sure so um backed right now is just waiting on one thing which is approval of its limited purpose Trust Company and they're waiting for the New York Department of Financial Services to to approve that charter you know it's in the first instance if you are in exchange and you want to list a futures contract which is what backed wants to do you're subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction so you need to have a designated contract market you need to have a clearinghouse and you you know you need to get CFTC approval for for those things and then also you need to certify whatever the specific futures contract is that you want to list on your market backed has already gone through all of those hurdles with the CFTC so as far as the CFTC is concerned backed is ready to go as soon as they get approval from NY DFS for their for their Trust Company and the purpose of the trust company is to warehouse the actual Bitcoin that will underlie the physically settled futures contracts that backed wants to launch so they're just waiting for DFS approval the last I had heard the issues with DFS were really just around sort of the nuts and bolts of the proposal for the trust company I think there was some concern that maybe the amount of money that act was going to put into that company to guarantee the assets was too low I think they were proposing 35 million dollars is the guarantee and maybe DFS wanted it to be more than that so it's really just those kinds of issues there there's no reason in my mind to think that backed won't eventually succeed DFS has already approved a number of other trust companies just like the one that backed is trying to get four other companies including crypto companies like Gemini which has one of these trust companies and others so I think it's just a matter of time in your previous gigs as a lawyer I believe you focus quite a bit on market manipulation and that's one of the reasons that the SEC has cited for not approving a Bitcoin ETF how big of an issue do you think that is in crypto and how do you think that that can be resolved to the SEC satisfaction yeah so I did I actually had a couple of cases where I defended individual traders and trading firms that were prosecuted for market manipulation so I have a fair amount of experience in the area and I think just looking at the crypto market manipulation is still a pretty significant issue and one that we need to get a handle on not just because it's it's the main issue that's holding up ETF approval but also because there are a lot of really sophisticated institutions and other firms that just don't want to get involved in this space until the sort of wild west of the manipulated markets gets under control I think that to get there a couple of things need to happen I think first of all some some federal agency needs to have jurisdiction over spot markets meaning the markets where actual digital assets are traded not just futures contracts and right now there is no federal agency that has regulatory authority over those spot markets the CFTC only has jurisdiction over futures exchanges the SEC only has jurisdiction over securities exchanges so the spot markets are really out there on their own I've heard some talk in DC about the the CFTC being granted authority over those spot markets I think that would go a huge way toward toward eliminating market manipulation and making people more comfortable with this space and then I think the second thing is and I hate to say this has a former white-collar criminal defense attorney but I think that the government needs to show some type of enforcement interest toward these traders who are manipulating these markets and I think what's holding them up right now is that they really don't have access to the trading data that they typically need in order to launch these types of enforcement actions or prosecutions but once they're able to get more of that information and identify who the players are who are spoofing or wash trading these markets for example or who are perpetrating pump and dumps or the opposite of a pump and dump which is a short and distort I think once they get that kind of information we'll start seeing more prosecution from the Department of Justice and we'll start seeing more enforcement activity from both the SEC and the CFTC and I think that will send a signal to traders who think that these markets are open for manipulation will send the message that they should probably look somewhere else so it seems like based on that answer that probably a Bitcoin ETF is fairly far off yeah I have to say I think that both because of the market manipulation issue which really hasn't made much progress in 2019 and also because of the custody issue which chairman Clayton has recently started talking about a lot more I don't think we're gonna see an ETF approved this year unfortunately privacy coins how did those mix with the world of financial regulation not particularly well as you might expect yeah look you know we have a a financial system that is designed around the principle that all transactions should be open for a government of service for the purpose of allowing law enforcement to identify and prosecute criminal conduct and this is really how law enforcement has developed over the second half of the 20th century and certainly through the beginning of the 21st century which is the principle is all crime is most likely committed so that the criminal can make money and in order to get benefit from making money through criminal activity you have to integrate that money into the financial system so that you can spend it on goods and services and so if we just create this really strong walled garden of the financial system so that we can stop those criminals from getting their illicit proceeds into the system or detect them when they do that's gonna be the best way to detect and prosecute and ultimately stop crime privacy coins are the opposite of that right privacy technology really stops the government from having insight into into financial transactions whether they're legal or not and I think that when you know I think this is an issue that hasn't really come to the forefront yet because you know we see our politicians in these hearings talking about Libra and really just starting to grasp what a cryptocurrency is I think it's gonna take a while longer before they start to understand what privacy technology is and at the same time they're being told by law enforcement that Bitcoin is into concern because from from a you know criminality perspective because the blockchain is open and transparent and auditable and really if the FBI had its way every criminal would do all of their transactions on Bitcoin because it's so easy for them to trace those transactions so I think there's not a lot of concern about this right now but I think that has the use of privacy technology increases it's going to be an issue that we have to deal with you know there's a sort of I mean tangentially related a similar conundrum I feel like we're you know we were talking about the KYC AML laws and I noticed that Jeremy elaire in his testimony to the Senate pointed out that these fad F rules that require the exchanges to send information to each other about who's transacting that those basically could potentially lead to privacy breaches and you know there's this news recently that broke about the Capital One hack and I just skimmed this article about the hacker but apparently I think she was like mentally unstable and she even went online by the moniker like erratic and and so I just I was just like oh great okay as more people get coding skills but then maybe they're not like fully with it or you know whatever like are we really gonna want to have you know all this stuff that's like a managed by you know in these honey pots and so I felt like that was like another way you know I mean the privacy coins versus finders really it's like kind of different but sort of similar and that there's like pros and cons on each side and it's not really easy but you know with blockchain if you could use this technology to enable people to have control of their data then you wouldn't have so many of those honey pots yeah I agree and I think that is the very difficult and very nuanced but also very practical conversation that we have to have which is privacy has benefits and it has drawbacks but if you watch you know there's this new documentary that just came out on Netflix called the great hack maybe you've heard of it it goes through the story of Cambridge analytic and it's you know I won't bore everyone with the details but definitely go watch it if you can what it does is it really shows us when we don't have control over our data and we don't have privacy how much damage can be done when you can put together different data points for specific individuals and how a company like Cambridge analytic a can access to to our data and then use it to persuade human behavior on a global scale and that's that's a really scary thing and and when you think about it in terms of government actors right you look at a country like China where the Social Credit system is based largely on harvesting data from citizens and then using that data to decide who's a good citizen and who's a bad citizen and restricting their rights based on their activity and it's the same thing when we talk about financial information because how we spend our money strikes really to the core of who we are it's as personal as any kind of data possibly could be and so there are great benefits in allowing technologies that improve privacy not just because there are criminals who are going to use it and it's going to make it easier for them to buy drugs on the darknet right that's not the point there are all these other very important benefits of privacy technologies and I think that we're gonna have to have that discussion about those benefits outweighing the potential drawbacks of reducing the effectiveness of this surveilled walled garden financial system that has allowed law enforcement to detect criminal conduct in the past github recently geo-fenced its platform off from Iranian citizens due to sanctions at Niren sa last fall about sanctions enforcement and crypto how do you think this issue will play out in the crypto space well I'm hearing that that there will be public enforcement action from oh fak which is the the enforcement agency that enforces trade sanctions related to the crypto industry at some point within the next few months so I think that I think this is actually gonna happen pretty quickly the the title of the article that you mentioned was something like get ready for crypto sanctions enforcement and I think that we're pretty close to that happening but on you know just like we've talked about the potential use of an open permissionless system to you know to transact sporters and potentially to enable some types of criminal activity that would be harder to do through the traditional financial system crypto also allows people to evade trade sanctions there's there's really no way to get around that fact if you want to send value to someone in North Korea it is simply easier to do that on a crypto network than it is to do it through some other system and that's something that I think Oh feck and the government in general is struggling with and I think that they're that they're coming up with some pretty helpful guidance about what they expect from companies especially who are processing transactions on crypto networks but definitely this is just one of these issues that we're going to have to struggle with in the sense that the rise of a new financial system that is open and permissionless and based on crypto networks decreases the effectiveness of the trade sanctions regime that the US government has used to influence foreign policy for quite a long time all right so we've covered a ton of topics concerning regulation in crypto but are there any others that you feel like people in crypto aren't thinking enough about that you want to talk about oh no I think that lightning rounds pretty much covered all the very interesting subjects that are that are coming up it's definitely not boring to be a crypto lawyer these days yeah or a crypto journalist
