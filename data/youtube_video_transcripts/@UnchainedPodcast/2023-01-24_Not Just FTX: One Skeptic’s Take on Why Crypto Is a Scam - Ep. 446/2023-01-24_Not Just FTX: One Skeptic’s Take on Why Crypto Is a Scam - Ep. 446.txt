Link in the description today's guest is James block the author of The Dirty Bubble media newsletter welcome James hi glad to be here so you are actually a doctor but you publish this extensive and actually fairly frequent newsletter on crypto how did that even happen how did you even get into crypto I learned about it probably a year and a half ago so I'm relatively new to it I've always had a fascination with uh financial fraud and Finance in general going back to I mean when I was a young kid even and it was difficult to choose between medicine and finance but I ended up going into medicine for my career but I've always kind of kept an eye on things and um when I learned about crypto one of the first things I learned about was the tether stable coin in some of the companies that were associated with them I saw a lot of red flags that made me concerned that there might be something nefarious going on with these companies and um it kind of was a organic it wasn't like I was planning to do this it went for me just being on Twitter following people and learning to doing my own research to eventually writing things and actually trying to make a contribution so it's kind of grown over those months into what it is now so wow I have to say I'm super impressed that you only started getting into crypto a year and a half ago because you know your your newsletter will go into blockchain analytics and you have this understanding of I mean I guess you said you already had an interest of Finance but still yeah I'm I'm actually very impressed and when did you launch the newsletter I think it was in January I actually started at um I was concerned that my Twitter account was going to get like taken down or hacked or something which actually ended up happening at one point and I wanted to have a place to save the things I had done so far so I started basically copying threads I had done on Twitter over to substack and then I think the first actual article I wrote for substack was in uh February oh wow wait but why did you have that fear that your Twitter account would be hacked because you you can secure it you know well so I was getting targeted by Bots a lot I was posting a lot about a few different things I was focused a lot on the Celsius Network and um I don't know I just had a few interactions that made me think that um my account might be targeted either for like Mass reporting or something so I figured I might as well you know put the stuff somewhere else safe actually and then in May of 2022 um or sorry it would have been June of 2022 uh my account actually was hacked um and I lost control of it for about two and a half months um and my sub stack was also targeted by uh fraudulent copyright claims it actually taken down for a little bit as well so I had a fun summer trying to like preserve what I had already been working on wow and wait like is that simply because of your involvement in crypto that all that happened or I mean that's all I write about so I assume that I made somebody upset whether it was related to my work on Celsius or certain other things I had been working on I'm not sure but the timing was interesting because it was right around the same time as Celsius for those withdrawals and I was publishing a lot of real-time tracking of some of the the things they were doing in terms of moving money around and um that was when things happened so I don't know I think the copyright stuff against my blog was actually a separate thing but that's just me speculating so okay we'll talk offline um because I I have some thoughts for you I don't wanna I don't want to make my thoughts on this public but anyway okay you know you you said that you had an interest in financial stuff but I don't know if you have any training or anything like that but I was curious to hear exactly what your Finance background is my finance background amounts to growing up uh with a with an accountant for a grandfather and a lawyer for a dad and they would argue about like argue about investing every weekend when we go and visit them and so I picked that up I don't know I didn't have like a lot of video games and stuff so I ended up like reading the Wall Street Journal and things like that's I was a weird kid so that's really my background is just like piecemeal sort of like reading books about history of different light frauds and other companies and things um have a few of them on my bookshelf and like you know I you you start to pick up sort of how things work you don't necessarily have to have a formal understanding of everything like my accounting skills are abysmal but like do I connect can I recognize how a company works and kind of piece together kind of the broad Strokes yeah wow okay like I said very impressive that it's you know kind of more self-taught I guess um than I would have expected so at least for me um I think the first post of yours that I remember seeing was the one is Alameda research and solving it's the one that came out a couple of days after the coindesk article on alameda's balance sheet so I was curious like you know you said you launched in February of last year your newsletter what was your experience in terms of the trajectory of that newsletter and you know how it really started getting around um I mean I just started writing about the things I thought were interesting so in addition when I was doing I did a medical degree and a doctorate in research during like my my graduate training what I learned was about like research and learning how things work is you like have to almost force yourself to write about things to really understand something you have to force yourself to try to explain it to other people and so that kind of grew out of that was like okay well I found this interesting thing how about I try to write it in a way that anybody could understand it then that way I know that I understand it so that's really how it started and yeah I don't know it just kind of grew from there you know I I got some attention because of the Celsius stuff um a couple things I wrote about nfts and like celebrities and things got a little bit of attention but really the Alameda thing was really what got a lot of people looking at what I had been doing so was that your first viral post the one that I mentioned yeah I would say so yeah so as I alluded to earlier your articles can be somewhat long and the analysis sometimes is pretty detailed and given that you have this completely different job and a totally unrelated feels I was wondering how you even have time to do this and like so I I really I you know you just said that you did it because you wanted to force yourself to understand in writing does that but like is that really the main reason at this point like you you basically have this entire other career so why is it that you're spending so much time in an effort publishing this newsletter it's fun I mean like I almost quit doing this a few months ago actually I had done a lot of stuff with Celsius I'd actually found some original things that were cited in other other papers in coindesk and things and you know I kind of thought like well I've made my contribution to this I can just quit I just have too much fun doing this I've met so many interesting people and learned so many interesting things about real real Finance in addition to crypto and literally I know everybody I know people all around the world now because of this right so like I can't really stop now unfortunately maybe but in terms of time I mean I find I find time nights weekends whatever when this is your hobby when you have a hobby that you really like and care about like I don't really watch a lot of Netflix you know like I don't uh I'm way behind on reading books I'm right behind on like other things I like to do because this is basically what I do for fun I love it I love it and now the crypto world is benefiting maybe I don't know if they I don't know if everybody thinks they're benefiting but okay well even if they don't realize they're benefiting they're benefiting and I was curious how do you create the graphics of the blockchain Flows In Your articles like it looks like you no that's that's a free tool called um uh well bigquery explorer.bitquery.io it's literally a free it's it's it's very easy to use and it's very accurate from what I found I've actually gone through an aggregated transactions and made sure that the numbers they're saying are accurate I mean there's certain limitations obviously but yeah I mean it's a free it's free software I actually wrote an article about how to do this a few months ago oh my God basically how to do everything that I do because I figured like it really isn't that hard it just takes the time of like looking through a bunch of stuff and trying to figure out who owns what that's the hard part but in terms of actually doing the doing the math and like understanding what's happening that's not that difficult once you spend a little time you know familiarizing yourself with it okay great I'm definitely going to check that article and I don't know how I missed it because I was obviously reading a ton of your posts then I also was wondering why you chose the name Dirty Bubble media I don't know a lot of things just sort of happen I don't remember when I came up with it exactly but it was fairly early on I think it was when I was I I encountered um I think it's Jim chanos who calls this the Golden Age of Fraud and I had the slot pump end in my head that it's really just a Dirty Bubble and then I'm a millennial so I watch SpongeBob so it was like a natural like that's the Ville that's a villain from SpongeBob so it's like a perfect like I don't know it worked out and I thought I could make a cool little thing out of it so I did I so I don't know SpongeBob so uh it's just like a minor character in that show that's like a villain like a like a super villain that's just like a bubble that goes around him like like grabs people with its like bubble it's like just a dirty little it's a dirty bubble like that's a it's a kids show like this is not sophisticated but like it worked because of the the idea that what this is is that they asked economic bubble that's filled with fraud and that's that's kind of the the idea there so okay yeah okay also he's a villain and a lot of people see me as a villain so I figured it was fitting well actually that was kind of my next question for you because your newsletter calls out a lot of problems with crypto so I just wanted to hear your overall take on the space like what do you think the main issues are and how do you think it needs to change what I can say is that I've spent a lot of time and I I'm pretty single-minded person and when I when I have an opinion I usually like will defend it and so I can definitely get one-sided at times that being said you know I haven't really found a single project that's at least a project that's facing consumers and like selling tokens in a project or selling like some sort of uh investment scheme or whatever to Consumers that ever seems to really be legitimate and that's a problem you know I mean look at look at the crypto lending industry not one of those companies as far as I can tell operate in a in a forthright in a legitimate fashion uh the only one that's left now is nexo and they just got raided in uh Bulgaria for apparently helping Russians invade sanctions so like you know there's there's problems with all of them and you know I'm agnostic about whether there are certain you know potential applications for the technology I'm sure there are but the problem is like any any opportunity that's offered to retail investors to actually invest in these things to me seems to be like smoke and mirrors um and that's you know it's it's sad but that's that's just the reality of the situation but and so you're differentiating that from just like kind of a straight up exchange where you can just buy and sell or well so even those I mean what are they well here's the thing like what are you buying and selling right like theoretically it's like coin based an example and I I have been short coinbase in the past so I'll disclosed that I actually never really write about them um but I mean theoretically they're operating in a legitimate fashion obviously they've had some problems with kyc they've had some problems with following regulations and they may have additional problems in the future um but at least theoretically seems like they're doing things in a Baltimore fashion they're not FTX right they're not like stealing people's money or anything but like at the end of the day if all you're doing is helping Ponzi scheme sell uh investment contracts that are unregulated to Consumers what is your business right I mean even if you're doing that in a legitimate and honest fashion you're still facilitating vast scams and coinbase in particular is an example where they've listed all sorts of things that you know any rational person would say this is not good for anybody uh so I don't know I don't I just I haven't found anything yet that really catches my attention makes me think this is a sustainable business that generates cash flow that's going to actually end up you know surviving for more than a couple years and make something positive for the world I haven't found that yet and out of curiosity when you talk about the different assets that coinbase lists would you put things like well let's start with Bitcoin would you put Bitcoin uh in that same category as I think that Bitcoin to me it's irrelevant and the reason why it's irrelevant is that the price of all of these tokens is determined by exchanges and operators who are offshore unregulated and using variety of Market manipulation tactics to control the price right so like for example the Bitcoin ETFs that have been uh denied by the SEC and everybody's up in arms about it there's a very clear list I think it's like seven or eight things that the SEC lists every time they reject one of these applications about the problems with Bitcoin markets and why they can't allow one of these things to be registered in the United States and that's a laundry list of problems that has not been fixed so like my thing is again I'm agnostic about things like Bitcoin because to me it's irrelevant the price is what is important right now that the prices was sucking people and then having them spend their money on it and they're vastly overpaying almost certainly because the prices is determined by fraud and that's the problem I I focus on that like it's like sort of like arguing about religion or something it's like you can you can set things aside and say okay well there's certain problems that we have to focus on before we can talk about these more philosophical questions of like what the value is when we don't have any way to tell right now because the entire value is based on largely on fraud okay so you you're like agnostic on whether Bitcoin intrinsically has value yeah I mean I don't I don't know what that even means um I mean here's the thing I buy I buy or I tend to buy assets that generate cash flow um or assets that I can use so for example I buy a house because I can live in it um I buy stocks and companies that I think are honest I mean obviously they can lie to you when you can get tricked but I try to buy companies that I think are going to survive for more than a couple years and you know make profits I try to buy bonds that you know generate returns that sort of thing um so like something like Bitcoin that doesn't generate returns um and also it's like gold at least gold you can like bury it in the backyard or something it'll sit there forever and it's an element it literally was made by stars like it's not going to go anywhere right but like Bitcoin depends on certain things like a network that operates continuously right there's certain things it has to have so I'm I would say I'm like I'm skeptical that I would ever invest in it myself but whether or not it has intrinsic value is a question that I don't think anybody can answer because it's a it's one of those philosophical questions that I don't think has an answer right meaning there's just opinions yeah those are opinions and and I mean frankly markets are opinions right like this idea of efficient markets I mean I mean look at look at like I could get people mad at me and say like Okay GameStop or something but like you know like even even like supposedly real regulated markets there's all sorts of I mean there's real fraud too and that's that's the problem I think with a lot of the people in crypto is that you'll point out and say well look at all the fraud happening here they say well but look at the real markets or the regulated markets look at all the fraud happening there and that's true there is a lot of fraud in those spaces but it's like an order of magnitude less and at least they're trading things that have some intrinsic value that you can prove right like cash flow is intrinsic value to me that's that's intrinsic value okay so but I think then actually the way I was starting to characterize it is correct that you are agnostic on whether Bitcoin intrinsically has value you're saying it's more the question is around how these markets operate am I right that that's that's the problem that I'm interested in yeah that's the problem that I think is because that's the problem that's relevant right now right the problem that's relevant is all these people across the world are investing their money in this stuff and if it's not a fair system for determining prices if the prices don't represent whatever the intrinsic value may or may not be right then that's the problem that we have to address before we move forward with arguing about what the actual value or use cases of these things may or may not be okay so because I was going to ask you for your opinion on a theory of next but I don't know if it's basically the same as what you just said I mean I think that it's interesting like it's that's I use almost almost exclusively I look at the ethereum blockchain right like the the interesting part for me is that this is probably the first time in history where you can track fraud in real time publicly right like I can see every transaction they make it was on on chain obviously there's a lot happening outside of that but you can still learn a lot and that's never that's never happened in history as far as I know so there are cool aspects to it but like again what's the activity on the ethereum blockchain doing it's transacting in Ponzi schemes and frauds so like it's basically so like you have software as a service which is a major like category of business to me ethereum and other blockchains like it are scam as a service that's what they're offering but really I mean like let's be fair I mean look at all the tokens listed on ethereum how many of them even even to someone who believes and say something like Bitcoin how many of them have intrinsic value even to that degree they don't and that's what that's what it's used for that's what most of the volume on this that on that blockchain is for so what is it then yeah I mean I think probably for some of the crypto entrepreneurs that listen to my show they're probably listening to this and they're thinking well I'm building something legitimate we're actually trying to do you know XYZ so for those how would you categorize those so here's what I think right this kind of goes back to what I was saying before about you know theoretically like there are use cases for blockchains right like there are banks playing around with them they're you know theoretically maybe you could use it for like tracking inventory or something whether or not you need a public decentralized blockchain for that versus a private blockchain that has nothing to do with Bitcoin or ethereum or any of the other like public blockchains that we see that's one question that I think needs to be answered but regardless there may be legitimate projects happening but the problem is that none of those projects are selling tokens to customers or to Consumers because it's almost certainly illegal right like like Securities laws say that these things are almost certainly Securities so like anyone who's trying to do this in a legitimate fashion is not selling this stuff to to people so it's not even relevant again it's like these these are these are projects that I even see as like related to the question of like what's happening in crypto they're they're doing their own thing that's completely separate they don't need the ethereum blockchain because they're building their own right I mean name one project using the ethereum blockchain that actually generates cash flow or generate something of value I haven't found it yet well I mean yeah I I guess it was for some of what you said I I it almost feels like you're saying like literally every erc20 token is is a Ponzi or a scam I mean they either are or they're they're used to transact in them I mean I don't think like usdc I don't think is a is a fraud but I think that it's what is it used for I mean it's used it's used probably to do things that is used to move money in a way that can't be moved through banks legitimately so maybe there's some questions there that need to be answered but that's I mean I don't think like usdc is a Ponzi but like most of the tokens that are sold on there are just I do think there are a lot of legitimate payments that are made in usdc and I don't think they're only the ones that can't be made via Banks because I can think of plenty of instances of people who either get paid in usdc or people who have asked me to pay them in ustc um or whatever that are just they're just normal payments um so sure but those are those are just transferring money to people that's not like that's not what's actually people are investing their money in right like people aren't like investing in stable coins thinking they're going to get rich they're buying stable coins to do other transactions on the blockchain right right okay but I for some reason I thought you were saying that every usdc transaction was one that couldn't be done legitimately through no I don't think every every one of them is but I think you can find a lot of examples of ones that are and that wouldn't be possible in the traditional the traditional finances man that's going to be a problem when Regulators now that they're finally aware of what's Happening Here it's going to be interesting to see if these stable coins are able to function in the way that they function currently I don't know if that's going to be possible if Regulators really start to get digging their teeth into it okay but mean by that I mean the way they function currently is like you can just transfer them on a blockchain and you're saying that somehow Regulators won't allow that to happen or I I guess we're going to see I don't know I think it's I think it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with all of this stuff in about a year okay meaning like you think that maybe they'll require intermediaries to send the money and that will take you okay I have no idea what those regulations what form they'll take but um I mean I mean I think what's going to happen is that a lot of the companies that have been facilitating the the banking side of the Sable coins are going to face problems and the problem is if you can't find a bank to do the transactions or to hold the money for you or to facilitate transitioning it in and out of the crypto ecosystem then that that's probably where the regulations are going to come but we'll see okay yeah I do have a question for you about thinking because I did notice you tend to write about that a lot recently yeah so and then but one other question I wanted to ask about your general stance is that do you think that crypto will take off like you know I said technology or is or is is that just still a separate question from what you like to even tackle I mean I think it is a separate question from what I like to tackle that being said I mean blockchain technology has existed for what 30 years now or something I remember exactly when it was invented but no 2008 2008 well that's that's Bitcoin Bitcoin but like in terms of like private blockchains that's been around much longer that technology has been around for a long time well as far as I understand I think bitcoin's the first blockchain no Bitcoin is the first decentralized blockchain there are there are early instances of blockchains you can you can go um I remember the name of them but that's been developed since the 90s yeah you know it's not like private blockchains are not a new technology so the fact that they haven't been they haven't been adopted in any you know Broad I mean they would have been adopted by now I guess is what I'm trying to say I mean do I think Bitcoin has certain advantages sure it does again I guess I I don't know I haven't seen what it's really used for Beyond um you know selling drugs and uh saying it's a store of value which I don't see the argument for that but and so earlier when you were talking about how you feel like it's really the markets that are the main issue here what do you feel would need to happen to make the space something more legitimate and um or or to just resolve some of these issues that you talked about well I mean realistically the space it won't exist the way it does if there's regulation right like if these things are considered Securities and this SEC is very strict about that and says hey any token that's issued by a company is a security they won't be issued because the whole point of doing this was regulatory Arbitrage right like that's why they did it the way they did it that's why all these VC firms got so interested in that was that this was a way to offer basically offer Securities contracts to Consumers without having to go through all the rigor mortal of actually following regulations or offering something that had any kind of link to anything in reality because none of these tokens confer any kind of legal right to any you know it's not like they're dead instruments or their stock or anything they just pieces of code on a blockchain I don't even know if the space will exist in a very in a similar fashion to what it is right now with true regulation I mean the question would be what is it going to be used for right I mean could I see could I see theoretically like here's example theoretically could you have like stocks on the blockchain sure you could but you know that would require it would be a completely different thing and I don't I don't know how much of a difference it would make between having it set up on a blockchain versus the way it is currently I don't know what difference that would really make and then the final point would be just because blockchain is a good technology or not let's say it is that doesn't mean they're going to use ethereum it doesn't mean they're going to use Bitcoin it doesn't mean they're going to use uh I don't know Solana or whatever like anybody can set up their own blockchain to do whatever they want they could copy the code they literally can copy the code I mean that's what like Signature Bank did for their private blockchain they largely copied the code for ethereum and modified it anybody can do that instead of their own blockchain so like I just don't see like the the case that like you have to invest in ethereum or Solana or whatever when anybody else who's who's uh well resourced and motivated can create their own blockchain to do whatever it is they want to do yeah um just to go back to using blockchains to trade stocks um paxos is working on something or frankly they already have a product like that and you know the advantage is shorter settlement times so uh you know that became an issue with Robin Hood and GameStop so well I mean that I don't I don't want to talk about that because I'm not an expert but I know that there were certain other issues with the failure to delivers on that that actually do sort of bail out the whole short squeeze thing but that's that's probably a topic for another day I mean I don't know yeah theoretically sure theoretically it's possible but again like if if like uh the NASDAQ wanted to do it on a blockchain they could just make their own blockchain and set it up on there they don't need to go buy ethereum that's my problem is like you can buy ethereum Thinking well this is going to be the future and maybe you're right I don't think you are but maybe you're right but that doesn't mean that ethereum is the future it's sort of like buying stock in uh Myspace thinking that that's going to be the only social media Network in the world right I mean it's the same it's the same problem so right but so then is that like an admission that one of these with the token will eventually take off or no it's a statement that that could happen theoretically I don't think it will could but I don't think any of the ones that currently exist will be used uh because there's no motivation to why would you like if you're if you're the NASDAQ or you're JP Morgan and you want to use set up your own blockchain to do whatever or you want to set it use a blockchain why would you like go use somebody else's when you can just make your own I mean control it from day day one I mean there's no motivation for that so like that's why I don't see the point of owning any of these projects because they can be easily replaced by somebody else's project that's used for whatever purpose it is they're using it for yeah yeah I mean I think the private ones in order for them to make sense it needs to be consortiums but because these are private companies that are used to competing with each other they haven't um really taken off one who wants to I mean realistically who actually wants to have all of their transactions public like do I want people knowing where I spend every dollar I mean like that's the whole cbdc thing right like what would you want that to be legible to everyone no I don't want that does a company want their competitors to be able to see like where they're moving inventory or something no they don't they don't want that privacy and secrecy are are valuable assets and when you're doing real business so like that's another argument about public blockchains I've never really understood is that a lot of people want privacy and they they there's no advantage to using a blockchain to this public especially in this in fact there's a disadvantage yeah we'll see what happens with zero knowledge technology which could make things private but also have like public guarantees um I feel like that that could maybe change things but we're going to move on from some

with the code Laura Link in the description back to my conversation with James so let's talk about FTX you have that Breakaway post about Alameda and I was just curious for your kind of overall General thoughts on what happened there and what the crypto industry can learn from that situation so I focused when I wrote this article because I mean obviously uh we only found out a few days later the extent of the fraud that had been happening there but the part that I focused on was um how they had used various tokens to create billions of dollars in fictitious value which they then borrowed money against and also showed to their VC investors and said look how much money we have please give us some more money for us to continue to build our you know elaborate scheme here I mean I think that you know part of the reason I was able to recognize what they were doing is that that's what a lot of these guys are doing right if you go back to I focused a lot on Celsius Network they were doing the same thing with their token they had they had created a token they were going to do what they call the flywheel which was this idea that somehow their token would be used to capture value uh and basically create this like virtuous cycle of um almost like perpetual motion and finance and if you really think about what was happening it didn't make any sense what was actually happening was they were spending their own customers money to drive the price of this token up and then marking it to their Market on their balance sheet and saying look how much money we have going to Pension funds and saying please invest with us and that's you know what happened in the case of FTX they were doing something similar but then they were also taking these tokens and using them as collateral to borrow against which was a problem because the tokens were worth nothing so the reason why these these these scams are effective or have been effective is that they use this veneer of a market to make it look like there's value so in the case of ftt token Sam could point to point to the like coin market cap or something and say look you know coin market cap Aggregates all this data from all these exchanges and says the ftt is worth a hundred dollars a token and we're going to be conservative we're going to mark it down to 80 a token on our balance sheet because we're just so conservative and then they would use it to borrow against Etc uh but in reality if you looked at where the trading was actually happening most of it was happening on FTX shocker and then if you actually looked at the the daily trading amounts the volume and the liquidity was so low that if they had tried to sell any significant fraction of their token it would have crashed it to zero in Additionally you could show basically that they were the only people owning this token meaning that there was no real organic demand for this thing nobody wanted it nobody was buying it in that if anything changed in their little closed ecosystem that caused them to need to try to get money fast it was game over for them and so that's what I published essentially and that but that's that's true for a lot of a lot of the projects and and the uh companies in the space is that's exactly what they've all done or a lot of them them have done that's the point of these tokens is you know the ones that aren't just Frank rug pulls where they just immediately sell all the tokens that they have and make a quick Buck there's some version of the scheme that FTX and Celsius were doing I think a lot of them are doing that and you know you have alluded a few times to Celsius so what similarities and differences do you see between Celsius and FTX because they have vastly different reputations than yet from what you've written there are perhaps more similarities than people might expect you know I'm not gonna I'm gonna say allegedly because I I want to be careful but you know the the founder of Celsius whose name was Alex machinski was recently sued by the New York Attorneys General for fraud um and basically using his own statements against him so you know Celsius was very badly mismanaged to say the least they took lots of money and invested in very bad ideas like you know investing in Bitcoin mining at the top of the market um into basically they have a giant mining investment now that's totally you know it doesn't make profit so they're they're having a hard time paying even to keep the rigs um actually core scientific which was a large Bitcoin miner recently declared bankruptcy in part because of their this agreement they have a Celsius results wasn't paying their bills so I mean that that was just a question of of horrible mismanagement and potentially fraud which needs to be you know we'll be determined in the coming months um I'll let the court system figure that one out I mean the difference is that we can account for most of the money that's missing in Celsius like where most of the losses were some of them we can't but I've come fairly close to figuring out where it all went and mostly it looks like just really bad Investments maybe some like related parties who profited from it but nothing like Sam who apparently was just taking money and just doing whatever he wanted with it um we haven't seen any evidence of that with Celsius so that that's the one difference but I mean Celsius and and FTX were very closely linked right like Celsius did a lot of business on FTX their token cell token traded largely I mean it wasn't exclusively on FTX but FTX was by far the largest market for a long time based on legal filings in my own work it looks like Celsius was actually using their doing their scheme to drive the price up on FTX and then they used FTX to sell overlay million dollars of assets after they had froze withdrawals to try to pay these loans back they had in D5 long story but they had a very close and very um interesting relationship with FTX that went back a long time and I think part of that can be tied back to tether because tether was an investor in Celsius they were one of the First Investors in Celsius one of the largest shareholders uh they had went over a billion or around a billion dollars worth of tether to Celsius using Bitcoin as collateral and then obviously tether and FTX and Alameda are very closely linked as well so there's there's like an interesting little Triad there of related parties and similar interests that I yeah I haven't totally figured out yet but I don't think it's a it's a coincidence that FTX and Celsius were so closely late and so at minimum just from what I read of of your newsletter it seems that you're just saying at minimum FTX um or rather the FTX Executives or founding team was somewhat closer friendly with the Celsius team and the tether teams is that yeah I I don't I don't think we've fully understood that relationship yet all I can say is that Celsius did a lot of business with FTX in a lot of business with Alameda to the point where it was I mean it was I think a unique relationship why that was I I mean saying that I'm speculating as to why but I think that the fact that they were both so closely linked with the tether cryptocurrency and that that team as well that I don't know I think that there's probably a reason for it but hopefully we'll find out I mean I don't know you know but there's still so much that we don't know about these things that has yet to be explored or uncovered and hopefully we figure it out I mean you never know some of this stuff will may never be totally resolved yeah one thing that I saw in your newsletter that I feel like I had not seen at least too much discussion of was the history of some of the executives at ftx's European subsidiary and I was curious if you could just talk about that from my audience yeah so FTX expanded into Europe I think it was mid-2021 I'd have to go back and look at my article I don't even remember anymore but long story short they bought a few different entities in Europe and I'm actually working on a follow-up article about another one of those entities but their European component of their business was licensed in uh Cyprus and it was licensed by after they purchased a company called kdna Financial Services which turns out was linked very closely to What's called the binary options industry so binary options very briefly are a type of financial instrument that allow you to bet on certain outcomes and it's like a yes or no thing so it'd be like um is Tesla stock going to be above 100 on Tuesday right like if it's yes you get paid some said about if no you lose your money and there are versions of that that are more convoluted but they're all basically the same product and the thing about the binary options industry is that it's almost exclusively dominated by fraud um and in fact in I believe 2017 it was banned in Israel which was the primary country where most of these people were originally operating from uh because of the egregious amount of fraud that was uncovered in that space so it turns out that kdna was a binary options company prior to being taken over by FTX that after FTX took it over they actually retained it appears most of the executives from that binary options business in their other exchange and this ties back to some very very uh dirty people involved in that in the industry so the fact that FTX just so happened to buy that company at that time with those ties it was very interesting and it's an interesting coincidence to say the least and actually that ties back to Celsius because it turns out that Celsius also has interesting ties to the binary options industry some of its early investors uh mashi hogay being one of them a fairly prominent guy in crypto a few years ago um who later turned out to be a fraud also had some very close ties to that industry I don't know it's it's interesting to say the least and I'm working on another article that shows that um that's not the only tie that FTX has to the binary options when will you publish that article hopefully soon I've been busy with a lot of other stuff but it's interesting I mean the thing is like the historical stuff it's like it can kind of wait you know it's not like it's going to like break the news or anything but I think it's interesting and I think it's kind of instructive as to who these guys were doing business with and then it raises some interesting questions about you know why they were doing business with these people and how they happen to know that they existed in the first place because these aren't like it's not like this kdna company was like some really prominent well-known company I mean there's barely any mention of it on the internet before FTX buys it um it was very it was not very well known it was basically a shell company that was used to operate these apparent frauds so it's very interesting that Sam found them one other article that I found interesting was you wrote a post about the bank of credit and commerce International and you described this it's kind of a historical day I believe that this bank was around probably before you were an adult um and anyway you described it's similarities to FTX and I was curious how you even dug that up and and uh you know if you if you could just recap you know what you found there and how it's similar that would be great so I mean I think that like the reason why I I am able to recognize these things for what they are is that fraud kind of it's sort of like history doesn't repeat but it Rhymes right like things look very similar and I like history so that's kind of like why I know stuff about finances I read books about you know I don't know I have like a uh John Rockefeller or like you know banking scams or whatever like uh so that's kind of where I get my experience or my knowledge from and the Bank of Commerce and credit International is just a fascinating piece of History because it ties to so many different people across the whole world in so many different crazy events so I mean briefly it was a bank that was founded I believe early 80s late 70s early 80s um by a guy named Betty who was from Pakistan who had an interesting somewhat checkered past prior to that he'd been always in banking but he ended up founding this bank with investments from the UAE as well as I believe Bank of America which subsequently a couple years later said this is getting to uh getting too hot for us and they got out but essentially it was designed to be or build itself as the bank of the third world it won't do business where nobody else is willing to do business so they end up having branches in like 78 different countries and they ended up actually operating very um heavily in England uh they ended up actually buying banks in the United States secretly that uh they were able to get away with for several years and move money through those and on the face of it they were this very successful rapidly growing financial institution that was really trying to do good um the founder of it this Betty he was a very um charitable person he gave away millions and millions of dollars to all sorts of good causes and one of the people he ended up being very close with was the former President Jimmy Carter who's known for being a philanthropy oriented guy and actually they were such good friends that Carter would regularly fly in his plane Carter when a Betty was sick Carter actually went to visit him in the hospital and was like having his own personal doctors come and see him and things so like he had a very close relationship and that was far from the only person this guy networked with everyone across the world like he was very well connected like seeing Sam up on stage with Bill Clinton and uh former Prime Minister of England like that's that's basically what this guy was doing he's the same thing but what it turned out was that it was a massive fraud in in every regard the the bank was operating with no controls um it was set up in a way to be to obfuscate it from regulators and Auditors so there were like separate each each and entity in each country was like a separate entity so like you might get audited there but they would never see the whole picture very similar to how FTX was with over 200 different companies operating all in concert in ways that make it very difficult for anyone to know the whole picture of what's really going on and what BCCI was doing was actually laundering you know billions of dollars for everyone from the Marcos family the um corrupt dictators uh Noriega the dictator Panama um the CIA actually they were moving millions of dollars to the CIA and the Iran Contra affair um they literally touched almost every like I mean drug traffickers you name it like they did business with everyone and so it's really fascinating because like you see all these things and then when they finally collapsed in all these political connections came out and all these donations came out and there's a lot of the story that a lot of people say never got told and then you look at FTX and you see like this company that to anybody who's looking at it from the outside said there are serious problems here you have the guy who founded it and runs it as this this icon who's who's going in front of uh Congress who goes on a podcast and literally says his business is running Ponzi schemes like he literally describes his own business model as as a Ponzi and he basically admits that's what it is publicly and nobody does anything about it you're talking about Odd Lots yeah I'm talking about the odd Lots thing I mean there are other examples of that right like there are examples where he brags essentially about committing bank fraud where he's having other individuals do banking for him I think there was actually in that Sequoia Sequoia VC firm that that uh invested in FTX they had a whole article about their investment that's now been taken down and I believe there's a part of it where they talk basically about how FTX had some creative banking strategies so like this always known and he was still managed to create this Aura of being this like charitable guy who's going to give away all his money he managed to give tens of millions of dollars to all these politicians get his picture with Bill Clinton everybody else and I don't know you have to wonder like what was really going on there that's that's kind of the point of that article is I mean I have I have no idea to the extent to which this goes but it's just very interesting that someone was able to infiltrate uh our government and our media to that extent so quickly and so effectively so I guess we'll see yeah yeah I found those parallels super interesting um so now let's talk about uh some of the kind of Ripple effects of the FTX collapse one that you wrote about was trouble at Signature Bank and on my show we went into depth on the issues at silvergate they're both obviously banks that cater to the crypto crowd um so just talk a little bit about what you think is happening at signature and how you expect things to unfold from here I mean I don't like to try to predict the future but signature and silvergate are basically doing very similar business to each other I mean I think one difference is that signature I believe has done a couple crypto based or Bitcoin based loans but it's not a very significant portion of their loan book compared to silvergates taking more risk that way but signature has like silvergate been doing business with a lot of entities that are questionable entities that are using questionable methods to do banking so you know the example of FTX one of the big problems that silvergate is having is that Alameda research was actually the one getting all the customers transfers for a long time uh and the bank knew that and didn't do anything about it and you know that's a problem um and if it turns out that it looks like that may have been also happening with signature so signature has their own blockchain there which we talked about a little bit before called Signet uh silvergate has the send Network these are blockchains but they operate only theoretically in inside the bag actually it turns out that there are ways to transfer money between those blockchains using fire blocks which is an interesting side point that I think is going to be fun for Regulators to try to entangle but long story short it looks like uh FTX was using Signet through elevator research so the question becomes was silver signature providing basically the same type of uh Service as uh silvergate was um to FTX the other thing is that both of them appear to have banked Finance through a shell company based in the Seychelles called key Vision development limited uh which was actually apparently struck off the register and Seychelles over a year a year ago and uh signature continued to bank them so there are concerns that they've been doing business with people that um a responsible Bank probably wouldn't and that's why most banks haven't done business with crypto and they're doing business with people that are using some very unquestionable tactics to do their banking so I think those are the problems you know and then obviously besides that there's the risk of holding all of these deposits for stable coins that are potentially at risk of sudden Bank runs um if you look at silvergate I don't know if the I think the actual earnings are out tomorrow so we'll find out how bad it really was but I think the preliminary numbers would like they lost like 700 million dollars because they had to sell all these uh short-term Securities they were holding in order to pay out these withdrawals from FTX so there are these they're also in addition to the regulatory problems there are like just the basic financial problems of holding a lot of money for people that are subject to sudden massive withdrawals when people panic so there's that and then and then signature the other thing about signature is that they have some interesting loans called their fund banking division which is by far the largest division that's grown very rapidly in the last couple of years um and nobody seems to know who they've been lending to I don't know we're going to find out I think in the next couple months what's what's happening there but um signature has an interesting history too if you go back and look at some of the uh some of the people they've done business with so all right well we'll have to see and I just want to flag for people that we're recording on Monday January 16th so when he said the earnings will be out tomorrow um they'll have been out a week by the time uh you guys got this podcast let's talk about another kind of big Domino uh in the FTX story which is dcg um you wrote a post called digital currency grift tell us a little bit about your perspective on what's happening at dcg so when I wrote that you know that's that's one example where um like I said I can be kind of one-sided and unfair at times and so when I wrote that article entitled the digital currency grift after I published it I wondered if I'd been unfair to Barry but it turns out I was not really unfair at all so digital currency group was kind of this conglomerate uh in the crypto space all of its businesses are crypto related he was a very big Bitcoin guy but he also did other business as well the two of the major components of that were Genesis that uh basically uh um ostensibly offering uh Prime broker services and reality is actually operating as its own trading house and then uh uh grayscale which is the holds the grayscale Bitcoin product as well as a number of other crypto uh trusts that are publicly traded basically a way for people that don't want to own crypto or Bitcoin directly theoretically they can buy shares of this trust and then hold it and then they have exposure to bitcoin so the problem is that there are a number of different problems but it appears based on statements from um former three Euros three arrows uh heads uh suzu I believe Kyle's all Kyle Davis is also made statements essentially what was happening was um in order to to create grayscale shares Genesis was lending Bitcoin to a variety of different trading houses who would then use that Bitcoin to create shares one of them was the three Euros capital and for a while grayscale the Bitcoin product was trading at a premium to bitcoin so there was basically this way you could make print money from from for free essentially by doing this trade um the problem is obviously free money only lasts for so long and eventually that premium became a discount and everybody blew up so long story short Genesis ends up owed over a billion dollars by this three Euros capital and the problem was they didn't have the money and they've been also borrowing a lot of money from a variety of people putting the Gemini exchange which was offering this quote-unquote earn product uh basically a crypto interest account um and they were basically giving all of the money directly to Genesis to do whatever they wanted with it so Genesis wasn't able to pay that money back so what they did was they filled the hole with the promissory note from the parent company that said hey we'll pay you 1.1 billion dollars I think in like 2029 or something I remember how far out is several years 20 32 2032 okay even worse but apparently what they were doing according to recent reports and I think according to even what the Winkle Vice said in their little uh recent post there they were marking that as a current asset on their balance sheet so this thing that's not gonna be paid off for uh nine years was being marked as something that was valued at 1.1 billion dollars today and I mean I'm not a lawyer but I think that that's going to be problematic for them it also turned out that dcg had spent I think it was 500 million dollars or so basically buying back their own stock from other uh people basically to keep the the value of this company afloat so like they were doing all sorts of these very problematic things uh with other people's money and you know eventually it got exposed I think you know the FTX thing happening finally made people realize hey there's all this hidden risk in the system we need our money back and they weren't able to make the calls when people said hey we want our money back um so apparently they're like three billion dollars in the hole and um it doesn't seem like they have anywhere close to that they're trying to sell their Venture portfolio off the estimate that's worth 500 million to me I think is um pretty generous given current market conditions I think it's probably worth a lot less than that they can try to sell coindesk I guess Dirty Bubble media will buy a coin desk someday uh we'll just have to wait a couple more years but uh no I mean it's it's um it's really tragic because it turns out you know Barry's original Barry Silver the guy who runs dcg um his original business was actually trading in the in the chairs of bankrupt companies so he has a lot of experience with bankruptcy and it sounds like he's kind of trying to drag things out in a way that will try to save him but I think that things are not going to go well and I mean it's already we're already well along the path towards serious repercussions for everyone involved I mean the SEC just filed their lawsuit a couple days ago against both Gemini and Genesis for offering this earned product illegally and I think there's going to be a lot more coming related to all of this very soon like generally kind of your take on what went wrong there really is that it's sort of like they they didn't manage their risk they were just long everything and then it sort of blew up for them as that kind of that's part of it but I mean also you really shouldn't because dcg is a private company so it's not like their stock trades on the on the uh NASDAQ near Stock Exchange or something it's a liquid right and the same thing they had a lot of venture Investments that they made that are a liquid and actually Celsius did something very similar all of the money that they had borrowed or at least all the money that I know about that they had borrowed like all the money from from Gemini those weren't like locked deposits that they had to pay back within like in five years or something it was those were demand deposits that people could come back at any time and say hey we want our money back and instead of investing that money in things that were liquid that could be easily sold in exchange back for dollars that could pay people back they made investments in things that are totally liquid like their own stock and and apparently all these Venture things and they did all that of course during this bull market where the prices were inflated and I'm sure vastly overpaid for all of it right I mean what's dcg stock worth today not not much so that money is basically gone and I don't think it's really ethical to do what they did at all I mean it's very questionable obviously from a business standpoint to do that and I think that uh I think the regulators and law enforcement are going to be um very interested in all of this because it's very questionable all right so one other thing that I wanted to ask about in terms of this kind of whole crypto contagion of 2022 is that you had written quite a lot about a number of these different lenders but you also just in general talked about the problems with tokens associated with these different companies such as ftt the sell token he also wrote about nexos problems and nexo just closure is a former sponsor of Unchained and nexo has its own token as well and I wondered if you had a general opinion on these kinds of tokens that are associated with companies I mean the fact that they haven't been regulated as Securities already is amazing to me I think that that is going to happen I mean they don't so they don't confer anything of value right like it's not like owning cell token meant that you own some equity in Celsius or owning an EXO token confers equity in in nexo it doesn't confer anything you maybe get some benefit to like in the case of ftt you could get cheaper exchange fees or something but like the the basically it's like a rewards program right it's like it's like going and like I don't even know like if there's a good comparison in the real world for this it's like it's like trading like Chuck E cheese tokens on the on the on the your stacking stage like there's no but even those you can at least use them for something you just go play games with them you can't even do that with these things so like practically there's very little use to any of them the value of them is essentially zero and the only reason why anybody thought they had value was that these markets were used to manipulate people into thinking that they had value and that's true for I think all of them I don't I haven't seen an exception to that um so yeah I mean that it's not gonna that's an example of what I mean like if there's true regulation in the space those things would have never existed like they never would have happened um I'm sure they would have found other ways I mean the market always finds a way to find to blow themselves up in Corrales hidden risk and stuff I'm sure they would have figured something out but the tokens as they exist today they would not have existed um if it had been any kind of real regulation so well here's a token that's sort of a Json you had a really interesting post about finance and the finance chain and BNB and interestingly you kind of basically said it's another variation on the one coin scam so I was kind of curious if he could just sort of recap what your thoughts are there and what you think might happen to to that chain and those coins well so one coin was a pyramid scheme and it turned out that essentially what they were doing was saying we're going to sell this crypto and it's going to be the next it's going to be the Bitcoin killer I think is what they called it and I was run by this very charismatic woman who later disappeared and has never been seen since I think she's on the on the most wanted list or something but so they but it turned out they actually never created a blockchain at all right like the the token didn't even exist it was just like a number on a database somewhere like in their Excel documents essentially like it was on a spreadsheet so when I say when I compare those things and I mean like this is based on other people's work so like you know I've validated the best I can but a lot of the features of how the the binance blockchains operate They Don't Really operate like public blockchains at all the code has been essentially obfuscated for a very long time they're finally releasing bits and pieces of it it appears that certain workarounds are used to like basically retroactively rewrite code and things that is very questionable I mean it's not it's not like something that uh Satoshi would not be happy with it let's put it that way and the whole idea of a company owning its own blockchain I mean the thing again it's sort of like going back to the idea of these things are scam as a service what what is what is the what is their blockchain actually used for right like look at what look at what the projects are on they're almost exclusively very very poor rug pull type projects almost exclusively and they have a few D5 quote unquote D5 decentralized Finance protocols that are actually run essentially by binance directly so there's nothing decentralized about the binance uh blockchain that's why I don't really think of it like a real I don't think it's really like it's not really like ethereum or anything else I mean whether or not ethereum has value is a separate question at least it is a public blockchain right at least there is something there that is public there's by any of this is not like that and then the price mechanics of the BNB token are incredibly questionable uh based on multiple people's analysis of how that token behaves so there's a lot of a lot of questionable things about it and um I think that I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens with it let's put it that way so um the last kind of like news bit that I wanted to ask you about from your newsletter was you wrote about the case of avraham Eisenberg the mango markets exploiter and I felt that your takeaway was definitely different from what we hear in the rest of the crypto space so can you talk a little bit about what your perspective is on that case well I don't know what the the takeaway is for everybody else with her business takeaway you know they think that he you know manipulated markets and that like even though sometimes they might say code is law I think in this case they're like no no no no he's like explaining this is it's like an economic exploit um and then but then the other thing is that um some I had some lawyers on my show who it said that they felt that some of the enforcement around this put at risk the ability for white hat hackers to um do the kind of work that they typically do in D5 which was kind of an interesting take but so what's your yeah my take I mean my take is that it's not borrowing if you don't intend to pay somebody back and that's what he did right like he figured out a way to trick a protocol into lending him money and he never paid it back and he had no intention of paying it back they paid back some of it because he I don't know if because he had to her because he felt like it I don't know why he did what he did but he kept he kept at least half right or around half of the money and obviously like you can read the lawsuit that's been filed against him I mean like even if you think of these things as Commodities like there are certain rules about how you trade Commodities and he clearly violated all of them I mean he's used everything from like you know trading he was trading with himself and he was you know creating these like vast price movements using basically manipulation like I mean again I'm not a lawyer so I don't know what's going to happen but I mean but that's the thing is like what he's doing is the part I guess maybe that's different from the other crypto people or whatever is that I don't think that what he's doing is all that different from what crypto is doing in general right like again these tokens would not exist if they were truly regulated like the Securities and commodities that they are right like this is all regulatory Arbitrage all of that all of this or a very large portion of what's happening is that so like what he's doing is just like a extreme version right it's not like these exchanges aren't trading against their own customers they all they all admit they're doing it that's what that's what Sam was doing on FTX that's what that's what binance does they admit that their market makers their own biases he submitted that like they're trading against their own customers it's the same same thing it's just that he he did it in a way that got him in trouble faster than them because he was so obvious about it and it doesn't help it doesn't help when you go on Twitter and admit what you did and say that and explain exactly how you did it I mean that if you look at like Alex machinsky's other example where like I mean literally read the lawsuit against him and they're just like listing all the tweets that he wrote about different things and it's like okay well you just I mean you dug your own grave right so and then again and then the Genesis thing too like I think the reason why the SEC moved when they did I know the winklevi complained about that but it's probably because all this stuff is public and now it's very easy for them to say okay well you guys said this you just basically admitted the whole thing like you know good luck now like they don't have to worry about trying to litigate it because they're gonna they basically already gave gave them the gave them the whole case so I think the lesson from uh Abraham is you know if you're going to do these things at least try not to be too public about it [Laughter] this has been a fascinating conversation what have I not asked after that you you want my listeners to know no it's been a good conversation I can't think of anything all right well where can people learn more about you and your work yeah they can uh go to Dirty Bubble media substack.com I also tweet under the name Mike burgersberg um which you know if Elon decides to shut me down I guess you might so I'd say focus on the sub stack that's where the real work is done so all right perfect well thank you so
