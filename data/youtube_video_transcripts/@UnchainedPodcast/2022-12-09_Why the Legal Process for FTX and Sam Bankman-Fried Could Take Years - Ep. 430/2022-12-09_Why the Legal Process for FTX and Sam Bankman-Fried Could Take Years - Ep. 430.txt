hey everyone just wanted to state two quick clarifications about recent shows in this past Tuesday's show with ram alawalia and Sam Andrew about all things Genesis and dcg Sam and I stated that alone to three arrows Capital accounted for 47 percent of genesis's loan book this was technically true as of June 30th but not true when the loan was originated ROM explained that the figure was likely that high because as Genesis began to call in loans the good loans got called back but then the bad loans remained taking up a huge portion of the loan book second in the episode the Tuesday before that with Michael Jordan and Alex pack Michael said that there was a tweet from dokwan confirming that the Luna Foundation guard's selling of UST in a curve pool to purchase Bitcoin set off the d-peg however I talked to doe and this was a misinterpretation of his tweet he says that the UST sold to buy Bitcoin didn't come from a curve pull but instead from the Luna Foundation guard's own Holdings and actually significantly predated the withdrawal of liquidity from that UST curve pool hope that that clarifies things and now onto the show hey everyone just a quick note before we begin Unchained

the description today's guest is V Li partner and head of regulatory and policy at Bain Capital crypto welcome V hi Laura thanks for having me after the collapse of FTX and the Revelation that customer funds were allegedly lent to Sister trading firm Alameda and then lost founder and former CEO Sam Pinkman freed has been in the hot seat there are at least six investigations into what happened with the latest of these being that the Manhattan prosecutor's office is looking into whether he manipulated the market for Terra and Luna can we just do kind of a quick overview of all of these different investigations and actually now that I think I think it might even be seven do you want to just go over which ones are the most important and why yeah so since you just mentioned this um potential like Market manipulation with respect to the Terra Luna incident earlier this year why don't we just cover that real quick because I think that one is actually really interesting um I think the article that reported this did not say when this investigation started I suspect that this has probably been going on for a while simply because you know the collapse of Terra Luna happened like back in April so the theory that they're allegedly pursuing here is a really interesting one right it's it's something that you do Steve from time to time this idea that like it's illegal to engage in trading to artificially increase or decrease the price of some asset whether it's like a security or a commodity or something like that so the idea is that instead of reflecting like the market-based forces of supply and demand you're tricking other Market participants into buying and selling something at an artificial price so that's fraud right so and it can be a crime so typically when Market manipulation is charged it involves the manipulation of like a security or a commodity like I said right so there's criminal statutes on Commodities fraud there's criminal statute on Securities fraud and then of course these things are often also charged under wire fraud when it comes to crypto assets though I wonder if you know in this case it involved Market manipulation of Tara so I wonder if if in this case they'll run into the same issue you that they had in the two cases the federal prosecutors that is the two cases that they brought earlier this year involving the open C employee and the coinbase employee and the brother and it was the cousin where they charged quote unquote insider trading but didn't allege the involvement of any security or commodity or anything like that so it was just charged under wire fraud so I'm I was looking at some cases involving Market manipulation and the only one I was able to find that only charged wire fraud without like a Securities fraud charge or a commodity spread charge involved um I don't know if you remember this but from a few a few years back uh some Deutsche Bank Traders were charged with manipulating the Libor rate um and they were convicted in that so that was just charged under wire fraud because you know the Libor rate is it's not a security or a commodity but in that case what's interesting is that the convictions were later thrown out because the judge said that like it's basically not possible to manipulate the Libor rate because there's no like natural market rate for Libor in the way that there is for like an equity or a commodity commodity future or something like that so I don't I don't know that that would be an issue here because I think you know most crypto assets do have a market or like a prevailing market price that's determined by natural forces of supply and demand but it's just something to be aware of you know like how they brought these Market manipulation charges in the past and and how could it apply here and then that's the Criminal part so on the SEC and the cftc side there are also Provisions that prohibit Market manipulation and it's the same exact idea pretty much it's just that it does have to involve a security or a commodity and I think if the SEC was investigating this too and ended up charging it they would do the same thing that they did you know that they would have to do in like the insider trading cases in the open C and coinbase incidents where they would allege that you know Terra Luna is the security and that um they tried to manipulate the price of it in order to profit oh well and we so I don't I don't remember but open c i remember that that was charged as insider trading but it was by the SEC yeah so in the open C case the SEC did not bring a parallel case I I'm not sure why but I think it's because you know they've never actually brought a case asserting that nfts were Securities whereas they obviously have brought cases asserting that tokens are securities right and so they did bring a parallel case in the coinbase insider trading case because that involved tokens my guess is that in the open C case it's just less of a settled issue for them whether nfts are securities or not okay yeah and one other thing just earlier you said Tara Luna happened in April it was May but then besides that there's this also uh there's also a Department of Justice investigation can you talk about that because that's probably going to be criminal as well right yeah so you can bring a criminal charge for Market manipulation right and so a lot of times these cases involve something called like spoofing which is when you place a bunch of orders that you never actually intend to fill in order to drive the price up or down right yeah but I'm not talking about the Terra Luna potential Market manipulation anymore I'm just talking about the investigation to FDX oh okay you want to talk about FTX uh the recent events not but yeah so the recent events yeah so you know I think people have a lot of questions about how the process is played out so far um and how it's likely going to play out in the coming weeks and months so you know we know that the doj and the SEC and possibly other Regulators or other criminal authorities are investigating and I you know we're still learning the facts and Sam has obviously been speaking out publicly but I think right now I feel pretty like comfortable saying that enough facts have come to light to suggest that there probably was fraud committed and at the very least the misuse or misappropriation of customer funds and you know Caroline Ellison the CEO of Alameda herself The Wall Street Journal reported that she told her employees in a video call right that um that she Sam and other executives that FTX were aware that customer funds were being moved to Alameda and so you know the question is I think a question a lot of people have including me are like why hasn't he been arrested and will he be arrested will others be arrested and and what's taking so long and what's he doing going on on all these podcasts and Twitter spaces and doing all of these interviews like what's up with that yeah well can you answer those questions like why hasn't he been I don't I don't so I know he just retained an attorney like recently I don't know if he had legal representation when he was going out and doing all of these interviews I find it hard to believe that like if he did have a lawyer that the lawyer would not have strongly advised him against doing that it's certainly very unconventional for someone who is being investigated for potential crimes to be speaking out as much as he has but I think he's trying to to shape the narrative and and preempt you know what potential like criminal or other charges might be coming down the line right yes I think he's trying to you know sort of paint this narrative that this was about like mistakes or you know the fact that he wasn't paying close enough attention to what was going on or like maybe taking on a little bit too much risk or I think at other times he suggested that like this was all due to like you know a downturn in the market that he had no control over or like a bank run which he also had no control over so I think he's he's suggesting that you know it's all of these other things other than just outright fraud and like misuse of of customer funds people are calling this the bad businessman strategy and saying it's not a crime to be a bad business person yeah so we're going to

Cohen who was the lawyer for Elaine Maxwell who was affiliated with Jeffrey Epstein and I wondered what that said to you about what kind of Defense he's likely to undertake that selection of lawyer yeah I mean Mark Cohen is a seasoned criminal lawyer he's done criminal trials he's done civil trials he's worked on cases involving Securities fraud um he's taken you know cases to a verdict including like acquittals and so I mean it makes sense that he would choose some someone like that as opposed to I think like for a little bit there he was represented by some Stanford law professors you know David Mills who I think is still advising him but anyway yeah that's possible yeah but you know if you're facing potential criminal charges in the southern district of New York no less like you want an actual criminal lawyer who had has experience trying Federal criminal cases and white collar cases and so I mean you know to me it signals that he wants someone who is able to do that if it does come to that so I was curious because he said he's down to one hundred thousand dollars in One bank account so I was curious how much a lawyer like that cost I I mean I think I probably a lot more than that depending on how you know the investigation proceeds and whether he is eventually charged and whether he decides to go to trial or not you know obviously if he decides to go to trial that could that's going to be a long process and it's going to involve a lot of work and and that would you know result in a lot and more expenses but if he if he is planning to negotiate a plea then this could be resolved um more quickly right so I think it really depends on how this all puts out and and and the route that he wants to take and earlier you mentioned how everybody's wondering why he hasn't already been arrested so why why not yeah so so I think it's important to kind of like take a step back I know there's like a lot happening and just to sort of go through how these criminal investigations and like if there's an SEC enforcement matter going on like how they typically work just so people have like a realistic idea of how things are likely to play out so on the criminal side this is very basic but in order to arrest someone in a situation like this you need an arrest warrant right so you can get that through either an indictment returned by a grand jury or a criminal complaint um but either of those have to be based on probable cause and if the person is overseas in a country like the Bahamas which the US does have an extradition treaty with the doj would then work with the office of international Affairs to have the person extradited and so if the person submits to being extradited then the process should be pretty quick like they'll be back in the U.S pretty soon but some countries allow you to challenge your extradition right so like Julian Assange for instance challenged his extradition and that took a long time to play out so that could prolong the process I don't know what the process is in the Bahamas for someone to challenge their to challenge an extradition request but if if Sam avails himself of that that could prolong the process so you know the doj is either like in the process of investigating the facts in order to establish probable cause to get an arrest warrant here or it's possible that they've already obtained one like we don't know right if if they had an arrest warrant and are actively working towards extradition that wouldn't necessarily be public right arrest warrants are typically kept under seal for obvious reasons like if the person you're planning to arrest gets wind of it then they could be a Flight Risk so it's totally possible also that they already have an arrest warrant and are just working on that um and that's not public um but you know assuming that they're still investigating that can take a lot of time right like they have to get search warrants to get access to documents and data potentially they have to sift through all of the documents and they data they might want to interview Witnesses right all of this stuff is really complicated in addition when it's a lot of this stuff is located overseas right so you know hopefully they're getting access to like what they need because the criminal authorities in the Bahamas are willing to cooperate and then of course FTX has a new CEO and and lawyers and they're presumably cooperating and doing what they need to like preserve documents and turn over evidence to the government and things like that I do think one potential wrinkle here though is that the government is probably also investigating the role that officials and government officials in the Bahamas may have played in in all of this right so um you know there were reports right that like after the accounts were frozen and no one could withdraw their money there were reports that some of the accounts belonging to officials in the Bahamas and like their family members like they were allowed to withdraw their money um when everyone else's accounts were frozen and then of course that happened the same week after the accounts were frozen and I think there are still questions there about whether some of that money was transferred to government accounts in the Bahamas or you know whether they directed some of that or Were Somehow involved right so to the extent that the U.S is also investigating potential involvement by any government officials there that could also complicate the cooperation between the two countries um and that could also prolong things right and then with criminal investigations like this there's always the possibility that there are people who are cooperating Caroline Ellison was reportedly spotted in New York City recently and it's also been reported that she's hired the law firm Wilmer Hale which you know as a lot of people know they have like a star roster of former Federal prosecutors including the former like sdny U.S attorney himself preparara yes exactly um so you know cooperating Witnesses if if that's something that's happening here cooperating witnesses can speed up an investigation right if they're if they're providing evidence that can be like corroborated that could really help the federal prosecutors here establish probable cause that they need to get the arrest of you know Sam or potentially others and so you know I don't think that's rocket science here that there are probably individuals involved that have an incentive to cooperate sooner rather than later so that can also affect the timing of the investigation and like when an arrest could you know could happen and you know I know people have been like Bernie Madoff situation and I think he was arrested within like a week or something of of his crimes coming to light but you know I would just caution like that situation was really different um because Madoff you know he basically confessed his crimes to his sons and then they called the FBI who showed up at his house like soon after that anybody basically admitted to all of it right like oh and this all happened over the course of like a week so that's obviously not the situation here which is why it's probably just going to take longer like Sam hasn't openly admitted to criminal conduct and in fact he's you know like we were saying earlier he's been pushing like a very different Narrative of just like you know maybe he made mistakes or wasn't paying attention or or it was just like made Bad Business decisions or something right like everything but criminal fraud and so I think it's just for that reason too it's very different than something like Madoff where you did see an arrest right away I think this is going to take more time yeah and just to understand like earlier when you were saying that there might already be an arrest warrant and like leaving this situation with the Bahamian government aside since so many journalists are going and meeting Sam right now and even setting up film Crews and his you know either his apartment or you know some of the other FTX apartments and interviewing him and all that um it's very easy to or not easy I you know there's security at the place where he lives but I'm just trying to say that it seems like maybe it's these other factors not that they haven't like tried or something it's like they're probably waiting for various reasons yeah you're saying like in the case that they actually do have an arrest warrant yeah like I wouldn't imagine that it's like actually hard considering all the other people that are going to meet him in person so there is the extradition process that they would have to undergo right like they have to work through that process like I don't I don't think that FBI could just show up in the Bahamas they would have to work with the government law enforcement in the Bahamas to to get him extradited and then when he's here the you know that process would would take over okay and then I wanted to ask when you mentioned that um most likely there will be some kind of fraud charge obviously the word fraud has been thrown around a lot uh just kind of in I think a non-legal way but I imagine that in a legal way there would need to be like a certain bar for evidence um and like for instance you know I just think when you're a journalist sometimes you know whether or not you use the word lie to describe what somebody a statement somebody has made you know it kind of requires having a sense of their intention or you know being in their brain and so it can be a little bit difficult and they imagine that that's a similar case here I I don't know but can you just explain to me sort of what the legal bar would need to be for fraud to be proven yeah so if you know if the federal prosecutors bring a criminal fraud charge here would likely be brought under the wire front statute which is very broad you know it can cover all kinds of fraud which involves you know things like stealing customer funds and lying to customers about what's happening with their funds and lying to investors about you know how the money that they're investing is going to be used right so something like that could be brought under a wire fraud charge it's pretty broad um and fraud you know like people use it like you said in the colloquial sense but actually when it's used in like a criminal context it's pretty straightforward it's like what you know an average like person would consider fraud and so you know if it turns out that customer funds here were misappropriated in light especially of like the terms of use that prohibited the customer funds from being used that way I mean that's just outright deception that's frog right you're telling customers that you're not going to use their money for any purpose like that and then you take the money in order to plug in like holes and cover up losses in your Affiliated like hedge fund that's I mean that's going to qualify as like criminal wire fraud got it and then as you said earlier this really could go anywhere in terms of it ending up in a plea deal or maybe even going to trial um I don't know if you have an opinion on which of those is more likely um but I was also curious regardless of of that question what kind of punishment do you think he's likely to face both under a plea deal and if it goes to trial yeah I mean so there are so many factors right that go into clean negotiations and that's that's even assuming that you know if if the doj decides to charge him it's not a given that they're even going to offer him a plea deal right they have no like obligation to that's totally up to the federal prosecutors whether they want to do that or not and then if they do write like his potential sentence which which would ultimately be decided by a judge like the federal prosecutors don't decide what the sentence is going to be but they do decide what criminal charges to bring and then there are sentencing ranges that are associated with those charges right so they do have some discretion as to what charges they decide to bring how many charges they decide to bring and what sentencing ranges are associated with those charges and then that is ultimately what the judge would work with you know if he's convicted to decide what his sentence is going to be but you know if he's if he's charged with wire fraud which is you know um the most obvious like outcome if if the facts support it then I think he's facing something like 20 plus years in jail and you know if there multiple charges like it there's there's flexibility as to how they can charge like one count with respect to like different you know conduct that happened and that's something that you know if they offer him a plea they can always negotiate that right that happens all the time where you know if if the defendant is willing to plead and to cooperate or something like that then they might work with the person to you know decide like what the charges are going to be and and what the ultimate sentencing range is going to be so that's all a part of the negotiation I mean who knows what he's going to do I think you know he's going to decide based on what the charges are and what's on the table but do you feel that the fact that the strategy so far seems to be this bad businessman strategy means that he's less likely to take a plea deal like in the sense that if so far he hasn't been willing to admit that there was fraud then like do you think it means that maybe he's less likely to accept a plea deal don't think necessarily I mean you know he's he's doing all of this right now but like his mindset could totally change once he's actually faced with an indictment right or like a complaint and he sees What charges are on the table and how much time he can be facing I mean he could be singing a very different tune once he's faced with with all of that so I don't necessarily think that you know what he's doing now is any indication of how he would react or respond once he's actually facing charges okay and then the only kind of somewhat uh recent comparison I could make maybe would be what happened with theranos where the initial fraud was revealed in the Wall Street Journal in the fall of 2015 and it's only in the last month that the top Executives there Elizabeth Holmes and sunny balwani were sentenced so how long do you expect some kind of conclusion like that to occur for the FTX story yeah so when the reporter there broke that story I think even then it took I think it took something like a year right for her to even be indicted so that investigation took a long time I mean who knows that you know the same the investigation here could take something like months up to a year or longer and that if I recall the reporting there was actually pretty comprehensive it was pretty it was a pretty thorough job and yet it still took them you know that much time to to get their case together in order to charge her and then of course once it went to trial you know you have to go through the discovery process and um you know there could be like a lot of witnesses involved that the government wants to talk to to prepare their case and there's like a motion to dismiss stage there's summary judgment so there's all sorts of stages that you have to go through before it even gets to a trial and then the trial itself has to occur so it can take years you know like things that could make it take longer as if the defense brings a lot of motions to challenge the admission of certain evidence or things like that and so there are all sorts of things that can happen in a criminal proceeding to really like draw out the process so I think it's really hard to say but if Sam does choose you know if he is charged and he chooses to take it to trial it could be years and if he chooses to plea deals on how long or how quickly could that wrap up that could wrap up quickly I mean if they you know if if assuming they offer him some kind of deal right which I said is not a given but if they do and he is willing to plead and accept responsibility and they can agree on what the charges are going to be and and things that would affect the sentencing ranges then it could happen very quickly so it's just it all depends on how he he wants to proceed if it comes to that all right well this has been um just very uh insightful and um kind of yeah just just interesting to learn more of the legal process about how all this works is there anything that I didn't ask you that you would want to add yeah so I just wanted to mention too that you know the SEC is also reportedly investigating not just this situation involving like FTX and Alameda and the potential misuse of customer funds but I think the SEC is also involving um this like marketing potential Market manipulation with respect to Terra Luna um so you know I don't know people know this but you know when the SEC and the doj are doing parallel investigations like this which is not at all uncommon I I spent about six years at the SEC five of that was as an attorney in the enforcement Division and we did a lot of cases in parallel with the criminal authorities so if the SEC is also investigating like all of those things that I described earlier that the doj is likely doing as a part of its investigation I mean I expect the SEC and maybe other you know the other Regulators that are looking into this I expect them to be just right there alongside the doj you know looking at the evidence interviewing Witnesses together and that sort of thing it's not at all uncommon for them to do that you know if the SEC is also investigating that in parallel or this recent FTX Alameda situation um it's not at all uncommon for them to conduct those investigations in parallel and and share information and things like that and a lot of times they even you know if they decide to bring charges like the SEC decides to bring a civil enforcement action and the criminal authorities decide to bring a criminal charge they'll often like even announce it at the same time not always they didn't do that um with Elizabeth Holmes but usually they'll try to time it so that the charges are announced at the same time but the the thing there is that typically if you know the cases are brought in parallel the SEC case and any other civil case will be stayed meaning the judge will basically put a pause on it and allow the criminal process to come to a resolution before allowing the SEC and civil cases to proceed so we could that's that's what I would expect if that happens here okay one thing actually that that makes me think about is the fact that in the coinbase insider trading case the SEC basically just stated these certain tokens or Securities without providing the rationale for that so if that were to happen it sounds like they would do the same for perhaps Tara and Luna um which would cause another whole interesting wrinkle and everything yeah in the coin in the secby case the coinbase case yeah so they actually did include some analysis not a lot but they did do sort of like like kind of a short Howie analysis for each of the I think it was like nine tokens that they alleged were Securities so I would expect them to do that here they haven't done that in every enforcement action that they've brought that involved alleged Securities right so like there was a case I believe it was from last year where they charged a crypto exchange called poloniex for operating an unregistered Securities Exchange but in their order they don't actually they didn't actually say which Securities or which tokens were allegedly Securities so there have been there's been at least one instance where they have just declined to allege what tokens were Securities but they did do it in SEC B wahi the coinbase case and they did do like a Charlotte Howie analysis so okay yeah but I think also people took issue with the fact that then those token teams couldn't kind of like defend uh but anyway okay well this has been just super interesting and also um really informative thank you so much for explaining it all on Unchained of course thanks Laura for having me on don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap Taylor Swift rejected a 100 million dollar sponsorship deal with FTX the financial times reported that FTX attempted to strike a nine-figure sponsorship deal with Taylor Swift that included an nft arrangement despite negotiating with a pop star the talks fell through before ftx's eventual collapse in November apparently former FTX CEO Sam bankman freed is a big fan of Taylor or as one employee told the Ft big fan of Tete FTX also had extravagantly expensive deals with many celebrity figures such as Tom Brady Gisele Bundchen Naomi Osaka Shaquille O'Neal and Steph Curry the report calls into question ftx's internal decision making which led to clashes between bankman Freed's Inner Circle and more experienced executives Bloomberg
