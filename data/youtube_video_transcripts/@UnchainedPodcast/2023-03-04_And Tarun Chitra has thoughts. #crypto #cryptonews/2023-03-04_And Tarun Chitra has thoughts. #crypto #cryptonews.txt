well I think uh you know I saw a very maybe somewhat Politically Incorrect tweet about um bass which was uh it's binance smart chain for white people and so so to get some context binance smart chain is a chain actually very similar to coinbase in the sense of it you know have a smaller set of validators you can't just like join and validate the chain um and it uh it's sort of where a lot of retail users in China and Asia go to first have their first experience with actually using a wallet uh and it's it's very popular it's like the most popular blockchain actually by transaction volume but the interesting thing is I guess the US doesn't really have that experience
