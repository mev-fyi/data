hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no-hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Lauren I've got one more announcement about my live podcast recording with metallic Buderus we have chosen a venue on March 20th Vitalik and I will be on stage at Columbia Journalism school and the Joseph D Jamil lecture hall on the third floor as I said on Twitter this is especially meaningful for me because I went to Columbia j-school and never imagined when I went there that I'd be holding an event in the same building 11 years hence this choice of venue actually has nothing to do with my alumni status it is pure serendipity which makes it all the sweeter the evening starts at 6 p.m. with food and drinks batalik and I will start a conversation at 7 and we'll wrap up around 8:15 there will be a short Q&A at the end plus a few giveaways and we'll round up a night with more drinks and networking until 9 p.m. if you haven't yet bought your tickets I suggest you do so ASAP as there are only a few left go to the Eventbrite link inside your podcast player now to get a seat at what is shaping up to be a fabulous event also if you're a podcast listener not based in New York you can pre submit a video of yourself asking vitalik a question I'll select a few to play during the event just record a short video of yourself one minute max stating your first and last name location and affiliation if relevant and asking your question email it to hello at Unchained podcast comm with a subject line of video question otherwise I hope to see you on March 20th at 6 p.m. at the first Unchained live for a night delving into the pressing questions about whether aetherium is losing its lead how batalik use the competition heating up at the smart contract space governance and more it's going to be a substantive fabulous conversation so get tickets now and I will see you at Columbia within months cryptocurrency anti money laundering regulations go global are you ready avoid stiff penalties are blacklisting by deploying effective anti money laundering tools for exchanges and crypto businesses the same tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy the topic or topics of today's episode are finance finance chain and B&B tokens my guests who will be discussing this are Kyle somani and to Shara Jayne managing partners of multi coin Capital welcome Kyle and - char hey Laura great to be on thanks for having us hey Laura great to be on again so let's just be clear for the listeners your firm has invested in B & B tokens so I just want everyone listening to be aware of that in general hopefully most listeners are aware that anytime I have investors on my show of course they're gonna talk positively about anything they've invested and but Kyla - char I wanted you to come on the show because multi coin recently did a pretty in-depth look at Finance and its strategy to decentralize and finance is obviously a hugely important company in the crypto space and there were a lot of really interesting observations in bold forecasts you guys made that I thought we could unpack and for listeners who haven't listened to my episode with cz from last summer I urge you to do so to hear more about finances background and also really just to get the flavor of what cz is like honestly I'm not gonna lie that's probably my favorite interview I've ever done he's just the kind of person who really has strengthened his convictions and it really shows and it was just a really it was just a fabulous conversation but sook I lied to char why don't we start by describing the success of Finance and its centralized exchange so far yeah absolutely so this is - char and we were we've been watching finance and their execution ever since they launched in 2017 and we've been incredibly impressed by how well they've executed that really just dominating the crypto spot trading market they have by far the most volume of any other crypto exchange that that offers spot trading and in fact they have more volume than the other top three competitors combined well all of these numbers are subject to some modification to remove some of what we call wash trading so if you go look on coin market cap and you look at top exchanges those numbers aren't exactly accurate so in our report and in our research we referenced some findings from the blockchain transparency institute which looked at all of these exchanges and tried to determine the amount of real volume as opposed to you know just reported volume finance has also been incredibly aggressive in listing tokens and they offer the most token pairs of any of the major spot trading exchanges out there so you know their dominance in both volume as well as token pairs is unquestioned and one thing that I always just love about their story and again if you haven't listened to the episode was cz from last summer definitely do so because he describes on there how he had never even heard of an ICO and then within like I think I forget that timeframe it was just a few weeks I forget like three weeks or 15 days or something after hearing of an IC o---- for the first time he was holding an ICO and he raised I shouldn't feel like beans tempers up before we started again but I think was like what was it fifteen million it was about fifteen million dollars yeah and then within five months became the number one crypto exchange so it was just I mean it you know obviously the cliche term to describe that is a meteoric rise but that is just such a good description of what happened there so one of the things that you mentioned in your report was that what's been especially impressive about finance becoming so dominant is the fact that it doesn't for any Fiat pairs so why is that a such an impressive feat yeah so you know if you consider getting into crypto all right assuming you have no crypto you want to convert some of your fiat money into Bitcoin or aetherium or something else and you need to be able to do that with a fiat - crypto exchange so coinbase in the u.s. is probably the most dominant fiat crypto exchange and different countries around the world there are other exchanges that have kind of local local dominance for getting people on board in the crypto but then a lot of an exchange a finance finance until very recently did not have any Fiat crypto support at all I had only supported trading crypto to crypto and so what's actually probably most remarkable and really most counterintuitive about finances rise has been that they became the world's dominant spot trading exchange despite the fact they did not have any Fiat crypto so that means people came in you know fiat crypto on coinbase or on Bobby or on bid hum or whatever exchange in their local jurisdiction got into Bitcoin or ether and then went to finance and then it kind of did most of the rest of their trading there and it's pretty remarkable that that's led to the most financed being the most dominant exchange yep and I'd like to add a few more stats here that we pulled up from the report that we published recently and what we see here is that by Nance is the top traded exchange for 82% of the top 50 tokens and Finance is facilitating thirty six point six percent of global crypto spot trading volumes so those are just some numbers to help put that into perspective and to have accomplished that without having any support for fiat currencies during the period that we're describing is quite simply phenomenal yeah because of course at that time when Finance had just launched you know that was the summer of 2017 so at that moment the kind of awareness of crypto maybe was sort of hitting the mainstream but definitely it was before we saw the real real massive run up with all kinds of every people getting into crypto which happened more in the fall so after that crazy bull run how has finance been faring so far in this crypto winter it seems from our observations that finance did not make the same mistake that many other organizations in crypto made where they over invested and they grew too large during the bull market and had to go and you know cut things back through crypto winter from what we have found by Nance you know has not undergone any meaningful layoffs they actually seem to be growing at a healthy pace and from the latest information that we have they have about 400 employees around the world so I think that they have been quite disciplined in how they grew and this is paying off for them now as they're able to continue investing throughout the crypto winter while some other organizations you know maybe are having to pull back yeah I wonder if some of that discipline you're talking about is I mean who you know I I didn't ask cz this but I do remember I asked him kind of about all his newfound wealth and he said something about how it hasn't really driven him to to purchase or spend anything flashy because he said it's just the knowledge that he could that was enough so maybe if he has sort of a similar kind of attitude for his business you know to be to be pretty frugal or or just to not let things go to his head than that might have been the case oh and what about trading volumes on Finance during the script I winter so trading volumes just if you denominated in Fiat just are generally going to match market prices so you can see that you know trading volumes across all exchanges are down about the same as the market is down so that is that is definitely affected by Nance just as much as it's affected the other exchanges from our analysis this was all proportional and none of the major exchanges the you know by nan spit phonetics coinbase crackin and other topics changes of the world seem to have benefited or been hurt disproportionately through crypto winter in terms of volume and I know some people have been making noise about coinbase seeming to have changed its philosophy entirely almost some people are surmising it's kind of reaching for revenue do you feel like buying ads has changed its any any part of its operating ethos I guess due to the fact that volumes are down no we don't really think it has I mean the most remarkable thing about my dance is the day they really executed this regulatory arbitrage strategy from inception right they move to headquarters I think five times if I'm not mistaken and so maybe they're just kind of structurally a very decentralized organization and they had they have been since inception their 400 employees are spread across 40 countries or so so so given that my finances has been pretty true to their mission of enabling people to anything call their time as exchange anything nerve change the world exchange the world yeah that's that's the tagline and and it's been pretty clear from day one that that's been that's been the mission and that their growth path and trajectory has aligned very strongly to that if you look at you know all of the new initiatives they're rolling out over the course of 2019 those all are really just an acceleration of that mission so things like my name's chain and the centralized exchange the decks that that is very large implications for the future of Finance team and employees Launchpad as a capital formation and fundraising platform look at my intense research and look at the Fiat exchanges I mean everything they're doing is in support of that mission but you know doing so in a way to be do it in a compliant way and to do it in a way that bridges the old world to the new world yeah and we're going to get into all of that more deeply in a second but I want to establish a little bit more stuff about finance before we get into its decentralisation strategy so you know we've been talking about kind of what it's been doing or just how it hasn't seemed to really change its strategy but so what business moves has it been making this past year like I know you know adding Fiat is one of them like what what are some of the things that you see it's it's been putting into place yep I think finance has been fairly aggressive in expanding out their business and taking advantage of this bear market as an opportunity to really build and so a few of the key initiatives are as you mentioned Fiat exchanges they brought on Fiat exchanges in Jersey which supports euros and pounds they I believe have also brought on their Singapore exchange as well as one in Uganda and from what we found in our research it it seems their plans are to bring on ten crypto to Fiat exchanges over the course of 2019 so that's a fairly meaningful initiative on its own on top of that we have the launch of Finance chain which will offer a decentralized exchange for which they released a test net fairly recently and this decentralized exchange is in our opinion the most important and largest initiative that finance is taking on right now and just to show you know how committed they are to the decentralized exchange in order to attract volumes to these centralized exchange the fees are actually lower on the decentralized exchange versus a centralized exchange something that we haven't really seen elsewhere in addition to that they have recently executed the first two successful sales on the finance Launchpad platform which is effectively a platform for icos or initial coin offerings and they have a schedule set out where they're going to be doing one sale per month both of the the first sales that they did sold out extremely quickly so they've shown some success with the launch pad product as well and last but not least they've been devoting a lot of energy to their research initiative and really know sharing research with their clients and their users and trying to create a better informed crypto community and while that doesn't necessarily have the direct monetization opportunities as this first three initiatives I think it's also incredibly impactful in you know being a very mission driven culture they me how this fits with what finance is doing and can you also describe the secure asset fund for users and why that's important oh absolutely so many exchanges have been targets of hacks or other types of security problems in the past you know everyone knows about the infamous mount GOx incident and I mean even more recently we have things like quad Riga in Canada and there were a few attacks last year as well primarily on some Asian exchanges if I recall correctly and so in response to those types of events Finance has created what they call thus a foo fun essay a few which I was named after a typo that cz had on Twitter just like hotle we encrypt our love our typos becoming mean but they went and they created the Sabu fund and I believe that is capitalized through some of the trading fees that finance earns and is made available to insure against losses in the event that finances security is breached however as far as we are aware we have no evidence that financial security has ever been breached or that any funds have ever been lost but it's nice to know that there is an Insurance Fund in place in the event that that does happen and I also wanted to ask about this fact which I find pretty distinctive about finance it doesn't have a bank account so where does it hold its assets so Finance holds their crypto assets in a variety of you know cold storage wallets from from what we understand those are distributed across the world and I believe that the the by Nance Fiat to crypto exchanges have bank accounts in the jurisdictions in which they're domiciled so you'd expect finance jersey to have a bank count in Jersey and Finance Singapore will have a bank account in Singapore but the core entity is still free of the Fiat system and so if they're accepting payment for something it has to be the this other party has to pay them in crypto is that how that works I believe so and I believe they also pay people in crypto now I know that a large percentage I think the vast majority of their employees take a significant part of their salaries in B&B tokens but other cryptos that are used to pay employees you know most likely include assets like Bitcoin or US DC and other stable coins those are quite useful for payments and why does it not have a bank account I think that the regulatory arbitrage strategy which they undertook in the early days would have probably been harder to execute if they were reliant on a bank account and given the fact that they were operating only a crypto decrypt I'll exchange and have any Fiat support I think C Z and team probably made the determination that a bank account was more trouble than it was worth at the time and this goes back to I think a comment maybe it was Kyle meter earlier which is about how it's not clear which government has jurisdiction over by Nance so why is that not clear and why is that significant yeah so I mean it's not that any one government doesn't have mr. jurisdiction is just that die Nance operates across many jurisdictions they have now he settled kind of a home base in Singapore they also set up another you know HQ one HQ two kind of a thing in Malta it appears they're working on some sort of HQ three in South America somewhere although that's still TBD you know where that's gonna end up so maybe they are subject to jurisdictions in those local local regions but they now have the the level of scale such that they can negotiate with governments and and get you know get favorable treatment and and guarantees that there they're not gonna get like my my name is launched in China in July 2017 and she wants later the Chinese government shut down crypto like that that was always a very scarring experience for finance and so now I think as they operate on a go-forward basis they're gonna try and structure deals with with you know regional governments to ensure that you know something like that doesn't happen again so this is something that I pressed cz on in my episode with him and I did recently see he tweeted that he felt like some of the questions were misleading which I have a feeling what he's referencing is at this point in our discussion where it wasn't clear to me that he fully understood kind of like how a security is defined in the US which is obviously different than other jurisdictions and also or maybe he does know but you know at least when it comes to as you see I think that they say if you're serving US customers and they have jurisdiction so I noticed in your report you so that you actually thought that finance had little risk of being prosecuted for listing unregistered securities and of course with a huge amount of tokens they have most likely at least if you probably are so why why do you think there is little risk of that there's a couple of reasons one reason is that you know we have seen that the SEC and other American regulators are really taking a good-faith approach to the industry it we haven't seen the regulator's really go after anyone who was operating in good faith and you know who did the best to comply with regulations given how gray the regulations really are and from our research you know specifically looking into by Nance's listing process it appears that they're operating in good faith and so you know we think that they are no more at risk of being in violation of listing potential security than you know any other exchange you know an exchange like crackin or coinbase or bit FedEx and so we don't think that the SEC is likely to go after any one of those exchanges given that they've all engaged in the same activity and we do think that the good faith approach practiced by finance in this case it does de-risk it a little bit now that doesn't mean that that there isn't a risk there that's that's definitely a risk there's an unknown that how will the regulator's actually act and you know what happens from here but all the evidence that we have so far points towards you know actors who have acted in good faith or are not at risk and why why do you say you don't feel like their risk isn't greater than these other exchanges because they had such a or they have still such a you know larger number of tokens that they offer so wouldn't it be I mean maybe maybe the argument could simply be that they just offered many more than these other exchanges so they might be more of a target plausible but I mean you look at coinbase just listed XRP BitFenix has a very large number of listings that you know are a significant subset of finance crackin has you know a very large number of listings as well it just it seems unlikely that finance gets singled out in this example though you know we can't predict precisely what the regulators will do and then also when you were saying it looks like they made a good-faith effort how are you defining good-faith is it because they have like a vetting process or yeah well what constitutes good faith yep it's you know they have a structured vetting process there's you know multiple people within the organization that seem to need to sign off before anything is listed you know they are requiring from what we understand a legal opinion saying that a token is not age security before it is listed so between those those various aspects I think that's what in our opinion constitutes a good faith effort they've also been proactive in dealing assets when there's been some teams that the teams may be were we're trying in the faith to build whatever they said they were gonna build ultimately gave up or fails for whatever reason and the team is basically gonna shut down shut down shop finances then been proactive and delisting those assets as well and then I noticed in your report you also have this section about money transmission laws how well does finance follow those laws and what risks is it taking in regards to money transmission laws so we are not necessarily experts on you know the specifics of global money transmission regulation from what we have understood you know a lot of those laws really apply to the fiat side of the world and now that they have finally launched some Fiat support I'm sure they're you know working with those regulators in those jurisdictions to be compliant with all applicable regulation so you know we're not we're not lawyers we're not we're not anyone's attorneys so you know we can't say that they have a absolutely clean bill of health but from what we've seen I think that everything is in compliance ok great so we're gonna discuss finances plans to decentralize and the B & B token after the break but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors face it regulations can stall or kill a fast-moving crypto business new F aft and EU cryptocurrency AML laws are coming soon you could be hit with stiff fines or blacklisted no matter where your servers are in the world prepare now deploy the same powerful cipher trace tools used by regulators protect your assets streamline your compliance programs and keep your exchange or crypto business out of the regulators crosshairs learn how effective anti money laundering tools help keep your crypto business safe and trusted learn more at siphysicians.org why don't you go more into detail on that yeah so finance is kind of recognized that a they want to they want to fulfill the crypto vision in the long run of decentralizing kind of core financial infrastructure and technology infrastructure for the world at large and it's not you know not it's not beyond them that they are running a currently a centralized exchange business which obviously is not decentralized and enjoyed by Nance has started to make a pretty proactive efforts to build a blockchain that will really support high-throughput trading of assets and that that chain is gonna be called by Nance decks by Nance it seems like started working on this really in earnest probably six months ago or so maybe a little longer six nine months ago they rolled out a test net pretty recently and I think the finance chain is going to be going live in production at some point in March so we're pretty excited to see that come out the really cool thing about finance chain is it will allow for truly decentralized peer-to-peer exchange finance Inc or finance the company will not be in any way able to censor trades hold user funds innovate their accounts users will be in control of their own keys and so it's a you know it's a pretty radical approach in that direction the other major major major breakthrough here is in understanding the capital flows of the system today in centralized exchange world finance takes some fees on every trade that happens so if you trades let's say one Bitcoin for you know ten ether then Finance is gonna take I don't know ten basis points or 20 basis points or whatever the fees are of that trade in the the in the finance chain exchange model different people can run the validators the chain is going to start off somewhat centralized it's a lot of validators but the plan is to make that to grow that number pretty quickly and at some point anyone who owns B and B tokens is gonna be able to stake their tokens towards being a validator and then if you are a validator and the bindings chain then every time other people trade on the - chain the validators in the network will actually receive those fees the fees will not go to buy an sync they will go directly to validators or meaning directly to be in B holders and so this is a major major shift in strategy and in how revenues ultimately collected through the system and that is really exciting for both the future of democratizing kind of this financial infrastructure and for the future of BnB token holders and and can you just contrast that setup with some of the other popular decentralize exchanges or exchange protocols that are out there like 0x like I don't I don't know if it's a very different model or or similar yeah so the financing model is pretty substantially different so the 0x protocol lives on top of the etherium blockchain the founders at 0x realized pretty early on that if you wanted to do a decentralized exchange on top of aetherium it would be pretty difficult to do what's called an on chain order book right so in a traditional order book you've limit orders people saying I'm gonna I'm willing to sell one Bitcoin for ten ether at that ratio of one to ten some of the person may say I'll sell one Bitcoin for ninety third right so that's a different price ratio so you know you need be able to host that order book of all of these different limit orders in etherium the block times are out 15 seconds and the throughput of the system is not super high and so putting limit orders on the blockchain directly is simply unfeasible I'm the 0x team realized that from its you know basically from from inception and so they started building a system where people could basically match those orders off chain and then just do the settlement on chain so just the actual part where you trade the Bitcoin for the ether but not that's a part of price discovery and hosting limit orders and so that's what the 0x contract does that was a big step forward for decentralized exchanges on top of the theorem but unfortunately what we've seen in practice is that there's still a few a few practical problems that have really prevented market makers and liquidity providers from providing liquidity on top of 0x protocol the first is that if you want to cancel an order you need to pay gas fees and the Xerox model and that becomes very expensive most for for those of you don't know how market makers behave market makers are placing orders and canceling orders a ton it's actually very common that market makers may cancel 70 80 or even 90% of the total orders they place on the order book because as prices move around they will cancel old old orders that have not been filled and so given that it becomes prohibitively expensive for market makers to to maintain liquidity on 0 X base 3 layers the other big problem with the 0x model is lack of deterministic order execution and what we mean by that is um the block times every 15 seconds and because miners in aetherium control ultimately which transactions are included in the block even if a market maker thinks he has matched he or she has matched an order with another trader you don't actually know that order has been filled and actually settled on chain until you see it in a block the next block could be in two seconds it could be in ten seconds it could be in thirty five seconds you don't actually know when that's going to be filled or if the miner or if the miners gonna replace your you know your signature with someone else's and fill it themselves and so it creates a lot of uncertainty for market makers on how trades actually get executed and filled and so as a result of these problems we just haven't seen liquidity on zero X based real ayres on top of the theory and really take off in a meaningful way I think last time I looked volumes were like under two million dollars a day or maybe a million dollars a day it's it's pretty low so finance chain is obviously these guys know how to run a centralized exchange and so they've designed the exchange from the ground up to solve both these problems in a meaningful way canceling orders will be free and then trade block x or one second and the validators in the system rotate in a deterministic way finance chain cannot offer perfectly deterministic order execution in the way that a centralized exchange can but I can do it in a way that's ten or a hundred times faster then kind of what's the status quo on top of theorem and so the expectation is that you know those with those problems solved - chain will be able to offer an aunt a tour de book with no no cost of canceling orders with nearly perfect deterministic execution well and you know I didn't mean to like only pick on Xerox but you know just in general as you were describing a lot of these duck says have pretty much almost no liquidity no adoption so is it just pretty much the speed and and the fact you know that this chain is built for this are those kind of the main reasons that you think this will be different like like you know what are the scenarios in which also it could end up with very little liquidity and adoption yeah I mean it's possible if people don't want to trade on it then it's probably possible that it ends up with no liquidity one of the ways finance is trying to mitigate that risk was specifically I mean financier is there was trying to cannibalize their own business is the kind of explicit explicit goal here and one of the ways they are encouraging people both makers and takers to over to finance chain is about offering lower fees on the decentralized exchanges and centralized one so there's actually a fundamental economic motivation to move over coupled with you know just general trade execution it's our expectation that finance will solve the cold-start problem that is really plagued most decentralized exchangers historically in addition to that they are also supporting Hardware wallets from day one so they've announced that Ledger will be supporting the financed chain and the decentralized exchange from the day that finance chain is launched they have also already seen implementations of finance chain through crust wallet which is their web 3 wallet that they acquired recently and so I think that they will have much better tooling already available in order to attract volume to their decentralized exchange and while we don't have any details I do expect that there will be some mechanism to bridge liquidity between their dominant centralized exchange and the new decentralized exchange oh well if that's interesting you say that because in the report it seemed that you guys were pretty certain that they would draw on the liquidity in the centralized exchange - to overcome that problem in the Dex but but you're not actually 100% certain about that they just haven't released any mechanisms or details regarding that however from everything that we can tell from their business strategy it seems pretty clear that there will be some mechanisms but until we see the mechanisms themselves we can't comment on the effectiveness okay and I did see you guys kind of gotten to some of the details around the fact that it's utilizing tender mint can you talk a little bit about you know how that affects the performance I guess of Finance chain or you know why that's significant yeah so tenorman is really today the gold standard in proof of stake because that's rhythms the tenement protocol was invented by Jay Kwan and Ethan Buckman from the Kosmos team and they started working on this I think in 2014 they've been working on this for quite some time tenorman is we spend a lot of our time working with early-stage entrepreneurs building all kinds of different proof of stake those algorithms and general recognition among everyone is that tenorman is really just the gold standard in the construction of them it's the simplest it's the most straightforward it makes the kind of the least assumptions in terms of kind of protocol operation and it offers very high performance so my Nan's I think very smartly chose to fork kind of the core cosmos sdk and the core cosmos system which means they are kind of receiving tenorman and all of its benefits as part of what they're building the net effect of that is the system will be fast and it will offer near nearly perfect deterministic order of execution which is what traders need yep some of the details our I think there will be one second block x with one second finality and so you don't have the problem of you know when will my trade be settled when when can I know if the trade actually happened you know that it's one second per second so or one block per second and that's something that proof of state systems allow which proof-of-work systems simply do not and I think that's an enormous advantage for finance chain and then one other thing is that apparently by netting will only support the assets that cosmos supports so how old Bitcoin be traded on Finance chain that's a great question while cosmos and their their internet of blockchain system you know is unlikely to be able to integrate with Bitcoin in the in the early days finance seems to have adopted the Gateway model in order to support trading of assets that are not immediately supported by cosmos or issued on Finance chain itself and what does that mean that gateway model so the Gateway model is one where it's similar to wrapped Bitcoin if you w bt c which is bitcoin that has been deposited with bit go along with i think a certain number of other members in that consortium and they then issue an asset called W BTC which is an ER C 20 token which basically puts Bitcoin on the etherium blockchain and the gateway model does introduce some counterparty risk in that the Gateway that you know you're depositing the actual assets into and receiving a you know the token that represents those assets from you know you have to trust that gateway however those are you know fairly easily audited you know I believe that for the W BTC product you can go and verify those Bitcoin on chain match the number of WBT see that has been issued and that information is available to everyone to see all of the time and so the gateway model is a is a good short-term step until inter blockchain communication grows more mature and you know potentially integrates with other block chains like Bitcoin since since buying an Cena is gonna be decentralized how will they decide which assets to list like it just is it you know they're like right now by Nance itself has this vetting process but how is it going to be decided for by Nance chain yeah so we don't have I think all hundred percent of the details but we have a general structure is known and it's gonna be basically kind of a community voting model people if you want to propose an youto can be listed on finance chain the kind of the issuer or will need to buy and I believe burn or I think burn or spend B&B tokens there's gonna be a pretty large number I think they said it's gonna be I think on the order of a hundred thousand dollars or more um the intention is to scare away all of the lower quality projects and then there's gonna be some frequency of voting where B&B holders can vote and say either yes we want to trade this asset or no we don't all the details of like the timing of those cycles how many you know or is there a new vote every week those kinds of things are still unclear but the general structure is not as known yes so let's talk a little bit more about B&B token let's talk about how its structured now you've defined it as a discount token why don't you explain what that is and just explain generally how it's used in the current finance universe absolutely so the finance token is an interesting hybrid of many different use cases the the first use case is really that of a discount token in that if you pay your trading fees on by Nantz the centralized exchange or the finance chain decks in B&B tokens you get a discounted rate and this incentivizes traders to hold B&B tokens in their accounts and use them to pay for their trading fees in order to pay you know what is a substantially discounted rate in addition to being a discount token in that regard it is also a staking token and in multiple ways first users who hold a significant amount of B and B get discounted fees on the centralized exchange so just by holding some b and b you also get an additional fee discount also if you hold a significant amount of B & B I believe it's 500 B & B at the moment your referral fees from actually sending out your referral code to invite new users to the by Nets exchange are doubled and so that provides an additional incentive and last but certainly not least and actually in our opinion the one of the most important pure utility aspects of the finance Jane or the B&B token is staking B&B tokens as a validator on finance chain in being able to earn a percentage of you know all fees that are paid on the finance chain and I think that's extraordinarily valuable those are all of the the on chain kind of properties that are inherent to the Finance token but in a dish to all of those the finance company has also committed to using 20% of their profits to buy and burn B&B tokens until they have burned a hundred million tokens in total there were 200 million tokens created no more can ever be created and so this buy and burn would remove at least half of all B&B tokens ever created from the supply now on that topic I do want to go a little bit deeper and talk about you know some some concerns or open questions about this buy and burn model you know there have been some open questions about you know is finance actually buying those tokens that they're burning from the open market or are they just using some of the B&B that they're being paid as fees as part of the exchange accumulating those and then burning those later the answer to that is it's not clear which of the two that they're doing but it doesn't really matter at all because at the end of the day the number of B&B outstanding is decreasing and this means that each and every B&B that you do hold has greater utility in all of the aspects that I mentioned earlier so you know let's say there's a hundred and seventy five million B&B outstanding today and you own you know 175 thousand B&B you have 0.1 percent of all the BMV in existence once finance Inc is done burning the remainder of the B&B that they have committed to burning then you will own a substantially greater percentage of the total outstanding BnB and so if you stake those in finance chain you will earn a larger reward or a larger percentage of the fees without having to you know go and buy any more tokens so this is kind of similar to how stock buybacks will increase earnings per share in the equities world this isn't an equity and you know there there are some differences there but I think some of those heuristics can be borrowed in order to understand the mechanics behind the buy and burn here yeah one of the most fascinating parts about this whole description is that it's one of the coins I feel where you can look at it and just from your description there's they've got kind of the utility aspect right where there's gonna be because because it has utility there's going to be high velocity there's gonna be a lot of turnover people are going to be using the token you know and it really only has that use but then on the flip side in terms of the value of the token as we know the higher your velocity the lower the value and so then there's that stinking element or this other stuff that you mentioned about how your referral fees get higher the more you hold where that kind of like reduces the velocity and so helps prop up the value and then the burning obviously you know they can't do the exact Bitcoin model obviously since they did do an IC o---- but it's sort of a similar concept we're kind of like getting real estate now when there's like a lot of them out there kind of helps you later on as the supply decreases so it's just really fascinating it it just seems like they've really thought pretty carefully about how to preserve the value of that token but also obviously make sure that it's useful for something however so going back to what I mentioned earlier and obviously I'm not a lawyer either as as you've been saying but just from my understanding of the how we test I do think B&B at least right now you know let's just regard the part about finance chain that it does fit the definition of a security in the US and and that's because the definition is that it should be an investment contract in a common enterprise whose profits are dependent on an identifiable party which in this case would be finance so do you really think I mean you know we kind of discussed this issue about the company and you know whether or not they'll face certain regulatory risks but what about for the token for its ICO how big do you think the legal risk is for them for what they've issued that's a great question and so first you know I want to to say that securities aren't necessarily a bad thing you know we are not the the right group to to determine you know is B&B a security or not that's going to be up to the regulators and the courts to decide but you know being a security isn't you know just an unequivocally negative thing there's there are certain restrictions that come with it but otherwise you know I own plenty of securities personally you know apples Apple shares RI security so it's it's not just like some negative thing to be now let's look at you know what happens if the courts do determine that B&B is a security well there's a couple of things that are possible the first is that they ask any venue that is trading this unregistered security to delist it given that the vast vast majority of B&B trading volume occurs on by Nance itself this seems to be a low risk to us just because finance is not within entirely within the u.s. jurisdiction and so it seems unlikely that liquidity would just vanish if that statement was made by the US regulators or the other thing that we've seen with you know unauthorized securities offerings is you have to give investors in the IC o---- a put right where you have to give them the ability to get their money back at the price that they paid however I would be absolutely shocked if any of the original B&B IC o---- investors decided to exercise that right if it was provided to them given that it would be entirely economically just irrational to do so finance coin has you know delivered extremely attractive returns since the ICO and so even if it is determined a security I do not think that you know rational investor would actually you know try to exercise that put right and get their money back for lack of a better term so you know while there is some risk there it's just something that you know we as investors are willing to take on you know we are compensated for taking risk and you know if we didn't want to take any risk we would just be investing in US Treasuries so one other thing I wanted to talk about was in your report you made a pretty bold claim that finance will become the first company to start out centralized achieve scale and then decentralize itself and migrate value capture from finance to the BnB token how can you feel so confident of that now when it's pretty early yeah so I mean if I think throughout the report we highlight some quotes from CDs made over the last year that pretty strongly insinuate that that is the game plan and then it's also just very clear if you look at just generally how finances if all things an organization like that is that is the game plan see the the the the company is already quite decentralized in a lot of ways I mean the four hundred people work across 40 countries they are a very global company in nature yeah the current centralized exchange does you know a decentralized kind of are sexually but like they they were launching B&B and the finance they're launching the my name is chain to disrupt themselves and the ultimate manifestation of disrupting themselves with finance chain is that they decentralized themselves and so that that's very clear that that's the kind of long term vision it's actually unclear if that will happen but if if there is a company that is going to start on centralized scale and then decentralize itself it's hard to imagine it being any one other than finance you know what time scale do you imagine that happening over it's hard to say at this point this is definitely gonna be slow I can't imagine it would be I mean a what is fully decentralized me and that that's somewhat ambiguous but I didn't expect at least five years and you also said that you imagine finance will become the first decentralized autonomous corporation how do you define that and how is it literally just that they'll disrupt the actual existing company and what will be left is the binary chain and B&B token or how will that happen yep so I want to start with a quote from cz this is from the most recent quote unquote earnings announcement and token burden and so in that cz says from an earnings standpoint finance Dex will not directly increase profitability for finance but it will certainly increase the utility of B&B in a big way that should be good for B&B holders finance is also a large holder of B&B so we benefit the same way as all B&B holders the more people using by Nance chain the more value is created or the more successful we all become and from that and other quotes similar to that what we see is that you know I think cz really understands that the vision for blockchain technology is to remove rent-seeking middlemen and allow users of a network to actually own that network and the same is true of an exchange an exchange is just a network it's another type of network you know it's not just it's not a network in the same way that a communications network is necessarily but it's a network and its benefits from the same types of network effects and so what we see is the actual way that this happens is that more and more of the trading volume and almost you know eventually all of the trading volume moves to the decentralized exchange as a decentralized exchange has lower fees and also allows the users of the decentralized exchange to own you know some percentage of the exchange themselves and then you know by Nance is basically become a decentralized autonomous corporation you know a combine the earning of the fees you know being paid out to B&B holders as part of a nice chain with the fact that B&B holders will be voting on what tokens are listed on the on the chain and I'm sure there will be some other details revealed about governance of you know upgrading the system etc so in that case it turns B&B into basically the ownership touken of the finance chain and the finance chain is that quote-unquote decentralized autonomous corporation didn't that vision does buy Nance itself still exist I believe that the that the Fiat to crypto portions of by Nance you know cannot actually be decentralized I mean those require an actual bank account and that that's going to be impossible to decentralize unless we see you know some some massive changes in regulatory structure so there will still be some centralized components to buy Nance that continue to exist and one thing is when you were describing this vision I've heard you guys also talk about sort of like well basically finance employees and how they've bought into this vision or or just kind of seen part of this movement so how would you describe kind of like being be employees what you know why they've decided to join the company and and stuff like that absolutely I think one thing that's that's very clear from our interactions with both the you know the leadership team at finance as well as you know many of the everyday employees is that this is a company that really has a missionary culture rather than a mercenary culture you know we can tell that they that they truly care about this industry they really want to do you know what's right for increasing adoption and you know I think that came through in your interview Laura with cz last year it was I think pretty clear to anyone who listens to cz speak that you know here is someone who really isn't just motivated by the money is really motivated by the mission and what blockchain technology and crypto can accomplish for billions of people around the world and so culture really does flow from the top there and I think cz is an excellent representation of that the parallel that that I actually drew in the blog posts that we published announcing the report was to Jeff Bezos where you know it's very clear from looking at Jeff Bezos actions and quotes over you know the past 20-plus years that he believes in putting the customer first in everything that Amazon does they put the customer first his most famous quote at least in my opinion is your margin is my opportunity because it gives an opportunity to cut prices and benefit customers and so you know seeing that same ethos here with cz is something that you know I as an investor find extremely attractive and then in addition to you know all of those philosophical aspects just from a pure financial perspective and a pure you know aligned incentives perspective we do know that a very large percentage of finance employees are taking a significant portion of their core salary not bonuses their core salary in DMV tokens and we know that Finance Inc is incentivized you know by holding a large amount of B&D tokens as well and so you know while being in business with you know people who really believe in what they're doing and are doing it for the right reasons is very important so is making sure that incentives are properly aligned and I think you know both of those conditions are present here yeah I've also heard you guys say that a lot of the employees have taken pay cuts to work at finance so to not only take a pay cut but then to be compensated in the company's own token I definitely would say a lot of them have really bought in so this has been super fascinating but um and and definitely you've painted like a very kind of bullish picture and you know as I mentioned I really I just had so much respect for Zizi after our interview because I really grilled him hard and he you know like I said he just really kind of believes in what he's doing and and he didn't take it poorly at all like I did a 100th episode where listeners and past guests could send in recordings and he sent in a recording and he said it was his toughest interview but anyway so you know with all this stuff that we've said here obviously you know I know you guys believe in finance and what they're trying to do around to centralization but what do you think are the biggest risks to their decentralisation strategy like you know if five years from now or whatever we say okay their plan to decentralize failed what do you think will have been the factors that kept it from succeeding that's a that's a great question I think that there are really two categories of risks here category one of risks is you know risk to the to the existing business and you know some of the main risks to the existing business many of these which we noted in our report our competitors accelerating tokin listings and being successful in attracting volume away from finance you know we have seen that for example coinbase has gotten very aggressive in listing new tokens recently however we do think that this risk is is mitigated or is quite low because you know we can look at the actions from you know let's let's look at coinbase in particular you know they listed CVC they listed loom they listed manna they listed GNT and those tokens are really not or coinbase was not able to attract a significant portion of the volume away from finance on those tokens and so we don't really see competitors coming in and listing these tokens as being that large of a risk another risk is that competitors start lowering pricing finance has the lowest fees in the industry and they are able to sustain this through scale this is you know why they are one of the largest exchanges in the industry if one of these other exchanges is able to cut their fees to compete you know they may be successful in attracting some volume however that might be difficult in this crypto winter given that you know some of these exchanges are you know out there looking to raise capital or have you know recently raised capital and need to justify you know having revenue at certain amounts in order to to really meet investor expectations so it becomes really hard to cut fees in that scenario are there any other factors that you think will have kept it from succeeding yep so now let's get to the second category of risks and these are risks around execution of these future projects namely by Nance chain I mean by nan Shan is not live yet we have seen a test net we've played with the test net but test net is pretty cool it seems to work but you know it's not in production and until it's in production we cannot know for sure how it will work there could be failures with tender bench we'd you know we don't have a tender mint chain in production that you know we can point to operating for the past X years with you know perfect security and finality so there could be some failure there as well and so there is meaningful technical risk here and if that technical risk plays out you know we could see that that finance chain fails for purely technological reasons I think that's probably the most material risk facing B & B today okay great well thanks so much for joining the show to talk about B & B and finance and finance chain
