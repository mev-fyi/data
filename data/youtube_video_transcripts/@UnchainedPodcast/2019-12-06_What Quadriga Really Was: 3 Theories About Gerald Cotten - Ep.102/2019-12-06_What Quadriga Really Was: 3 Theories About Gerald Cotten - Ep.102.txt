you wrote an excellent article on is it quadriga or quad Riga I say quad Riga though in truth it depends I think who you're talking to okay because I used to say quadriga and then when I read it was like for the Roman chariot so I was like oh it should be like quadriga I studied Latin and I still am not sure I I think in Canada I heard quadriga more often but I can't bring myself to pronounce it that way oh okay because I think that's yeah more like an English pronunciation and then quad Riga is more like Italian but anyway okay oh maybe that's why I go there yeah so you were this great article I will just say quadriga they caught quadriga exchange for Vanity Fair and I think most of my listeners will know this exchange as being the Canadian exchange that closed after the owner Gerald cotton mysteriously died in India and because he was the only one with the private keys that meant that the 250 million dollars owned by the 75,000 users of quadriga was not accessible however there were a number of clues such as the fact that he created his well shortly before his death that he knew that an exchange needed to have backups of private keys etc that this may not have actually been an error so what did you find out about Gerald cotton and his background yeah well I mean that's a good account of what the original story was that he had lost the attention was on this this idea that he had lost his keys to the Wallace the cold Wallace had all the funds were on but it quickly was determined really by people on anonymous accounts online commenting on Reddit and Twitter and and the like that those wallets were in fact probably empty or that a lot of money had already moved out of them and and that was indeed borne out once our instant young the accounting firm that was tasked with tracking down all of the money by a by a court had access to some of the these internal accounts and files although they weren't there wasn't very good bookkeeping going on but they basically figured that out as well and so then then attention started to turn to cotton himself who he was who his business partners were and what kind of business quadriga was exactly yeah and so what did you find out about him I think the main thing to understand about him the the main turn in the investigation and public perception of the case is that he wasn't really this persona that he projected which was this bright young Bitcoin enthusiast who was very excited about the possibilities of a virtual currency in a kind of utopian sense and that he was a kind of can-do businessman who was trying to make it easier to spread you know to propagate this technology he really was first and foremost a Ponzi schemer he had a much you know his experience with running Ponzi schemes went back to his early high school years from he was 14 or 15 there are records of his involvement and these very crazy labyrinthine websites devoted to this online Ponzi scheme world about which I knew very little before investigating you know for reporting the piece but that was really where he lived and it was only when he was in his mid to late 20s after running a series of rackets for years from more than a decade that he turned to the idea of a crypto currency exchange and and once you go in you know pretty deep into his history you start to realize that I started to realize that that quadriga for much more in common with these other schemes he had run in the then with you know the Bitcoin ideology and so why don't we actually just dive into a couple of these just briefly because one of them the one that yes he did while he was in high school that one blew my mind he was 15 and he started something called S&S investments which was a pyramid scheme the other was Midas gold which I believe people in the crypto space probably should have heard of and he did that with a partner that he had met in these forums devoted to these so-called high-yield investment programs or hyi Peas can you talk a little bit about who Michael was you know what these hyi peas were and a little bit more about their history and like Midas gold yeah so the the real turn came when the the scrutiny turned from cotton himself to his co-founder Michael patron who it was known to you know it it varied depending on what community you're in but basically people in the Bitcoin world in Canada for the most part knew who he was knew him personally it's not a huge world at the time he was someone who had a shady past that people you know which which didn't necessarily distinguish him greatly there are a lot of people and that's in this fear then and I'm talking about the early days of quadriga 2013 2014 2015 around there there were a lot of people who had you know maybe a checkered past who were drawn to this technology doesn't mean they were all operating with with ill intent but he was certainly one of them he had a record a criminal record he'd served time in a federal penitentiary in the US for his part in a kind of money an earlier money laundering scheme and he had he had been associated with a number of sort of online essentially money laundering operations which depending on how one you know the level of illegality kind of depended on how he looked at it and what level of suspension of disbelief you wanted to ascribe to it but but Midas gold was one of the most popular and it was used to transfer funds money Fiat into Liberty Reserve which is sort of a you know predecessor to to some to crypto current of cryptocurrency and so he was he was a middleman in that process and one thing that was revealed early on was that you know not only did Patra and cotton have a relationship that went back to you know when cotton was 14 and 15 and haunting these these online forums about hy IPs but they had worked together on just about every a number of enterprises over the years usually patrin was more in that kind of financial services area so operations like Midas gold were transferring funds from one type of you know a fiat into some other kind of currency and and cotton tended to do the more sort of outright you know investment programs which were basically Ponzi schemes where he would say you know give me a hundred dollars and I'll give you back one hundred and fifty dollars tomorrow that kind of thing you know with varying degrees of sophistication and yes one of the big breaks was that it was determined that it was discovered that Midas gold and it's in its online registration documents used Jerry Cotton's contact information and that was sort of the first glimpse of this collaboration professional collaboration that had been going on before quadriga and really all the way back to to Kahn's teenage years yeah and one other piece of this was that Michael patran is actually not Michael Bertrand his name is omar de nani so there was like a whole another thing about that but i actually just want to move on to what was actually going on at kawatche riga you wrote quote we now know that cotton began no later than 2015 to steal his clients funds he also created dozens of false trading accounts to stimulate trading volume on the platform in fact he even disclosed in the 2015 filings this was to go public he neglected to disclose how that he filled those fake accounts with invented funds trading counterfeit Bitcoin for real Bitcoin and Canadian and American dollars by the time of his death Cotton's sham training accounts which had names like r2d2 c-3po spelled not not the way that they sound but anyway you guys you could read an article had conducted approximately 300,000 trades so you also mentioned other shady things like that he dealt in cash which is obviously very weird for crypto exchange and you also mention though that these business irregularities appear appear to have begun before Patran and the other board members left so do you think they knew it's so hard to unravel I mean that there's so there's so many it's scams on top of scams and and sort of crimes on top of crimes that it it's hard to unravel at a certain point and you know I think and that's that's how I wrote the piece is essentially there's different theories of the case you know by one theory of the case I think it's it's it's it's it's impossible not to it's impossible to leave that he started quadriga out of some kind of for the reasons I guess that he he spoke about it publicly he it's meeting Michael I'm sorry meaning cotton cotton with Michael started he founded quad Riga and cotton was the public facing representative he's the one who gave interviews and boosted it for the most part and of course he spoke about you know the glories of cryptocurrency and how it was really difficult to trade if you were just a normal person without technical expertise and and this was a platform that would make it easy it seems by under any interpretation that was not his motivation it seemed to have started as some kind of a scheme the question then is what kind of scheme was it okay you know what let's do this so let's take our ad break right now and so in a moment we're going to discuss your three main theories for what actually happen but first we'll have this quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins well government-backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and

comm that's et oro comm back to my conversation with nathaniel rich alright so let's talk about you your three main theories you have three theories the first being that Quatro girl was a scam the second you dubbed the Royal [ __ ] up and then the third was what you called the mastermind theory so why don't you just start with the first one like what are the events or what's the evidence that you have for this game theory right well I think you know I should say in all three they start as a scam I think that's that sort of there's no other possible interpretation but it's what kind of scam is and I think that under the first theory it was a scam in this in the mold of all the other scams he had basically wrong to that point which is he was trying to lure a lot of people onto the platform get them to deposit money he was taking a percentage but but it seems that the real the real way to make money was once you have a lot of people's money locked up on the account to pull the plug you know give people excuses excuses after excuses and essentially run away with a lot of the money and blame third parties you know banks who are uncooperative or software glitches and so on and and that stuff started to happen indeed there was a software glitch that seems to have actually been been real where they lost 14 million dollars in a single in one fell swoop there were third-party payment processors who had to serve as the platform's intermediary with with Canadian banks because of the regulations in Canada and a bunch of those businesses which are pretty shady enterprises to the end with also appeared to have you know stolen money and charged huge transaction fees and so on and however there's the possibility that at a certain point he started to become convinced you know started to drink the kool-aid and started to become convinced that this business actually could be very profitable as a legitimate business and and that starts to happen once the price of Bitcoin goes on this stratospheric rise and so there's there's there is a possibility that around 2016 when he made efforts to take the the company public that he actually thought okay you know I'm not going to Rob I don't need to rob these people simply the volume of trading going on in the exchange was significant enough that I could just make it a fortune in this legitimate way and he was he was making a lot of money at that time at one point quadriga was processing a billion dollars of trades a year and he was getting a cut of every single one so that's kind of the best case the most virtuous theory is that he started off somewhat corrupt and then tried to do good and then it just like didn't work out that then things started to see started to fall apart so is this now the royal [ __ ] theory well no under under this first area the virtuous theory then people did steal from him you know these third party payment process stole from him they lost money and in an effort to try to make back his clients funds he started to conduct some questionable trades you know moving money out of the exchange which we know he did and and making bets on pretty high-risk bets on unfairly obscure forms of cryptocurrency in an effort to recoup the losses that were legitimate and then and we know for a fact he was making these bets and the bet spiraled and he kept you know he basically kept doubling down and kept losing so that's that's sort of the most virtuous best-case scenario and then I said of course we should say then he goes to honey he goes on his honeymoon in India as things are spiraling and the price of Bitcoin is falling and people are trying to pull their money out of the exchange and there's not enough money in the exchange and he gets essentially food poisoning he has Crohn's disease and he dies of complications from Crohn's disease in India on his honeymoon now the second theory which I think is the most are you ready I should ask are you ready for the second the second theory which i think is the most the kind of Occam's razor theory the one that makes the most sense although it's not airtight is that yes he started it as a scam he started doing once once the money started flowing in because the market took off he started basically doing all these other scams on top of it which some of which included just stealing funds from you know his clients you know he started to just like splash cash around Canada he bought twelve million dollars in real estate properties about a yacht an airplane and he was on taking foreign vacations it seems like almost every other week with his with his wife or to be wife and under this theory he basically was like a small time scammer who lucked out beyond his wildest imagination and came into a ton of money and lost total control was not able to to keep it up at the scale required of a major you know business and combination of you know frittered it away had money and no oversight had a lot of money stolen from him and then as the money and then you know we still have the same kind of ending which is as as people start to pull out money and there's not enough money to pay out angry customers he starts to panicked and he starts to do these crazy trades and loses even more and again he goes to India and he dies that's like the theory that I think most people who follow it very closely and there's a huge you know there is a very large community of of folks who have obsessively followed every aspect of it including some of the more baroque technical aspects of the case that one I think it is net at this stage I'd say is about that's sort of the seventy percent theory if you ask most people okay but what was shocking to me and that was my theory going into the reporting once I'd done sort of my original reading about the piece I assume that's what had had some version of that had happened I would have said you know 99% chance that's what happened yeah so I'm gonna let you do the third theory but we need to also then after this address like the death you know like whether that was accidentally but anyway okay so Thursday well so what was shocking to me about their reporting was that I went from say 99.9% sure that that you know the the [ __ ] up theory as I laid out was what had happened to more like 70 percent because everybody I spoke to the people with the greatest authority on you know the people who both investigated it the most and the lawyers on the case at this Bay Street law firm Miller Thompson which is representing the class of defrauded you know the creditor class all that seventy five thousand plus people who've lost money on the exchange and even talking to people of course the FBI and the RCMP and Canada wouldn't talk to me but those who have been interviewed by them and both of those you know organizations are conducting their own criminal investigation as we speak the RCMP is the Royal Canadian something police everything it amounted the Mounties yet and there is essentially the Canadian FBI although much dangerously under-resourced and and from what I've understood from this this reporting totally over its head in over its head with this case a very very weak understanding of cryptocurrency um okay but anyway you were saying people interviewed by them say what so yeah the people who have been interviewed by them also have the sense that they have great suspicions about whether cotton is really dead and so that leads us to the the mastermind theory which is that cotton is not some you know amateur [ __ ] who got in over his head but instead that this was very well plotted and that the whole thing is a cover-up basically and that he is he very carefully over the years was able to move money off of the exchange in a controlled way to account that he controlled and that it was in fact an exit scheme that was designed designed from the beginning but it was an extra team that he executed and that the final step was when things became started to get daint risky dangerous for him when basically the the public started to be become aware that quadriga was running fractionally which means you know they didn't have enough money to pay back their investors that that there were lawsuits that there was increasing scrutiny that he pulled the plug and went to india and faked his own death and is now sitting on an island somewhere you know perhaps with the new face and a new identification and all the rest perhaps with you know his own personal plane he's a as a pilot's license and a boat yes his boating license and and of course the tens or hunt or he know hundreds of millions of dollars that he's stolen and so I in the in the piece I lay out exactly how that might have happened and and it is it is plausible it's not again it's not the most likely scenario but of course for an exit scheme to work especially one on this scale it has to appear impossible to the public otherwise you would never get away with it you know that the public has to believe that he's dead and and and at this point that's that's the case most people do accept except for the people closest to it who who have as I said some great suspicions about the narrative and and and think that he could have very very well I've taken taking the money often and and that he has it and the reasons as far as I recall or not the reasons but some of the evidence that supports this theory are that there was a safe that he talked about that was bolted to the rafters in his attic which had been removed before his death and then there was another one you said that like employees remembered or I don't remember for his employees but even maybe acquaintances remembered seeing him in various like international airports carrying like $15,000 of cash and stuff like that so you were saying that there might have been times when he was like moving money offshore essentially in theory he wouldn't have had to do it that way necessarily I think the the sort of the most interesting possibility is and this is something I know the FBI is investigating because they've asked experts that I've interviewed about it was that we know he was conducting these somewhat ludicrously high-risk margin trades on on obscure forms of cryptocurrency on on other exchanges so in other words he took a bunch of money off of quadriga that should have been you know the pooled money from his people who were trading on the platform moved it into a personal account on other another exchange or several other exchanges and and made on those exchanges use the money to make these bets and and what we know is is that you know we know some of those traits and they're crazy trades basically um real longshot trades so one argument is well he was desperate and he was trying to get himself out of a hole that he that's sort of in the [ __ ] theory but another is that they were set there were such high risk trades and they were such exotic trades that they could have been designed in such a way that the person that he was trading with on the platform could have been someone who controlled an account and if someone known to him it could have been him and essentially there's this idea that he could have been laundering money through these high risk trades on another platform now it's a risky it's risky because on these platforms when you're you know trading funds you know anybody on the platform can trade with you and there's and and to depend on the platform it's usually pretty public when you're trading you know a lot of currency at one time so and yet there's a way you know from speaking with with experts and and you know currency exchange and and and and and and crypto currency exchange in particular they say it is possible that that could have happened so that that would have probably been the most likely way he would have got huge amounts of money off of quad Riga and into anonymous accounts that he controlled some other way so that's that's that's sort of the best going theory of how it happened although yes there's you know we know he had tons of cash you know I've seen photographs of his kitchen where he just has piles of cash on the you know on the kitchen table you know maybe a million dollars or so in one photograph and so he he did have a lot of cash he there's also reason to believe he had a lot of ether this is something I didn't have space to write about in the article but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that he had a ton of ether in his private that it was privately held by him so and that he didn't disclose in his will or and his other you know certainly not in any tax tax returns or anything like that so there's enough there that makes this idea plausible or possible and it can't really be tested unless you dig up the body in some ways the biggest obstacle to this theory is the fact that there is a body that was transferred from India to Canada and was buried in a cemetery outside of Halifax so yeah you could in theory dig up the body and and that's what a lot of you know of surfers want Canadian authorities to do but but to this point the RCMP has shown no inclination to do that that's interesting um yeah so we're over time but just quickly before we go dude like just you know there were a number of theories online about the circumstances surrounding his death do you think that he's actually dead and also this is two questions and one what is your sense of what's happening with law enforcement like I said I think he's probably dead I think it's you know I'm at I'm somewhere around 80% myself I would say I think in some ways the heart yeah when you the the the most difficult thing to overcome with a mastermind theory is the fact is his wife's role in it and I'm you know it's hard to imagine that if he'd had faked his death that she wouldn't have been in on it because basically you're asking her to she witnessed his last 24 hours in the hospital when he was very sick and she flew back with the body so assuming that you know and if he did faked his own death and you'd have to assume that she was in on it which then begs the question well why would he fake his death in such a way that his wife had to keep up the act and come back to Canada and keep up the act for a year many years and and that's that's sort of the trickiest part of it you can make you can make you know there are arguments for how that might have happened their theories about it but that's that's sort of the most outlandish aspect of it in terms of the investigations my sense is that the FBI investigation is is serious and thorough and that they have a lot of information that nobody else does including information from a lot of these other exchanges that cotton had moved quadriga funds to those exchanges have not as far as I was able to gather have not spoken to the RCMP or any other investigative body and so it's very possible that the FBI will come out with some kind of findings that are more substantial or change the narrative in some way but it's also very possible that they basically you know essentially uncover the same information but in greater detail and and therefore you know we don't get any farther in our understanding of the case you know and I guess at a certain point the question will be whether the FBI asks the RCMP to authorize digging up the body yeah yeah I think the part that's confusing for me is if he did unbolt the safe then that kind of lends credence to some the idea that something about this was premeditated right because if you accidentally die like you're not gonna be like oh I need to take these funds do you know what I mean so I think that's right we're yeah the whole thing with the wall not having the wallet keys to the wallet or that he was the only one who had that doesn't add up I mean it just you know he's get we have you know podcast interviews with him from you know a year before he died where he talks about how important it is to never you know to have have plans for what to do if somebody you know what to do with your keys it's sort of you know crypto 101 you know as I understand it and so that was the most outlandish part of the original version of the case to folks who knew him and in the community they thought it was inconceivable that he would not have a back-up plan not only you know for his for his his death but even if he's kidnapped or you know incapacitated in some way that and he and he did in fact tell people his friends and family that he had you know there was a kill switch that if thing had happened to him that these codes would go out to his friends and family and so that part of it is very mysterious and and sort of doesn't doesn't make sense like although to be honest you know there's a lot that doesn't make sense okay and that's what's fascinating about the theory that the case is that there's no theory of the three ones that I laid out I think there's none that totally works there there are flaws in each of them and and you know inconsistencies and so it allows one to entertain every possibility basically okay well I'm sure my listeners will keep noodling on this that we are well over time but this was just so fascinating I I'm so glad that you came on the show thank you so much for coming uh none confirmed thanks thanks for having me on don't

just a few taps before you start receiving interest every week join the over 1 million others in download the crypto comm app today hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap the biggest news this week was that atheria researcher Virgil Griffith was arrested at LAX on Thanksgiving for assisting North Korea in evading sanctions afterward many crypto people made comments on Twitter like that what Virgil did could help North Koreans break their dependence on the state or saying that it goes too far to say diplomacy with the North Korean government could never help the North Korean people or that what he did could bring out peace between the two Koreas and other and other comments that indicated that people in the crypto community don't seem to know much about North Korea this created a lot of cognitive dissonance for those of us who do have a fair amount of knowledge about North Korea this was not that long after we saw everybody up in arms about censorship by Americans to appease the Chinese government so to see this people were now saying wait a minute let's not pass judgment on the guy who helped the most sensorial dictatorship on the planet which doesn't even let its country on the internet at all and doesn't let it citizens leave doesn't let its citizens travel within the country without approval and the country that will also lock you your family in two generations after you in a prison camp if you do something it perceives to be against it that was just like we so if you're fighting for censorship resistance why are you justifying the behavior of somebody who was helping the number one biggest censor in the world and it was also especially jarring to see this from the unicorns and rainbows crowd so I ended up tweeting what I believe may be my first tweet storm ever which states some facts about North Korea just to make it clear what words like peace and public mean in the North Korean context so for instance public in our countries sounds innocuous because it indicates everything's on the open what is there to hide but North Korea public means it's approved by the dictatorship meaning it's something that does not at the very least does not hurt Kim jong-un's ability to continue oppressing the 25 million people under his rule so using the word public as it pertains to North Korea actually doesn't have the same innocuous connotation or the concept of peace between North Korea and the South or between North Korea and the US again that sounds so nice but in the North Korean context it just has a super twisted meaning because that implies that the Kim regime survives which then again means that it continues oppressing 25 million people living there which it doesn't sound like peace to me it's like being like oh well let that guy you know the keep all the hostages like and and we'll call it peace so I was surprised by the reaction to my twee storm because I still wasn't sure if people didn't actually know these things because I was not saying anything even remotely knew but actually somebody tweeted back and they asked me what the everyday Koreans North Koreans accesses to the Internet and I realized whoa okay so that is so basic to me it didn't even occur to me to tweet it like when I said that they cannot know information about the outside world without you know exposing the Kim regimes lies and getting them in trouble that meant of course that every day North Korean people are prohibited from accessing the Internet I'm not even sure how many of them will even know what the internet is so yes while in theory getting cryptocurrency to people in oppressive regimes could very well be helpful in the case of North Korea how do you even do that if they don't have a way to connect to the internet and if they you know in attempting to do so can risk their lives so I think some people took my tweet storm as stating some opinion on Virgil like I saw some stories saying that I was criticizing him but actually the tweets from really didn't have that much to do with Virgil I was just trying to explain that we took two people who you know when they were seeing these things that that wasn't exactly what they meant like I wanted them to know those words don't have the same meanings that you think they do when you use them apply to North Korea like this is what it means on the ground when you say those things what I did say about Virgil is that I have no idea what was in his head but given the facts about the whole thing my best guesses are that either he did not know how things work in North Korea or that if he did he doesn't really care so Lee Quinn of coined US had the best story just kind of summarizing the whole thing at reuters reported that Virgil had thought it would be cool if North Korea mind ether and just to show you you know North Korea definitely has an interest in cryptocurrency bleeping computer had a story about a fake crypto currency trading site that was written with malware that is believed to be created by a North Korean hacking group so now moving on from the sensor who won't let his people on the Internet at all to the censor that won't let its people unto certain websites on the Internet a second headline Chinese internet firewall blocks ether scan wolfie zhao of coin desk who was a recent guest on unconfirmed reported that the chinese firewall has blocked assyrian block explorer ether scans since at least october 30th he writes quote this is likely the first known case of a blockchain Explorer becoming an Internet file war
