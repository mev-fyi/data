finance and a new data economy start building your next idea on the oasis network today's guest is sam bankman-freed founder and ceo of ftx welcome sam thanks for having me fdx had some interesting news this week well actually it's not so different from other weeks tom brady and giselle bunchen became part owners of ftx how did that happen yeah and we've been talking to them for a little while about working together and um you know we've obviously been spending a lot of time over the last six months trying to find you know ways to get our name out there more and so that was sort of you know one of the big pieces of context um here just given that you know we we were pretty proud of our product but as as you know one of the latest entrants to the game on the exchange side um we're definitely lagging in terms of a you know raw user base number but you know i think the other thing is that they're just excited to work with us and we're excited to work with them and that just goes a really long way i mean i know that you know gisele is really excited on the the charity side uh just you know work with the foundation on giving and i think you know tom's been excited about crypto for a while and so it was uh it's just a really good fit and so tom also tweeted his excitement about the partnership with the video of himself throwing a bitcoin logo that hits and shatters the moon did ftx come up with that with him and if so how does your team come up with that idea i think that was him and his team honestly coming up with that um at least i was not involved in coming up with that and did not know it was gonna happen until it did so oh interesting okay well that's clearly a sign of his enthusiasm yeah an ftx also recently inked a sponsorship deal with major league baseball to have ftx patches on all umpire uniforms starting next month and another one with tsm which is a professional esports team and they even rename themselves tsm ftx and of course everyone knows you also um became a sponsor of the miami heats arena so in general how does ftx think about sponsorships and about getting the word out about crypto yeah so you know there's a ton of things you can do obviously and many of them are somewhat interchangeable you know many of uh uh you know sort of the blander ones are not that different than just running facebook ads and that's not to say anything against facebook ads you know we haven't really done them but maybe maybe maybe they're right maybe we'll start um but but what they don't do is they don't uh you know do that much for your image or your brand and you know they're sort of dilutive if anything and and so i think you know when we think about these there are a few things that we're thinking about but the biggest things are what are the people the organizations that really a lot of people pay attention to that a lot of people listen to and what are the ways to partner with them that people will see and and then the second piece of this is what's a way to do it that feels sort of exciting and authentic and and new and fresh rather than rather than just dilutive and you know i sort of go back to just so many of the advertisements that you see on tv so many of the brand endorsements you see where do you watch them and i sort of feel like i don't think that person's family was convinced to use that product you know like like you sort of you see this endorsement like i literally think that like their kids and their mom have no interest in the product after having seen you know they're like the closest person in the world to them just you know film endorsement for it and i think that's the biggest thing we're trying to avoid is you know is just the sense of like completely commercial completely bland and completely replaceable you know fluff which you know i i think like it's not who we are it and and i think it just doesn't do that much and so the biggest things that we're thinking is what's something here that's going to seem cool and authentic and exciting and so ftx has two presences one in asia and one in the us but a lot of these sponsorships sponsorships that you're doing do target a u.s audience so why is that yeah i mean i i think there are a few pieces to it and certainly like i mean look one thing you could say is i i grew up in america like maybe that's just what i have the ear for right and and i do think that there's some truth there in that like you know it's taken me a lot longer to figure out what would even be meaningful things in other countries because i didn't have you know 26 years steeped in in their cultures you know to to be able to tell and it's so easy to mess these up and it's so easy to think you got a great deal and then it's a dud and you can never figure out why and i think we see this and you know i'm kind of honestly one thing we see this with is you know there are these like you know us sports team sleeve patches that are that are going around right now about two-thirds the price of an arena naming right and they're just like like no one cares about them it's just like super consistently like no one can name a single one of them they don't stand out at all and and what instead of just sort of looks like is i money grabs probably being a little bit too strong here but this sort of sense of a team being like man how many times can we sell something like what if we take every inch of like square space and separately try and market that as like you know our whole you know brand that we're sharing with you type thing and you know i think when it comes to things that i have in here for i can kind of tell quickly no one cares about that versus like okay no that's that's something that that really is meaningful whereas in other countries i just don't know as much but we do have people on staff who do and so i think that's not the full answer and i think a big piece of this is frankly the us is where our name recognition is probably lagging the most and a lot of this is because ftx us didn't open up until a year ago you know which point you know ftx.com was already you know like 10th or 15th biggest venue globally and so um so i think it's just like you know it's only been around half as long and as we have even more ground to make up in the states than we do globally and why the emphasis on sports in particular it's a good question and you know we are looking at some other things as well i think that there's a heavily overlapping user base and dynamic which is one piece of this um i think they're just you know among the most recognizable recognizable people and recognizable organizations you know you don't have the equivalent of like you know what's the name of sort of like you know the premier clubs the you know things like that in other industries that's not to say there's nothing to do there but i think that it's it's quite a bit more finicky and and difficult to figure out what it would even mean and again not to say we shouldn't be doing it even and it is something we're kicking around i i think that that a number of these things fit really cleanly in the sports paradigm and you know if you thought about a musician for instance like what would be the equivalent of like an arena naming rights like there sort of isn't unless i mean you know some something tells me that uh you know we're not gonna see uh you know beyonce renaming uh you know her act to ftx beyonce or any and i would not do that if i were like that would be a big mistake on her part that's you know so well it would i mean i was thinking maybe just madison square garden or the barclays center or something like that but um totally great there there are so most venues don't come up most years most of these deals are like 20-year deals and so each year you know there's maybe five or ten that are opening up we actually got a little bit lucky there were way more openings when when we ended up getting you know the miami um uh you know heat arena than in most years or at least more effective openings because of covid i mean it was you know formerly american airlines arena and i don't i don't know why american air runs didn't didn't renew like i don't have any privileged information there but if i had to guess it's an airline company covered like it sort of you know they had three stadiums i think they've now cut down to two doesn't seem like a shocking decision yeah yeah and you mentioned about giselle being head of environmental and social initiatives and obviously you yourself are very active politically being one of the biggest donors to joe biden's campaign and um i just feel like crypto is kind of at this interesting crossroads right now where it's kind of intersecting more with mainstream movements and you know such as like the environmental movement in the nft space in particular or um you know it's also doing things like gaining adoption in places like el salvador which some people in parts of the crypto community feel like you know kind of is uh i guess opposite some of the values of crypto but i just wondered like how do you think ftx can push these values oriented goals amongst these different groups that sometimes are at odds with each other totally and you know i think that's a good point and the biggest thing i'd say is we don't want to push this on people you know we don't want to prescribe for people what they do i think the way we think about this is we can set an example and you know it it's up to other people what they do there are things that i'm super passionate about um you know things to sell is and and things that frankly a lot of our team care about a lot and you know we're really honored when when you know whenever we see people in the community sort of joining in on it and i think that's sort of one of the most impactful parts of of doing this from our perspective is being able to you know to reach out to the community but uh but on the other hand you know if it's not for you that that's totally fine and so i think that you know one thing that that we're doing is we're going green so we're we're going to be buying offsets for all of the you know carbon produced by deposit you know crypto deposits and withdrawals um through ftx and i think we're probably gonna do more than that as well and you know look at what we can do to try to uh fund some sort of more cutting-edge research in uh or you know development in into ways to mitigate climate change but you know i think that's something which hopefully giselle you know has thoughts on her is excited about you know i know that she has expressed a lot i i think it's something that internally a number of us do a number of people in the industry do and you know really exciting to the extent this helps other people think about how they can help the world but you know if this is if you don't care about this that that's you know totally up to you all right so in a moment we're going to discuss some of the other recent news involving ftx but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible designed for the next generation of blockchain the oasis network is the first privacy-enabled blockchain platform for open finance and a responsible data economy combined with its high throughput and secure architecture the oasis network is able to power private scalable d5 revolutionizing open finance and expanding it beyond traders and early adopters to a mass market its unique privacy features can not only redefine defy but also create a new type

spotify and amazon prime subscriptions download the crypt.com app now and get 25 dollars by using the code laura the link is in the description back to my conversation with sam thankfunfreed so fdx also just enabled tokenized stock trading what's your goal with that offering like who do you think you can attract as a user that you're not attracting now totally there's a few different pieces to it so one of it is you just look at these existing users and giving them you know it's sort of you know anytime that they have to tab out to another app in order to trade another asset class we sort of feel like bam like you know is that app doing a better job than we are and if so what can we do there i think that's one piece of it another piece of it is just looking at there you know are tons and tons of people who have interest in trading crypto and also of interest in trading stocks i think like one of the most poignant moments for me in this and i i apologize that i said this before to you but it just really sticks with me is um you know the sort of the moment that um that a bunch of brokers including robin hood restricted buying at gamestop like literally that hour hundreds of millions of dollars flowed into dogecoin and answers just a really strong signal of like it's the same people like these same people who are buying gamestop or buying dogecoin and i think frankly the same people who are buying tesla and facebook are probably buying bitcoin in ethereum and and so i think that like we're seeing and you sort of like hinted at this before like we're seeing more and more convergence between you know as crypto gets closer and closer to mainstream mainstream is getting closer and closer to crypto you know because of this there are just a lot of people who want to trade both stocks and crypto who want to invest in both and we want to provide a platform where they can do that and so i think that sort of one piece of it is just the generic like why not both philosophy but i think there's a few other things one thing is you know ftx is now basically the only venue in the world that offers real liquid 24 7 equities trading traditionally equities exchanges are only open like 35 hours a week which made a lot of sense when you had to be physically in a pit with everyone else physically there at the same time to do a trade now it's all online it's all global there's no need to have that restriction but basically no other exchanges have lifted it um we saw an opening to be you know one of the few venues open in the middle of the night us time so that's sort of another opportunity that that we saw there um we can cross margin it with everything else on the platform internationally and so that's sort of another really cool thing which again there's no reason other people haven't done it other than that's a little bit complex if you haven't built out this system but you can use your apple stock as collateral to buy bitcoin or you can use your ethereum as collateral to uh you know to short facebook and you know what this allows is one integrated seamless trading experience where you can do whatever trades you want as long as you have enough total collateral to support it so that's sort of the background on offering equities in general and you know i think at this point is basically public domain that you know we we are in the process of activating a broker-dealer license in the united states as well and so so far this has been you know offshore but uh but that you know might not be true for long the other thing though and the thing that we just did is i mean i say we did it but you know we didn't do the heavy lifting here you know uh dag and cme worked with uh boffin in germany to create basically regulatory regime for actually tokenizing truly tokenizing these equities and what that means is that for the first time there will be you know fully backed stock tokens um that you can transfer on the blockchain that you can move to your private wallet if you want um that you can have control over and that are redeemable for the underlying equity um and they'll be trading on ftx and you'll they'll be creatable and redeemable as always but you know uh there's also now the the green light to make these movable and i think that is really exciting because it is basically for the first time really actually bridging the gap between equities and blockchain this is all very fascinating and i think some of the description that you gave there of the tokenized stock offering is meant to differentiate ftx is offering from the one by binance is that correct like because binance i believe they follow the market hours et cetera et cetera yeah there is there's this much more like sort of you know the traditional robin hood type experience yeah so you know ftx and finance are similar in a few different ways you know with having a us venue and uh one based in asia and obviously we're seeing now binance's approach of playing it a little bit on the looser side with regulation is starting to see blowback and they're even kind of being booted from some companies countries so how does ftx avoid the same fate yeah totally and you know obviously i can't speak to you what's happening you know with them and i will say they've done absolutely phenomenally over the last year as a company i mean they're you know they're the only exchange that's been growing at the same rate that ftx has over the last couple years um but it's super impressive because you know they started from a high point and then kept growing and growing rapidly so i you know included them for for that growth i think when it comes to the regulatory side obviously you know there's been some differences in our approach have been you know certainly happy to have been doing things the way we are um i i think the biggest thing that i would say here is it's easy to run a business that will never run afoul of regulators if you just don't do anything right that's that's sort of trivial but it was like worth noting right if your business literally is just a company with no business and no no activities you're not breaking any laws and the reason i say this is this is how i think a lot of people think about crypto regulation they just have a single dimension of do more versus do less if you do more it's more illegal if you do less it's more legal and i totally get why you would have that prior and to be clear if you're just like acting without any regards for the law then that is correct like if you're just taking random actions without thinking about the legal consequences then yeah the more you do probably the more laws you're breaking but the key thing which i think and again uh this sounds sort of silly and obvious to point out but i really do think is the thing people miss is that you don't have to act randomly right and and in particular regulators goals aren't to kill industry um and this is really really deeply true in in most jurisdictions that you talk to them and this isn't just a line they'll say they have a mandate from up high like the actual country cares about fostering industry like you know regulars aren't trying to just like create a perfect bliss of no activity because other countries implodes they're trying to work with businesses if they can and so i think the right way to think about regulators and obviously look it is different in each case but the right general prior here isn't that they're trying to you over the right prior is they're trying to find a way to let businesses grow while also having whichever protections they think are important for for users and for the country you know whether you're talking about anti-money laundering whether you're talking about you know uh sort of retail customer protection or anything else and what this means is that like i do think that there are ways to have an ambitious business that does a ton and and maybe does even more than others while also being extremely compliant and you know the big thing there is basically like just thinking hard about what is it that regulators do or or don't want looking at the legislation that's on the book but looking beyond that looking at the comments made by them looking at the history of actions talking to them getting a sense of what they consider to be a good actor you know what they you know especially when you're looking at gray area industries or industries where regulations just haven't been written yet right you can't just say ah there's statue 17 this is the answer right it's more nuanced in that it's understanding like do the regulators in this jurisdiction see their existing you know commodities uh you know regulations as extending to cryptocurrencies or do they see crypto as a new asset class pending a new set of legislation like that sort of a classic question which you know when the commodities legislation was written crypto didn't exist so they're not going to say whether or not you know ripple falls under that category or um and so you know really trying to work with regulators and and you know our general philosophy is we want to be able to build the products that our users want um but we want to do that in a in a compliant way and sometimes that means applying for licenses and so anywhere that we can get licensed we will and you know we we have a bunch of licensing we're applying for a bunch more and we're reaching out to a bunch of countries that don't have licensing regimes yet saying hey you know we'd love to be a guinea pig here we'd love to work with you on building out a regime for you know whatever it is for crypto derivatives and um so applying for licenses when we can get them so we can do it in you know the most straightforward manner from a regulatory perspective and when there is no relevant license for a business you know understanding is this something that the regulators are comfortable with you know usually we guess you know usually we read that right no one always gets it right you know everyone will sometimes misjudge that and then being extremely responsive to regulators when they reach out and say hey we actually are not comfortable with what you're doing here you know saying like oh sorry about that you know did didn't realize that you know super appreciate that super happy to shut this off um and but we also want to talk with you about is there a path forward to doing this is there a license that we should be applying for should we be talking to you about about what that might mean in the future and um and you know rather than seeing licensing and regulation as just an attempt to kill the industry see it as like an attempt to have an industry that is is pro-social and and you know good faith and you know working with that as best we can and do you have anything that you would kind of name is like at the top of your regulatory wish list right now totally absolutely biggest thing by far always for us is clarity on derivatives this is the you know no competition for us in terms of what's the most important you know when it comes to aml kyc which is probably the most important part of regulation when it comes to financial services there is more or less clarity like you know there's lots of there's lots and lots of of of case law on what duties financial businesses have to um you know to to know their customer and prevent money laundering now there are some open questions there which i do think matter one of which the world is going to have to grapple with is to what extent does it is it a meaningful statement to try and think about whether an autonomous smart contract has a duty to know its customer like what does that even mean so okay there are some open questions there but by and large it's like yeah we have an aml kyc policy you have to when it comes to securities regulations in most countries it's not a big problem for crypto the united states is definitely on the more strict end there and we would definitely appreciate more clarity from the sec you know i think we're not alone in that in thinking that like there's a whole swath of tokens where it's just like no one knows whether they're going to be considered unregistered securities or commodities or utility tokens or some new designation you know there's um and so i do think that matters but the truth of the matter is you know three quarters of volume globally goes up in tokens that the sec has signaled are not securities right like between bitcoin ethereum um and then you know sort of most of the older tokens you you can add up to a lot of volume pretty safely and so so on that side we would appreciate more clarity but it's not the most important thing the most important thing for us by far is almost no jurisdictions in the world have come out with ra with comprehensive frameworks for derivatives uh for crypto derivatives and you know i think they're sort of aware of this this is sort of like on the 10-year road map for each of them um but the the problem is that like two-thirds of volume trades and derivatives encrypted like this is the majority of the space is happening in in futures and um and and so i think that's just by far the biggest thing that we would love regulatory clarity on all right yeah and actually earlier when you were saying um for some of the other coins where you're not sure if it's a security or commodity i was thinking that probably applies to ftt am i right about that you know i think in in many many jurisdictions we've gotten clarity that it you know that it is a utility token um but not in all of them and i think that is absolutely an example where you know obviously we haven't listed that on on ftx us and you know that's an intentional decision and i think that is certainly something where you know we would love sec clarity and i think there's a whole host of tokens where you know frankly these are things that don't have direct analogs where they're not you know they're not they don't quite necessarily obviously fit into like like it's not like like a an edible commodity or like a precious gem it's not like you know a voting equity it's not like like is is it the currency i don't i don't i don't know i mean right and you're sort of like like really the answer is what is a cryptocurrency i mean it's it's a new type of thing and um you know it's a sort of utility token space and crypto is one where you know i think long run we're not going to see them classified as existing objects long run we're going to see new regulations coming out that define them as a new asset class and come out with some set of of of rules around them uh but that hasn't happened yet yeah yeah and i mean in the us we're really gonna have to see because i just feel like i'm seeing kind of a huge range from some of the different lawmakers so we'll see what happens right i mean you listen to the hearing today and there's just yeah a really wide range of opinions yeah yeah um almost disturbingly wide but i mean let me and when i say that i mean for all the education that i think the industry has done like there's some views that um maybe seem a little bit less informed but some of them were certainly out there um but i think a lot of them were also yeah i know it's reasonable you could also reasonably think something very different you know it's and you know whatever the regime is it is and the biggest thing is like preventing scenarios where there's no where there's no reasonable path forward that that's the thing that's most frustrating you know if you tell us like you know just go for it but don't be a dick and don't do anything scammy don't do anything that takes advantage of users i don't do anything that like helps money laundering don't do anything you obviously think you shouldn't do and we'll give feedback as it goes along we can work with that you know and if instead you say look you can't do anything until you have a license and here's the license here's the application process super happy to work with that the most frustrating thing is you need a license but also we haven't come up with one yet right yeah yeah right now it's a little bit slow moving here in the us but yeah all right well i had you know a ton of other things i also want to ask you about but maybe we'll just have you on for the longer show sometime soon because i truly think there's so much that your various firms are doing in the space and and frankly yeah for any given one of them we could spend an hour discussing some of the topics there's so much going on yeah always happy to come on okay all right well thank you so much for coming on the show this week it's been such a
