guest is Philip dumane co-founder of drag welcome Phillip hello thanks for having me on channelis is reported in its 2022 crypto crime report that Not only was last year the biggest year ever for crypto crime at a total of 3.8 billion dollars stolen but that funds stolen from D5 protocols accounted for 82 percent of that total and that uh equates to 3.1 billion dollars stolen from defy so you and ethereum developers Dia here and mayor Bank have put forth a proposal to address this problem and it's called ERC or ethereum request for comment 7265 what's your proposal yeah so our proposal it's more of a design that people can implement but the proposal is basically creating a safety a generalized safety layer that developers can add onto their contracts that will allow the funds within the protocol to be protected even if the core logic of the protocol is vulnerable and could be exploited on its own and so the way that you define this like colloquially is as a circuit breaker uh what does that mean yeah so a circuit breaker is a relatively common mechanism that you have in traditional Finance on for example exchanges it's basically like an emergency tripwire that allows you to pause the system uh in cases of emergencies or irregularities I forget which exchange was exactly I think was the NASDAQ but essentially if a certain uh asset I think it's the I forget which one it was exactly but if it uh Falls by too many points within one day uh they'll halt it for a few hours and then if it falls even further they'll hold it by more hours because in the past you had basically like these sell-off Cascades where people would just like start to panic and just sell off assets and then these circuit breakers were intended to allow people to just like cool off and basically like relax a little bit reassess the situation with a clear head and then resume the markets when people were in a clear state of mind and so how are you proposing that this ERC 7265 would work uh so it's very similar so uh basically what it does is it adds this layer around your protocol through which all funds flow and what this allows you to do is that before any assets leave the protocol it gives you some time to basically evaluate evaluate that withdrawal essentially from the protocol and basically do some added analysis on it whether it's malicious or not so this can be done on chain or off chain but basically it gives you time to intervene in case you realize that the code allowed somebody to maliciously withdraw some amount so I I saw the proposal that it would limit the withdrawals by these time periods like you mentioned as was done on the traditional Exchange so if that were to happen then who would get notified in the event of this like large withdrawal that trips the circuit breaker yeah so it would be the team in charge of essentially controlling and monitoring the protocol so this would likely be the devs and the core team of the protocol or if it's a protocol that's like more decentralized and has like governance they probably have like some small Security Council that is in charge of like stepping in and assessing the situation seeing if it's a false positive so like uh accidental tripping of this like tripwire or whether it was like a actual attempted Hack That was detected by the system and then react accordingly so would the standard then have a tendency to centralize the operations of the D5 protocol uh yeah exactly it would basically require the protocol to have some Central owner or set of owners that have the ability to make that call of okay is this is this just an accidental like tripping of the circle breaker or is this like real malicious activity and then you do have like this Central actor that has to have the responsibility for the circle breaker to be feasible at least in the initial version there are versions down the line where this mechanism can be more decentralized and trustless but that is not what we have yet at the current stage so I mean most people when they're proposing things for ethereum they're not proposing things that would make protocols more centralized so why is it that you're willing to to do that with this proposal um I'm a big fan of decentralization and I would actually um specify on the point that it doesn't make protocols more centralized like centralized protocols I have the same model centralization so basically it allows early stage projects that are usually centralized anyway and in fact if you look at D5 majority of protocols have some sort of centralized control somewhere whether it's delegated to governance or whether it's the team multi-sig a lot of projects have these capabilities ready but we're basically extending the positive things that can be done with these capabilities because already today these capabilities can be used to for example upgrade a contract or in the worst case rug the contract or what we're adding on top of this is the ability to effectively intervene in a hack in real time so I also wondered about this issue of this small team deciding whether a withdrawal is legitimate or a hack I mean what's to stop them from realizing oh this entity wants to withdraw because there's a fundamental flaw in the protocol and we don't want them to withdraw because we don't want to set off panic and have other people realize there's a flaw here what if it's something like that and it's keeping somebody who has recognized a legitimate problem from keeping their funds safe so directly there's not much you can do to prevent this but this is already possible today with these centralized protocols so if you look at for example what happened with the waves blockchain and their lending markets I forget what it was called but basically what the team did Via governance is they essentially seize funds or forcing people to deposit more collateral into the protocol by essentially threatening to to seize their assets if they didn't comply and malicious teams do this already again what the circle breaker does is it doesn't change fundamentally the capabilities that these teams have is it adds their countermeasure capabilities but one way they can mitigate this in the long term is to have essentially custodians that handle this so instead of teams handling this you have like some some set groups that are basically experts in doing arbitration or these kind of checks and then the team delegates that control to these more trusted parties rather than themselves and the idea here is not necessarily to to completely solve uh the centralization issue but it's more to move things in a better Direction and basically minimize damage and what about the time limits is that something that is determined by um whoever implements the standard or is it also because I just wonder you know is 90 minutes really enough for figuring out whether or not something is um you know like a legitimate withdrawal versus or legitimate withdrawal versus something more nefarious yeah so the circuit breaker basically gives the team uh time to decide so a hacks are usually quite complex technically and they use a bunch of different transactions to try and manipulate the protocol into uh extracting funds so it's hard to make the determination in an automatic sense so the circle breaker acts as more like an initial flare or signal telling the team like there's some irregularity here that might point to a hack and then it gives them the time to essentially evaluate that situation before anything results in irreversible damage because what happens today is if there's a hack the only notification name I get is once the funds already left the protocol the circuit breaker basically gives the team time to evaluate the situation and intervene before damage is a reversible so I also wondered how the circuit breaker works in the context of crypto where prices can be extremely volatile I don't know if this applies only for withdrawals um but you know I'm sure you're aware and you kind of mentioned this in when you talked about the NASDAQ example that prices can fall dramatically for purely legitimate reasons and so does this apply in that situation or not yeah so teams will have the discretion to configure their Circle breaker as they want so if they want to also pause the protocol or delay it or when there's extreme price action they may choose to do that but the design of the circuit breaker such that users can still close their position and trade within the protocol even while there's a halt essentially but the main thing the circuit breaker does is it delays any outgoing effects so anytime assets might leave the protocol and so to say irreversibly like cause damage to the protocol which is like when the funds are outside of the jurisdiction of the protocol uh that's basically what the circuit breaker mitigates and allows teams to evaluate like that part so if you have like an exchange with then the protocol or a lending Market you can still close and open positions you can still trade but just like exiting from the protocol is what might be temporarily halted okay so you're saying basically if this had been implemented at the time of the mango markets exploit then essentially at the time he manipulated the price or allegedly manipulated the price um that it wouldn't have been tripped then it only would have been tripped when he with went to withdraw is that how it works exactly yeah so I would have tripped the circuit breaker when he tried to withdraw like the large amount of assets from The Lending protocol okay but I thought you said they want so potentially because of ethic attacks potentially teams could if they wanted also implement it to prevent price manipulation yeah so they could also configure it so that if there's like a sudden large change in the Oracle price that they also alerts them and temporarily holds the protocol for them to evaluate whether it was like a real price swing or just like a manipulated price stick okay yeah this gets into Super tricky territory in my opinion but um so in a moment we'll talk about more of those edge cases but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible ondo Finance is connecting the on-chain economy to real world assets with compliant institutional grade tokenized securities ondo's Flagship

app at railway.xyz to find out more back to my conversation with Philip so another thing that I wondered is is this limited to just a single entity withdrawing funds because you know attackers could game this where it's multiple you know a civil attack basically where they withdraw from multiple entities um and they sort of sneak in under that limit and like nobody really notices is that something that you guys have accounted for yeah so there's different like countermeasures or ways attackers will adjust their attack when they notice a protocol is protected by Circuit Breaker so first the circuit breaker is such that it's a general it's a general encompassing layer of the protocol so even if the attacker splits their withdrawals into different smaller pieces they'll also have to go through the layers so if the protocol has a rate limiter like connected with a circuit breaker then just the aggregated volume of those smaller withdrawals will still Trip the circuit breaker now the other attack is smart attacker could do is if they find some sort of exploit that allows them to do that is slowly like trickle out funds so just like maybe steal you know a thousand two thousand a day maybe a bit more of like the volume of the protocol is really high and over time just drain the protocol like that but even in that case that's already better than the alternative because um you're mitigating the damage and because they can only withdraw that much per day right so it gives you time to actually find the exploit and just monitoring the protocols for other ways or maybe even through your bug Bounty program you'll eventually uh catch that bug and the fact that the circle breaker was there mitigated the damage in the sense that it forced the attacker to withdraw funds more slowly and over time and then what about a scenario where people have lost faith in the protocol for some reason and I I don't I like I don't have in mind anything from D5 but you know obviously the FTX example is a pretty recent one where users want to withdraw um in large numbers at a very specific point in time and they had a legitimate reason to do so you know what if this were used in a way where the people kind of holding the keys to the drawbridge were like nope we're not letting you out even though they would have had a reason that anybody else would view US legitimate to withdraw yeah so that goes I think it goes back again to the point at the beginning like can it be used maliciously and it definitely can so if the team decides to abuse their power for any reason whether it's they just want to go away with the funds or they don't like where people are moving their money uh they can't abuse that power and the only way to mitigate that really is again to have like these third-party arbitrators or like these services that uh basically intervene in that or have like a more extensive governance process but this is not a problem that is unique to circuit breakers any project that has uh centralized keys can have this at any time and a surprising amount of protocols like if you go on etherscan anybody you can check this for yourself as an indication of whether your protocol centralizes you go to the address that holds the assets for the D5 protocol and just check is etherscan telling you that this is a proxy and if this is a proxy this usually means that there's somebody behind the contract that can upgrade it and change it to whatever logic they want which includes moving the funds to their own wallet and this is present in a lot of protocols so what the circuit breaker does here is that it doesn't add to what they can do maliciously but it does add to what good teams can do to save their own protocols and I wondered also um because it just felt like there could their scenario similar to what happened with the Dow in 2016 where this hacker got access to 31 of the funds and during that time granted obviously was a very different time so people who wanted to rescue the money Affairs that was in the Dow had very limited tools to do so but you know you could see a scenario where if the same event were to happen today on a modern day D5 protocol that the hacker could kind of secretly get the 31 of funds and then everyone else that wanted to withdraw suddenly would be stopped so I don't know if you have kind of like a way to mitigate that kind of situation I'm not sure if we'll understand the question is it uh can we mitigate the governance attack where the um attack requires a large percentage of like voting tokens or is it stopping uh the scenario where an attacker withdraws before everyone else and then everyone else is like basically bottlenecked by the circle breaker yeah the the latter yeah so that really depends on how the circle breaker is configured against so there's two main versions there's one which is delayed settlement by default where all transactions go through a like review delay before they they exit the protocol by by default so let's say like a one two hour delay so you would draw from Ave let's say imagine Ave has the circle breaker and then you would get your funds would actually land in your wallet after two hours so in that scenario that would uh block the attacker because you would see the spike of funds from the attacker and it would be in the queue same as everyone else and then that would give you time to actually see that and block that but in the other scenario where you have a rate limiter on chain where you then it depends on the configuration so the protocol will have to say Okay is the maximum drawdown five percent ten percent twenty percent of CDL within a certain window and then if an attacker finds a vulnerability then the damage will only be limited to the maximum drawdown because there will obviously a smart attacker will wait okay when is the volume low and then I'll just max out the the limit and then that will be my profit from the attack and then all the other funds I could have stolen or will be in there again so again I want to I want to reiterate like with any security measure in a smart contract it's not bulletproof it won't stop all the attacks it won't stop all damage but I think it will be a very useful tool for uh early projects or in general like projects that are still at centralized stage to really massively reduce risk and mitigate a damage in attacks but it won't stop everything of course your proposal itself actually contains two scenarios that would still allow for funds to be stolen one of them you called unsafe arbitrary calls the other untracked or unprotected flows so can you just describe what those are yeah so these are mistakes uh that can be done at the implementation level so the idea the fundamental philosophy of the circle breaker is how do we protect the protocol even if the core logic has mistakes um but a Dev adding a circle breaker can still make mistakes at the um basically at the integration point between their protocol and the circuit breaker so for example if they have assets coming in and out of the protocol but they forget to add the line that actually tracks uh the ins and outflows because the rate limiter has to know what money is coming in and out to be able to like block any malicious funds going out but if they forget to actually track that then obviously funds can go out without being tracked by the rate limiter and it to see blocked and then the second type is a unique but very dangerous vulnerability when it does occur where you have in your code somewhere the ability for you to basically execute anything on behalf of the protocol or on behalf of the smart contract so those are the two ways that your protocol can still get hacked despite having a circle breaker but the interesting thing about the circle breaker is that these are like very limited and these are very easy to review for so unlike an audit where you need to do an in-depth review of the entire protocol understand all the logic and make sure there's basically no Corner case no loophole that allows the attacker to leave with funds it's basically becomes this checklist where you can see okay all the places where assets are going in and out do they have this one line of code and then arbitrary calls are they properly protected they're rare in general but when they do occur then you can review them specifically and it just it just reduces again the attack surface uh and places where things can go wrong but still things can go wrong and you've said that you intend to make this for D5 protocols that are upgradable by governance to not contribute to centralization to describe what you mean by that I mean by that similar to before I'm a big fan of completely decentralized protocols like uh uniswap V2 that have very limited governance interference and is like completely autonomous and I do want the D5 space to eventually strive to build more Primitives that are like that but I also see the reality that unfortunately is often not like that so I really believe that the circle breaker can help these newer teams to improve their security and also give them the leeway and flexibility to eventually transition into being a fully decentralized protocol and essentially moving the circuit breaker shell because the way the circle breaker is also designed is that a protocol can eventually migrate away from it so once they're ready like let's say it's a new protocol it's a startup and they maybe don't have that much money to do like the extent of audits and security processes that like these large D5 protocols have so instead they deploy a more cost effective solution like a circuit breaker for the first two years and then once their protocol has traction they can actually invest heavily into their security and then do this like one-time review have a bug Bounty program out for like half a year one year and then when they're really confident that this protocol is independently secure then they can like strip the centralizing shell of upgradability of governance of the circuit breaker and then become like a fully fully independent primitive on chain you're working on a startup called d-reg which is related to this proposal what does direct do so uh d-rig basically right now we're mainly contributing to the circle breaker and making sure that the standard is good it's not too opinionated it can be used by a lot of people but our goal is to create infrastructure that supports protocols that are integrating Circle Breakers because uh beyond the circuit breaker itself you do want some monitoring infrastructure some alerting infrastructure that notifies you as a team when something goes wrong in on chain so that you can review it and then on top of that we do do want to mitigate the the issue or more like the the downside of the circuit breaker which is like the delay right so as mentioned before the way the protocol uh or the circuit breaker secures protocols is through this delay so you would draw funds and then you only get them after two hours and what we want to provide is a service that says actually instead we'll pay out users in advance so it looks like a normal protocol where they get their funds immediately but on the back end it's actually us assuming the risk so basically what we would do is we would in real time before it goes on chain we would look at the transaction estimated for ourselves okay does this look like a hack or not and if it's not a hack we say okay we'll pay out this user in advance for like a tiny fee and then in return they get their funds immediately and the protocol still has that safety because if we're wrong for example our algorithm makes a mistake and it turns out it was a hack then then the team will say well no you uh you talk you assume risk for the attack and it turned out to be a hack so that's your loss essentially so that's how we would enable protocols to both have that security but still have the same atomic like user experience of I make a transaction and then within that one transaction I get my funds out and as you mentioned earlier this is a proposal and also it's something that's up to each protocol whether or not they want to adopt so does that mean that it doesn't need to go through the official ethereum Improvement uh proposal process to be adopted yeah so uh it's an so in ethereum there's like eips and erc's so they both are on the EIP uh page but erc's are different in the sense that they're application Level standards so they're completely opt-in they're essentially if a developer wants to build an application they usually look at these standards so that uh their application maybe follows just like in general uh better practices uh that it's interoperable with more protocols you know for example the a very popular erc20 standard just ensures that your fungible token is compatible with all the dexes and Landing protocols and ERC 7265 is similar to that it's not the change to the uh ethereum blockchain itself it's more a standard on the level of smart contracts that says hey if you do want to make a circle breaker like your own uh then just follow uh the standard because then it'll be compatible with all the infrastructure that people might build around it such as like all the infrastructure we build if you want to build like your own circuit breaker that under the hood Works a little bit differently if you follow our standard uh if you follow the standard then uh we'll support it basically out of the box so to to answer the original question like no it doesn't have to like be accepted as a final proposal uh to be adopted by other people and so do you have a sense yet of how many Protocols are interested in adopting it we're still working on that uh to be entirely honest like I'm more of a developer and programmer and although I'm a co-founder at the startup with my co-founder we're trying to basically do the business development effort I'm not the best at finding protocols to um do that but we do have one protocol that is on board and currently looking to integrate the circuit breaker asymmetry Finance they're like a LSD aggregator so basically you deposit your eth and then they put it in a bunch of different lsds to basically diversify your LCS and then they're looking for their next D5 product to use Circle Breakers to improve improve the secure because similar to other early stage protocols they still have those upgrade keys because they want to be able to maybe up make changes to their protocols or if a bug was found like internally then they want to be able to patch that up so for a protocol like that uh you can have very large benefits and they're looking to Pilot it as one of the early adopters great yeah and for listeners who don't know LSD sticking derivatives um some examples are like oh and rocket and uh since this is an aggregator I guess they're using multiple of them and were you going to add something else oh yeah I was just going to say we're also talking to a few security audit companies who want to uh also collaborate uh with us and their customers to add Circle Bakers but that's like still in the in the talking stage all right well we'll have to see where this all goes thank you so much for coming on Unchained yeah thank you so much for having me on and I hope we can just improve the space and just yeah improve the reputation of D5 because we always promise security like oh this is like autonomous secure Finance but let's actually do it and let's make it accessible to people it's making it secure I think would be very helpful to um actually having it grow absolutely and don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week
