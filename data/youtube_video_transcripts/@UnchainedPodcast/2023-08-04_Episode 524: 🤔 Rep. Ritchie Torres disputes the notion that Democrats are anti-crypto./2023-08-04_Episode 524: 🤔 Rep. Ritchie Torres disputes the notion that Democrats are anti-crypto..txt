yesterday the financial services Committee in the house passed a market structure bill on a bipartisan basis and the bipartisan support came from younger Democrats like myself who are open to embracing the potentialities of blockchain technology so I see it as more as a generational divide and as Congress becomes less of a jury talkers over time I suspect the institution will become more open to embracing crypto Republicans generally are pro-business so that's what's driving the Republican position but but to indiscriminately portray all Democrats is anti-crypto is to ignore the generational divide within the Democratic caucus and then setting aside the politics of Congress you know I ask myself what is crypto and blockchain you know the combination of crypto and blockchain has the potential to revolutionize Finance creating a better cheaper faster payment system
