arbitrum and optimism today today's guest is Thomas Brazil founder and managing partner of 507 Capital welcome Tom hi will learn good to see you thanks for having me 2022 was the year of crypto bankruptcies and this is an area that you are very familiar with as you have been purchasing claims from crypto bankruptcies for a very long time starting with mount gox tell us how that initial purchase of Mount Cox claims came about oh boy uh well again thanks for having me on and you know I got kind of sucked into the crypto probably in a way a lot of people did I wasn't like ideologically looking for you know stateless money or you know wasn't into Anarchy so I just I ran across Mount Cox and I saw that there was this situation going on and I figured it would be interesting to try to buy a claim I thought oh wouldn't it be cool to buy a claim in a Japanese cryptocurrency bankruptcy claim it's like the the highest like form of you know bankruptcy trade client buying so I sort of started buying claims and then I was like I guess I should know what crypto is you know what Bitcoin is and then it sort of went down the rabbit hole and you know I was always like ah okay this is this is pretty cool I mean and so I stayed close to it um you know crypto distressed as a asset class is if you think crypto is an emerging asset class crypto distress it's a real emerging asset class and so I've sort of always done it as a little bit of a side hustle and you know work predominantly for a large family office sourcing regular distress deals whether it's bankruptcy trade claims if loans all loans um and just special situations sort of opportunities and so it's been sort of a passion project so yeah we started with Mount Cox and you know we've been involved in almost every crypto insolvency since leaving malc Ox big cornica cryptopia and then if you push over to the States you can look at things like quadriga which is a great cred which is sort of these are trimmers of like the C5 meltdowns that we saw where you know a small amount of individuals with no checks and balances were sort of running these C5 institutions I guess not too to someone to Mac Cox but this is like the new wave you know like C5 meltdown 2.0 and those were the first trimmers and you also had other things like you had some icos go sideways with like fraud stuff so you had like gigawatt and thing called wolf fact and wasn't broad someone would say that but they had some other projects that went sideways and needed to restructure so there was a smattering of things but now we're in full swing so I'm curious like when you talk about all these different ones what was the amount that you had purchased before well we'll just like leave 2020 to a side but up until that year kind of how much was everything that you'd purchased or what was the value of it oh gosh so in Mount Cox um we really only purchased like a few million dollars for a client but at the time when we were buying um I originally started buying an old hedge fund I used to run and then in 2018 I stopped doing that and liquidated my fund and started working just you know on this project and then and then trying to you know basically be up on the sponsor and landed a job kind of working with the family office originally I you know exact amount um at cost is probably like two million dollars invested and it sounds like a little bit but at the time in 18 we were buying claims at four you know three four five hundred dollars of face value when they were they should have been worth about 10 times what we were paying for them and that was in cryptos like ten thousand so we're sort of like buying crypto at like a thousand dollars or something like that I'll look through value so that was kind of the iteration of the trade and then of course when it's a little more complicated than that because we're buying below the cash value in the estate on Mount Cox and then go over to bitcoinica those stack tacos still going on Mac should pay out this year probably this fall is what we're hearing they backed up the date in terms of like election for how you want your distribution whether you want the early distribution delay distribution which you want all in Fiat or crypto basically because they were you know there's 14 000 creditors which now seems like a little bit but at the time that was a lot and it still is and in Japanese insolvency is is known for being slow so it's taking a little longer but so that was pretty much the trade we did that so we sort of hoovered up small claims it worked out great or has worked out great for my family my family office that did it with us we've done some other things along the way and when you talk about how the mount Cox one because it's Japanese is especially slow how long would a typical bankruptcy take to play out so typical American bankruptcy is you know I could give like the pair dancers like 16 to 18 months for large chapter 11s that number comes has come down over the years because there's been sort of the rise of what are called 363 sales or sort of auction process as opposed to doing a plan you know but if you look at Japanese the Japanese uh are known for extremely long and you know like there are certain jurisdictions like Swiss liquidations and you know the financial services liquidations are also known for being particularly long things that have sipples attached and stuff so there are you know Lehman took you know enormous amount of time it comes all over the map I would say for the current ones going on if that's really the question 16 to 18 months for the normal course stuff that needs to be done but some of these companies have a lot of pre-protection act pre-petition activity that needs to be investigated and potentially litigated and those causes of action as they're called lovingly in the bankruptcy code will be pursued for many many years the cash and crypto could be turned returned in like you know like stages like stage one is cash and crypto returned and like the books and Records all settled and then like stage two is like causes of action pursued and potentially preferences we talk about those things but that gives you some ballpark hopefully okay and just so I understand like the theory then for you is you're buying these claims at some fraction of the actual value that they'll pay out in the future but is another part of the strategy that in the future you know on a long time scale as long as they're good at assets the crypto will also have increased in value or yeah yeah sure so with Mount Cox it was always like Bitcoin at a discount and also Bitcoin free so I should say that our digital investor did that two million dollars but we had some follow-on investors that bought frankly a lot more and at higher prices and their view is always like we're just buying Bitcoin at a discount helpless sources help us manage it help us do all the paperwork and that was the trade that they were basically doing by Bitcoin at a discount I would say with when you look at the dockets that are currently out there these are just like your traditional special situation investing it's just applied to crypto you know Voyager looks a lot like a merger like a bankruptcy merger which guys will play those and they or you know whatever people will invest in those in a special situation space and you have the three AC stub attached as well because that'll be the residual value and uh and potentially a cause of action against FTX which looking more valuable today and if you move over to Celsius it looks like a liquidation play where there's there's some Fiat there's some steak beef and things like that that'll that stick his youth goes up clearly that's going to increase the value of the recovery as well and then um an FTX and there's build real Venture portfolio with things like three ACS and FDX and those do look a lot like crypto recovery because think about it I mean you know if the recovery is let's just take FDX like the recoveries were 20 cents you know if crypto sort of comes back out and have a bull run you know what does that Venture portfolio worth it's worth a whole heck of a lot more so it's really would affect your recoveries even though it's not necessarily like tied to the price of Bitcoin or tied to the price of the ethereum okay and wait but meaning like even if you get paid out in dollars since it's because this is something that I don't understand it's like yeah can you explain that because like for some of these you'll get paid back in the crypto but for others you won't you'll get paid back in some dollar value but I don't know what it's pegged to is it pegged to the dollar value at the time of the filing or yeah yeah yeah okay okay so this whole like dollarization issue which is like you know the bankruptcy code hasn't kept up with the crypto markets as you would expect uh under the U.S bankruptcy code there's a thing where you dollarize claims at the time of the petition this is true almost every bankruptcy code act in fact I was actually looking at the BBI insolvency code and I was noticing that they have dollarization in there as well basically meaning that you you you basically calculate some claims at claim as if it's liquidated on the time of the petition which generally you might be referring to like a derivative's contract that like liquidates or I don't know a contract that you have with the debtor of like an employment contract it's like liquidated on the day of the petition but in this instance you have crypto you've got to basically take that crypto and almost like you own the coin market cap and just converted it all into dollars on that date that's your claim value um so that's going to happen in all the cases I mean there's very strong likelihood that's what happens in cases I would say where you get into real arguments and where there could be points of contention is in Mount Cox it was who gets the uplift in value post petition if you blow through your dollar value right so in Mount Cox uh Bitcoin was at 483 dollars at the time of the petition by the time the case is now paying out Bitcoins at sixteen thousand seventeen thousand come on eighteen thousand and the question is like who get that uplift in value the Japanese Court basically gave it to the creditors and I would say in Celsius Voyager and FDX and I guess maybe even three ACS as well because it appears there are some people who are investing via ethereum and things or maybe doing a lot loans in ethereum and Bitcoin there will be questions around do you get the dollarized value at the time of the petition or do you actually get some of that do you get is it actually not dollarized and that's gonna be a big question like so for instance if you're in celsius if you had Celsius tokens do you get that dollarized value at the time of the petition or do you get now this crappy well I should say crappy because what if someone buys Voyager maybe you get uh that Voyager token reinstated or something like that and the same thing with ftt if I had ftt in my account do I get that dollar I was the competition and that's my claim value or do I now have this this let's call it crappy token that has no value and I'm inextricably like have this crappy token I don't think that's fair but it's possible there will be some dollarization issues where you know people need to be worried about but those are sort of really strong there's a really edge cases and probably don't affect the majority of creditors in either one of these cases okay so it sounds like though in the vast majority of cases you do not actually get back the crypto that you had in your account you could get distributions in crypto there's nothing in the bankruptcy code that precludes it oh it's just so when you're talking about the dollarization it's literally just benchmarking what your value is but you could still be paid oh got it right these are two separate questions one is how do you estimate your claim and then how do you receive that that claim value you could still receive it in crypto there's nothing in the Bank of Dakota precludes it so just to back up for a second the bankruptcy code is lovingly as my mom would say is written in the negative meaning that it doesn't say that you can't do it then you probably can as long as there's an equitable basis for it and so in the instance of most of these these uh these dockets most of the creditors want to see crypto return to them and so there's nothing to preclude the court from doing it and I think they will in any case they can I mean they've been talking about it and the voyage you're hearing yesterday where they were talking about approving the disclosure statement the big topic was you know talking about disclosure statement and people were saying like well you're honored this is like a chance for people to get their crypto back like if we were actually needed to liquidate I'm not sure that we'd have a mechanism for sending all this crypto out to claimants so that would be quite an aggressive thing for the estate to do be expensive versus letting basically Finance do it for states where they're not and that regulate it's the wrong word but where they don't have licenses to have customers they're basically going to be Distributing the crypto out okay got it so then it's more a case-by-case basis it's not where there's like anything in particular that will let people know in advance what will happen so how do claims get sold and who generally buys oh geez um so there's a whole like Marketplace for these things there are a few marketplaces that are great there's nothing wrong with them and there's a whole brokerage community of course The Brokerage guys I don't think love the marketplaces because it seems like oh I don't want people to you know like opacity is how I make money but and then the in buyers are generally hedge funds opportunistic investors sometimes High net worth individuals sometimes family offices you know I would say crypto is somewhat unique because you have a lot of crypto people that have crypto money and they think like oh this I'm like I I'm already infected in this case like I already have a 20 million claim why don't I buy some more claims because I know what they're going for and I like the recoveries and I've done all the work so you have a lot of new insurance potentially of people wanting to buy it's not for the faint-hearted you kind of need know what you're doing but it's not impossible basically to Source claims and you know get lawyers to help you draft documents and then review preference exposure and then think through all the issues like we're talking about dollarization how to value your Venture portfolio how to Value the mining portfolio if it's if there's if there's a mining portfolio and your docket you're involved in so it's not that hard to do and then how are the prices typically determined oh boy oh you know willing seller willing buyer still sort of like hand-in-hand combat where those people interacting as opposed to just through a computer screen and no one's thought of tokenizing it although I've had people over the years always reach out like hey we should tokenize my Cox claims hey we should took knives FDX claim and I'm like it's actually a cool idea if you had an estate sanction it that would be even cooler because then uh maybe the estate could make like a fee every time it went across so like you knew that if you were selling it also your fellow creditors were like gaining so I think that'd be a really cool idea if someone wants to do a call me I think for all intents and purposes a lot of the claims are not homogeneous you know people that have tried to do like full marketplaces I think what they realize is like oh wow the claims are not so homogeneous like it depends like where the person's located like what their preference exposure is what the underlying claim is and also like the marketplace while it sounds big now because FTX is a 10 billion dollar clean pool and Voyager and Celsius have multi-billion dollar claim schools generally the claims pool and like take an airline bankruptcy guess how big trade clean pool is like a few hundred million dollars and it might have 10 billion dollars of financial debt the claims pool is usually really small compared to the cases but with these they're huge the claims pulls the entire dock okay and then once you buy a claim what exactly do you get a mess yeah but like are you the official contact person for the bankruptcy estate after that yeah basically yeah you buy the claim you file your transfer in the court sometimes there's transferability issues you need to work through again like if you're doing this you want to have like able counsel helping you um but it's not rocket science and you can file your transfers you know and you're if you need power of attorney if you need beneficial ownership you know certain jurisdiction like if you're in the BVI maybe and then you know you're the coin of contact you basically step on the shoes of that creditor that can be good and bad right because if you have a preference you know I mean yes okay you technically don't buy the preference but they could offset your claims because you are stepping in the shoes of that claimant wait you keep using this word preference but what does it mean so preference anybody that's a creditor at this point is Googled it like 5 000 times and doesn't want to hear any more about it so I apologize for your creditor but for the general public of preference is just this idea that if you received a preferential payment or treatment from from a debtor pre-petition pre-petition meeting before the date they file their bankruptcy petition so an American jurisprudence or you know bankruptcy law they look back 90 days and BDI they look back I think 90 days or six months generally the idea is you have three creditors like I give you like just a like law school example I have three creditors one of them you don't have to be friendly with them but you just like him the other two you don't like so you only have ten thousand dollars left and you have three creditors that you owe ten Grand you pay him the 10 grand you file for bankruptcy and the other two creditors get bumpkins and the idea is like well hey that's unfair we should really unwind that transaction pull the 10 grand back and then do split it three ways so it's equal treatment it's a court of equity bankruptcy courts come out in English Common Law Courts of equity and so that's the idea of a preference now there are defenses to preferences and we can talk about all that stuff um but yeah you want to talk about business and preferences sure why don't we we'll cover that briefly okay all right so in all these cases the big ones are ordinary course of business defense meaning it was a depend these were demand deposits and you could pick them out anytime you wanted the other one is ordinary business terms which are added under the 2005 updates to the bankruptcy code under what's called babsies they update bankruptcy code you also have what are called 546 e Safe Harbor which is basically Safe Harbor that allows you to when you have oh man I feel bad saying this because I'm not like you know a high-end lawyer but I I'm gonna do it in a non-high lawyer way if you have Financial transactions going through financial intermediaries on account of a Securities or commodity contract you're supposed to be you're supposed to have a safe harbor this was added by you know financial industry lobbyists to basically stop cascading you know Bank runs in the financial industry and so the question would be are these crypto firms Financial intermediaries under the definition of the 546c Safe Harbor and if that's true although all the transfers you made to yourself out of your account could probably be fit within the safe harbor and so it'll be an interesting question to see and I've tried to contact a few crypto firms or crypto uh thank you a few crypto like policy groups about you know basically pushing for Safe Harbor because I think it's important for the industry I've gotten hadn't got a ton of support back from them I think partially because they don't really understand the issue and it's just too like Arcane and it's like what 546e I didn't even want a lawyer who thought it was interesting and then she was like send me like send me a summary on like what you think we should do and like I'll I'll do it I was like summary what you should do I just explained it you should get involved in these cases they're like maybe we have a law firm do it for free for us I was like I don't think our law firm's gonna take this up for free for you like these things have gone up the Supreme Court okay well let's now just talk about Mount Cox because we have so many bankruptcies to cover in this episode and we are especially what the FTX we're really going to get into it but let's talk about Mountain Cox because obviously this has been in the news on and off since 2014 which is kind of crazy and um I just was curious to hear or take because I imagined since this was the first major crypto bankruptcy case that probably like kind of presented the new issues uh having a crypto bankruptcy would present for bankruptcies in general so what were those issues dollarization was a big one who gets the up the dollarization leads to this question of who gets the uplift and value of the in this case Bitcoin post petition and then and but then also like you know for some of these especially in FTX I imagine you know some of these are um  coins and so the value will probably go down so then also how does that even okay we're back to dollarization we haven't let's 2014 2024 almost so 10 years talking about dollarization you know because the codes aren't really set to to deal with different currencies I mean they aren't foreign currencies they can handle and that's why they had dollarize it to whatever currency is that local currency like in Japanese and solvency code it take it puts it into Japanese Yen well the great thing about that is the creditors have been walloped recently because the Japanese have been falling against the dollar and well and probably against the Euro as well dollarization again but now it's cutting the other way for these coins and utility tokens do they get dollarized where you get that that petition date value or is it just totally a zero and you have no hope I think it gets dollarized as well um I think that with some of these issues they're Equitable so there's like the legal so if I should say that and everything we talk about there's like a code Provisions like especially with all these American bankruptcies but then you also can look to like what the Equitable Solutions are on you know under 105 the bankruptcy court can basically do anything that it deems Equitable that isn't in direct conflict like with the provision of the code again if it's if it's not expressly prohibited it's allowed if it's if it's leading adding Equity to a situation and I'm just curious for your take like do you think dollarization is a good idea or has been a good idea um I think it is I think it is because even if you get dollarized and you think oh that's that could screw me you would have other Equitable arguments to why you should get the uplift and value if you're getting screwed by dollarization and you probably have Equitable arguments to if even if you're dollarized I I think I think it is the right solution I I think if you didn't dollarize it and left it in all these different currencies it would be very complicated for administering the cases huh maybe one day we'll we'll Bitcoin eyes you know that'll be like the you know but right now I think this is six of dollars well one thing that you said to me when I interviewed you from my premium offering was that the mount gox case never actually answered the question of whether people should receive back their crypto you so that they kind of punted on this question of whether Bitcoin is property so I was just so curious how do they get away with not answering it and why do you think that Japan I think it's a look I'm not a like a Japanese legal scholar so anyone that like works in the field I apologize because I'm sure they're gonna be like oh this guy's horrible my take from having expensive legal counsel there and going being going a few times for court hearings and being involved in the case for many years is it's kind of everything is kind of a backdoor deal it's like you go into the creditors meeting any sort of argument that was going on it's already resolved and it gets like presented by the trustee you know when you go to Japanese Court I was telling you this song I think on the other part it's like the trustee sits in the middle of the courtroom and the three judges that are overseeing him sit on the side and he stands in there and he talks on a microphone for like 45 minutes like almost like filibustering the whole thing so no one can ask any questions it's only an hour and and literally like the judges sit on the side and Nod as he talks and it's just a very cultural thing I think where there's just not a lot of disagreement there is disagreement but it's always behind closed doors and it's always like when it comes to being public there's it's all very smooth and there's like you would never notice any um they didn't punch they punted on like they just basically said like hey it's property we're not sure who should get the uplift in value we think you should uh claimants and so unless someone kind of like strongly objects um we're gonna kind of give it to you that's that it sounds silly but that's basically what they said they never really answered the question on like whether they basically said it's more Equitable to kind of give it to you we're not sure yes it's dollarized but it's property so maybe you should get your property back they just never really got to the question so but then were there any were there any kind of like precedents that were set in Mount gox that you know could be applied in like FTX or 3ac or Celsius or anything no so no there weren't really um and that's interesting and there were some precedences out of um the UK and out of New Zealand which should affect some common law thing so if you think of BVI or three three ACS is going on or maybe the Bahamas or if I'm saying it right um so the other day the judge said it wrong and it messed me up and those Kate those those are English common law and they should actually look to potentially other commonwealth countries to see how they've interpreted it and there was some some decent case law out of New Zealand I think that went up the Supreme Court they basically said crypto is property and even though they were pretty good for crypto asset earners they basically said like and it's held you know in cuff you know there's a custodial relationship because you thought there was you know what I mean so like even though they're they're all the prongs of uh like a custodial relationship might not have been there you're we're still going to give that to you that's what they basically said in cryptopia when it won the Supreme Court so that's good case law but of course it's not you know this positive at all for U.S bankruptcy court oh okay so in a way it's like maybe we need a big crypto bankruptcy in the U.S to kind of set some of the precedent so yeah right so here so Voyager is quite a clean case they had FTX as a buyer going in or kind of going in and now they have CZ if that gets done a lot not a lot of case law will come out of Voyager but Celsius kind of being like the red-headed stepchild will probably end up like am I allowed to say that uh will probably end up making more case law around dollarization and what are you going to do with the sell token you know there'll be a lot more fighting about that preferences you know will preferences be pursued are there defenses to preferences what what are they in the crypto context so it'll be a lot of case a lot of that and FDX will be the same there'll be a ton of case law because it's so messy that they'll be just be more fighting okay yeah so we're gonna get into all of those cases but first why don't you just give us kind of the tldr on what's happening with Mount Cox this year because this year I think as a momentous year for the mount Cox creditors finally nine nine years later yeah so I'm I think that's I think it's it's about time it's great to see that um the case is sort of approved coming to an end I guess um creditors were supposed to submit their like election for early payout or late payout and uh whether they want to get paid in uh crypto or Bitcoin and if they wanted to get paid in Bitcoin which I think well they didn't actually choose which which uh payment you know party you want to use or whatever but uh that got moved from January to January 10th to March 10th since it's in March it looks like now the distribution instead of this summer will be this fall which is great for creditors I think people are somewhat worried about all that Bitcoin coming online quote unquote but I would say that one of the largest creditors is a two firms one or three firms one is the bitcoinico state which is going on in New Zealand that'll take a few years to work out so that is a that's about 64 000 accepted Bitcoin claim so it should be about I don't know rough math like call it something like 10 000 of the 140 000 Bitcoin that will be going there so that's going on that's not coming online you also have let's go down the list then you have like this guy Josh Jones there's a thing called uh Bitcoin Builder he's gonna receive he's actually the largest creditor but it's really Bitcoin Builder just in his name um that won't be coming offline but it'll take him probably a few months if not a year to administer that so that Bitcoin will be coming online just yet then you can go down the wrong it's probably Fortress who owns probably another 10 maybe 15 of the docket that could be coming online but I think they'll be pretty smart about it and they probably have hedged some of it and then you know maybe us and I don't know let's see there's there's one or two other large creditors I think what it will do is it'll be a lot of Bitcoin on the market with guys that have a pretty low cost basis and will probably want to re-popicate it into the like Bitcoin lending market and so the prices for Lending out your Bitcoin or I should say the interest rate you can make for Lending it and Bitcoin might be very depressed and I think Bitcoin cash which a lot of people are going to get could get really walloped because remember these were like pretty early bitcoiners like 2014 so I don't know I can't read into their minds but probably some of them are really serious like Maxis so right yeah that would make sense okay so in a moment we're going to talk about all the major crypto bankruptcies of 2022 and then some but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 50 million

believe maybe you tell me could have an impact on other bankruptcies they concerned the assets held by the so-called custody customers who did not have interest bearing accounts versus the earned customers who did have the interest bearing accounts that was the vast majority of them on Celsius so can you explain what those decisions were and then why they were significant and also let me know whether or not you think those will affect these other cases yeah so it's very interesting so I think I think Voyager did file first no and but anyway but but oh I I thought it was Celsius but maybe I'm wrong but anyway no maybe you're right I don't even remember now um it was I felt so concurrent that it doesn't really matter but on this whole like custody earned question I think it really will affect long-term like where a lot of the C5 players and the on-ramps on the crypto how they go about writing their terms of service and and what their customers will demand to be able to get right but just just explain what those decisions here yeah so the decision was basically so far the decision has been we're going to return only to earn that's pure earned excuse me custody that's pure custody meaning that it came into a custody account it never went into an earned account and we're also going to return people that have custody accounts of under 7 500 that's basically the minimum threshold for bringing a preference and let me talk about why the whole custody account type might be a preference and why the judge has not ruled on returning all because of the account and claimants money basically on leading up to the bankruptcy there were a number of State AGS uh attorney generals that were pushing back on the earned account saying security and it was unregistered and they were being offering to non-accredited investors and so you got to get out of our state with this product and so what Celsius did is they basically transitioned everybody over to they created a thing called a custody account and this did not allow them to pre-apothecate and it was supposed to be literally a custodian for you which is a very different product than a Securities offering where they're going to re-evothegate and you're basically have an earned claim in your general unsecured creditor that was created Believe It or Not 89 days before the bankruptcy filing and remember we spoke about preferences earlier which are 90 days before the bankruptcy now some people claim that machinski or the the debt that you know I should say Mission speed the debtor the debtors professionals you know purposely filed on the 89th day just to make sure that you know if they could that would be an extra 280 million dollars or whatever the account claimants would be in there that whole account type would be considered a preference and so other than the pure Capital that went in there and now can come out anything that went from earned to custody within that that 90 days that's a preference I think it's gonna it kind of like we were saying earlier like Voyager is going to make less case law because it's too clean probably blocked by similar you know other than fighting over the the Robin Hood shares and it's significant because it kind of shows that preferences matter you know custody matters you have to follow all the prongs to set up a custody account you know just looking at your phone and seeing that you have some assets in here it doesn't create you know a custodial account custodial relationship and so I think it's quite significant and I think it'll probably affect all the big guys if you think of you know from coinbase down how they go about offering different products and even the way The Regulators will think about like what they demand if they bring regulatory enforcement to make sure they insulate their citizens of that state or that country but what do you make of that 7 500 threshold like do you think that because it's like I don't understand why they didn't just say if you have money there then you will get it back like why do you think they suddenly were just like oh below this cut off you can get the money back but above well the reason they gave under 7 500 is because that's the minimum threshold in in order to bring a preference oh okay when I say they gave back people with 7 500 I mean people with accounts with 7 500 or less in them so if like com Brazil has six thousand dollars the preference uh threshold the minimum to bring a preference under the bankruptcy code is 7 500 so in a way they're just keeping that possibility open for them but I guess what I'm asking is like why not just say you have that money in there it was in this custody account like why not just say even if you have more than 7 500 worth of it that you can just claim it as your own why not well I think that on on from an equitable basis you know it's it's it's it's who knows it's it's likely that it probably still gets returned but judges have a tendency to Only Rule on what they absolutely have to you know they sort of like try to narrow things down to what they feel very confident is right and then anything that's not they're like hmm maybe I can punt on this decision and then maybe later in the case I don't even have to rule on it because someone buys the business and so that's always a really nice you know to have like even today with the hearing in FDX like even on voyagers disclosure statement yesterday people were bringing up all kind of issues for confirmation the judge said that's a really great objection the problem is I'm not ruling on confirmation today I'm ruling on whether the adequacy of the disclosure statement and I know what you're saying and I hope you bring that up when we have a confirmation hearing but right now I don't have to listen to any of that you know like I don't have to take any of that in and so I think that's what he's trying to do he's saying this is very narrow 75 below that's obviously not a preference because it can't be anything that was a pure custody meaning it came from your outside wallet into a custody it never touched earned that clearly was never preference because it was never the debtor's property but the stuff that went from earned to custody within the 90 days I'm not sure yet and I'm going to hold it until we figure it out later okay the judge also ruled that the money and the earned accounts would be Celsius is and talk about that and like what do you think the significance of these decisions would will be for these other bankruptcies I think it's significant I mean if you look at the if you look at the terms of service even though they moved around and shape-shifted a lot over time they were very clear that when you read it it's you know when you buy into this you're basically giving your money to Celsius to reaperate and that you have this earned account and it's a journal and secured claim I mean that's basically what it says I think that's again Voyager probably would have had a similar determination but they didn't have to go there because or hopefully you don't have to go there because hopefully uh Finance can get over the cepheus review and can close on the transaction right which is a review about like the National Security interest of selling Voyager to finance but anyway yeah so Cynthia's review I'm not an expert on cepheus but it is yes it's a doj's way or I don't know who actually review that it's like Department of Justice for it's like the actual like what branch of the government but uh someone reviews it in the government and yeah says like you know someone that you know is foreign I think particularly Chinese is allowed to own this asset I mean I guess I guess binance has its own issues historically of like whether you know having wallet issues with with with with shady depositors and things like that but it seems a bit far stretched to be blocking it on cepheus but yeah I agree but I would say for for FDX is it that helpful probably not because the terms of service for FDX say English common law the problem the FDX runs apart and we are runs into and we could talk about this is even though let's say English common law and even though they say title never changes hands between the customer and the the company exchange yeah yeah the exchange you know it's a giant fraud you run into real issues around alleged was that a legend a legend there's a allegedly I wouldn't say a giant fraud that's the wrong input is allegedly a lot of you know Shenanigans going on to where you have to start questioning the very contracts that are being used to support it I mean in in Celsius people really came hard at machinsky and now I think in hindsight people are going like okay we can talk about things he did that weren't right or aggressive stuff or promising things on amas or being promotional but uh you know we've got bigger fish to fry and I think in his terms of service people were like oh through all the terms and service out because he wasn't following other terms of service you know this thing in contract law that you'd sort of like just because one provision is broken doesn't mean the whole contract is thrown out you're supposed to try to follow the contract so we'll see what happens in in FDX but the Celsius ruling it's not too informative it's sort of like what you kind of thought was going to happen all along I know people didn't want to hear it but it was clearly plainly obvious by the terms of service okay yeah I saw numerous people saying that they felt the decision was right even though it's not something pleasant for Celsius customers so Celsius is still looking for potential buyers in Bloomberg recently reported that there were 30 of them how How likely is it that you think such a deal would go through you know look it's possible I mean if someone just basically pays very little and is able to acquire their customers on the on the cheap then then why not and what do you think that would be good or bad for creditors I think it would be good for creditors one it would probably take the preference risk off the table um because any buyer would say like hey you can't be going after purposes after my customers and I think also it would ex it would speed things up you know have a buyer they're going to process they're going to open accounts anybody wants to close their accounts is 90 days to close it very similar to kind of like the binance buyout Voyager you know it would probably Grease the wheels of getting something done I think the administration of Distributing all the crypto left of bankruptcy professionals I'm not saying they can't do it I'm just saying when you see the bill you're gonna be like whoa so I think the cost on the estate of administering Distributing all the Bitcoin could be expensive and then I think it also leaves the door open for preferences but I think it's the real risk of Celsius I don't think it's something to to think that oh there's 30 bidders I mean sure 30 people signed an NDA how many people are really serious and compared I mean you saw the back and forth on Voyager and Voyager was pretty clean so you think the odds are what less than 50 percent you know I think that the debtor and the UCC uh the unscrew creditors committee is known as the UCC the UCC and the data are going to have a tough time deciding whether the bidders are qualified and have feasibility issues around buying them so let's say a company who's kind of like a ragtag team gets 25 million or 100 million together and tries to buy uh Celsius can they really run the operations what if they slip into chapter like right after buying it there's a lot of risk so you're going to need someone with sure they might only pay 50 or 100 or maybe maybe something like 100 million dollars for the customers just to buy them and then basically in state reinstate whatever cryptobalance is left the new state you know so like a one for one for the crypto and then we're going to add 100 million but there's real feasibility issues feasibility meaning like who's to stop a bank run on that buyer unless they're a big boy who can shoulder a lot of withdrawals if they take over the company okay all right so now let's turn to the Big Kahuna of the crypto bankruptcies we started to talk about it FTX the day we're recording FTX announced that it had recovered more than five billion dollars in different assets and that didn't include another 425 million dollars held by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas so Thomas when I mentioned that I saw you shaking your head so what do you make of this news and what do you think it means for customers amazing amazing news you know the thing about these cases you you can't you know twist and turns like this do happen it's nice to see a pleasant one for the creditors there's a lot of fervor from distress firms trying to buy claims in this case so it's interesting to see great news on the back of it did any of these guys know about this great news I doubt it I had one creditor who was going on and on about how they had to have known because they were trying hard to buy his claim and I'm just like I'm telling you I just don't see it I mean it's possible but I don't think that anybody that would have leaked out these State professionals don't do that kind of stuff they're really kind of in their own world and they don't make sure they talk with the stress firms but they would never cross a line like that and um so anyway getting on to it yeah it's great news um I think the the issue is going to be is it great news or is it good news and so so when you peel back like what's in that portfolio of stuff that they say is highly liquid like how highly liquid is it and are they I just I guess just more disclosure I mean it's a big statement to be making and there's really no benefit to a state professional over promising and under delivering generally it's the other way around they under promise and over deliver so they look great you know just like John Ray in the beginning of the uh FTX case you sir oh my God this is the worst case ever worst case ever and it's like oh we actually we found a billion dollars you know so it's like they have a tendency to do that sort of under promise and over deliver yeah well I did see that Conor Grogan the coinbase director of product strategy and business operations tweeted that he tracked all the FTX assets and he felt that they're relatively illiquid he saw things like locked Saul for you know Solana as well as FDT which you know doesn't have much value Maps oxy like you know some of these no-name Sam coins and so he actually said that he felt it was irresponsible for them to advertise this five billion dollar number as something that they could actually recoup so what's your take on that my take would be that's a very thoughtful tape I am but an estate professional I don't think would come out with something like that unless they really had something and thought through it they're not they're not idiots yes okay they're learning crypto a lot of them but these are Highly Educated what you know all top top firms I mean I'm not sure who actually said it in court of someone at Sullivan and Cromwell I'm pretty sure you know you're talking about some of the best bankruptcy attorneys in the country um I don't know if it was dietericho somebody else but I don't think they would say unless they really had it and if it's not on chain that probably makes me think it's in currency you know like dollars and dollars in euros should be fantastic okay well we'll have to keep our fingers crossed yeah we really don't know there's like no there was like it was it was literally like this it was like a paragraph of disclosure and they're like and we're not gonna tell you anymore it's like oh come on like the biggest news ever and there's like no real breaking apart but it is curious to me like where do you find that much money in how is it not like tracked on chain you know I think that is very curious all right let's also talk about the Robin Hood shares these were very hotly contested um and now it's resolved but let's actually just talk about that initial fight because that was all very interesting but anyway okay well clearly my understanding is is less than yours so initially block fi tried to link claim to them because they were saying that the entity which is one owned by Sam Pinkman treat that had purchased them had pledged that stock as collateral for a 600 million dollar loan that blockify had provided to Alameda the same thing with freed himself tried to lay claim to them saying that he needed that money for legal fees the ftx's date was also vying for them so why were these shares so contested and what do you make of this fight like what was the significance okay yeah so sandbankment framed his his point was he had an equity interest in that after the loan uh to block five block five was saying this has been pledged alone as a loan and we're collapsing on the loan so we like backwards we'd like the collateral and FDX of course was saying well hold on a second the guy that pledged that loan never had the authority to pledge it and it's null and void because he wasn't authorized to pledge it he basically had our and sorry he had our property and he was pledging it when he shouldn't have been so those are the three separate arguments none of it's been resolved because the government showed up and was like we're just gonna hold these which on one level sounds great I guess if you're FTX because um block 5 was making a power move for him you know the US government's probably going to want to pound the flesh I mean they're talking about holding them as part of a civil or criminal forfeiture and what that means is that the those assets will be if if he signs the plea agreement they'll be they'll first of all as the criminal trial is going on they're gonna sit on those assets so it could be literally I don't know a few years while he's going through his criminal trial and they're holding on to the assets and only then only after that will he potentially sign a civil civil forfeiture which only then will each estate have to make a claim on the Civil forfeiture so it could be years before those shares have gotten back it was kind of interesting to think about in terms of uh for Robin Hood I mean it's kind of a big risk now because who knows maybe Robin Hood ends up going to zero in five years or who knows maybe four x's and instead of 400 million and 1600 million and then Sam has he wants the residual they want their loan and then the estate wants their property back so it'll be interesting how the spoils are split and the other thing is I'm not sure exactly but when you do these civil forfeitures there's no like adjudicated process not a court process you literally interact with the doj um for splitting up those goods you know laying claim on that forfeited property and and so the doj literally some person in an office somewhere could be like okay you get 400 you get 400 and you get 400 which is kind of crazy to think about because it really won't be appealable in any way you know or it won't be like motion practice with stuff that you would normally see in restructuring so it's kind of kind of a curveball but none of that's been decided and it'll be years because his criminal trials going on and they'll sit on that property just like with knockbacks Alexander vinegar they're sitting on the BTC property while he's been extradited and if he's tried only then they've been sitting on the BTC servers for eight years however long knock knock's been going on okay yeah and just to fill people in that's the exchange where allegedly a lot of the stolen Bitcoins from Mount Cox were laundered through and he so BTC was shot down and then he was arrested and um I can't remember what happened they they caught him on vacation in Greece yeah yeah so okay but I can't remember I think the French authorities kind of I can't remember if he got extradited here I don't think he did did he he did he got extradited recently oh he did yeah okay okay they're like come on like missing malcact Bitcoin maybe who knows okay yeah well oh right that would be amazing for people like you the creditors right yeah for all the creditors I mean I doubt they'll actually find any and I heard recently there was a news story about them doing a like a prisoner swap like the Nick was going to be prisoner swap of somebody else and I'm just like oh great this would be horrible for creditors but there are I assume like you know the blockchain stuff just out there or blockchain analytic guys like there are wallets that people track like malc ox like sort of like Associated wallets with the hack that just sit there right okay but so just to follow up on the um Robinhood shares thing because I guess I didn't fully understand about the US government's using that money so essentially like in a way they're kind of holding it as what some kind of Leverage to use in their case against Sam how do you know yep basically terrible okay okay okay yeah seriously hotly contested Robin Hood shares and and but out of curiosity like why do you think it was that asset in particular is that just one of the few assets that's actually valuable in the FTX case are like why was it those in particular I think because technically they're outside of the estate you know because the shares were pledged to block five but they weren't owned by block five so not owned by that estate and then the FDX estate says hey that's stolen property but they haven't actually brought that lawsuit yet right so it's technically outside of the estate still so the government's like well hang on a second we can maybe get what's outside of the property okay maybe that house and like maybe those shares like they can't they can't like reach the automatic stay of the bankruptcy uh courts and just like start grabbing property out of the estate these these were this is like big estate property that's that's that's basically not in Indiana State so it was just what was available got it okay so yeah now now I get it this is um just I mean it's super interesting how this all works but that makes a lot of sense because yeah obviously they want to honor the bankruptcy um and yet they you know need to also pursue Justice however they're gonna do it so I wanted to ask you about one of the marketplaces where the FTX claims for trading because you know you mentioned these before about these marketplaces but coindesk reported on one of the sites called X claim FTX claims were going for 13 cents on the dollar and that's actually up from I guess initially after the bankruptcy it was just a few cents on the dollar um but I was curious like you know why you thought it was that amount because the same article said that the Voyager digital claims were trading at 41 cents block fives were trading at 28.5 cents in Celsius is at 18.5 cents so why is it that the FTX ones are so low you know like what how are people kind of determining what they think the value of these are okay so I'll get in trouble with my friends if I don't mention their two real websites the the two best ones are claimsmarket.com claims for like you know I guess it's slash markets.com and then ex claim not with an s.com those are the websites if you want to go and like try your hand at doing stuff and they are they're you know legitimate claims are there you just have to kind of like check the schedules make sure it matches the schedule them out look at the preference exposure uh get comfortable with the counterparty that they have ID and stuff like that yeah why are they so much lower I guess because if you if you look at Southeastern Voyager it's very clear what the outcomes are going to be uh Celsius or say let's do it all let's do all three Voyager you're buying for 40. you're basically going to get 50 to 55 in crypto and you're going to get the three AC claimed as a kicker it may be a cause of action against FTX so that that's the play right you buy it for 40 you make you make 50. right and that short order like a few months hopefully if the deal closes and and you're just facing this on like what what assets they have to to repay the okay got it like the balance sheet we know what the balance sheet looks like we know what the claims pool looks like we know the numerator and the denominator looks like so you know it's like simple arithmetic on that then you start going further down to Celsius we know what the arithmetic looks like but they're burning a lot of cash and we don't know what mining's worth and there's some Equity guys kicking up a big sting saying that like Hey we're ahead of all the the customer account claimants on the mining business and on the gka assets um so there's a little more friction right between like numerator and denominator we know but like we don't know like where we're going to converge and like get our recovery so there's a bigger Delta between like what you you what you what you can pay versus what you could potentially have the opportunity of getting potentially and then you really don't know what the cause of actions are against insiders it's a little unclear and then going further down I mean FDX other than like today's big announcement people are scratching their head what is the denouement what does the numerator look like what does the denominator look like I have no clue is it 10 billion of claims is it 12 billion of claims is it 15 billion of claims and also on the numerator like well who's owning what like what is in the liquid portfolio what about the Venture stuff isn't that a lot of Solana projects like isn't Solana dead now like I'm not saying it is I'm just saying these are the questions that get asked within the stress firms and they start saying okay we need an even bigger discount and then there's wallets moving around you hear about stuff on Twitter like while it's moving around and so again now not only the new we don't know what's going to happen but the numerator and denominator are very fuzzy and so you need bigger differences between what you pay and what you have the opportunity of making oh okay it's like simply straight up the fact that the like the accounting for FTX was so messy that's really what it boils down to okay yeah yes the funny spreadsheet which is very messy weird yeah poorly labeled internal Fiat account and whatever so yeah okay but I would say that uh you said 13 cents yeah I mean the the market on FTX has been bouncing around like crazy so it started really really it actually pre-petitioned there were some a few claims trading I wish they claims but accounts trading hands people trying to do all kind of stuff trade Tron trade the nfts get off back way through you know Bahamas and then once it filed people were like oh my gosh is this a zero like this could be a zero and so claims are trading at like 35 cents and then sort of moving out between five and five six seven and then all of a sudden there were quotes in like the teens and I would say that's probably where the market is um even after today's news maybe a little higher but it's tough for larger distress firms to buy smaller claims so if you're a small account claim it you'd be real if you really are trying to sell it you have to be realistic about they have to do due diligence on your claim they have to resilience on you um like a kyc email background and so it's harder for smaller claims to get that full price you get to see quoted in papers and stuff like that sometimes so people shouldn't get it's just a function of like the friction of of doing transactions I mean if you're a 500 000 claimant someone's buying it for 10 cents that's a 50 000 purchase like you got to buy a lot of claims to make a business out of that okay right okay that makes sense yeah it sounds like a slightly bureaucratic thing so one thing that I found interesting was you tweeted wild prediction timelines are years zero to two building records years two to seven litigation and sell-off Investments years 7 to 15 selling off Venture portfolio you know Arrow Arrow recoveries 60 to 100 plus over 15 years so so curious like how are you coming up or like when you when you use these percentages of 60 to 100 is that like 60 to 100 of the actual crypto or 60 no the dollar value dollar dollars yeah and then when you say like 15 years like I don't know it sort of seems like a super long time to get that 100 of your money so yeah but talk a little bit about your projection there well if you buy it for five to ten and you make 10x over 10 years or 12 years and you get back your cost basis in the first couple of years you're not going to be upset oh wait wait but you said 100 not 10x 100 is like one you just get back what you put in oh no I'm in if you were to buy them at 10 yes if you're a creditor and then today's news is fantastic fantastic news today so I'm not saying that that's not uh fantastic news and that was a total curveball why do I think that I mean I think that there's a lot of cash a lot of crypto Investments a lot of cause of action a lot of assets outside their state that which the state can trace out using like constructive trust um lawsuits and things like that and I think that um that'll all come back and I also think that um there are a lot of people around this estate that probably made money that need to be looked into you know and also like if you think of the bank run on SPF and and I should say on an FTX like five billion dollars left the estate in the last 30 days that's a lot of potential preferences and they're not talking about little you know one million dollar claimants I'm talking real big institutional players that pulled serious money off of these platforms and I'm not saying they should pay it all back but clearly that will help recoveries to the more like retail client so that's just a prediction also based on you know my experience with some of the when I was a kid like learning about bankruptcy there were these.com bankruptcies and they had these big Venture portfolios and they were very interesting because all the firms that invested in these these ended up being like 100 repay and then some uh cases because the Venture portfolios in years like you know 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ended up being great so the two biggest ones depending on the one that I wanted to mention but the other one is called comdisco These are these are Big bankruptcies um in the.com bubble uh that led to Fantastic recoveries actually for creditors but at the time people were like the.com Bubble Burst who wants any of these crappy.com companies and yes okay a lot of them were zeros but there were some real winners in there and it ended up really helping recoveries and so I think you could get a very similar story and both probably I guess the big ones with Venture portfolios or three ACS and FDX all right so we're going to talk about 3ac in a moment but before we do that I just want to ask about this other issue with the FTX bankruptcy case which is whether or not the names and contact information of the customer should be kept private so at the moment that we're recording the judge's rule that they can be kept private for three more months potentially they're you know they might extend that and I should just say like we're recording on Wednesday January 11th Apparently one of the experts who looked at the list said that it's a valuable asset and I was curious to know like is it unusual to keep the customer list private and if so like why do you think they've chosen to keep it private so far let's talk about that and let me give you the case history on it so in in uh let's walk through them cred uh which was a precursor to these cases the customer list I think was kept private then flash four uh come forward uh Celsius was kept private excuse me voyager was kept private uh Celsius was not and now FDX is trying to do it and the same guy that ruled incred which incred it was unopposed because it wasn't such a big case it was unopposed to keep the uh the Creditor list or customer list uh private the issue you have is you have customers and creditors we keep even doing it ourselves like the customer list credit list which one is it so an American jurisprudence uh and in bankruptcy there's supposed to be this idea of transparency and access information not just for for parties of interest but like all the creditors and all the parties of interest to see everything that's going on you want to sell an asset great motion the court explain why you want it everybody have an opportunity to see it respond to it support it object to it you know find red flags in it you name it and that's the way the system works and under 107 of the bankruptcy code you're only a few areas where you're you that you can look to to have cause to redact things the debtor hasn't even come close to meeting that burden in today's hearing and so I think the Judge wanted to give it to him but there were too many people objecting to what they wanted to do and so he basically said like look I love you I want to give you this but you haven't really done your job so I'm gonna give you three months instead of six months of of like an interim basis redaction and you come back here with good 507 or excuse me 107 arguments so how we can redact this and basically the big the big things you can do for adoption are it's valuable to the estate and you were basically hurting the value of the business by giving away this customer list or this creditor list um that's one argument it's basically you know business competitiveness reasons the other one is like imminent harm to the party that you're giving their information out to and the standards are there I was getting on Twitter some guy was going back and forth with you seemed like a very nice guy but he has like a very strong view that like no one's information should be public I have I guess a little bit of a different view I feel like there should be some disclosure around creditor names and amounts so that people can make relationships that you might not know like oh that's the guy that he used to have doing this for him and like you know he's not technically an Insider but like I'll bet that that came from here you know what I mean like and if there isn't a lot of disclosure people don't see those connections so I think it's really great to have a disclosure that's the benefit of course the downside is people are saying things on Twitter and people get all hot and bothered like all I'm getting doxed someone's going to come and like hold me up at gunpoints get my crypto so I see both sides of this and I think judge Glenn in Celsius wrote a really good opinion on this but if you want to talk about the facts in FDX it looks very much like the the judge is going to give them the relief they saw it he just wants a better you have better papers and evidentiary hearing so that he doesn't look like a jerk for granting it even though there were serious objections today to what the deader wanted wow wow you think okay yeah I don't know I mean I I agree with you that I see it both ways yeah because of the nature of this case I do feel the more information you know kind of probably the better for people because since you know where where you know did certain people get their money from like that's an important question to figure out so the point that you made yeah I I would agree with that and you know FTX has a lot of individual Traders and stuff and they might have things in their personal name so then it's redacted but really it's a business account but at the time they could only open it in a personal account so what do you do with that and that wasn't even brought up today in court if I don't even think they know this but like early claimants I think could only open accounts in personal names oh yeah yeah it's it's so tricky yeah I don't feel there's like any one good answer but I find it interesting that the judge yeah like I guess what what I'm hearing is more that the judge has a predetermined decision but isn't engaging with the issues and that's what I find um maybe not so compelling uh but anyway I wish the job I mean for me I get it like judges federal bankruptcy judges are generally extremely smart and they are specialist in what they do they are bankruptcy attorneys um who have been you know you know applied and I think I can't remember who actually appoints them but they're appointed for like 14-year terms so these are generally incredibly smart people that are very thoughtful and they really care about the law but I think on this issue maybe some people think that the bankruptcy code is like too far behind where people are on privacy issues I mean my problem is is like as a bankruptcy Nur like some of the arguments are just so poorly like just articulated like they don't even try to follow the code they're just like your honor we want the relief like because I said so and because this is the court of equity 105 your honor 105's in section management code it's like kind of like throwing up the Hail Mary like when the judge he doesn't like you in your arguments you're just like 105 your honor like it's like just saying like there's a court of equity and you can do whatever you know you think is Equitable basically that's not expressly prohibited and that that's what 105 says of the Mexico and I just felt like the debtor didn't even try to put on an evident you're hearing for why they met the standard of one of 107 and it was just like guys like you're not even gonna try like you know and honestly in Celsius I think the reason they got that opinion from Judge Glenn that they did was because I think it was Kirkland Kirkland did a really bad job articulating if there was really imminent harm because they basically switched first they said it was business competitive reasons in their first papers then when the judge was like I don't like this argument this doesn't make any sense to me like you gotta explain this more to me instead of explaining it in front of him they just switched the next hearing they continue the hearing they just switched and said imminent harm and the judge was like but I don't get it like one guy like two years ago has held up at gunpoint like he's not even a credit in this case what are you talking about yes isn't the whole point is they don't have their keys so how would someone hold you up a gunpoint for your keys like you don't have your keys you have a claim like that's the whole point of like why you're in this mess you had a C5 account somewhere so I think the judge will still Grant it though because he was he was you know judges do this they sort of like kind of let you know where their head is by the questions they ask and things like that and just their demeanor he basically said like come back with more evidence I'll probably give you 107. I mean he didn't say that but he basically said okay okay all right so let's talk about the 3C liquidation for a moment co-founder Kyle Davies recently tweeted we and other creditors of 3ac are frustrated with the current bankruptcy process ongoing costs are high assets are not being thoughtfully handled inter-credit or disputes are delaying the process and the estate value is not being maximized do you think there are merits to his claims oh that's a heavily loaded question I don't know enough about what Russell who's the one of the Liquidators from teneo for three ACS is doing I think there's another guy named Chris farmer Maybe anyway I'm sure they're doing an okay job um but there's nothing wrong with creditors expressing uh their opinions if you are in a U.S bankruptcy court talk about transparency this would all be through motion papers but it sounds like from those tweets that there's a lot of backroom discussion about what someone's doing what someone's not doing why they aren't doing this why they're doing that generally I mean that does go on in U.S bankruptcies as well but there's a lot of motion practice so you will see the papers on the docket you'll see like this ad hoc committee doesn't like what the debtor is doing or what the UCC is doing or the UCC doesn't like what the debtor is doing but you normally see that in three C's because we have no disclosure it's all going on down to the BVI the Liquidator is basically doing whatever he wants and you don't have a ton of disclosure about what he's doing and they're probably frustrated at that process as well because I understand that they're looking into you know like all these cases they're going to be looking at a pre-petition activity so you know the posture of some of these State professionals is not always going to be so kind pre-petition actors and that can be frustrating so I don't know that much about it other than sounds like they're they're frustrated all right we're gonna keep talking about 3ac um in a bit but I actually also now just want to bring up Genesis because at this moment in time it seems likely that Genesis will have to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy and as I mentioned earlier we're recording on Wednesday January 11th and I'm saying this right now because in case Genesis files before this episode comes out next Tuesday now you know why we are not discussing that bankruptcy filing you know assuming that they file it'll be a mix of retail and institutional creditors the retail primarily from this Gemini earned situation and I wondered if you could just talk about how people should expect the institutional versus Gemini earned creditors would be prioritized retreated we don't know yet because we haven't seen the Gemini contract if someone sees a Gemini contract with Genesis send it I'd love to see it but I haven't actually seen it when you read the Gemini terms of service I just happen to randomly read them sometimes uh no someone sent them to me asking me what I thought and I said yeah these are General these are clearly if you're if you are a Gemini earned customer you are a general unsecured creditor that's what the terms of service say in my opinion and then now but it does say that Gemini when they lend out your your stuff can sometimes get security interest and will you know do its best efforts to you know to protect our you know our customers when we're lending stuff out so it's possible that gemiini does have some collateral security interest or whatnot in the Genesis you know sort of loan that they gave out so so that's how that sort of plays out so you are unsecured but the person that let your stuff out might be secured so let's hope so but we haven't seen that uh the winklevies haven't published that unless I've missed it somewhere so if somebody has it send it to me I assume they have some security interest but there's probably more exposure than a full repay or I think they wouldn't be on Twitter um you know basically trying to pass the buck okay and so 3ac meanwhile has also been insinuating that they were misled about gbtc and I wondered you know what you thought there how you thought their claims might play out in a Genesis bankruptcy so these are now all intertwined right we can link Gemini the Genesis and Genesis the three ACS because they're a huge creditor um I think it was reported to have over a billion dollar claim uh I think a billion billion two something like that if there's rumors going on about the management of gbtc in this instance which we should say is is grayscale which is owned by a dcg which is also the owner of Genesis right and I think one of the issues was Affiliated transactions where um Genesis was potentially lending people money on gbtc shares which then they would buy DBT series than which they would pledge with Genesis which then give them loans and it would go circular um which are affiliated transactions whether it's illegal or unethical or breaking any rules I don't actually know I'm not a security lawyer but if that's the case it could potentially hurt their claim the three AC's case because they would be able to offset you know three arrows would probably bring an action to be to reduce or offset that claim and if that were the case of course that flows through the Genesis recovery which then flows through to the Gemini earn account holders recovery potentially wow okay like reducing it essentially full contagion is Among Us oh my gosh yeah well just to throw one other in the mix um you know Genesis is his two biggest borrowers were Alameda and 3ac and uh I guess all three of them will be in bankruptcy so just talk about I just can't even imagine how all that will to have all three of them in bankruptcy and then yeah can can you talk about how that will work I'll just say a number of bankruptcy professionals been buying beach houses after all this is over there gainfully employed for the next couple years you know in all seriousness yeah I mean there will be interactions between the states one of the nice things probably about Estates is like no one's getting 100 cents on the dollar they have the ability to negotiate these Estates and they can make deals and get things done um probably more efficient efficiently than you know Gemini and you know very like on Twitter like you know World War you know exchanging words that you know you know you can't you can't sort of What's the phrase you can't squeeze a rock or whatever like there's only so much if if there's not no juice left and once they're in chapter and they can negotiate with their creditors you know these states can can settle these things out so but yeah they'll they potentially all be in chapter I don't know if it wasn't I would file I don't really understand the earned product now this is a Gemini's business in general oh well I I don't know if Gemini would file it's it would be Genesis but I yeah I'm just a little bit confused because um you know they were lending to Alameda and 3ac but they're all in bankruptcy so then like I'm I'm sort of wondering like who has the final who gets who gets the funds in the end well it just all blows up right so like three ACS liquidates itself does distributions and that blows up and then you have this it's they're like nested they're almost like nested dockets in a way in a way right um and there are parts of dockets that are nested like Voyager has a three AC claim of about 600 million yeah because I thought it was 650. yeah yeah I was getting it mixed up with with self uses a priest he's claim they have like a 40 million dollars so those those cases are just nested and you have to wait for them to work out and it'll it'll it'll lengthen some of these cases out but there's no reason that especially under U.S bankruptcies where you can't do interim distributions and things like that okay all right well this has just been a Monster episode um I mean yeah there's been so much going on with all these different crypto bankruptcies clearly you're um having your moment in the Limelight because you know you started with this so long ago I don't know if you ever knew that this would become such a big thing now it's like it's just consuming that Industries my view was if crypto becomes an ecosystem you'll have restructuring Cycles it's the most volatile acid and like I can't think of a more volatile asset class okay well um clearly you've struck goals digital goals um well it's been such a pleasure having you on Unchained where can people learn more about you and your work I'm on Twitter and you can DM me generally open to polite DMS please save the hate mail and uh I guess it's just Thomas at 507 Capital if anyone ever wants to email me or just
