order your secure hardware wallet today today's topic is crypto economics which is easily one of my favourite things to think about in this face here to discuss this topic are Olaf Carlson we and Ryan zarur of polishing capital welcome Olaf and Ryan hey Laura thanks for having us hey Laura thanks for having us on and to talk about my favorite topic in the world crypto for this Jam thanks Ryan I'm glad that you're excited um so let's start with the basics what is crypto economics so for me crypto economics is the field that studies using tokenized representations of digital scarcity to incentivize a distributed network of actors and these actors usually contribute some valuable resource to a network and self-organizing in a specific way and then are remunerated for either the contribution of these resources or or pay for a specific resource on a network and that the simplest and first version of a crypto economic model is really the block reward in Bitcoin leading to a very secure Network for the users of Bitcoin and that's a really a key point because crypto economics typically either drives security on a decentralized network or accelerates Network effects and what we look for in crypto economics is typically one one of those two things or a combination of them yeah actually well that was gonna be my next question is what behaviors you're trying to incentivize or what problems you're trying to solve but are those really the only two or there are there other ones so there's a number of different like resources that could be that could be exchanged on on an open source network so it could be you know trust it could also be say computation or storage or basically anything else that we can bring say a distributed group of network actors together to to exchange in some sort of value and one of the things that we like to talk about here at the the poly chain office quite a bit is that the resources on on these decentralized networks that will be exchanged there are a number of different ones that we haven't even thought of yet and we're really excited about what could come up next so it's definitely not just security and and network effects among users it could it could be a range of different things yeah I think to date securing block chains has been by far the number one use case of crypto economic models I think looking into the future though you could imagine for example the contribution of intelligence leading to a sort of block reward rather than a kind of proof of work or proof of stake style block reward and so then you can instead of securing a block chain you could grow a pool of you know data say or a pool of you know people that are curating content and you could gather a group of people that are curating content in an intelligent manner so I think that going forward will actually see many more experimental types of crypto economic models that accomplish many different goals outside of just security of networks and then really we're also seeing the emergence of sort of crypto commodities right and again these this could be computation like it would which is represented by gassing on the etherium Network it could be storage for example with ipfs file coin any sort of on law important online resource you could essentially derive down into a crypto echo economic model and achieve greater levels of market efficiency for trading those resources this could be bandwidth it could be energy one day it could be you know essentially anything effectively where today we have a network and then on top of that network either an intermediary or maybe a very inefficient market that can that will be disrupted and will be made into a protocol that operates on a perfectly competitive and highly efficient market yeah that's something I wanted to ask about what's an example of where a crypto economics model makes sense or where one doesn't make sense and to my mind I've been thinking a lot about how tokens or crypto economic models only make sense in networks that are actually displacing middlemen so you can either have kind of like a centralized company like let's say a Facebook or you can have a decentralized or distributed network social network that's powered by tokens but that's why and and I I sort of hesitate to name names but there are some even really huge coins in the marketplace that it aim to somehow maintain middlemen and yet still have coins and those don't make sense to me am I thinking am I just missing something no I think in general peer-to-peer tokenized models are incompatible with centralized revenue extraction I just think it's too easy for an open source developer you know anyone anywhere in the world to really fork the network and remove the revenue extraction mechanism you could for example imagine an alternative Bitcoin where a company or or the founder of Bitcoin really tried to charge 1% transaction fee for every you know transaction in the Bitcoin network but this would be trivially easy for for anyone to sort of route around and not abide by that rule so I do think that in general combining a for-profit company that has revenue extraction and a peer-to-peer token model often often doesn't make sense yeah and I think there are only reason why some of these what we call rent-seeking tokens have not been forked out of their networks is because there just isn't enough sort of resources or developers building in the space right now but I think in relatively short order you will see some of these you know not very sensible token models that are effectively rent-seeking on top of their networks be forked out in that network be offered I'm free of that rent-seeking yeah so we'll see hopefully as the space develops we'll see some of these tokens that I think don't make sense get shaken out and hopefully the people who've bought them won't lose too much money so let's talk about actually these basic problems then like let's start with security how does crypto economics solve for security and by that I mean you know why don't you describe how proof of work works and some of the other consensus algorithms yeah so I think in a proof of work system really what what is happening is you're you're incentivizing rational for-profit actors who are really not behaving altruistic aliy in any manner who are just trying to receive block awards for hashing and in the case of proof of work those actors though who are performing those hashes are actually effectively adding security to the blockchain so that it becomes harder and harder the larger those block rewards get as the value of the underlying coin increases it becomes harder and harder to attack that network for for an adversary to kind of attack that network and alter that ledger so just by virtue of pure kind of rational selfishness these miners are actually in a sense providing a massive service to the users of a proof-of-work network now that is being paid for in a sense by the users through inflation right so it's not to say that it's free but the users of Bitcoin effectively paid the inflation rate to these block validators and in return you know can be sure that their transactions aren't going to be reversed at a later time and you and I have actually talked about this before but I just want to point out how you keep saying that they're not doing this altruistically and we've spoken before about how we we have had decentralized our peer-to-peer networks before before Bitcoin but those were ones where people operated them altruistically just out of the goodness of their heart where they you know put files on Napster or on the Tor network or whatever but they weren't being compensated and so this really was a breakthrough where you don't need for people to just decide to kind of make this charitable take this charitable action and instead they can be compensated just the way that you would if you were doing a job well I think the really interesting thing here is that when you add in incentivization and this is sort of the aha moment of crypto economics when you can add in incentivization you not only drive Network effects on these decentralized networks such that you know the amount of people willing to participate goes up quite expressively you accelerate these network effects like rocket fuel and you know this is really one of the great things about crypto economics is that using these digital incentives we can create you know a certain mass very quickly that are willing to contribute say you know computation or some kind of resource to it a network and you don't just rely on altruism but then you can also program in further incentives such that again security is delivered so that people won't say you know try to include transaction that are you know that are a double spend or or or some kind of transaction that shouldn't be there you you force people to sort of act but act honestly because of their own sort of economic self-interest and doing so I I would also say that it depends on the level of adversary you're dealing with so for example the Tor network which you mentioned Laura is a very breakthrough an innovative anonymity Network however I would argue that it is insecure against nation-state actors who are trying to you know decode kind of who's who's using that network and actually connect endpoints despite the fact that that packets are being encrypted and routed so to me if you were to build a sort of tokenized tor so to speak which wouldn't be that dissimilar from say the bitcoin network where users could effectively pay to use the Tor network in in the in the form of inflation that would go towards the nodes in the Tor network I would argue that if you designed successfully and like for example the project the orchid protocol is working on this that you'd actually get a much much more secure version of the Tor network and and I don't mean like a little bit more secure I mean like a hundred or a thousand times more secure because people are now doing this in in a kind of professional industrial scale and for profit right and this would replace all of the current nodes in the Tor network which are more kind of academic or experimental and they aren't really being done at scale and it doesn't provide sufficient defense against a really sophisticated adversary yeah so not not only greater security but also greater performance than what we see today on tor interesting and just out of curiosity did you did you guys invest in orchid yes we did okay because I have heard quite a lot of criticism also that project I don't want to get off into that tangent right now maybe I should explore that in a future episode but I have not explored it in any depth but I definitely know that there are some questions being raised about the viability of that but I do agree just like on an abstract level that of course when you have incentives you're gonna have direct economic incentives and that people are going to be much more motivated and there's just going to be a lot more activity and I think this goes to an earlier point that Ryan was making about this speed with which these networks can take off I mean we've seen it time and again you know if you look at the Dow if you look at the way I CEOs took off if you look at crypto kitties I mean there's just like what's so crazy to me about this whole space and Olaf you made this point in your speech at consensus last year is that I do think that because the incentives are much more direct than you would find in most other systems that I guess we partaken in the world that that is part of the reason why we're seeing this level of speed for a lot of these projects so to kind of keep going in this vein around security and talking about proof of work so I'm curious to know like what you guys think are the crypto economic differences between proof of work proof of stake delegated proof of stake and any other consensus algorithms you find interesting and as you described them if you could sort of define some of the new terms for the listener that would be great yeah so one of the major breakthrough consensus mechanisms that that we're very excited about is is the Definity consensus mechanism which is called threshold relay and so threshold relay uses a something called a BLS signature which is a cryptographic signature that was developed at Stanford and the the threshold relay in simple terms allows randomness to be natively generated within the block creation of the protocol and this this randomness allows you to randomly select the next block validator set from a massive potential validator pool so you have a pool of call it 500 potential validators and each block is validated by a small subset of those and it also selects what the next subset of validators will be in short this model allows for very very efficient block times so in the Definity system blocks take about one second to be created and because this is not probabilistic the way proof-of-work validation is is is probabilistic in nature you have finality in just two blocks so the equivalent you know kind of finality in Bitcoin would take an hour in aetherium you're looking at 17 second block sand maybe about 30 blocks for that level of finality whereas an in Definity this is just two seconds so this is the the type of improvement in the underlying consensus mechanism that's actually been enabled by cryptography that was literally invented since the creation of Bitcoin huh well actually I'm gonna ask about that so so I I understand something like proof of stake or proof of work where the probability that you'll get the next block reward is based on how much you've put in whether it's hash power or coins but in this case where it's random is there some way to you know kind of improve your chances of being then the one to add the next block so the that's the the brilliance of the design is there is in fact no way to kind of game that system again this is all experimental I you know I I don't want to make any guarantees about anything that hasn't been live and tested for for a few years but at this you know stage it appears that this kind of randomness is kind of true randomness and not cannot be gamed by that validator set but then does that remove the the incentive in some fashion to you know I mean well so you're as a validator though your profit is still quite predictable it just you know based on you know probabilities over a long time horizon it becomes very stable they obviously it's random on a block-by-block basis but over an entire day you know each of this say 500 validator should receive a pretty equivalent number of blocks and then there's sort of a second part to this with validation towers such that you know the subset that proposes the transactions in a specific block are randomly selected but then the validation through kind of validation tower height which is based on on sort of who owns what looks somewhat like the payout there would be somewhat more akin to who owns what it's similar improve mistakes so just to review them proof of stake effectively your level of confidence and say the transactions proposed by a given miner is is proportional to the amount that that miner has at stake if they're proven to be wrong and and thus are slashed so basically it's just an economic Nash equilibrium where you're not going to try to say stick in faulty transactions or double spins in an economic system that you're you know highly committed to and thus your stake is sort of the level of confidence that that the network has in what you're proposing that all that needs to be then paired with a sort of like a a challenge period where where others could can challenge in case somebody with a high amount of stake was were to still propose blocks or transactions that that are a double spend or or you know we're not supposed to be on the blockchain we skipped over like delegated proof of stake is that another one that you could discuss a little bit and what you think that's useful for yeah so I think delegated proof of stake is also significantly faster than a bitcoins proof of work however I think that delicated proof of stake runs a risk that's pretty well understood at this point of having a somewhat small pool of validators and and risks a sense of potential centralization and and thus censorship or control by endogenous parties to the network so to me delegated proof of stake you know it's similar to threshold relay is a continued area of research is very promising but I think that you know until these things are in the wild for many years it's hard to know the full implications of these decisions yeah and that's kind of similar to to say proof of authority so we delegated proof of stake you've got a group you know all of the token holders and a network that will sort of kind of delegate mining authority to a subset of miners and those are probably very professional miners that that are well structured to do that however that creates a certain amount of centralization similar to proof of authority where miners are chosen based on you know some selection criteria maybe they're like notaries or or maybe they have you know some kind of celebrity status and in that network and so they they're they're chosen as authorities and and thus trustworthy in that network but then the problem with that is that it's sort of orthogonal to the you know to the very culture of our space where it's you know giving power back to to some authority and it's not decentralized and and in the hands of each node on the network and so we tend to prefer you know a permissionless system an open network rather than say like some kind of proof of authority network it's somewhat similar to what we already have today in the world right yeah I think actually or some of these systems lead and this is maybe the point Olaf was making too is they lead a little bit toward oligarchy which doesn't feel very which is what we have kind of well yeah the thing is though that it's very tricky to predict how this will play out on a mass scale over many years so for example bitcoins proof-of-work which I think on paper is very much so a decentralized system in reality as we've seen play out in the market I think that I just a handful of mining pools dominate validation in the Bitcoin network and I think that kind of centralization that came with economies of scale of mining hardware and and power was very hard to foresee so to me you know we can predict as best we can but this is one of these interesting things about this area is that when it plays out in in the wild in an adversarial environment in the real market it can often be a bit different than than it was you know thought to be on paper yes and this will definitely be a continued area of research so we're gonna discuss governance and other issues but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors founded by Ed Stephens appreciate his billing the most valuable

Ryan zur of poly chain capital we were talking before about blog rewards and I know that was something you wanted to explore but I didn't know if we'd gotten to everything that you wanted to say about them well one thing you know we're very optimistic of the block award I like to say that you know we had this moment in in 2017 where where projects were selling kind of a majority of their tokens all at once in a in a crowdfunding moment and then with Wamba neighs Philo coin we saw what I call the return to the block award where Han prioritized fully 70% of his network over time to incentivize that network over time and we think that that was a very prudent move we like to see that in in other teams that there that the the reward the token is doled out over time to incentivize actors over the long run to contribute a specific like resource or a relevant activity on that network and what we're also seeing is the emergence of block rewards that can go to different actors in different ways so we're a network needs a combination of say software developers developing applications and you know miners confirming transactions and you know other other entities doing other things in contributing other resources you know the block award interesting way to approach the block who roared is to have governance that allows it to be doled out to these different constituents in these different value add groups in accordance with what is you know what is important or what is valuable for that social network or that you know that that network of nodes and so we're spending a lot of our time today jamming with projects on how to design their block award such that they bring together all of the different groups that they need to incentivize they've got you know a higher abstraction software developers building applications that they can also incentivize low-level protocol layer development well you know having security in transaction confirmation and different things and the block reward doesn't need to be just isolated to one group it you really should think very carefully about all of the different constituents in your network so you you can imagine a thought experiment where instead of 100 percent of block rewards going to validators our block validators and in that network you could imagine say 10 or 20 percent of that block reward going to a Treasury this could be a multi signature Treasury which could be managed sort of like a DES or decentralized autonomous organization where the token holders can actually vote on how that Treasury is spent so there's no reason you couldn't use the block reward to subsidize other types of activities outside of just a block validation which adds security to the network one thing that I you know would be very interesting to think about is suppose in Bitcoin if 50 percent of the block reward were paid to core developer contributions as determined by the community of users now there's some pretty difficult governance problems around voting and how that allocation is decided based on the community of coin holders but the hash rate of Bitcoin would be you know mathematically about 1/2 of what it is today which I don't think would materially alter the security of the network in a meaningful way but then you would have you know literally tens of millions of dollars sort of centralized treasury controlled by the decentralized network of users that could actually be allocated to core protocol developers to you know anything that could kind of increase the size of the network increase the reliability of the network increase the visibility of the network so this idea of a kind of decentralized you know Dao Treasury that could actually be used by the community to pay for things outside of just block validation is is a very interesting concept to me yeah I love that and just so I understand then those funds would be held in a smart contract and then there would be some function by which people would vote on how to dispense the funds yes exactly and it's like it would likely be a system of smart contracts you know what one would probably hold funds another would be a voting contract which could control uniquely control the actual contract that held the funds so it's it's not a simple architecture right and the security of such an architecture would obviously be paramount but it is the type of thing that I think we will start to see emerge so that you know funds can effectively be used by the community in ways that you know we've never seen that type of capital coordination built directly into a protocol and and I think it would be a very very interesting experiment to see play out and are there any particular tokens that you think are really interesting in this way so anything that is really focused on on chain governance is capable of creating such a system as this so you know systems that are working on are chain governance like Tasos and Definity I think are some of the most promising contenders there I do think that also polka-dot it's really interesting work coming out of that team on on chain governance but on chain governance is very difficult and we were still sort of researching and developing around security and and secure models for hunching governance because yeah the problem with you know I'm glad you brought up security Ryan because the there's not just a sort of network security of on chain governance there's there's a kind of like ways you can vote yourself into a black hole right you let you like vote for no more voting or you vote for you know giving all the tokens to like like for example you could imagine a network where 51% of the people or rather of the tokens voted to steal the tokens from the remaining 49% and granted to themselves but you know it was only good governance ya know and you know one would hope that you know the mark could react in such a way that there would actually be a net loss of value for that 51% that voted that way but these are the types of problems that are not really network problems they're they're more like game theory problems for how these voting and governance systems could play out so I do think we'll see some really really interesting experiments over the next few years I think some of which will succeed wildly and some of which will blow up you know in a large way well so how how do you try to prevent something like that could be because actually before we got into this topic one of the questions that I had for you was that if I think about kind of the pros and cons of on chain governance versus more like an ethereal more Bitcoin model my take on it is that obviously we've seen the pitfalls of off chain governance however with on chain governance that can be somewhat more easily engaged since people sort of know the thresholds they need to meet in order to affect some sort of change that they might want whereas with something like aetherium or Bitcoin where human judgment plays a bigger role and so governance is less predictable attackers can't just say to themselves oh here's what I need to do this is like the minimum necessary to push this decision to my advantage so like how do you prevent that kind of thing from happening so I I would say with respect to on chain governance yes it's difficult but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't move towards that so it is a more difficult goal to achieve but it's a very noble and I think it will be a very valuable goal once we get there now with that in mind it's important for projects to grandfather in governance over time and there are some checks and balances that you can put in place to help do that and we for example this is what we we did with Maker where the core team held sort of veto power on any decisions with respect to maker and and its development but they fostered this community of token holders that were very participatory so that once a week on Sunday mornings there's a governance call that all the major token holders participate in there's a kind of a culture of expectation that to be a major token holder in the network that you have to participate and have to be vocal and have to have to contribute and then this voting became sort of a natural process and then the whole community was also able to vet out over time that there is a threshold a sort of quorum of you know reasonably competent participants in that network such that they're you know there's confidence there that when maker migrates to fully on chain governance that there are a group of actors that understand the decision that they're making and that there's kind of a voting block that can prevent say negative things from from going through but again that needed to be developed over time through the culture of that network which I don't think we talked a lot about in our space but really it's it's an important element there and I think you'll probably see it in some of these other emerging governance platforms that there are some large token holders that are known entities that are you know sort of benevolent actors that will contribute to the network in a positive way and there's an expectation of that and they work together and coordinate such that attacking the network is then more difficult now that does unfortunately mean that sort of like the whales have a certain amount of power in that network but again I think the benefits of on chain governance and the speed that it will offer to it a network in evolution of it of itself of the network will dramatically away the drawbacks I just do my thing about that is then it doesn't sound it sounds quite centralized is this more like like is it just that these people have that their their weights are voted more heavily or it's right that their votes are weighted more heavily or you know I'm just trying to figure out because that just doesn't sound as decentralized as as I typically typically think of a decentralized network being sure but we just we just went you know discussed a few minutes ago how Bitcoin and and and also etherium have kind of consolidated around some you know some powerful nodes that do a lot of the the mining pair and so third it has been this migration towards some level of centralization decentralized consensus mechanisms do not necessarily mean radically decentralized consensus mechanisms there there's sort of a happy medium towards efficiency and evolution and and then on the other side sort of massive decentralization I think the more that you that you have participation and the more that you that you incentivize nodes to be positive contributors to a network the more that you know other people will start to onboard into that network and then over time again in this grandfathering process it will decentralize and you'll have say closer to democracy then you know plutocracy but at the same time because some of the early tests in governance have been total blow ups mostly because they haven't been able to get to quorum for even very obvious decisions I do think that kind of having this grandfathering process and in governance makes sense at the juncture that we're in and it's better than just throwing our hands up and saying well governance is hard so let's not do it let's just trust the dictator and when you see that there have been these blow-ups what examples are you thinking well the Dow is obviously the big the big one right like to not have voted in favor of the moratorium obviously was you know that was such an obvious decision but we couldn't get to the threshold to push that decision through because not enough token holders had had voted in in that moment even though at the time it was a frankly obvious decision and we that was because we didn't have the right tools to make it easy for token holders to vote there were obviously a certain threshold that were speculative asset holders and not you know active participants of that network and that that network in that moment would have benefited from say a minimum quorum of you know well capitalized benevolent actors that you know that that could push a reasonably non-controversial measure like the moratorium at that time through right I guess yeah I mean I I definitely see what you're saying and this actually leads us to another question I was gonna ask you which was whether or not you four on chained governance whether or not we really should be trusting people who are busy you know with their work and their families and everything to to make a decision on probably stuff that they haven't done research and and you know if I look at even just what governance is like here in the US and I see how you know I live in California where we're supposed to vote on all these referendums all the time every time I'm like oh my god I have no idea about these issues and I'm supposed to make this decision so I definitely see it you know I see what you're talking about but I also do think that yeah it's like a tightrope you know you don't want to go too far one way or the other well this is the beauty of crypto economics though right because when you add incentivization in then people get very interested very quickly and and I would argue that if you were paid a reasonable amount for you know for your votes and your subtract and and measured upon you know based on your contribution to your voting and in in California over the long term you would probably or maybe not you but a a threshold number of people would be very active and you know given the metrics of the wisdom of crowd and and the strong academic research in favor of that I would argue that you would that the crowd would arrive at you know good decisions you know probably more often than you know the benevolent dictator situation or or another you know political political model adding in that economic incentivization matters a lot and why wasn't the economic incentive there with the Dow because wouldn't they have had that incentives you know in order to preserve the value of their tokens so there was an incentive there and yet people still didn't do it so not well not necessarily right you need a couple of different things you need the access and the information right and so there wasn't the access and there wasn't and I you know for some people there wasn't the information and then you alternate the incentive to do the action right so people you know there is this sort of - equilibrium that went the wrong way where people are like oh other people who you know can run command line will we'll just do the voting and and the quorum will go through a sort of almost like drags it right and then like it happened and then you're like whoa wait a second look I have that that's actually not what I wanted kind of thing but like people were sort of lazy because they didn't receive direct benefit for that action so if you receive direct benefit for taking action then that's where again a crypto economic model can adequately incentivize the very strong governance one and what we're getting it is a larger issue around voting really being something that when you think about it from a game theoretical perspective in say the u.s. elections it's really quite rational to not vote at all because the probability that your individual vote will swing even to say a local election is extremely low and so you know it leads to a sort of tragedy at the common just our normal democratic system and it's why in part you see such low voter turnout even in in very important elections so to me one of the things that's so fascinating about this is that we move from designing democratic and voting systems using governments and nation states with extremely high stakes to using open source software systems and block chains which I think everyone can agree iterates at about a 1000 X speed to the development of nation state systems right so now you have open source developers all around the world actually designing the tip of the spear on what governance voting and incentive systems look like and so to me that the fact that we can move this to an offline world that's often a bit lower stakes and much much more experimental and open to experimentation is something that will have long lasting effects and I think we're going to see this in other ways with blockchains right so you know we're seeing this early say new financial instruments that are on chain so things using the the 0x protocol which is is sort of like a trade execution protocol in a smart contract on top of that we're seeing a Dharma which is a peer-to-peer loan system dy/dx which is a peer-to-peer options and derivatives system over time you know these are projects which are mimicking financial instruments from the offline world once these are all created in that blockchain smart contract environment will actually start to see the tip of the spear of novel financial instruments occurring in an open-source software development environment on blockchains instead of that occurring in the sort of traditional financialization that's kind of an inter you know calm a complex intertwining of Wall Street and the government and various regulatory bodies we're gonna see it evolve in in a global open-source software environment so to me the fact that we're pushing a lot of these very hard questions that actually are unsolved you know to it this open-source software development speed and and iterative ability is is one of the things that's so fascinating to me about this whole ecosystem so I actually want to go back to what we were discussing earlier where you were talking about how you could govern your way into a black hole how do you design a system to prevent that kind of thing from happening like if you are just you know as you mentioned there is just so many ways that these could blow up and everything is an experiment but obviously I'm sure as these teams are going about trying to design these projects they're trying their best to account for all the different I guess like fail failure scenarios so how how do you guys think about that when you're trying to help these teams develop their systems so as Ryan said I think it's important for things to start gradually you don't want to codify you know something that you're not sure if it actually works and and kind of vote yourself into a black hole but there are all sorts of things you can do so you know Ryan mentioned not reaching quorum if you don't reach quorum you can reduce the threshold which is required to get to a vote right programmatically so it's it's the type of thing where if you can you know see the problems before they happen you can continually iterate and codify around them the other thing is that voters can actually you know change the voting system right this again is is kind of tricky and an almost paradoxical because you have the people participating in that voting system voting to change the rules and thus their rights within that voting system which can again create like mixed incentives for certain participants in everything the main thing for me is that there be a number of experiments run and that we encourage kind of experimentation in this area and that over a long enough time horizon we will see what works and and continue to build on those core things that work and continue to experiment and iterate I don't think anyone today you know even those of us that spend a lot of our day thinking about this can really determine what is the exact best mechanism right now I think this will be an iterative process that takes a long time to determine but I also think that when it is figured out well you know I would say that i cos to date have been that the most efficient form of capital court nation we've seen since the development of capitalism itself you know 30 million dollars in 30 seconds is kind of unprecedented right and III think that if we can move to these systems launching voting and governance in an effective manner will actually see an even more efficient and a large-scale form of capital coordination beyond anything we've ever seen in the world well I wondered I also asked you about a couple of the governance mechanisms that get talked about a lot like Hugh turkey and liquid democracy can you just find those and also describe what you think of them yeah I mean what a lot of these come down to is on a very high level putting the vote to the market so you know in a system where you have token based voting those largest token holders you know it's literally kind of one token equals one vote which is a very different system than we have in say the us offline democracy that's one person one vote and the block chains though you don't really have this sense of personhood yet so to me you know I am very excited about experienced experiments like few Turkey where actually markets and effectively prediction markets can determine outcomes and so people have to sort of put their money where their mouth is so to speak and I think that you get much more honest assessments of positions you know a much more honest you know reveal of kind of my preferences when you ask me to actually bet on on the outcomes that I want so I very much am looking forward to kind of larger scale experiments of these systems and I think that there really is no clear answer though today about what what is going to work the best and are there any projects that are trying future key I think very wisely there are not any projects that that that I can think of off the top of my head that are going to implement future key in like their first iteration of governance however it's often of footnote that you'll see in many white papers that like governance will eventually move towards a future key model that's specifically you know having essentially a prediction market be that the governance mechanism is something that that needs a thorough amount of research and experimentation because it can create essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy where if you like rally enough people around a specific concept and they're sort of like all betting towards that concept and then you can kind of in some in some certain decisions and in some instances you can kind of like bring it into being and that could go the wrong way and you know because we don't have a lot of a lot of experimentation around prediction markets to date but we're on the cusp of seeing number of different prediction markets be live in that scale I think you know in very short order we will see a lot of projects move their governance towards towards a future key model I know a lot of people are excited about it I also wanted to discuss icos which Olaf had mentioned obviously there have been a number of kind of maybe less than savory outcomes we've seen in the ICS fees and maybe incentives aren't always aligned in such a way as people might like to see you know to incentivize the developers to actually build a network once they've raised all this money so what kinds of governance do you think you can bacon or crypto economics can you bake in to the way I SEOs are being done now in order to improve the incentive there well I think one of the things I mentioned earlier is just sort of favoring a block award that incentives Rises the network over time that's the only one so having an IC o---- that's only a minority of the tokens are not a very significant component of the tokens and then raising only enough to get the network live so that the distributed network will have enough sort of tokens left over to incentivize resource allocation by individuals over over the long term that's sort of one easy one yeah I think there's also just some basic stuff that exists in a pre blockchain world for a reason like for example vesting which is just you know that the creators of these block chains should should kind of dedicate to a lock up so that they're in it for the long term I think that makes a lot of sense though you know I think a lot of the kind of kind of wild-west we see in the ICO markets as a result of the fact that in block chains you know you really give financial sovereignty to everyone and I think that not everyone is totally used to that kind of you know power and so I I think that when you give financial sovereignty to everyone there's like a flip side to that coin which is that we see a lot of fundraising and contributions and investments that as an outsider don't make a lot of sense yeah so I think that there's a flip side when you know to everything when you give everyone free speech say you know people say unsavory things one other thing I was wondering about cuz you guys haven't raised this but obviously you are investors and I know the way that you invest is a little bit more of a venture style where you really work with the teams to try to ensure their success but I've seen a lot of different analyses that look at how you can design a crypto economic system to keep the value of the token from plummeting towards zero as the velocity or the usage and therefore the turnover the tokens Rises so is that something that you guys think about and if so what do you think are some good designs to keep the value that token rising along with usage of the network so I think what you're referring to is the MVP equals peak you kind of on a monetary equation yeah well I think that can maybe usefully inform a way to think about token values I think we're dealing with a totally new asset class and it is incomplete to use that sort of valuation model that again is you know I think it's struggling to take an old system of thinking and attach it to the current things and innovations we're seeing in cryptocurrencies and I don't think it's the full picture so every kind of valuation model that I've seen I really applaud those that are working towards coming up with something that that makes sense but I also think you need to think about this from a kind of first principles perspective without being too caught looking in the rearview mirror it at equations that have worked for historical movements historical assets and apply them you know too aggressively to this new area which is frankly just a completely new asset class so for example you know some people are of the opinion that lowering the velocity of money on these networks thus increases the value of the token and so there you don't come in with lot longer staking lockups and and things like that but in a reality in the in the nature of our space and and these networks you could think of it totally counter intuitively as well and say the increase in the value of tokens means that you're increasing transaction throughput which is that actually network effects which means that the network itself is is increasing in usefulness and and so again you know just exemplifying loss point and further to that I'm not sure that we have arrived at a and true in all senses equation for valuing tokens or valuing these networks and and again you know we support experimentation and and continue to be open-minded about how to approach these networks well I mean when you're helping teams design these systems do you guys think at all about how to inflate the the money supply or whether to cap it or or things like that and and if so how do you make those decisions so for I mean it really depends on it's a case-by-case basis so when we bring in projects and jam on crypto economics it's important to note and to remember that a good crypto economic model requires you know computer scientists an economist and behavioral psychologists and you know math and game theory experts and it's really this amazing field because it's the combination of so many different fields and so depending on a resource in question that's being traded on the network depending on the nature of that network depending on whether save velocity is a desirable thing on that network or whether or whether you're you're you're trying to say maximize psychological ownership of the of the token or that network and so locking it up makes makes more sense you know will design it will help design a system that that sort of makes sense for that specific network I mean the capping or or uncapping will usually be the result of a number of different variables that they're very particular to what you're trying to achieve what you know whether it's trust or whether it's exchange of value or whether it's exchange of a resource you know again how you approach each one of those would be different and the crypto economic model there would also be different and needs input from all these disparate fields and we're running out of time but one other thing I wanted to ask you about an Olaf knows that this is something I have been curious about I feel like every time we've seen sort of a really big decision that needed to be made and people had entrenched views on either side there's been a fork so I just wonder for all the talk of Unchained governance how do you prevent there just being a ton of forks all the time like I feel like if you end up with some system where there's kind of a lot of voting going on about a lot of different changes and there's a few every so often where people just feel super passionate about it and they just decide to fork then we're just gonna end up with all these split coins but Olaf didn't agree with that and I'm curious to just hear your opinion on how you disincentivize that and keep everything on one chain yeah so you know I think that in a democratic or voting system people tend to accept that if the system is designed correctly they will accept the outcomes even if it was not their preference so for example if the President of the United States that is elected is not the candidate I voted for it doesn't mean I leave the the United States it often just means I that in this case I was in the minority of voters and there really was a preference you know that wasn't mine that actually represented the most people so to me if you can if you're if you're buying a token on a blockchain that has on chain voting and governance you should also be buying into the fact that when you are the minority voter that you accept the outcome of that vote as legitimate even if it was not your preference it is not to say that this will stop Forks right but I do think there is more of an understanding that you will not you know have the outcome that you always want but you still accept the legitimacy of the of the overarching system yeah we'll see I think the place where I disagree with you slightly and maybe it's just that we're on different places on a spectrum is that I feel like when an open source system you can so much more easily leave whereas obviously if you live in he was like like you kind of have to upend your life to protest the outcome of an 11 election so it's quite a different thing but I guess we'll find out what what ends up happening is there anything else they didn't ask you guys about capturing Atomics that you want to mention one thing that I'm observing and we're starting to jam on here at the office and and do some research on is is really the power of the psychological effect in crypto economic systems and this has come up very recently with respect to make her and the die so as eath went down quite precipitously over the last few months if there were some some instances where one would have expected the die to become unpaid and adjust downward at least moderately from you know from the one you US dollar value that it is and in fact it is main maintain stability remarkably well even though it's still today just the single collateral which is eath and we're starting to kind of think around you know just the psychological effect there that people have decided that die is is is a dollar and even though you know the metrics in certain moments would have indicated that that it should be adjusted down slightly because there is there was a certain blacks want risk now again just a caveat the black so on risk will will will would be reduced when it's a basket of underlying collateral unfortunately today it's still not a basket of under line collateral but even in this incipient moment we have stability and we only have stability because of the psychological effect that the market has deemed it to be one dollar and I find that incredibly fascinating and again it calls into attention the fact that strong economic crypto economic models are a combination of you know economics behavioral economics behavioral psychology computer science security game theory math and so on this for me is what makes this field the most interesting on the planet is this combination of these otherwise disparate fields in a new way that is so fascinating and has such an amazing effect on large groups of people who you know otherwise have no interest or no commonality amongst themselves globally and and it's just it's happening it's such an accelerated rate I find myself often saying that we are innovating in the field of economics more in the next 24 months that have happened in the last 24 years and that for me is just incredible I agree Oh laughs did you want to add anything no just thanks for having us in the podcast Laura yeah I mean congratulations on on all the success with this this new podcast it was expected and we're you know we're just so excited about all your success here thank you well this has been such a great conversation and I would like to have you back because I'm sure in just a few months time there will be much more to discuss on this same topic but before we go we're compete get in touch with you or learn about poly chain I think if you go to our website you can get about as much information as we have out there which is poly chain capital alright it's like three sentences or something but we you know we are hiring for a variety of roles so if you're interested and listening feel free to reach out great okay yeah there is a one link to a jobs board and and you can also reach out to careers at poly chain capital we are hiring both for internal functions as well as a number of functions around our portfolio so if you are active in any of the fields that I I just mentioned you know and excited about what's happening in in our space and in in crypto economics please feel free to reach out unanimously across our portfolio projects are looking for talented people to come and help them in and again in a variety of fields not not just computer scientists great and as I've said before not on the podcast but on the web this whole field is full of people who were doing something else before so don't necessarily think that you don't have experience because basically none of us have experience okay so thanks guys for coming on the show
