not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day we're doing a special Late Night episode it is midnight here and we're all very tired uh but we didn't have an episode for The Chopping Block this week and so we thought we would record something for you where's up we've got Tom the defy Maven and master of memes actually got Robert Victor connoisseur and captain of compound and we've got to ruin the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and you got myself a masib I'm the head height man of dragonfly so we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advised legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block that XYZ more disclosures so we're coming at you late at night how are you guys doing on this uh very late very well I'm a long time listener first time caller just really excited to be here and chop it up I just hope Tyrion gets his pizza I'm worried about him and his stomach that's kind of my big I uh I I did I did dye my hair at least one of the colors that won the pull so which color won the pole well first of all half of my head was shaved that's true there was one that shave it off there was one that shave it off once orange or green one I forget which one so I I had both so it's a strong Choice it's very nice it's Max Cypher Punk right now yeah I'm glad that you're deferring to The Chopping Block Dao unlike Barbershop you've learned you've learned a lesson about unchain governance which is very good to see I don't want Gary coming after me I know yeah that's right well so okay so this week the news this week is all about regulation and legal stuff and Congress and people yelling at other people for being securities honestly it's all kind of boring and we were talking about like hey do we have to do another episode about more kind of legal naysaying like there's nothing that important that happened this week and so and we're also pretty tired um it's just been a pretty grueling week as well and so we thought maybe we'll shake it up today and try a little bit of uh variation and format so instead of just rattling off the news and giving you vague opinions about them uh we decided instead we're gonna try something different so Tom what's on what's on the menu tonight so this is actually inspired by a tweet by hildabby uh who is our data scientist here at dragonfly where he had a nice little Dune chart but with some of the key information such as the title scrubbed out and guess people just guess what the chart was and so we're gonna play a little guess that chart right now um so apologies to any audio listeners will try to get some nice uh descriptions of what the chart to pick so are you guys ready do you guys know what Geo guesser is I've been following yeah of course of course yeah we're basically this is this is the on-chain geoguessr a little bit for anyone listening Tom has the charts haseeb tarun and I do not know what chart he's about to put on the screen all right um let me see if I can describe this chart so the chart uh oh this is transaction fees per chain you're so confident okay okay so the chart is um it starts at January 2020 and it like shoots up basically up through July 2021 and it comes down quite a bit in January 2022 comes down again in the summer and then like kind of hits a local bottom around beginner 2023 and then starts going back up again the biggest contributor is ethereum by far then there's b b chain then polygon and Arbitron and avalanchinosis optimism and there's like tiny tiny little contributions from everything that's not ethereum right and the key thing here is that okay so I I've read too quickly I I was trying to do geo guesser style um I am not rainbow it's been black and white and it's pixelated so you might not be able to so the y-axis it goes up to 1B and halfway up there's 500 M so we're going with like 1 billion 500 million all the different chains are shown but ethereum is like 99 of this chart and there's like a little bit of activity from like but it's basically a chart of ethereum yeah last time okay something that daily maxes out at a billion and now is somewhere around 250 million could it also be stable coin volume I think it's way higher than that like no because there's no Tron on here Tron Tron is yeah do you guys want a a hint no no hints no hits if we don't get it in one minute you're gonna explain this to us but at the end you're gonna educate the listeners on why this chart's interesting yeah I like that because you picked it out I'm gonna guess that it's transaction fees that was my first guess and I know I'm wrong there's no way that there's a billion of transaction fees a day yeah that doesn't seem right uh total fees paid Maybe I don't know um that doesn't seem too high yeah total is it maybe it's issuance no a billion issues a day that doesn't make any sense yeah could it be like native assets moved like the value of the Native uh like the value of each value of B and B value of polygon move per day bad investment decisions per day I mean that billion a day must be anchored then yeah yeah that's uh that's the peak uh no your time is a bit off to ruin you gotta you gotta look at the time series uh down here you sure no hints all right give us a hand give us we're clearly waiting it is a TV element trick a TV Elementor daily per chain Bridge activity maybe per day bridging in ass is bridged in pretend Bridge tvl metric uh Evo metric maybe like borrows like daily borrows borrows and no that's that Bar's gotta be less than that yeah all right I I formally concede and give up on this one any last last guess go for it all right what do we got Puzzle Master stumped us this is this is this is again this is hildabby this is tornado cash tvl by Chain you see that big drop in August uh when the sanctions hit so we do come back to regulation a little bit sorry and then uh these other chains so sort of popping off it obviously it's highly correlated with the price of ether um but you kind of see you know it's like ethereally per chain really threw us off the daily per chain really guys tvl and daily don't go together that was that is true yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna give this feedback so actually one interesting question to me is where is the BNB Bridge hack what do you remember when that was because like I'm curious if if you notice the BNB percentage is going up toward the last yeah I'm wondering if like the BNB Bridge hacker is part of the reason for that well the BNB part also does look pretty stable actually as I think it was just like that's when BNB launched because initially it was ethereum only it doesn't look like BNB grew or changed that might grew a little bit I think after July after the sanctions hit but uh overall it's like it's I think around the same slice that's natural though right because like the BNB deployment was not sanctioned but the ethereum deployment was which doesn't really make a lot of sense so oh true yeah well I didn't think about that it's the only legal place where you can interact with tornado caches on BNB Channel legally yeah sure if not it's not not illegal or it's not not legal yeah okay understood ofac loves binance yeah yeah I think they're trying to Advantage foreign actors answer it so there we go that was one uh you guys want to do another one was that that's too painful Let's do let's do one more I'm sure the audio listeners are loving this by the way this is like a very audio friendly format there's gonna be a lot of editing for this yeah hide your private Keto yeah you know there's a big there's a big hat going around yeah should we talk about it can we talk about the The Ledger ad the chain thing oh yeah where Ledger is telling you to buy a new jewelry necklace and hang your Ledger yeah that might be the greatest Gorilla Marketing ever okay what are we looking at this is a Time series with a bunch of layer ones on them from January 2022 to April 2023 yes we have uh Arbitron Stark net optimism Loop ring Aztec connect polygons evm ZK sync light ZK sync era and then trendwise it's kind of neck and neck arbitrum and optimism you know both hovering around this in in aggregate about 2k um each contributing about you know 1 000 kind of dips during summer of 2022 and then going into 2023 uh uh start going again Arboretum growing a little bit more and uh some of these other layer twos uh contributing more to the pie exceeding 3K in March and April 2023. all right so this looks like a tvl of layer 2's chart except the units are off right the units go from zero to three thousand that's correct maybe it's like tvl and ether turn he's like ether number number of number of contracts deployed yeah or daily users no the daily user is higher than this right so yeah that's too low for daily yeah 3000 is definitely a lot more than three thousand dollars also there's a lot of activity in the most recent month on ZK sync well zika Singh grew and TBL a lot so they're like 50 minutes that's also where all the uh the like uh people are trying to airdrop Farm the most oh speculative air drop yeah speculative airdrop farming yeah it looks very proportional to TDL so there's something that is feeling correlated with tvl but is very different units hmm active developers GitHub activities you can't track that on dude are you tracking that on Dune all right all right that's that's a good argument good meta argument there you go there you go um the only reason I'm not sure about whether this is total amount of eth is that not all of these chains pay gas and eth if I remember correctly right now it can't be but they got to be moving they can be rapping yeah spread keep pulling that thread keep pulling that thread pull the thread uh this is like a chart murder mystery that's unfolding for our audience in real time I'm like the dungeon master right now yeah that's good and see what happens is it inflows maybe it's like monthly inflows because all these I mean I think that numbers have been going up basically pretty continuously but no that doesn't make any sense because uh maybe it does September 22 is sort of like the bottom of this chart all the Solana tvl clearly moved here wherever whatever this is because like okay so 1K ether is like a million dollars like that is not it's small right so like what is this 1K thing is it bridge in Events maybe no that's too small I kind I do kind of like this new contracts deployed or number of contracts interacted with or something there's that that like kind of could be in this range contrast deploy does make sense unique contracts maybe unique touch contracts touched contracts yeah you can yeah you can count which contracts were touched and maybe this is Bridge contract like I was gonna make a joke about where Turin touched the contract but it's not funny all right I'm gonna go final answer you need contracts interact with per month my guess is going to be number of contracts deployed per month my joke guess because I sort of thinks it's one of the Wilder too is a number of rug pulls per month that is correct Tarin it's number of rug pulls per month no it's uh cost of publishing transaction data to a layer one or two per month what wait what I was thinking along those lines but I was like I don't know if they would actually be able to get that oh the total price paid in aggregate yeah of posting call data to layer one over that month right right I see I see I see okay so that's actually quite interesting are we saying Celestia is going to be making getting to a uh three million run rate per month right for the same amount of demand just to get the Benchmark numbers right now because it's actually kind of interesting if you go back I think it's about a thousand on Arbitron garbage rooms paying about what two million dollars a month to post call data optimism right now it's 1800 so it's almost four mil oh okay so closer to four mil per month optimism is about a thousand so it's about two mil and starknet darknet 93 if so that's like what 100K or something or 20K um yeah okay CJ sync is at uh by the way we should we should maybe explain what what this payments are for layer twos have some State Management that they have to do in the layer one the sequencer who's managing the state of lawyer 2 has to post storage calls and other type of calls if there's a fraud proof but there's not in any of these and uh so that's what azeb was referring to is call data is sort of the data that they have to post it's kind of interesting that ZK sync had like such high State like cost growth relative to polygon a polygon still has very low usage I think yeah I think they're EPL is like 30 million or something compared to the case things like 250 million but I mean everything all these are like super young still here's a trivia question for you if all of these l2s are spending about 3 000 ether a month on the L1 ethereum what do you think the total ether spent in transactions on the L1 would be in the absence of all these ltos the question like how much are they siphoning demand from the layer one yeah I kind of believe in like the induced demand Theory where it's like a lot of the [ __ ] that's happening in layer twos is like goofy like nft stuff for people that like would probably not happen you know on on ethereum today at these gas prices and so it's like you you actually just capture this new market that would just would be priced out otherwise it can't be that there's nothing siphon but there obviously is some you know new activity that is only that only makes sense at a lower price point of course it's funny I was getting an argument with cost money about this over telegram which is always the best place to have arguments he's a big Layer Two token bull short eth yes he was making this big argument that like the the trade to do is to go go long the l2s and go short ether and he thinks like the l2s are going to siphon all this but they're going to suck up all the value because ultimately they're closer to the user and users are going to interact more with l2s and basically like eth like the floors is gonna drop out from under it because uh it's ultimately the l2s that are going to be valuable because they're directly user facing and they own the applications I thought this was kind of nonsense and so my Counterpoint to this well first of all I'm curious does that hold any valence for you guys this idea that the layer twos are actually potentially going to accrue more value than the low one if like that's where the applications live that's what all the users interact with it's possible I mean you know I'm not gonna say that his theory is automatically a good one but if the applications are living on the l2s and to Tom's point you can have applications that couldn't exist on the l1s then there'll probably be a lot of value according to the L2 but is it stealing value from the L1 is it adding more usage and importance to the L1 idle now I mean with the switch to you know full proof of stake you could also argue the exact opposite is that the L1 is the economic security for all of the l2s and it will be significantly larger another thing to uh consider here is the main layer ones themselves are actually quite worried about this and there's been a bunch of designs of things where the the fees from the L2 flow back more to the L1 so there's a thing called a base to roll up from Justin Drake and the idea is basically to have some Revenue share between the L1 in each case and the l2s um and sort of like trying to force that so it is interesting that peop you know there there are some of the eth researchers are actually sort of in the samani camp that the the L1 needs to get some revenue from Neil too I would say that if you believe that's true right if you believe the l2s are siphoning value from the letter one then that means you should it sort of implies that you should also believe that lightning makes Bitcoin less valuable because lightning is ultimately siphoning transaction fees from the letter one it's got the same kind of substitute or substitution effect which makes Bitcoin less valuable that would be true if Bitcoin had transaction fees yeah I was about to say assuming yes but it's supposed to right it does and ultimately like Bitcoin is used to pay fees with but you don't really use it for like data availability in the dynamically posted manner like you do with ethereum right like lightning transactions are like I do a you know a time lock at one point and I close a time like another Point everything stays off chain it's on there's not as much like Dynamic State updating I mean there's basically none there's like two utfs sure but it is in the end siphoning demand for layer 1 transactions right like otherwise you'd be directly transacting on bitcoin if you couldn't use lightning to settle Bitcoin that hasn't been bitcoin's problem for years though that is I agree I agree look I'm not arguing that's a bitcoin's problem but I am saying that if you are going to be consistent with that view that a substitution effect for demand for transactions lowers the value of the underlying layer one then you should believe that lightning drives down the value of Bitcoin and that doesn't seem plausible to me the other thing of course that on these layer twos ether in its sort of cash flow element which is just you know how much ether gets burned because of transaction fees only one but then there's also the element of ether as a form of money which I would argue today is where the Lion's Share of its value comes from is because the transaction fees demonstrably are not that big and on the l2s like eat this money on all the l2s eth is what everyone uses people don't use rat Bitcoin they don't use you know ARB token on the layer twos as their foreign money they use ether and so if anything these are authorized economies that are actually expanding the universe through which ether is used right in the same way like look there are many ways to make the dollar valuable one way is to grow the GDP of the US economy in other ways increase the tax rate another way is to get other people to use dollars do you think eth held on layer twos as like a euro dollar it's sort of like yes totally it's a great analogy that's a great analogy yes but only if the time and cost bridge is full of friction if it's literally extremely low friction to move ether in and out then it's the same asset I agree with the seems bigger Point here which is like if you think about what factors go into either value today it's like 95 99 this moneyness and then like a small percentage sort of the transaction fees and the burn and you know a lot of the economics that go into it and it's like you know crypto people always sort of fall for this oh well like this asset has these flows and like let's do like a discounted cash flow analysis and it's like maybe that's true for a very small number of assets but for the most part it's it's with this other thing I mean one question and I was talking about this with a bunch of people working on who believe in the like there will be five million Roll-Ups world how does the user end up managing the ux for this like none of the wallets that exist can really handle multi robot UPS right now at all like it's so clunky right you're like going in changing rpcs some of them make you pay gas and Native tokens some make you pay an ease some you know like that part is still very confusing to me and that's where I kind of can agree with the Solana Maxis is like the ux is much easier and monolithic yeah this is not a dunk on Cosmos but I personally find the cosmos ecosystem ux with multiple different chains to be like literally impossible as a user I think to tarun's point if you have you know a thousand l2s it's going to be the same user experience where it's like yes it's possible to move between any two of them and like all of these things but you know what wallet software is going to make this easy and intuitive and like how are you going to do it like it's already hard like my network drop down you know just on the evm chains in metamask is like too long and if you think about it there's like you know in Venture Land there have been sort of tens of companies founded for doing roll up as a service so that developers can start their own roll up like the way they start an Amazon web service great you can make your own blockchain easily but then it's like no one is really funding like wallets focused or like even just like some layer for for making it easy for the end user so I think that's going to be a big thing now part of the reason I I totally agree with you Sharon we actually we funded a company recently called Caldera that does exactly this does like their twos of service the difficulty like you said is that getting a bunch of layer twos up and running now it's kind of doable we have the open source stack obviously optimism is today the kind of hot snack du jour that people are using but actually managing assets across the kajillion chains like super sucks and of course they're you know we just had uh tax day in the U.S very recently and obviously like if you're trying to pay taxes across Assets in like 16 different ecosystems it's it's horrendous task much less just being able to manage your own assets across all of them and so I do think that that at some point when the landscape settles down and the number of stacks settles down they're definitely going to be software solutions that pop up that start to get smarter about managing your assets what you pay gas with meta transactions across different chains like consolidating assets for you and also helping and making it easier to do accounting across all your different chains that stuff will come up as the kind of space of chains stabilizes or the number of stacks stabilizes but right now there's still like super high flux and so anybody who's like okay I know exactly what I want to build for I think people still don't know like it's still very much a moving Target a lot of people are like okay well Salon is winning I better build a bunch of tools for Solana uh or other people were like oh well you know Cosmos seems to be taking over the world I should build for Cosmos chains and not Roll-Ups of the thing it's like okay should I build this tooling for Roll-Ups um I think if you give it a couple years we're going to see some stabilization in the chains that people use and like less turnover in the top 10 chains by tvl but over the last couple years it's been so volatile like I don't know how you would know what to work on my suspicion is that there will be a lot of venture funding going into the moving up the stack like you know there's been so much money focused on infrastructure in the last 12 months and like people are going to be like oh [ __ ] we actually need to really fund like the basic you know new wallets and stuff like that instead of because like it doesn't feel like the existing wallets are willing to change their experience enough to handle this type of World part of it is fear too right like the deeper you get into the guts of making decisions on behalf of users the more risk there is for mistakes for hacks there's just more surface area to like mess things up I mean there was all this news this week about like really crazy hacks that nobody seems to know where they're coming from uh Taylor Monahan was on the show recently was talking about this like crazy web of old addresses that don't seem to have any uh sensible connections to each other many of which were super sophisticated quote unquote cold wallet quote unquote addresses that have been just getting sweeped by the same attacker I've been getting more paranoid over the last it's like last month I guess I don't know if you guys are feeling similarly but more and more I just get paranoid about like uh I don't know attackers are getting better and smarter and more sophisticated than uh than before well they absolutely are I mean you know the underlying technology of security is not improving but there's more sophistication outside that is improving we were joking around about you know Ledger putting a really stupid ad on Twitter of like buy the necklace keychain for your like crypto Hardware wallet and that's like you know obviously like security moving backwards but like Security in my mind is moving flat and there's more sophistication around how to break security every single month and I think a lot of it falls you know like is rooted in human error in a lot of places and I think a lot of it's in like you know exposing zero days so to speak but you know I definitely think that over time security is not fundamentally improving there's not enough work spent on fundamentally improving the security architecture of crypto I also think that large language models are going to be really good at attacking contracts and they're going to be like I think the advantage the natural advantage to attack versus defense is going to grow with large language models because I think it's a lot easier for a large language model to find a vulnerability than it is for a large language model to fix a vulnerability finally the cardano stands can win why formally verified oh oh oh I see peer-reviewed formally verified okay got it well let's go Dono itself right yeah yeah we'll do a programming language that no one could use and at one point only had one transaction per block because the eutxo thing was messed up um but yes card on it okay okay cardano these charts seem to have brought out the animal spirits uh so what's the next they're doing a good job I didn't know you guys wanted another try all right number three it's kind of like one of those uh Rorschach tests where like you look at a chart and it like brings up all the stuff inside you that is true yeah I like it I feel like this is a good um psychological test for how you feel about crypto yeah it's the least fun party game that you can try at home you you know what tarun's parties are like we did we need a disclaimer for the listeners to to trigger warning we're gonna be playing the worst party game but we're saving you from playing it do not attempt on your own I I actually would be super down for this party game if it was actually like a party game I mean we're like four crypto Venture investors like we're like I think some of the only people that find this amusing I think I think I got a new one yeah actually this one I don't even have the labels on it are you gonna be okay with that is that gonna be too hard otherwise I think it's too obvious let's go let's go no labels I'm feeling risky tonight I I I will say one thing my first my first boss ever very nice guy this billionaire the one thing he would fire people for on the spot was no units on their labels that's legit like TV series no units fired on the spot I'm okay with that so if it just said like 100 200 300 he was like you're fired yeah all right so is Tom fired really is a party game wow I mean no there are well there are units on the on the x-axis yeah all right let's describe the chart so the listeners can understand what we're looking at because we all just said like whoa so the sharp starts in January 2009 so my hunch this is called a whale FIN chart I believe that's what this is called or shark fin sorry shark fin shark fin shark my Hunters that were thinking something in the Bitcoin ecosystem because the chart starts in 2009. and I don't think we would go all the way back so it looks like there's like no activity for 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013. there's basically no activity on this until 2019 and then it starts to go way up it peaks in like November 21 December 21 and then it goes back down to about half of its peak and it looks truly like a shark fin it's very symmetrical it almost looks like a normal distribution and there's also four colors but we don't have the legend so we don't know what those four colors correspond to but it's mostly one color it's like 90 one color yeah okay we were talking about lightning before my hunch is that this is a chart that has something to do with lightning or like a Bitcoin type of transaction number of lightning nodes by client it could be yeah it could be based on client it could be like 300 000 lightning nodes it maxes at 300 000. that's too much thing well the Segway was uh 2017. yeah I don't know okay like I'm just throwing ideas out no but actually I remember binance only supported segwit deposits and withdrawals in like 2020. I remember there are a lot of people on Twitter Bitcoin Maxi's complaining and yelling at CZ about this yeah yeah but the chart looks like zero it doesn't even look like it does the chart looks like zero until like two thousand how about number of channels instead of numbers I can see channels I think channels makes sense but Channel by client like that's what I'm trying to figure out or maybe by like capacity of the channel and like gray is like zero to 100 or something and then 300K BTC is like 1.5 billion no no no I'm saying that it's the number of channels but the colors are the capacity of the channel they're like class sizes right so like small medium big has lightning capacity ever been over a billion because 300K BTC is a lot no no I'm saying the units are not wasted the units are a number of channels the colors are corresponding to the side I don't think there's that many channels that's a lot I don't think there's that many channels either because like art most of the channels like bit refill and like nothing else that's what I remember yeah I mean it goes up to 300 000 whatever the uh also like what's this green thing that is like was like eating up demand through 2021 and then trunk indeed I feel like this is the green thing is kind of weird it's going way down right now okay Tom you wanna you wanna give us a hint you give us a hint you are correct it is something related to the Bitcoin ecosystem or related related to bitcoin that's an interesting guess I don't think there's 300 that there might be 300 000. there were more yeah a rap BTC could have could have could have been it might have been more but like maybe Ren Ren did you see no they never got that high 300 000 Bitcoin is a lot of Bitcoin so yeah yeah okay uh all right Tom next hand I I don't think I'd give another hint because that would I feel like that was a pretty big hint I'm tapped what what is it yeah what's the answer boom it is right there yeah yeah all right so wbgc plus Ren BGC plus everything okay so it's like wrapped like hbtc do not forget hbtc also the uh the wbtc numbers off eth are sort of messed up post FTX right because they minted a bunch of stuff that wasn't collateralized solid stuff yeah yeah but the the weird thing is the solid and wbtc pools were sort of like drained to zero also so it got it got a little dicey on oh interesting good Chart good chart that one was good yeah well okay that's solid I I was also about to be like like the Dune index lightning no way yeah actually now that you say that I'm like it doesn't seem like that would be an easy thing for tuned index I don't have lightning but they do have just general Bitcoin data now so if you want to look at ordinal stuff yeah yeah that's right there there were ordinals well I'm actually most interested in the fact that that chart has basically halved in like the past year or so there's a lot of BTC that was on ethereum that is no longer on ethereum which is probably the most interesting takeaway yeah where did that BTC go just back to bitcoin uh FTX for sure Alameda SPF I don't think it's half of the outstanding Bitcoin that was a joke okay yeah yeah because it peaked in April 2022 or may 2022. oh and then it was hbtc is basically nothing now and then wptc uh also fell quite a bit it must be tied to lenders in some way yeah like a lot of the lenders probably had to like a lot of lenders were using this stuff to get yield on this yeah exactly they were Farming Farming on your behalf exactly exactly you probably need to go check too right because the wptc redemptions are on chain you can just see who's ridiculous it probably was Celsius and FTX and the Genesis block fi all those guys who are finding ways to get yelled with their BTC the dinosaur graveyard of indeed indeed yeah that's very sad how do you do any of you guys know like how is lending making a comeback are people like putting their boots on again and facing the world or is lending just like kind of dead centralized lending centralized lending yeah yeah that dead dead dead E5 lending is like going up a little bit because of stake teeth yeah interesting I would think that like okay there's like an extinction level event there's no more yield anywhere like now it feels like a time that like somebody should come in and start cleaning up and like just offering like fairly low rates pocketing big spreads you know like just the lack of competition seems like it'd be a great time for somebody to come into the The Lending space why isn't that happening and also like okay yeah the risk-free rate on dollars is high but like the radon crypto assets is low so like well it shouldn't be I guess one of the things that would make it hard for a centralized lender is the fact that like right now borrowing costs in D5 are like hilariously low it's cheaper to borrow in D5 than it is and you like right borrowing costs in two parts below the FED funds rate like it's literally violates a lot of the laws of like Financial physics yeah I I I think you basically need need rates to go down a bit I've actually been thinking about this recently Robert I you know to your point um there are hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in usdc sitting in avian compound earning one and a half percent are these people who are using these as collateral are these people you see that stuck like why is this here yeah it's a great question so I mean there is so many stable coins earning so little in D5 I think the reason it's there is because it's better than bridging it back to Trad Phi to get 4.7 or 4.1 percent on your Apple account um or whatever you know is in the headlines lately because it takes days to go back and forth typically and people want to have their stable coins available to buy the dip or like invest in crypto like they don't actually want to leave the crypto asset purchasing ecosystem uh because crypto is still so volatile that if you can buy crypto you know and sell it for one percent higher that's more money than you're expecting to make offer rates anyway and like you have all these people like buying and selling crypto and just having it so readily available to take advantage of like you know I mean today either drop six percent right that's more than a year of interest you know for someone who was in stables and was able to buy it and it's looking to sell out higher like just in terms of that like human Market making you know the expected returns are probably higher than the difficulty of like moving into Trad five missing an opportunity you know whatever like if you have Stables it's because you like crypto you like crypto assets you like to be able to trade in them and participate in them and all of these things and it's like it still is super high friction to move it back to track by and back to crypto and so there's a glut of stable coins in crypto that earn way way less than the risk-free rate and I think people are mostly okay with that what are those they're saying else to earn one percent or two percent because I know I can just turn it into ether and Bitcoin you know in a second's notice you know in one in one block if I need to and that's like extremely valuable and the reason why they're not breaking it out of crypto one funny thing right is like we're pretty close to the all-time high actually of total stable coins right yeah it's like 118 billion right now I think yeah 130 131 of according to to default llama pull up the D5 llama chart Tom yeah this one the D5 llama stable control it's actually kind of I mean you can just see tether completely crushing it like that that that's the number one thing here you just see like tether and usdc going in like complete opposite directions at the end yeah because like it's crazy tether's near its all-time high it's it's like not very far from insulting it's only a couple of billion dollars away yeah and ustc is quite far from its all-time high it's about half of its all-time high the the only other interesting thing is that there seems to be a pretty perfect substitution effect is that like the um you know the pie seems to be fixed of demand for stable coins at least in any given moment in time and so when one's going up the other is going down it doesn't ever seem like they're that correlated except when the whole Market's going up yeah Mouse over April 22 one year ago what was the total table coins a year ago because there's 131 now let's add these up in her head real quick it's like 160 175 yes yeah so it's it's not down that much in in compared to say like BTC and eth being down 50 yeah yeah anymore look at that oh wow we were off okay it's 200 billion so it's down about what like no no marketing not TBL yeah oh oh oh oh oh Mark cap sorry because like did they include UST that's like that's sort of one of the weird parts of the data oh yeah but do we count UST I'm guessing they did yeah I just don't know whether because I just don't know whether we're back to the non-aggregated it'll show it does show ustc which is USC classic which is I guess the successor at yeah yeah look it's 16 bill right there yeah yeah wow dramatic dramatic okay all right so if you ignore that 16 billion it's still down April 22. April April's 187 and then uh now we're at 131 so you know it's down 20 mil 20 Bill something like that yeah it definitely feels like it's not so so cool yeah actually it looks like right when Terra collapse was the all-time high for stable coin and market cap the total circulating Supply and since then it's been like pretty stable after I mean it's gone down it's like kind of trickle down every month 20 million yeah but very slightly yeah not not a very significant drawdown I was just looking this up you were talking Rob you were talking about like the the risk-free rate and like the ability to instantaneously transfer stable coins in and out I was looking at what are the rates that big banks are paying on cash deposits that's kind of the analogy of like okay you can instantly turn you know you get the optionality uh Chase is paying 0.02 apy on cash right now so actually like if you if you consider Staples to be cash then actually they're getting higher yield at a bank account still that's true Chase might be unique anyone with access to a brokerage account can get higher yeah yeah right why right now Commercial Bank deposits are kind of flying out yeah and it's why the profitability of the biggest banks like JPM should be going up unfortunately yes listen it's according to FDIC the average apy across Banks nationally is about 30 bips that's so pathetic that's crazy yeah yeah well it turns out uscc is actually pretty good for being like yeah you know instantaneous cash account what when do you think we'll be talking about tokenized treasuries over tokenized stable coins or like something that's like close to off-chain yield I mean I think over the next two years some incredible things are going to come to Market that change how we think about organized dollars versus tokenized yield right I think it just needs to like find a clear regulatory framework I think the issue with real world assets broadly speaking this is like super kind of thousand foot few is that when we started like I mean I remember when I first got into crypto people used to talk about real world assets all the time and that was like 2017-2018 right it was a big narrative and that's six years ago now geez at that time like I remember when people were tokenizing like apartment complexes and they were putting them on the blockchain and being like why why are why is anyone buying my like Miami apartment complex and to be honestly people like found these like very random things that were totally liquid and very hard to value and a lot of local knowledge and were annoyed that like okay I brought this thing on chain I did all the legal work and like why isn't it magically liquid now so I think people have this mental model that like blockchains magically make things liquid which is obviously [ __ ] like that's not you know there's nothing magic about tokenization that makes the liquid things liquid and I think as a result like the order of operations through which blockchains approach real world assets was kind of inverted we started with the most illiquid hard to Value things that very few people want to own like a specific piece of real estate in a specific apartment complex or whatever as opposed to like treasuries right treasuries are the biggest Market in the world or the biggest asset in the world huge amounts of demand nobody is has trouble underwriting treasuries but they haven't existed on the blockchain basically at all for the last like five years now a big part of the reason for that was that yields on treasuries were terrible right they were basically 25 basis points for the longest time and when on-chain yields were dramatic who cares why would you want to bring treasuries on chain and now it feels like that's reversing right there's now clearly more demand for Treasures on chain there are a few projects that are doing it and there's there's there's a lot of you're seeing a lot of online growth in the demand for treasuries but the more importantly I think it's like it shows that we're now thinking in the right order of operations about what kinds of real world assets you need to build on chain and in what sequence they should be tokenized as opposed to starting with a PE fund or you know some random piece of real estate or some other random thing that nobody else wants and nobody else knows even what it is starting with the biggest and most liquid assets and bring them on chain and and following that sequence of optionality such that you know eventually the marginal investor who's living in some random country around the world uh it's like okay great treasuries I know what that is I I can see why I'd want that as part of my portfolio and then I might want this other thing and this other thing and this other thing and you get this um you get this menu forming in a in a sensible way that builds up this impression of like hey I can go on chain and I can buy the kinds of assets that I understand and care about as part of a sound financial portfolio as opposed to I go on chain and I can find dollars and then really random stuff that like some random entrepreneur decided they wanted to tokenize and then basically you know the crypto Casino and in between we have nfts which I think are a really fun approximation of assets that are sending liquid on chain yeah well we'll soon have the world coin orb identities when are they coming on chain I think they are they are on their own L2 right now right but this is POA I think it's POA though I think the goal is for they'll be posted they'll be wait they're on an L2 that's POA that has an L2 well there it's there's a plan to convert it you know what's funny like we haven't used the phrase POA in like years like I feel like it was like a phrase from like 2017. but in a lot of ways like a lot of the l2s are kind of Poa just we don't use that phrase anymore I think the the term L2 is a little bit aspirational at this point right it's like L2 kind of means like we have the goal of no longer being a multi-sig at some point but like somewhere there's a multi-sig and the multi-sig basically if they wanted to they could control it whether it's like controlling uh the fraud proofs and like the fraud proofs are white listed or you know the code can be upgraded or there are no fraud proofs and the crazy optimism stack or you know the ZK Roll-Ups are all obviously super experimentals there's everything is super protected the reality is like today L2 is more like the destination as opposed to a description of the present well I I agree but that's because I think it's technically extremely challenging to decentralize them fully safely right for all the different reasons for sure yes right I think it's correct that they're this way I don't think they should skip a step if we go back to our first chart I mean the question really is like is that amount of Revenue that has to be spent going the Worth decentralizing right like well there's some sense in like yeah you missed the second chart which was the profit um the Delta between the fees that they're charging people and what they're you know paying to settle on so you know some of them are making what like a thousand each per month um on the spread so like that is pretty attractive um but you know it's also like going back to the POA thing it's like you know it's there are levels of security I think this stuff is all obviously better than like you know any sort of you know POA Network and it's you're really what you're what you're risking is the difference between the last the last proof that was posted on chain so it's like you know okay sure it's not ideal but like oh we're getting there it's it's iterative by the way for those who don't know POA means proof of authority which basically means a multi-sig more or less yeah it means you have the keys but but I will say there there have been some successful chains have transitioned from POA to their own chains like gnosis chain which started as X die which was POA but now now you can run a gnosis chain validator so yeah I I've been wanting to write a blog post about this and I've been just caught up with a bunch of stuff but I'm going to write eventually but I want to get your guys take on this in real time as I think through this thesis so I feel like over the last six months so we've been you know so we invested into ZK sync we've been you know big bulls of of their tooth generally but I feel like lately the conversation has become and I see this more and more especially among like the kind of crypto intelligencia that like layer ones are basically irrelevant now because or all Alto ones Ulta ones are basically relevant now because we have the Roll-Ups the promised land is here we can finally get off this like intermediate step or like the ship that we were using to to get onto the the beautiful you know uh uh Promised Land of Roll-Ups and I guess my thesis is something along the lines of like the altel ones are still really important and they're not going to go away and I think they actually still have some structural advantages over l2s so before I go into like why I think that I'm curious just to get your gut level reaction or do you think especially the evm based Ulta ones do you think they're like basically done once the layer twos are like fully feature complete well I actually think the all l1s are long-term more useful and more valuable than the l2s potentially because okay interesting why and maybe I'm tripping and like we didn't talk about this on like the last episode or like I'm just imagining this or maybe we did talk about this in the last episode or maybe this was a conversation I just had with some crypto people like on the streets of Brooklyn or something but all the l2s are just evm chains and when it comes to being an application developer even if there's a hundred l2s they're not really offering you any new capabilities that you don't already have for launching an application and I give kudos to the alt L ones that are actually like providing different capabilities to application writers mostly through choice of language OR tech specs or whatever but like Solano legitimately offers something different than ethereum Avalanche offers something different than ethereum you know polka dot offers something different than ethereum all the l2s offer basically the same thing and every L2 offers basically the same thing as every other L2 even if you have 400 of them it doesn't really fundamentally change the toolkit available to application developers and at the end of the day the whole point of all of these platforms is to enable applications to be built on top of them and so I think all the different Alltel ones are more useful in that they offer different like tools to developers that l2s don't and so I don't think having a hundred different evm chains is the promised land like 100 different evm chains in my mind is almost exactly the same as equally as good as having like one evm chain I think it's a lot of wasted effort and a lot of wasted resources as a society and I think there's so much more value that comes from totally different approachings that get tried then having yet another L2 which I think adds fundamentally nothing so I would say that another interesting fact is that you know a little bit like ethereum last bear Market where the Bitcoin Maxis were constantly hounding uh them but the developers were like dug their toes in and like [ __ ] you we're still gonna keep building things here I feel like Solana does have that and no other all ll1 does have that where there's this community of people who are like they're just they're they're they're like almost like a cult in belief uh on the developer side because like we believe the cosmic particular attributes Cosmos has that but everyone in Cosmos likes to cut each other uh you know like it's a knife fight constantly a b anytime someone is like Hey how do I make something easier for a user oh guess what make another Cosmos chain and add another token it's like it's like the equivalent of that um you know the xkcd the comic on the standards and Technology like hey we have 15 standards I'm gonna make one that rules them all okay now we have 16 standards and like Cosmos has that problem like inherently in a way that I think is difficult uh and people are definitely working on trying to homogenize things but I think you know sovereignty comes at a cost Moana is actually weirdly the developer Community is so adamant there in in like a way that reminds me of ethereum developers to the bottom of the last bear Market which is good yeah I think it's honestly true for any chain like you're talking about like legit change like legit communities and legit legit developers but like go down coin Gecko and choose any random like 2017 era L1 and like dude there will be people in the Discord in the telegram on the Reddit typed about the chain for some particular reason and it's sort of like a religious in some way and like it's not just number go up people talk about like applications and like there are random depths people who get like married to like a particular like chain ideology in the same way like I just think they don't with like a you know L2 maybe on a tangent for this topic but something I wasn't thinking about is like it seems like to your point around these layer twos as a service or like stuff like bass uh popping up they kind of get co-promoted or like heralded by sort of like the chain like optimism but these feel very cannibalistic right like now optimism has to in or any Layer Two basically has to make an argument as to why they you know why you need to sort of co-locate on their chain with the other apps versus like run your own you know Fork of it and that seems like a a harder case to make over time we're building on base for that matter right isn't bass like sure directly cannibalistic from optimism I mean they're it's it's yes quite Zero Sum right like they're the same damn stack but one of them has coinbase distribution and one of them has like op token yes I'd be pissed if I was optimism yeah they're clearly celebrating this I mean I think it's not obvious and the other thing too like I think in a lot of these cases the token at least in the short term it's kind of a meme token right like obviously the fees for these layer twos I mean except for like the like you said the sort of the spread between the fees on chain and the the call data they have to actually post it's reasonable what like 20 million a year run rate or something like that it's like not a crazy amount of money but it's like not nothing but it's obviously not worth like 10 billion FTV so take Adam For example right like Adam obviously there is de minimis value going through the cosmos Hub which is what the atom token actually Dogecoin for nerds yes it has no utility ego other than jayquan struck me with ego with it there's no really nothing else just for for a lot of these things it is just the model right so I think like for op token I I don't know that there was a rational reason why like when base launched op token should go up when base and the optimism you know whatever it's called the optimism canonical distro I don't know what your chain whatever whatever you'd call it like clearly these are in competition with each other and they use the same stack and you're gonna Deploy on one you're gonna deploying the other base did say well we're going to give some of the fees to the optimism Collective or whatever but then they walked back how many fees they're going to give and like obviously they're not going to give the majority of the fees because it's their chain and they can change it anytime they want because it's up to them unless there's some contract which would be kind of weird so end of the day and obviously they could always change right like if there's going to be an alternative layer 2 sack that is open source and is totally license free and they're like oh optimism wants to extract more rent from you or basically be like okay well never mind optimism will like switch and do some Regenesis or something it will create a transition plan to go to something else where somebody else gets the fees so I I just don't know in the short term I think nobody cares in the short term it's all meme Warfare and maybe appropriately so maybe it's right for them to think about it as me Warfare but um I I don't think the markets think about it this way because clearly when base launch that was like super that's considered to be super bullish for optimism despite the fact that now okay there's a third competitor on the layer two space well I don't think the market thinks that much in general in crypto like I don't think we have these like extremely rational markets where you know there's fundamental analysis done on all the different arguably base not launching with the token though is very positive for op in the sense of securities stuff no I mean it's gonna be you know coinbase runs a sequencer and the revenue goes to coinbase Inc like I don't think that's complicated well I think I think Twitter's point is also a good one is that the demand for investing into layer twos there's only really today two tokens you can invest in arbitrary and optimism and if base had a token there would be a third and I think that's a simple enough analysis to be correct that that was good for optimism but based on that launcher token it's just buying BNB in in late 2020. op is the proxy on For Better or Worse it's it's a 30 IQ move but you know I I am agreeing with the thesis that haseeb was I I I don't really have a strong view on that thesis but I will say I think that's the logic people's you know the left curve logic is literally what I just right yeah well there's no token so they'll use op but like so I obviously none of us are Traders as far as I know Robert you can see yourself a Trader I feel like you're the most active in markets of any of us okay I am not active at all I'm not afraid okay so none of us are Traders so to be clear we're all totally incompetent at making these kinds of evaluations but yeah nothing here is investment advice because we also obviously nothing invested advice because we're all terrible at investing in like short-term trades but I will say the the longer I've been encrypted the more that I've learned that the obvious thing is usually right that's just like the the number one piece of advice that I give to everybody in crypto yeah ape tokens trading at four billion FTV you know it's uh hey they're gonna ship a metaverse ape is necessary to power the ecosystem [Laughter] too okay I think we've we've technically hit an hour um this was a very experimental show it's also very late at night so I hope you're feeling the the late night Chill Vibes let's go and sign off I think next week we'll do something a little more sensible than this but I hope that uh this was coming at you with a slightly different flavor in the shop to be clear this is what we used to do back when we were doing the like uh before The Chopping Block was a thing we used to do Twitter spaces that was like the robot Ventures dragonfly like what was it like happy hours like Friday happy hours and we would just like talk about random stuff and this was the voice you know exactly and then now we've gotten not so professionalized and we have an agenda and we like talk about the news now we're gonna talk about Gary Gensler C we're always mixing up here at the shopping blog that's what the show's all about keeping you guessing okay that's it tarun I hope your food has gotten here I hope it's not too cold would you order by the way yeah turkey burger turkey burger that's very healthy we're not editing this out yeah that's what you would say if you ordered like two pizzas you'd be like oh I got a turkey burger look look Zuko's not listening you know okay remember how Zuko was like a big meditarian and uh yeah yeah yeah yeah but you know I feel like turkey burgers like uh a cheap you know something people don't don't respect as much Tyrone you know that is a very feminized meal is a turkey burger I can't believe you would you don't respect it you're just showing hate all right signing off thanks everyone tune in next week bye
