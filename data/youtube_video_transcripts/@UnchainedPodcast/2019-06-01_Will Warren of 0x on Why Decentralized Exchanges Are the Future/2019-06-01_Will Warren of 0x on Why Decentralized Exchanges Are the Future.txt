who in crypto will be recognized today for their achievements stay tuned to find out today's guest is will warren founder and CEO of decentralized exchange protocol 0x welcome well thanks Laura happy to be here so I didn't have you in the podcast because I think everyone believes decentralized exchanges or Dex's will be a big theme theme in 2018 but before I get to that topic I wanted to hear your history first what were you doing before you got an encrypted and how did you get into the space yeah so I was originally on like a research track and I was planning to either go into research and academia or industry specifically in the field of engineering I initially heard of Bitcoin back in 2011 and thought it was really interesting technology the use cases were not really there yet it was mostly being used for Silk Road and stuff like that but continued to follow it my wife Linda Shay who is my girlfriend at the time ended up joining coinbase in 2013 and naturally I just you know got more and more interested through wind and then eventually when aetherium came out later I basically lost interest in everything else and you know at the time I was as a PhD student at UC San Diego studying engineering and I decided to drop out just to focus on building on aetherium Oakland and how did you come up with the idea to do a decentralized exchange protocol yeah so when I dropped out of grad school I was initially working on tokenized derivatives on the ethereum blockchain and the idea was that you know cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and it makes them not very useful for quite a few different use cases where you need the stable store of value and the idea was that kind of creating this standard for tokenized derivatives people would be able to hedge against that volatility and so that was the idea I was working on I spent around six months I kind of like fleshed out the whole system built it out rode up like a technical spec and then I met my co-founder Amir bandy Ollie and we were thinking about art how are we gonna bring this product to market and we realized that like tokenized derivatives just aren't very useful if there's nowhere to exchange them I think you know I just kind of assumed that someone would have built a decentralized exchange on the etherium blockchain by then it seemed like low-hanging fruit but you know that wasn't the case so this was back in you know October of 2016 this was like back before ether Delta was around so ether Delta was like the very first decentralized exchange that you know people started using on the etherion blockchain so yeah I mean I'm hearing like you know kind of we I think we just kind of sumed that this infrastructure for exchange would exist and it didn't so we you know we just decided all right well I guess we'll just go build this ourselves define what a decentralized exchange is and tell us what problems you're trying to solve or the problems that you think centralized exchanges have yeah I mean so the most obvious issue with centralized exchanges versus decentralized exchanges is that centralized exchanges are responsible for custody all of their users digital assets so you're I mean when you're using a centralized exchange you're you're actually giving them full control over your cryptocurrency and in the very you know the brief history of cryptocurrency existing at all there's been numerous examples of these centralized exchanges getting hacked for hundreds of millions of dollars and that's just gonna continue to happen you know every six months or so we're just gonna find another centralized cryptocurrency exchange that's hacked and the reason why is because when you pool many thousands of people's cryptocurrency in a single location it just creates this enormous honeypot this enormous financial incentive to hack that you know that custodian by any means necessary so with with a decentralized exchange everyone that's participating in exchange are on this trading they retain possession of their cryptocurrency at all times and when a trade occurs it occurs in a peer-to-peer fashion where the assets that are being exchanged are moved between the two parties trustless lee and without any third party having to have access to their funds and so one thing here obviously is that people you know they're good at losing things at least I know I am so while having a honeypot for hackers is not something that we should be doing I think also people might worry about losing their own private keys so are there any special mechanisms that are built in so that people don't end up easily losing them no so that's a great point and I think that's probably one of the biggest hurdles for adoption of this technology and just not even decentralized exchange but just the adoption of cryptocurrency generally is that having good like private key hygiene is is challenging there's a learning curve involved and if you mess up you lose your money permanently it's gone forever and that's pretty scary but I think that's an issue that will probably require education and then better wallets better better kind of private key management solutions so yeah I mean it's definitely it's more convenient to have your money just parked in a centralized exchange and not you know I do either security is really good and you don't have to worry about it but you know I I think history's proven that you should be very worried if your currencies in someone else's possession and so we've so far described what it is centralized exchanges and we've talked about the problems that centralized exchanges have but you were actually building not a decentralized exchange itself but a decentralized exchange protocol so what is 0x yeah I think so kind of going back to where we left off so I met a mirror and we decided that someone needed to build out this decentralized exchange infrastructure no one had done it and our original plan was just to build our own for-profit decentralized exchange so just something that we owned it was proprietary you know we would charge trading fees on on every single trade that went through our system and so we started working on it and as we spent more time in the etherium community and mint met with more projects in the space so you know different you know we met with auger and nosis and maker Mellon port all these different aetherium projects that are kind of targeting different use cases we realized that all of them required exchange functionality and they were all kind of they were all just playing to build out their own kind of one-off implementations for exchange and they all had kind of different approaches and so we you know there's this kind of this mounting body of evidence that all of these different projects would require it's changed functionality and you know it wasn't something where we could necess are kind of for-profit you centralized exchange could service all of their needs so yeah eventually it was just kind of overwhelming body of evidence that what we really needed to build was a piece of public infrastructure that anyone could plug into and use that wouldn't you know extract any rent or anything like that so we'd have to be free to use it would have to be truly public infrastructure and so that that was kind of how we decided to transition from building our own for-profit decentralize exchange and in shift towards repurposing our system for public use is that why instead of being for instance adapt or a decentralized app on top of etherium that is its own protocol yeah having so 0x but by having 0x serve as an open protocol that anyone can plug into and anyone can kind of create their own for-profit decentralized exchange on top of it it opens up this single piece of infrastructure to a whole wide variety of different use cases and it you know instead of having a bunch of different projects kind of duplicating efforts building their own kind of one-off implementations they can all just kind of use this this solution that's ready to go and but but I think like more importantly like the benefit of having an open protocol that every single DAP is plugged into rather than having each one of them build their own proprietary solution is that you know if everyone creates their own solution it will fragment liquidity across like a patchwork of these different applications cific decentralized exchanges and that will that will decrease the liquidity for everyone so it's like a worse outcome for everyone versus if all of these different taps kind of plug into the same decentralized exchange protocol or layer there's it creates a global liquidity pool it creates these and network effects around liquidity and it's a much more efficient solution but one thing is that the 0x protocol is only used to exchange aetherium ERC 20 tokens right so that liquidity only comes from that one pool is that correct like you can't take tokens that are built on other platforms yes that's that's a good question so so 0x protocol itself yes it is only designed to allow for the exchange of cerium based assets but I so two thoughts on this so first I think that you know with cross chain solutions like polka dot and cosmos and a variety of others I've heard about like block collider you know you'll be able to move your Bitcoin from the Bitcoin blockchain onto the etherion blockchain or anywhere else you would like to to move it so you know I think in like the next few years what we'll see is that the native currencies of all these different block chains will eventually be able to be represented as aetherium tokens that exist on the etherium blockchain and that you can trade using 0x protocol Oh interesting okay so there will be is that the same thing so when people ask about it being interoperable is that the same thing or is that a different or is that a different concept yes I think interoperability can mean a few quite a few different things but yeah I think one of the things that interoperability means is being able to bridge assets bridge block chains and move assets across those bridges so actually a really really interesting example that I think worth checking out recently you know that the true--but team has been making a lot of progress in bridging the the dogecoin chain and the etherion blockchain and what's really interesting is this might be one of the first examples where you can move the native crypto currency of the Dozois chain over onto the etherion block pain and just represent it as an ethereal token so I think that's like like an ER c20 token yeah exactly and it's all trustless and yeah I mean I think it's like a pretty interesting example of what's to come in the next few years it doesn't cosmos do a similar thing to that or that's what they're intending to do yeah yeah so cosmos will also allow for bridging different block chains or they they call them peg zones and I think they're pretty close to having a working product as well which is you know pretty exciting okay let's talk about relays on 0x what is a relay ER how does one work okay yeah so 0x protocol in its simplest form allows any two people in the world to trust lessly exchange in a peer-to-peer fashion directly so I can you know I can basically generate this 0x order which specifies sort of the trade I would like to enter into you know the assets that are being exchanged the exchange rate the the time at which I'm no longer willing to honor that that trade and I can I can take this packet of data and cryptographically signed it and I can send that to my counterparty and this packet of data is really just it's just data so I can send it to my counterparty through email or through some sort of messaging app or I could write it down on a piece of paper a ballot to them all that really matters is that the cryptographic signature that you know indicates I'm willing to enter into that trade that must be authentic and my counterparty just has to take piece of data and inject it into the 0x smart contracts and the smart contracts will then sort of move the tokens between me and my counterparty at the exchange rate that was specified and you know assuming everything you know assuming that order is authentic and so that that's how Xerox protocol can be used in it in sort of its most simple and most manual form but typically people don't you know people do these large OTC deals directly with the counterparty but typically people go to people want to go to an exchange so a location where many of different buyers and sellers are kind of aggregating their liquidity and it makes it very easy to find a counterparty that has you know is offering the asset you are interested in at a reasonable price so that's where real layers come in to use your expert achill so so real Ayres are basically just any entity that decides to aggregate these cryptographically signed 0x orders and present them to the world in the form of an order book and you know since these 0x orders are really just chunks of data that are cryptographically signed if I want to operate a real layer all I have to really do is host a database and when people send me these orders I store them in the database and organize them according to price and according to trading pair etc and then I serve them to anyone that kind of comes to my website looking for a counterparty and so at the end of the day a real layer really is just a decentralized exchange that looks and feels like a centralized one but since they're not responsible for custody of assets they're not responsible for trade execution you know they're really they really aren't in exchange they're really just relaying these messages back and forth between different people so that that's why we call them relays so if we're really sorry if a relay er gets hacked is there any negative outcome at all like obviously the user funds aren't at risk so is there any negative impact No so the hacker would simply be able to trade with the people that want to trade okay we're going to keep discussing real layers and other issues around two centralized exchanges but first I'd like to take a quick break for both of our sponsors now a word from our sponsor appreciate founded by ed Stevens appreciate is building the most valuable

IC o set of services that's start and calm slash Unchained star engine does not provide legal advice I'm speaking with will Warren the founder and CEO of decentralized exchange protocol 0x so to continue our conversation about relays I wanted to ask if I become a customer of one relayer then are the other sides of my trades are all of those people customers of the same relayer or can relay errs a kind of interact with trades on other relays or elsewhere in the protocol yeah so you can you can trade typically you'll be trading with other people that are also kind of using that same relayer as you but since 0x is an open protocol and all of these different layer relays are plugged into the same piece of infrastructure it does allow for things like liquidity sharing and it allows for real Ayres to kind of balance orders across different you know other real Ayres as well so you know it's it is feasible that you might end up filling an order on one relays order book that originated on a different real layer let's say that I'm I want it exchanged an on top 10 token for another non top 10 token if I wanted to kind of get the most for my money then wouldn't it be better for me to try to trade it for something like Bitcoin or ether rather than some other less popular token like I just wonder how high that demand will be to trade kind of some of these less popular tokens for other less popular tokens yeah yeah so I think that the trading pairs that we'll see a lot of volume will be denominated in the most liquid asset so things like you know ether or once a Bitcoin you know is tokenized on the etherion blockchain you might see trading pairs that are dena you know where bitcoin is the denominating token or things like u.s. dollar tokens once those are things you'll you'll be trading sort of these less less with tokens against the US dollar token or the Bitcoin token so what I think is gonna end up happening is rather than having a bunch of different real layers kind of competing for the same trick you know competing for market share of the same trading pairs what I think we're going to see is that there's consolidation in the relayer market and one or two real Ayres will end up dominating a specific market niche but what I think is gonna happen and we're already seeing it right now is is that the number of tokens on the etherium blockchain is going to trend towards infinity there's just going to be an enormous number of tokens and diversity of tokens that exist on the ethereum blockchain so rather than having a real layer that you know offers millions of different trading pairs for your users what I think is going to happen is that real layers are going to carve out a specific market niche and they will you know attempt to kind of dominate the market share for that market and describe what you mean by market niche what are some examples yeah so you know just for things like ERC 20 tokens today we're seeing you know there's like a few thousand ERC 20 tokens that exist just from token sales but I think we'll start to seeing much more interesting kind of classes of VRC 20 tokens in the near future so things like prediction markets oghren gnosis and even in prediction markets there's just a number of different verticals that people will want to kind of people will be wanting to trade on the outcomes of different types of events so like sports sports betting weather science politics all of these things will be represented as prediction markets that have aetherium tokens used to trade them and recently we've been seeing kind of an explosion in this new class of etherion tokens that are there called non fungible tokens so ERC 7:21 is the token standard that's used to represent these things and you know non fungible tokens are kind of like one one-of-a-kind collectible items and they can be you know crypto kitties is the first example that got a lot of interest in in this class of tokens but I you know I I think we're gonna see an explosion in different aetherium based on video games and other sorts of digital collectible items that people aren't interested in buying and selling in the in the very near future probably yeah in 2018 and so I think I think we're just gonna see millions and millions of different types of assets that people are interested in exchanging and each one of these kind of niche markets is gonna have a real layer that is creating our kind of tailoring their products to that specific use case in that that kind of demographic of users but I just wonder will users want to only exchange they're collectible tokens for other collectibles or would we ever want to see someone with maybe a real estate token want to trade it for a security token or so with a security token want to trade it for a collectible so I would just wonder might we see demand for real ayres that you know have a bigger market place that doesn't specialize I think so yeah I mean so if I had to guess the way that the relayer market might play out there might be this what kind of like one massive relayer that tries to serve a bunch of different markets and their real layer might look something like reddit where you can go to reddit there's an infinite number of people that kind of build their communities there all sorts of different niche subreddits that you can subscribe to and so when you go to Reddit you kind of find the different communities that you're interested in being a part of and you subscribe to them and I think it'll be similar with tokens and maybe a real layer that offers trading of those two guns where you go to this relayer you kind of identify the different types of tokens you're interested in potentially trading and you kind of subscribe to those markets but the user experience yeah I mean with Reddit you can create a subreddit that you know for your community but there's limits to how you how much you can tailor that subreddit to suit the needs of your of your community and user base so while there may be a single relayer that is kind of like a reddit where you can trade whatever you want you know in the same way that there are communities that organize themselves off of reddit because they can create a more tailored kind of user experience or a more tailored product for their community I think we'll see the same thing with real layers where there's just highly specialized real layers that you know allow their users to trade very niche types of assets like you know tokenized derivatives is one one area where I think you you really need a completely different user interface and different types of data that your users can look through in order to trade those markets a lot of people when they talk about decentralized exchanges wonder how they will overcome the liquidity issue which is a sort of chicken and egg type problem in which sellers may not want to go use such an exchanger there isn't enough demand and buyers may not think to sell there if there aren't enough sell there so how would you solve this problem or how do you think this problem could be solved yeah so I think there's quite a few strong incentives for people to use a decentralized exchange over a centralized one that you know and it's just these reasons alone the fact that you you know you don't have to worry about the centralized exchange getting hacked and losing all of your crypto assets I think those are some reasons why there there just will be a natural desire for people to use decentralize exchanges is it just it's just a completely different product but as far as how we kind of bridge our how we kind of build the quiddity in the ecosystem compared to where we are now there's not very much liquidity I think looking at the volume numbers for 0x protocol today there's five hundred thousand or a million dollars of trading volume each day but I think it's early so I think there's a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built out in order for market makers to come in and provide that liquidity to markets and that just takes time and and there's also education that needs to be done but I think probably the biggest bottleneck longer-term for liquidity to come to these decentralized exchanges is scalability the you know block chains are designed to be highly redundant censorship resistant networks that are hard to bring down and that does not necessarily translate into high throughput low latency and you know the good news is that I think that today we're kind of in the dial-up internet stages of blockchain and know you know in 10 years from now block games will probably look completely different than they do today and you know being able to support thousands or hundreds of thousands of trades per second will be much more feasible whereas today you know on the etherion blockchain we can support you know maybe fifteen trades per second so yeah I think that's it's one of those things where it's gonna take time and we probably can't can't cut corners or anything like that you want to do it right and in a way it sounds like your ability to scale actually really depends on a theory on ability to scale not not necessarily even your own effort yeah yeah very much so so today that's true because 0x protocol is is tied into the ethereum blockchain in the future you know 0x protocol is going to be blockchain agnostic so you can use this same exact message format and the same exact settlement logic but you can kind of swap out whichever blockchain you want to use as your back-end so to say yeah no interesting yeah but that is you know that's definitely a ways out you know we we could theoretically port 0x protocol over to some other chains today if we wanted to other evn block chains but you know if there aren't tokens there if there isn't like a healthy token ecosystem on a different blockchain then there really is no reason for 0x to be ported to that blockchain is there some sort of block time that you need to to have the decentralized exchange protocol work because for instance it doesn't seem like it would work with ten-minute block times on the Bitcoin blockchain ice i0x protocol so I mean taking the fact that the Bitcoin blockchain is a you TXO blockchain and not like it you can't support rich state that or tokens really I mean you know that would make it not really possible to have a 0x function on the Bitcoin blockchain theoretically though if it could support those things I could see people still using 0x protocol for kind of big OTC trades where it's just direct directly peer-to-peer because then then the block time doesn't really matter as much but yeah if you want to have a decent user experience where they can kind of pick an order off a publicly accessible water book and just kind of have these the tokens they just purchased show up in their wallet and you know a few seconds later yeah I think walk time does matter you know what is like the ideal number I don't really know I don't know if I have an answer to that right now it's a little clunky you know so if you purchase some-some etherium tokens using today you know the block time on aetherium is 15 seconds roughly so you know it might be like 30 seconds before your your tokens show up in your wallet but you know I again I think we are in the dial-up internet days of blockchain and these things are going to get better and all along a variety of different dimensions including blog time you've written about how front-running can be a problem in decentralized in a decentralized exchange environment what is front-running and how would that happen in a decentralized exchange and what solutions do you propose to prevent it yeah front running is an issue that isn't specific to decentralized exchange so and so I think it's something that people associate with decentralized exchange a lot today because it is one of the use cases that people are actually able to kind of use right now but so so front-running just generally the way that block chains typically work is that you create a transaction you sign that transaction and you broadcast it to the peer-to-peer network and that transaction isn't necessarily mine it's never mind into a block immediately what has to happen is it has to propagate through the network and before it is actually mined into a block the transaction sits and in what's typically called like a pending transaction pool so it's just a big pool of different transactions that are waiting to be mined into a block but haven't been yet and all of the transactions that are sitting in this pending transaction pool are transparent so you can you can look at all of them you know exactly what all of them are going to do and you know if some of these transactions are going to for example buy up some tokens on a decentralized exchange you can if you can see that that's going to happen that's a piece of information that you can use to your advantage if you're a trader you can essentially no and you know a group of people are gonna purchase a bunch of these tokens so you so you can go in and kind of rebroadcast a similar transaction or the same transaction but set a higher gas price so that your your trade will get mind into a block before the original person this trade will get mind into a block so that's not very good that means that smart people that are watching the pending transaction pool can kind of see what trades are about to happen and kind of jump in in front of them you know and again this isn't something that is specific to decentralized exchange you know there's a variety of different applications we're kind of seeing what other people are gonna do before they do it can give you an advantage like you know options and just just a variety of different things so for 0x there's a variety of ways that you can prevent front-running and and make it not feasible so I guess maybe this would be a good time to kind of discuss the different ways that relays can function so the first way that a relayer can facilitate exchange and host hosting order book is called the open order book model and this this was the model that was presented in our white paper back in February of 2017 and in the open order book model anyone can kind of generate one of the one of these cryptographically signed orders and post it up on a tree layers order book and the real layers order book is kind of just like a poster board and anyone can kind of look at the different orders that are up there and anyone can kind of grab one of them and take it off the order book and inject it into the 0x smart contracts and and this model is subject different running because the way that the orders are specified anyone can fill the order so if someone sees that you know you are attempting to fill this order they see that your transaction is sitting the pending transaction pool hold they can just take that same exact order and attempt to fill it by setting a higher gas price and jumping in front of you the second way that a 0x relayer can operate a decentralized exchange is using something that we call the matching model and the way the matching model works is every single order that is sent to the relay and that ends up on their order book specifies that relayer as the only entity that's able to fill that order and so what happens is when this when this relayer gets orders on opposite sides of the market at you know the same exchange rate or an overlapping exchange rate they kind of take these two different orders they package them together and inject them into the Xerox smart contracts and fill them you know synchronously anatomically in a single transaction and in effect you know this relayer is not only aggregating liquidity but they're also they're also kind of taking on the responsibility of trade execution and so no one else can kind of jump in front of an order sitting in the pending transaction pool only the real layer is able to execute these trades and there's there's also a variety of other ways that 0x protocol can be used it's a really modular and extensible system and you know there's there's some interesting ideas that we're thinking about that kind of combines the openness of the open order book model with the strong guarantees around trade execution that you get with the matching model and I don't want to go too deep into it here because it's a pretty you know we can we can go super deep on it's pretty technical subject but I have a blog post I just published recently called front-running briefing in the perils of virtual settlement that really goes through the issue from first principles then gets into some really interesting solutions that were exploring for the future yeah and one thing I wanted to point out was in your example I think this applies only to the open order book model but another issue would be if a miner wanted to do that then they wouldn't even have to pay the fee to front-run so for them you know it's it's a no-cost move right yeah and one other thing I want to ask about the the model that's you know just within the relayer does that mean that if the relayer only fills the orders that in their own books that front-running can't happen at all right that's correct so with the order matching model front-running cannot happen at all miners can't front run other traders can't front run but the relayer that is doing the matching they could front run they they have full control over the trade execution process so you have to you know there's some degree of trust there generally these are you know entities that are running a for-profit business they have a reputation to uphold so front running would be a pretty bad idea for them if they wanted to continue to operate their business but it is feasible that they could do that okay I actually want to switch over now to discussing some regulatory issues how would a decentralized exchange deal with regulatory issues like for instance what if there was a decentralized exchange that was selling for instance an unregistered security and the SEC wanted to stop that from happening would they be able to do that well so I think it depends on a few different things so real ayres you know these are people that are incorporating and running for-profit businesses and I think there is a lot of gray area when it comes to regulations in this space right now but you know the the pioneers the real layers that are that are you know creating businesses now I think they're pretty cognizant of that fact they have good legal counsel and they're you know doing their best to make sure they're operating in a legally compliant way but I you know I I think there are ways that 0x protocol could used to trade all sorts of different aetherium assets that would be pretty hard to prevent you know it if I wanted to enter into a trade with someone else privately and men kind of do this private over-the-counter trade I don't really think that there is anything to prevent that at the moment but there's also you know there's these other projects that are that are looking at things like kyc and AML for being able to access securities tokens so you know these would be registered securities on the etherion blockchain so like Harbor and polymath are looking at things like that and and that would be kind of a layer underneath 0x protocol that would that would prevent people from accessing unregistered her would prevent people from accessing securities tokens if they hadn't gone through a ky caml process and kyc AM L stands for no your customer and anti-money laundering processes so okay so it sounds like real ayres can institute kyc and AML processes is that what you were saying earlier oh yeah absolutely there I mean whether or not they they can whether or not they need to or if it's necessary I don't know not sure I think you know it's something we're still figuring out okay and then I didn't understand what you were saying about the harbor and polymath I do I don't know what they're doing but is that something that's different from the possibility of a relay er implementing kyc and AML processes yeah so Harbor and polymath are creating a new token standard that these are separate projects so they have somewhat separate approaches but they're basically taking the ERC 20 token and they're adding a white list of aetherium addresses to that token and white list you know contains aetherium addresses that correspond to people that have gone through an off chain AYC AML process and only people that have gone through that process are actually even able to receive the token or hold the token so you know if I if I have gone through kyc AML I own this security that is represented as a token on the etherion blockchain and I try and transfer that token to someone that has not gone through kyc AML that transaction would fail that would still have the token and this would you know this is kind of a layer underneath to your X protocol where if I owned a security token and I try and exchange that token with someone else or whatever ether that trade would fail if my counterparty had not gone through that kyc AML process so yeah so it's kind of cool that there's a completely separate project but they're and they're tackling this problem that they're tackling this problem at a different layer in the stack and to go back also to a little bit more like law enforcement type things I also wanted to ask so if something goes wrong on a centralized exchange it's completely clear you know that that exchange is liable but what if there's some incident that occurs on a decentralized exchange then how does that work like you know in the case where ether Delta got hacked was there someone that you could point to as saying like you know they messed up or you know in any other example where something might go wrong with a decentralized exchange who would be considered liable so that's a tough question I think it really depends on what was to go wrong I don't think there are very many things that could go wrong you know that would be kind of like a systemic risk to everyone yeah I think like with ether Delta so ether Delta is is this kind of like for-profit decentralized exchange running their proprietary system of smart contracts and I believe their DNS got hacked so someone got access to their ether Delta comm DNS and the way that ether Delta works is they kind of allowed people to create an ether Delta specific wallet in their browser so generate a new private key and send their digital currency to that private key and so when someone took over their DNS it allowed the attacker to kind of ask people to do some you know basically you know send their private key to the hacker and some people did that and lost money I think generally that was a really poor way of doing private key management you know you shouldn't be generating a private key for you know a specific website and the way that the private key was kind of it was bad private key hygiene you know ideally you'll be using something like a ledger Hardware wallet to trade on the decentralized exchange and you you know your private key is very far removed from anyone on the internet and every single trip you know every single action that you take that requires access to the private key has to go through your ledger and you can kind of examine exactly what's going to happen in that transaction so so I think you know I think ether Delta the way they got attacked was like like a very unique attack but I think generally you know it's going to be really hard for large catastrophic failures to occur for decentralized exchanges in the same way that they do occur frequently for centralized ones yeah there might be some people that get you know tricked into doing something with their private key that you know makes causes them to lose money but I think that's more of a new user experience or user interface type of issue that needs to be resolved let's talk about the ZRX token what is the purpose of this ERX token yeah so this seems to be one of the questions that we get a lot of confusion around but it's really you know it's pretty simple so as your X is a governance token the 0x protocol system of smart contracts is a pipeline of contracts on the etherion blockchain these 0x orders kind of enter one end of that pipeline and token balances are modified at the other end of the pipeline and the pipeline is broken into segments so individual smart contracts that are responsible for different parts of the trade execution are trade settlement process and the ZRX token is used as a governance token that allows us to upgrade or swap out different sections of that smart contract pipeline without bringing all of the markets to a halt and without requiring us to kind of deploy this brand-new pipeline in in my grade you know tens of thousands or whatever number of users over to this brand-new pipeline so we can we can just upgrade our current pipeline over time without you know making it a super disruptive process so how will this upgrades work like how well will I vote with the token or how does that work right so today the governance process is is not defined we have a placeholder governance module that you know is just kind of a multi-sig with a speed bump that prevents us from doing anything malicious but that placeholder will eventually be replaced with some sort of the centralized governance system that uses the ZRX token as the primary lever over which these upgrades or are either approved or denied and you know I think decentralized governance is one of the most challenging issues in both in the blockchain space and in the real world creating a governance system that is functional but also robust and resilient to attack is really challenging and you know we did not want to jump into anything too quickly and potentially put our entire project at risk you know even if our the system that we've designed is the perfect system for trades and for key centralized exchange the entire project could fail if we were to implement a mediocre decentralized governance system early on and you know before we were ready okay yeah I do know that also the token will be used to pay relayer fees is that correct yeah yeah so the reasoning behind this was that so this is actually a controversial point some people do not like the fact that we chose to have the zr x token used to pay trading fees they you know it can feel kind of arbitrary like why wouldn't i just pay with ether it can be kind of annoying as you're getting set up to do some trades like you know oh I want to go trade right now but I have to go purchase some of these zr x tokens but we have you know we spent a lot of time thinking about this early on and i think our rationale for having the zr x token used for paying trading fees is a valid one and a logical one and the reasoning is that you know the primary purpose for the zr x token is for governance for kind of upgrading this pipeline of smart contracts without bringing all of the markets to a halt but who do we want to be holding on to these tokens who do we want to be driving the governance process forward and if the only purpose for the token was strictly governance the people that would be holding on to this token would be the real Ayres so the different groups of people that have built for-profit businesses on top of Xerox protocol and you know that would be okay but you know that's only half of the ecosystem so half of the ecosystem are these people that are building relays and facilitating trains the other half are the people that are using these relays so so the end users of the protocol and if the only people that are driving the governance process and the evolution of the protocol over time are these for-profit businesses well there are incentives do not necessarily aligned with their end users and what we've seen you know in the past is that if governance if the governance system kind of is a favoring one group of people over another group and the imbalance is too strong that the entire system just generally will rip itself apart so you know we thought about this quite a while we looked at the different ways that we could potentially you know ensure that there is a broader participation in governance and eventually decided that okay if you want to access Xerox protocols functionality you want to be able to access a real layers order book you should be required to have a small amount of CRX tokens in your possession and this is a way to kind of push the distribution over a wider body of people that are in the ecosystem but what if we layers set their fees zero and then just choose to make money on the spread instead then we'll users really have an incentive to hold a lot of ZRX tokens yeah so this is an issue that we encountered recently with with one of the relays and I think you know so first of all like we were really close with all the different teams building relays or at least you know we're in communicate or in contact with them and you know really like a large part of our job at this point is providing technical guidance technical support and working with them to make sure that they're successful and one of the real layers that's using the matching model basically found that it is more expensive for them to operate a matching the real layer if they take the RX and fees rather than taking a spread and the reason for that is because when we initially designed the 0x protocol the the design was kind of tailored towards the open order book model not the matching model and so there's a there's some inefficiencies in the current design that make it more expensive for matching relays so in version 2 of the protocol we're going to eliminate these inefficiencies and at that point you know whether or not whether or not these real layers will take ZRX and fees or continue to take a spread there won't be any economic reason or rationale for taking a spread rather than taking CRX you know we'll see what happens I think that some of these real layers are religious focused on how do I build a business right now that is going to sustain itself and be healthy long term how do i acquire new users and kind of get the the feedback loop going but I think you know once we make more progress on putting a decentralized governance process in place and I think at that point you know it'll kind of hit home with a lot of these projects that okay well who's Eric you know eventually it isn't just going to be will mirror and the 0x team that are driving you know governance in 0x protocol you know I'm actually going to have to participate more formally and get involved and I think at that point it might kind of make it might be easier for some of these projects to really understand like the necessity of decentralized governance and the ZRX token all right well we will see yeah we're running out of time but how many free layers do you have on zero it's protocol now yeah so we were in contact with upwards of like 12 different teams at this point okay okay great so I guess we'll see how this continues to grow in the future it's been great having you as a guest where can people get in touch with you or see your work I would recommend people follow us on twitter @ 0x project or check out our website 0x project com we're also you know
