psp tokens or 7.5 percent of the total supply across roughly 20 000 wallets notably the airdrop introduced a heavy filtering process to ensure the psp was allocated to users most relevant to periswap's vision the team announced according to shreth agrawal an algorithm designer for paraswap to be eligible users had to complete at least six pair swap transactions in the six months before the snapshot date of october 8th eligible users also needed to hold a minimum native token balance additionally periswap users based in the us and china were excluded from the drop as a result only 20 000 wallets received an airdrop just 0.015 percent of addresses that interacted with paraswap periswap's founder munir benshim lead suggested that the robust eligibility requirements were necessary

his pulp fiction nft plans secret from miramax and was undeterred by a cease-and-desist order by the sound of it miramax thinks that tarantino's decision to nft work that has murky rights could lead to other artists making the same move tarantino's conduct has forced miramax to bring this lawsuit against a valued collaborator to enforce preserve and protect its contractual and intellectual property rights relating to one of miramax's most iconic and valuable film properties left unchecked tarantino's conduct could mislead others into believing miramax is involved in his venture and it could also mislead others into believing they have the rights to pursue similar deals or offerings when in fact miramax holds the rights needed to develop market and sell nfts relating to its deep
