description today's guest is Andy Greenberg senior writer for Wired and author of tracers in the dark the global hunt for the crime Lords of cryptocurrency Welcome Andy glad to be here nice to talk to you Laura your book is a fascinating look at the world of darknet markets crypto crime and the investigators who've taken them down and even before it came out I knew it was a must read because some of the excerpts I had read and wired I just inhaled and could not put them down so can you talk a little bit about your inspiration for the book and how you decided to cover this world yeah well it's cool to talk to you because I also covered cryptocurrency at Forbes um back before the word you know cryptocurrency you know even really existed I I wrote In 2011 uh the I think the first print magazine piece about Bitcoin for Forbes Magazine and I came up with the headline for that piece cryptocurrency like thinking that I had come up with this clever pun because I never even heard the phrase before I mean Bitcoin was so new um and so it was worth a dollar at the time and to me like I came to cover Bitcoin through covering this kind of I think a different way from you perhaps like I I was covering it from the perspective of the cypherpunks um I had written a book about Wikileaks and this movement from the 1990s of of mostly men like libertarian radical men who believed that they could use encryption tools to take power away from governments and give it to individuals and carve out places on the internet where you could essentially defy all government regular relation you could have total secrecy and Communications and you know for Wikileaks for Julian Assange who was a cypherpunk he wanted to kind of create like a fully protected Anonymous channel for whistleblowers and leakers um so when Bitcoin first appeared you know it seemed to me and it was described to me in fact as a kind of Cypher Punk Holy Grail like this is not just secret protected potentially fully Anonymous Communications this is crypto money like untraceable Anonymous money and it seemed to me like it was going to unlock a kind of incredible sort of financial crypto Anarchy on the dark web and and that people are going to use this kind of digital cache that you could you know you could put unmarked bills in a briefcase and send them across the internet to anyone without revealing your identity and they were going to use this to like do online drug deals and money laundering and all sorts of cyber crime and all that you know that did happen and I covered a lot of different for Forbes but then I kind of like started to realize even at the time in like 2013 2014 that the sort of descriptions of bitcoin's anonymity privacy properties were overblown maybe imperfect you know but it took me really until 2020 I have to admit to fully realize how completely opposite of correct that had been about this that Bitcoin is the opposite of untraceable and in 2020 or so is when I began to see Department of Justice announcements where they were thanking chain analysis so cryptocurrency tracing company again and again as part of these like massive takedowns and busts and indictments and that's when I saw that like it wasn't just that Bitcoin was like a little bit traceable it was truly like the opposite of how it had been described the opposite of this Cypher Punk idea of it and cryptocurrency uh in the large part like other cryptocurrencies too are completely traceable and had served as this kind of trap I began to see for people seeking Financial privacy and especially criminals for fully a decade and you know once I saw that I began to like seek out the the people who are smarter than me and had realized that earlier and had used this traceability of cryptocurrency as a kind of incredibly powerful investigative tool to go you know on the Spree of takedowns and busts and and really turn the dark web inside out and arrest hundreds and hundreds of people so that that story of those detectives who who did that is really the the story of tracers in the dark this book and out of curiosity when you say it was in 2020 that you realize that um do you remember which cases that was I was just scanning my mind trying to think of like I think it was actually let's see so there was first the seizure of a billion dollars worth of bitcoin from this individual X as as he or she was called who was a a hacker who had taken the money from the Silk Road 70 000 Bitcoins um from the Silk Road while it was still online the Silk Road dark web drug Market somebody had hacked the Silk Road grabbed 70 000 Bitcoins and then I think because that person probably knew that it was dangerous to spend them had just kind of held on to them out of fear for seven years as they grew to be worth uh more than a billion dollars a billion in 2020 ultimately more by the time you know that I was writing about this in the book and it was IRS criminal investigations in fact my kind of protagonist tigraine demberian who despite the fact that the hacker never spent those coins he actually I guess moose or he or she or whatever moved some of them through one exchange but very small amount that was enough for for this IRS criminal investigator teeth were in comparion to track him down and convince individual X whoever that is to turn over the money uh in in exchange for not being prosecuted that was the biggest seizure of not just cryptocurrency but money of any kind in Department of Justice history so that's what made me initially start thinking about tree analysis but then I saw I think also the same year that they've been involved in a terrorist financing case that was described as like the biggest cryptocurrency involved terrorist financing case ever and then also a North Korean hacker you know Big Heist um that had been traced and the money had turns out mostly had not been recovered but had been sanctioned and this was another you know Big Chain analysis win that the Department of Justice you know credited them for so I think after it was maybe just those three where I began to look more closely then I started talking to Jonathan Levin one of the co-founders of chain analysis my initial idea was like maybe I'll just write like a quick profile of this interesting company and I I learned very quickly from Jonathan just how many of the major major cases that I had even covered over the past decade chain analysis had played a role in you know from the from tracking the very first case that they did almost as a kind of proof of concept was tracking down the the stolen half billion dollars of Mount gox money you know the first like major theft mystery in the history of cryptocurrency they really kind of quietly solved that case and then they were involved in the takedown of alpha Bay which was a story that I the alphabet you know being a dark web Market that grew to be 10 times the size of the Silk Road that was a story that I had covered when it it broke but I had no idea of the role the cryptocurrency tracing had played in this epic investigation and then finally like the other maybe the other like biggest case that I tell um in the book is welcome to video this child sexual abuse materials dark web Market that chain analysis helped not only take down but they helped to trace the payments for child exploitation materials of hundreds and hundreds of men around the world who are uploading and downloading and you know physically abusing children and helped to really find and arrest those pedophiles and to rescue 23 kids so you know once I saw that there were these actually almost like a three-act structure it seemed like of these gigantic cases that were still unfolding when I Came Upon This I saw that there was a book to write about this notion of cryptocurrency tracing and about the kind of like incredible 180 that not only I but I think the whole cryptocurrency Community has had in our ideas about bitcoin's privacy you know maybe you knew that ahead of time but I didn't like I I really was surprised that that Bitcoin turned out to be so not private like truly transparent yeah I mean I think before then I remember I had had Catherine Hahn on my show and she definitely talked about that and just like how much she loved um using crypto for cases so I had some awareness that this was something that the government like felt was a boon to them so in that regard like maybe I had that inkling just from talking to her um and and one thing I want to mention for the listeners is um actually a number of these cases that Annie just mentioned we've done previous episodes about so I will put those in the show notes but one thing that struck me about your book was It was kind of amazing to me how much you got these government investigators to open up about their techniques and I was curious just how hard that was or what negotiations you had to do or whether they were like no we want to kind of like you know be proud and and just loud about what it is that we've managed to accomplish yeah I mean it was a kind of constant tension in the reporting like they wanted you know to tell these stories I wanted to tell the stories obviously they wanted credit for a lot of the incredible work that they had done these agents and prosecutors entry analysis but they also I think you know there was a certain like invisible line they didn't want to cross of revealing sources and methods and in specific cryptocurrency tracing techniques and I was kind of constantly battling to like push them to like say a little more or to like figure out um sometimes I was kind of triangulating among them like um you know they didn't really like confer very in a very organized way about how much they were going to tell me so sometimes I could combine different things and you know different sources told me to figure things out but also I think maybe like the the most important initial thing that unlocked so much of the story was that I didn't try to talk to the FBI or uh the DEA or you know one of these like law enforcement agencies that everybody's heard of it was a major player in this story was IRS criminal investigations which is this string change law enforcement agency within IRS and they don't get any credit for from anybody ever like they are truly like so they're this kind of Underdog unrespected I mean I think that's I tried to give them due respect but but I think that they don't get a lot of the credit that they deserve for these major cases and so they I think were more eager than other agencies to tell these stories and that really works in my favor because then once you have IRS CI is part of the story you you know DEA and FBI wanted to tell their part of it too in some of these cases and kind of everything kind of on unlocks um but there were serious moments of I don't know where I had to balance like do I even want to reveal this secret technique there was there was in in the case of alpha Bay for instance basically like a secret technique that she analysis and IRS criminal investigations came up with together to find the IP address of the alpha Bay server of a dark web cryptocurrency wallet server in general and they didn't want to tell me how they did that I mean there are no IP addresses in the blockchain so it was really not obvious how they had done it and they also told me you know to please not try to to figure it out um because this is something they were continuing to use to take down really bad stuff on the dark web you know as they described it anyway including child exploitation and things so uh I felt this real dilemma of I mean I guess to be clear like without even really even trying that hard I did figure out a really good guess of how it worked of how this this technique for finding IP addresses of cryptocurrency Wallets on the dark web worked I then had to kind of wrestle with whether to reveal my educated guess in the book and I I went back and forth on on it for like a year you know do I do I keep this technique secrets and allow it to be used to take down Bad actors on the dark web and wherever or do I um and then I'm I'm sort of open to criticism from privacy Advocates very legitimately who were saying you helped to enable Financial surveillance you knew something you could have revealed about about the ways that cryptocurrency users can be traced who are trying to be anonymous and you didn't tell your readers you know that's not good journalism and um but I also didn't want to enable the bad focus on the dark web to get away with these things and I was really just very lucky that in the final stages of my reporting in late 2021 there was this tree analysis presentation that leaked onto the dark web I think you're very familiar with it because you actually cited it to solve a mystery of your own and and uh if I remember correctly about the Dow hacker and um that presentation which showed up on this dark website called Dark leaks had this Italian language chain Alex's presentation that they had given to Italian police which then somehow leaked onto the dark web and it described among other things the secret technique for finding IP addresses of dark web sites which was exactly it was exactly the the technique that they had used and and so once it had been kind of like publicly burned you know I felt like it was safe for me to include it in the book yeah yeah of course once something's public then it's like then it's almost weird if you don't include it so um yeah and then obviously you have a duty to to do so I just love that story because I agree that when you're writing about this and you're writing about crime or you know in our case crypto crimes there's a moment where you are a little bit like okay so you know I'm getting help from these investigators and yet they're asking me not to reveal this or whatever and then you kind of have to figure out like what's the best thing and um yeah I had the same issue with my book um and for one of the things this part about how chain Ellis has had demixed the Wasabi transactions there was a moment where and it might have been like for a few weeks where they were like we don't want you to reveal that we did this we're gonna have you work it out on your own like we'll give you the tools or something and I was like nobody's gonna believe that I de-mixed the wasabi what um and then eventually I know eventually they took credit which was great for me but yeah there was a moment when I was like okay I'm gonna have to reconstruct this like this is gonna be maybe weird but anyway so out of curiosity that was such a great story so I'm sure there are other stories in your book where you uncovered new things or that were sort of memorable for you and I wanted to ask what they were because what struck me also about the book is that there's actually the the main stories that are covered are ones that like everybody sort of feels like they already know and so you know what else for you was something that surprised you or that uh was especially memorable well let's see I mean if we're going to stick with the alpha Bay story which is kind of the centerpiece of the book you know that's one that I had covered as a reporter there was of course like a big you know Department of Justice announcements Jeff sessions the Attorney General gave a press conference about the takedown of alpha babe um in 2017 and also revealed in that press conference that that in this International sting operation called operation bayonet Dutch police had taken over the second biggest dark web Market at the time which was called Hansa so that when Alpha Bay was shut down all of alpha Bay's refugees flooded into Hansa which was being run undercover by Dutch police and this incredible trap so you know from the beginning like I knew that that was gonna be a crazy story but like it's a it's very different to know those those like bear facts and then to hear the story of how it all unfolded and how for one thing like nobody knew even how alpha Bay was actually taken down and there was I guess this like this story that was known that the founder of of alphabet the Kingpin of this dark web drug Market who went by the name Alpha O2 had for a brief time leaked his email address in a welcome email the very first day is that Alpha Bay was online long before anybody knew who cared about it really and that was um when that email address was recorded and given as a tip to the DEA in 2016. sorry I'm not sure what all this was was public previously this is like the story the actual story an anonymous source gave this to the DEA office in Fresno in late 2016. that was in fact like the first time the law enforcement learned the name Alexander cause this French Canadian man who by that time was based in Bangkok and was incredibly wealthy driving a Lamborghini owned a villa and Phuket sorry I'm veering into like I I can't remember anymore what of this was public previous to my reporting but um but nobody I think knew the the story I certainly didn't of how cryptocurrency tracing was actually used to pin down his his guilt and prove that he was Alpha O2 I mean the the people who got that initial email leak tip sort of doubted it they they even kind of wondered if it was too good to be true if maybe this cause guy was getting set up by you know this was Being Framed by the real Alpha O2 and um it was only when these two FBI agents who were analysts rather who asked me to call them Ali and Aaron in the DC Office of the part of the of the FBI they had this just totally independently had this notion of like let's try to use cryptocurrency tracing to figure out who Alpha O2 is to to unmask a dark web Kingpin for the first time ever nobody had ever done that with cryptocurrency tracing and they came up with this very clever trick which which was to look at so-called exit scams like when the dark web markets essentially the the creator of the market just steals everybody's money and runs off with all of their cryptocurrency that they had in escrow for their transactions Ali and Aaron realized that every time an exit scam happens everybody on the dark web and these markets is freaked out and they pull their money out of the markets and they warn each other too you know don't store any Bitcoins in a dark web Market that you're not about to spend right away because that's really dangerous it can be stolen in an exit scam and the only person in those moments who doesn't have to worry who doesn't pull their money out of a market is going to be the creator of the market himself because he you know is the one who doesn't ever have to worry about an exit scam so they had this notion to really look into analysis's software which by then chain analysis had created this cluster of like 2.5 million addresses that they had identified as Alpha Bays buyers and sellers and admins and try to find the biggest sums of of money held in addresses that had not moved even in the midst of exit scams that had sat there kind of unafraid you know and they found some of these clusters with a cluster within the cluster that they suspected might belong to the to Alpha O2 this this drug lord and then traced some of those two cryptocurrency exchanges where they were later cashed out and they actually sent a subpoena to one of these exchanges just before the tip came in to the Fresno office about Alexander Casa's name and then heard that name Through the Grapevine had already sent their subpoena to this exchange and then only days later got the results of that subpoena and lo and behold it was Alexander causes cryptocurrency account on this exchange which really was like the confirmation of of that he was Alpha O2 and kind of like nailed down this theory that that had previously just hung from a few thin threads you know so that kind of like technique and I try to tell all these stories you know from the perspective of the investigators like make it you know give bring people into the detective story um and that certainly was like I couldn't believe when they described that to me like wow there really was a new pretty brilliant idea that actually unmasked the biggest dark web drug lord in history through cryptocurrency tracing yeah one other thing I loved about that story was um and we don't have to go into details people should read the book because um this just gets very juicy but like I was completely enthralled when I read about it in the in the wired piece um but he used this forum and the government figured it out and they were like watching him in real time which while they were investigating him and so that to me was just sort of mind-blowing and in the Forum he was just being his normal self because he thought he had divorced that from his Alpha character and so that was to me that was just crazy normal self is like putting it generously he was like this I mean you're being very like polite about it but he was the sex fiend who um had like an enormous number of extramarital Affairs he was married to a Thai woman but um was like clearly a sex addict who would pick up women in his Lamborghini sleep with them like almost you know nightly basis he seemed to like try to have these hookups and then would almost live Vlog it or at least blog it sort of the next day on this pickup artist Forum called Rush V and when the investigators figured out that this person on Rouge fee who went by Romeo for reasons we don't need to discuss uh that was that person was also Alpha O2 that actually like was a huge break in the case because it allowed them to sort of assemble his pattern of life to figure out he actually brags in this pickup artist form about the kind of full disk encryption that he uses on his laptop they knew that they needed to grab this laptop in an open and unencrypted state because of his posts then and and they also helped him to like establish his daily schedule figure out the best time to essentially like try to raid his house in this elaborate undercover agent sting operation that I describe in detail and also you know you could actually see as you said like when he was online because his his little profile like this little figure next to his account would would light up green when he was online on this pickup artist for him so that's when they saw that uh on the Forum like when the actual DEA agent was like monitoring this 24 7 they could see when he was online and when his computer would be open and and vulnerable to them seizing it essentially yeah the other thing I have to say is I know people often make jokes about like the government being inept and stuff but reading your book gives like a very different impression because um for a lot of these cases so many things had to go right for them to um capture these people or you know take down the site or whatever and time and again they do it which is like pretty amazing especially because for some of them these cases involve like on not only different agencies but like International um cooperation like with multiple countries I mean it's it's a truly fascinating and there's a lot of good acting that has to take place to catch them and yeah anyway I was truly fascinated I mean I think you're like uh like finishing the story about Alpha Bay there's a good example of this but it's I think you know it doesn't I guess that it's true that all these things worked out you know they had a kind of super weapon here and with cryptocurrency tracing that I think um none of the their targets really understood like the degree to which it was possible to to unveil all of these you know supposedly secret transactions and that was like an enormous advantage that law enforcement had um but then you know like with the takedown of cause specifically they found his server um using that secret IP address identification technique that I just described but then uh when they put when they sent people to Lithuania where the server was uh kept in a data center their their goal was in this elaborate you know coordinated takedown to catch him logged into that server like monitor connect to the server monitor it in real time and then basically crash a car into his front gate pull trick him into coming out of his house and arrest him get his laptop open and logged into Alpha Bay while they also could see that connection on the server they actually crashed the server immediately and um they thought that they'd screwed the whole thing up like um they were like oh now he's gonna see that Alpha Bay is down all he has to do is close the lid of his laptop and the whole thing falls apart because he has like been completely encrypted all the evidence they need to to Really catch him red-handed um and so they had to kind of scramble to put everything into motion at that moment and they actually you know it took them months to get access to the server when it rebooted it was still encrypted but um the but they did so I won't describe like all the action they'll leave that for the people to read the book but they did get his laptop in an open State and uh I hope this is not a spoiler I think people maybe know this who've read you know read about Alpha Bay cause died in a Thai jail cell and that was nobody's intention as far as as the people I spoke to I mean they were they found that to be like a tragic anti-climax an enormous disappointments and to say the least that like the target of this investigation that they had you know been tracking and surveilling and working to capture for nine months died before they could prosecute him and that is an open-ended mystery too I mean I did my best to figure out if he was murdered as his defense attorney and mother tell me or if he committed suicide as prosecutors and agents and long you know the Thai law enforcement agents tell me and I could not come to a you know conclusion about that so I think in a sense after this incredible victory of taking that Alpha Bay and by the way taking over Hansa and running it in secret as this elaborate trap the whole investigation still was in some ways unfulfilling for these prosecutors and agents who didn't get their guy I mean he his death was you know um a really tragic outcome yeah that's interesting that you don't have a conclusion with that because from the way I read it it seemed obvious that he had committed suicide um maybe I'll have to go back and give it a closer read but that's interesting I mean it's it's um there are signs that he may have like I I got as far as getting the jail cell video you know of his self um moments in the minutes before his death and this corner is report and I visited that jail cell where he died even I was in that cell and I saw that there were cameras and that's why I knew to ask um for that video um and I still don't feel like I know with any kind of journalistic in any sort of like definitive conclusion that I would share what what happens I have you know maybe uh like on different days I have different feelings about what happened but but ultimately in that video of of his jail cell there's a 30 minute Gap at the moment when he died you cannot in the time you know the ties told me that Gap is just comes from the fact that nothing happens like you cannot see the back of the cell where he um either was killed or hung himself in this sort of bathroom area um and they said that like all you see for those 30 minutes is nothing nobody comes into the cell nothing moves in the frame so we just deleted that um his defense attorney says well that why would they delete that that is what proves that nobody killed him if nobody killed him that's even more suspicious that they would have deleted those minutes so you know I I when I I feel like when I go when I talk to the the the Thai guards I even spoke to the guards who were on duty at the time and they seemed extremely casual speaking to me about it they did not they were not like sweating or whatever um but then I talked to his defense attorney and he's rightfully extremely suspicious um and I do feel like I have to kind of if I had to walk away from it as a kind of open a cold case you know something I can't really solve wait so the ties actually deleted that oh oh okay there's half an hour of missing of missing footage from his jail cell at that moment okay okay huh all right well I guess yeah unfortunately now then they like erased the evidence which is annoying but um all right right did they say that they they erased like they raised this 30 minutes of of you know still essentially nothing happening on camera to save space on the hard drive which I wouldn't you know I don't want to like attribute to to malice what may have truly just been incompetence like the Thai government probably isn't used to reporters asking to see these videos so um yeah I don't know it's okay this is not a cryptocurrency story it's a true crime story that I have truly that is going to kind of like bother me probably for the rest of my career yeah yeah well there's probably a bunch of those that everybody has all right in a moment we're gonna talk more about the book and ask more open-ended questions about crypto reporting but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible

something that was untraceable and in your book you actually talk about maybe the first person who kind of pointed out that that's very much not the case uh and it's the story of Sarah it's Michael John or Michael John I think it's Michael John yeah Michael John okay and so I was curious if you could just describe what it was that she did and why that was so groundbreaking at that time yeah so Sarah Michael John uh was a graduate researcher at the university University of California San Diego and she was a you know a very a very brilliant cryptographer who had I think worked on like you know crypto Systems Prior to cryptocurrency and then when she got interested in Bitcoin it was really with this idea of like wow so people think that this is anonymous but there's this whole blockchain of transactions that are yes they're like between Bitcoin addresses without any obvious identifying information but this is not like truly private in the sense that cryptographers think about privacy you know um Sarah had actually worked on an earlier kind of digital currency system called digicash David choms system which I believe is like truly untraceable it has it is fully Anonymous it has I think um kind of other practical difficulties in using it but when she compared that to what you saw with Bitcoin she was like what there's this whole blockchain here like I should be able to figure out all kinds of things about how people are using this you know supposedly private money she her initial intention was I think almost anthropological she just wanted to study she wanted to see what she could figure out about what people were doing with Bitcoin and how did the idea of just like writing a paper about that and At first she was just even trying to count the number of Bitcoin users but that led her to coming up with these clustering techniques where she began to to prove that you know sometimes hundreds or thousands or even eventually millions of Bitcoin addresses sometimes belong to a single person or organization or dark web drug Market in some cases that was the the first kind of big I don't know hole in this notion of bitcoin's anonymity like you could start to link together so many of these addresses into clusters that were really like someone's someone's money someone's identity was tied to to all of these addresses and then she started to find ways of not only clustering but sort of like following the money in unexpected ways maybe like the most interesting example of this was change making with like many cryptocurrency wallets you can't send a fraction of the coins from an address basically you send you sort of like crack open the piggy bank send all of the coins from an address and then receive whichever ones you didn't intend to spend back as change at a new address and you know if you look at that with no sort of prior knowledge it's difficult sometimes to tell the recipient's address from the change address but Sarah Michael John had this kind of like now obvious thought that well if the change addresses was newly created in that transaction then I can identify it and then you can actually see this one sum of money go from address to address but still belong to the same person and she called this a peel chain because it's like you can see like a wad of bills almost moved from address to address and you know like a bill is peeled off and like given to someone but then the wad moves to a new address and another bill is peeled off and but it's still throughout that whole process belongs to the same person that's that's somebody's change that just keeps moving from address to address and then eventually sometimes that hits an exchange and where it's cashed out or you know if you go back in time you can see where it was bought with with Fiat and she realized very quickly that if you were a law enforcement agency you could send the subpoena to one of those exchanges and then you know figure out who owns that wad or in some cases who is behind that whole cluster of addresses and then she also her other like big trick was to basically do undercover kind of transactions herself to interact with a bunch of services and people on the blockchain and record all of the addresses that she was interacting with which she could identify and then once she saw like that oh when I move money into the Silk Road and then out again that's the address that I was interacting with well that's part of this whole cluster that whole cluster must be the Silk Road and then I can see Andy like sending money to the Silk Road he must be buying drugs like that's um it's all like it all it almost seems you know kind of intuitive now but with this kind of collection of of ideas that I don't think were intuitive at the time to give her full credit she really like created a whole grab bag of tools to like to de-anonymize bitcoin and I think changed the way that the you know academic world immediately thought about Bitcoin but I still think just to like kind of put it in perspective I I read that paper in 2013 and I covered it and I even asked Sarah to trace some of my transactions that I've done with the Silk Road when I was at Forbes and she did she showed she showed me which transactions I had made to buy like these sort of um small amounts of marijuana as a test for Forbes I wrote an article about this in 2013. and yet I still thought that if you were clever enough you could stay a step ahead of the tracers you could like if you put your money through enough addresses or used a mixing service or something you would be able to defy this blockchain analysis and I think now looking back like it was only really once the really brilliant people at companies like chain analysis got involved at systematizing and automating and improving these techniques and they they had the money to recruit the smartest people to come up with new ways of tracing and new ways to defeat mixing services and all of that but now I I do just think it's safer to say no it's impossible essentially to use almost any form of cryptocurrency with with privacy with any anonymity yeah one thing that um struck me not only with Sarah's story but then when she analysis got started was both times so you know when she kind of revealed that she could do that I think it was shortly there after she went to some conference and somebody actually kind of made public remarks that sort of were pointed at her or felt like they were at least kind of scolding like you know you shouldn't be using the blockchain to Snoop on people um and then the same thing happened with Shane Alice's when it started and I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about this kind of tension because and it's sort of what we even talked to about the government issue where privacy is obviously an important right um and then yet we're both journalists so we um you know believe that the public also has a right to know certain facts and information and so I was curious if you could just talk about um where you see chain analysis you know walking that line like you know are what is what they're doing intrusive or is it something legitimate or yeah yeah well you know as a journalist even I feel like um I came at this whole subject of the cyberpunk world of the dark web and all that with this kind of default understanding the Privacy is super important and the first example that I recovered of it truly was Wikileaks where that's about granting anonymity to sources which we you know we all understand is super important and I wouldn't want those sources to be traced and so I I don't know I my kind of approach to this initially was like that I I found it very interesting and and legitimate that cryptocurrency was going to offer a new kind of financial privacy and once I realized that that was not the case I was deeply uncomfortable about the fact that I was basically writing these stories about these you know kind of like heroic figures in law enforcement tracing cryptocurrency to take down bad guys and all along I I felt this deep ambivalence like Financial privacy is important and um it does not make me feel great that Bitcoin was developed to be an antidote to traditional Financial surveillance like the fact that the government can just grab your every credit card transaction so easily and instead of an antidote Bitcoin turned out to be even worse of a trap in some sense you know I did not feel like that was a a uncomplicated good thing um so I was lucky in a sense that Sarah mickeljohn I think felt the same way and by telling her story I could kind of capture this ambivalence like she she also was really uncomfortable with the fact that the techniques she developed were then adopted by Chain analysis built into a tool sold to law enforcement um she in some ways saw her research on cryptocurrency tracing as a public service announcement like if you think this is private you know you should think twice this is not as private as you think and she you know I think considers herself a privacy Advocate she's a very privacy focused person and and so by telling her story and kind of like making her the conscience of this book I was trying to capture that other side to all of this that like yes um bad people can be caught through cryptocurrency tracing or whatever people doing bad things I should say but then so can dissidents and journalists and activists who might think that they're making you know Anonymous private transactions I mean people definitely around the world have and I think people have hoped too that cryptocurrency would offer a way for people in repressive regimes for instance to raise money but also like you know people may if they're not aware like try to use cryptocurrency to pay for an abortion in the United States or something and then be surprised to find the no that actually is extremely traceable and before they know it like they are being charged with a crime so I no I I as a journalist like I've TR I try to see like both sides of this extremely complicated issue and I spend most of this book to be to be honest telling these True Crime detective stories but I just really didn't want to leave it at that like I want I wanted to try to capture the complexity of it that's I think more than like coming down on either side I feel like it's our job to just show how nuanced and complicated these things are and you know I I don't I don't think that watching analysis I don't think chain analysis is an immoral company they wouldn't tell me about all of their clients I should point out they when it came to like the Middle East for instance it got a little difficult for that you know to figure out who they sell these tools to but I think more inherently like there will be other chain analysis C's you know whatever uh who are Chinese a Chinese company that will use the same techniques and be capable of the same tracing or a Russian chain analysis or whatever a Saudi Arabian chain analysis and then if it's not chain analysis like whatever the the techniques are there they're in they're inherent in the protocol in a way not in the in like the the company doing the tracing or the law enforcement agencies so I think it's more important to think about the fact that this tracing is possible and the it does raise incredible moral complexities and ambiguities you know one thing also though that I kept wondering throughout the book is that there were large parts of the story where you know this is just kind of covering that time when I think a lot of people felt that crypto currencies and and Bitcoin were Anonymous but I get the feeling that that perception has evolved that people have sort of wisened up a little bit about the Perils of using crypto or the criminals have and I was wondering what your take was on that like whether or not you thought people shifting to using more privacy techniques was going to make it harder for investigators to catch criminals or whether you maybe disagree with me that some of these dark net markets are turning to privacy tools you know how have you seen that evolve no I don't disagree at all like I mean it's it's very clear I mean um to just kind of skip ahead to something that happens near the end of the book Alpha Bay came back online in late 2021 now run by its former second in command and Alpha Bay now only accepts Monero as um you know for drug transactions or crime transactions basically I think that's a really interesting example Monero is there's no doubt far far harder to traits than Bitcoin has ever been it it like kind of Tangles up people's transactions and hides the amounts of them and and and so you know it may seem that like this golden age of cryptocurrency tracing is coming to an end that people are wising up but I think it's maybe more accurate just to see it as like a another phase another step in this cat and mouse game and in that same leaked chain analysis presentation that we talked about they claim that they can trace Monero in the majority of cases you know they say that that's like in I think like something like 60 of cases they can get a usable lead in another 15 or 20 I forget they can find the sender but not the recipients I mean it's it's and they do they sort of confess that it's probabilistic and not you know determined it's not like uh definitive but I think that that is often enough that's it's easier than people think to get a subpoena or even a search warrant to to get that Smoking Gun evidence so I do think that people you know like Monero users like get really mad at me for talking about this but I think that even like today people are using something like Monero thinking that it is perfectly untraceable in the way that they may be used to think about Bitcoin and it is not like you can see that trade analysis claims they can do this in the case of the bitfinex bust these the takedown the arrest of these two alleged New York money launderers in uh I guess early 2022 they had actually moved some of those billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency into Monero and yet you can see in the IRS court documents that the investigators continue to follow that money until it was exchanged back into another form of cryptocurrency and cashed out and it does seem very possible I imagine like two analysis had to have been involved in that case it's the biggest seizure of cryptocurrency again of money of any kind ever broke the record and it does seem extremely possible I'll just say that investigators did Trace Monero in that case too I don't know how they did it but that is their business is like knowing how to trace cryptocurrencies um sometimes in non-public ways so do you then think that the future of a company like chain analysis is not really at risk because privacy Technologies are coming to crypto kind of all over the industry people keep talking about how this is really going to be the year for ZK Roll-Ups and other kinds of zero knowledge proof type Technologies I think you're it's a super like that exact technology is like a super interesting question because zcash yeah you probably know more about like the use of zero knowledge proofs and services and decentralized like whatever Finance I've looked at zcash pretty closely and I wrote I think that like the first piece for Wired for you know about Z cash back in whatever 2016. see cash does strike me as like truly untraceable you know I of course I'm like the one who made this mistake about Bitcoin in 2011 but so nobody should listen to me about these things but but zero knowledge proofs are really fascinating they do seem to offer a kind of um true true untraceability with like no foothold for an investigator no like a clue that can be no loose thread that can be hold on so I guess then the question is will the zero knowledge systems like zcash be adopted enough to completely shut down the the tracers and make to analysis obsolete you know um it strikes me that like Regulators are are already it seems trying to step in where technology is defeating tracing like the regulation is trying to tag in basically and sanction or indict like people who are trying to offer anonymity like we're seeing this with one mixer after another that is enabling for instance North Korean money laundering of their big heists that those mixing services even if they have some legitimate users are being sanctions so if if Z cash were to start to really catch on both for people seeking Financial privacy but also criminal uses you know Woods would governments essentially just start to sanction or even like criminally charge every exchange that lets you buy and sell ccash I mean it seems like we're tracing fails like where there are these kind of pockets of like true invisibility um policy might step in and try to squash that you know and so if they're only kind of like a limited number of privacy Outlets maybe that is something where you know Regulators step in and chain analysis can kind of import and it's and it's ilk I should say there are like a whole industry in these companies now like TR RAM and elliptic they and they can do the rest of the tracing so and everywhere but these few sort of pockets of Darkness so I say Darkness like in terms of like invisibility anonymity so I don't know it's it's it remains to be seen I think it's going to be like a super interesting new kind of uh tension and conflict in the crypto world yeah but one question um and you maybe sort of addressed it earlier uh when we discussed chain analysis but I was just curious like do you feel that those types of analytics firms kind of take cryptocurrency away from The Cypher Punk ethos or do you feel like this is an important tool to have or what's your take on it I think that like the uh I mean The Cypher Punk vision of cryptocurrency is is nearly dead as I've said it's kind of like it turned out to be the opposite it was extremely regulatable traceable transparent just not at all the crypto anarchic world of finance that a lot of people hoped it was going to be and you know is it really chain analysis or or elliptic or trm who who did that who killed it you know who killed that dream I think they would argue it was Satoshi who like built the system in a way such that it could be traced you know Michael grungeer the founder of the the very first founder of chain analysis you know he says that like yes this is how Bitcoin was built I didn't do this this is the nature of the system uh it is the most transparent system of Finance ever created um and he kind of describes it almost as if Satoshi intended it that way but I don't think that that's actually that part I don't agree with because Satoshi wrote in that first email to a cryptography mailing list that participants can be anonymous so it you know and it turns out that specifically like only Satoshi has remained Anonymous he's like he or she or they are the only person who has pulled that off uh and the whole you know Universe of crypto Wales I let's think so yeah I don't know I I I I think that uh regardless though this idea that cryptocurrency could offer that world of untraceability or um kind of crypto Anarchy as some people wanted to see it is just a pipe dream yeah so one other thing I wanted to ask about was so you were one of the reporters that did try to look into who Satoshi was a couple of times there was an article where you kind of investigated how Finney perhaps being Satoshi um you were one of multiple reporters who looked into Craig Wright's claims obviously that ended up you know being maybe one of the watershed moments I would imagine for journalists in crypto so I don't know you know what your takeaways are about the Perils of trying to figure out whose situation she is or maybe not the right kind of watershed in that case yeah and and you know out of curiosity like why is it that you think that that's one of the only Mysteries that has remained unsolved so two-part question one for media and one for Satoshi I don't know I I never even really set out to try to figure out who Satoshi was I kind of stumbled upon these leads in both cases one of which I think was like you know the health any lead was super intriguing it still kind of blows my mind that he lives a few blocks away from Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto the person who Newsweek I think I think it's fair to say like incorrectly identify this Satoshi but that was a crazy uh coincidence ultimately that led me down this path of thinking that perhaps how Finney was the real creator of Bitcoin I mean what are the odds that like this allegedly first ever user of Bitcoin and this and The Proven second ever user of Bitcoin Health any were in the same neighborhood you know I mean so that was a and by the end of that investigation to be clear I wrote the story as like yes I once thought that helfini was Satoshi he is not um but he's a super fascinating important figure in the history of crypto that that's how I that's in conclusion that I came to in that piece um the Craig Wright story is like a much darker rabbit hole that I went down where I don't know I don't want to get sued by Craig Wright but um I do not believe that he is the creator of Bitcoin anymore and the way that I came to believe that was that I essentially like was offered these documents that I now believe were forgeries but I'm I'm not sure even who created I'm not sure that it was that they were intended to fool me I think they may have been I don't know I don't want to like um speculate too much it was a bizarre trap that I fell into with the Greg Wright um case but now I don't know I've first of all had had enough traumatic experiences trying to chase this mystery down but I also I never really wanted to to solve it until I thought that I was going to be the one to do it and then it's it's the Temptation is too great but like I never really wanted to to ruin this amazing mystery like the fact that Satoshi is still this mysterious figure that is just one of the juiciest mysteries in the history of technology and I I love the fact that it hasn't been solved and it would just I mean it's just refreshing in a way that there can be that kind of unknown left in the in the world of the internet and Technologies now I'm I'm fine with it and and uh I kind of you know really I I just think it's like a a a fascinating and incredible phenomenon that Satoshi whoever he or she or they are has sat on essentially tens of billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency and not spent it and not revealed themselves and not left any clues even for all of these incredibly Adept tracers that are the subjects of my book yeah yeah well I guess probably the reason is because Satoshi never tried to cash out and so that's really why exactly yeah you know the reason that Satoshi like is the only person for whom this is true that participants can be anonymous is is because Satoshi just that incredible inhuman restraint to sit on like one of the biggest Fortunes in the world I mean I think it's sometimes like I don't know has Satoshi ever been the richest person in the world I think almost um or whatever maybe it's a group but uh but but to not even cash out single of the coins in that Trove is you know yeah I think Satoshi deserves to to to win and remain anonymous I hope that that remains the case at this point yeah I have to say I mean you know I reread your health any article and a part of me is like yeah well okay I don't want to go too much on that rabbit hole because I think this leads us back to Craig white territory but um the notion that whoever it is or or whoever they are um maybe died is like one reason why the coins might not have moved but absolutely you know that's like an interesting Theory I just and I think a lot of people still believe that it was Health any but you know um and I'm sorry I haven't reviewed the evidence of the Whole Health any case like um before talking but I but I do you know this was 2014 it's a long time ago and now but I but I you know for one thing hell I was in the room without Finney interviewing him in this paralyzed State he was dying of ALS and he's like answering my questions only with like his eyebrow movements but um but he and his family just so like convincingly denied to me that he was Satoshi and no like um for for one thing like why would he lie but also um I I was persuaded that that these were like credible denials and and then his son showed me his Gmail account where he was communicating with Satoshi which would be hard you know to fake especially I don't know like um do you do that retroactively how do you do that actually and and uh you know was how Finney like was Satoshi rather like smart enough to was helping me slash Satoshi if we have we're going to go down this this the path of this Theory like smart enough to create this fake record of emails between the two of them from years earlier I know it just starts to strain credulity and like it I just came to believe instead that that um the know he is just like the second ever user of Bitcoin and um and the facts like did eventually with eye movements alone I think a list in an email to me it's very difficult for him to read emails and I I felt bad even like making him deny this in detail but he listed reasons why he was not Satoshi and they included like details of the programming languages that they used and other things so I'm convinced that healthy was not Satoshi it doesn't mean he wasn't like an incredibly remarkable person and I don't know why Satoshi how Satoshi has managed to keep the secret and practice that restraint disappear so completely um it's possible that the whoever the real Satoshi is is also dead for all we know yeah that's why I refer to the Craig Wright thing because I think his partner Dave kleiman or whatever died so um so one other thing that I just want to ask about was you know when I read coverage of this space and wired um it feels like kind of different coverage from you know the way for instance a crypto publication conversator even actually some of the general Tech media and I wondered if you could talk about either both your philosophy and the Publications philosophy around how to cover what's going on in this industry it's really interesting it's an interesting question um I think that you know the media has maybe like gone through its own like cycles of like crypto hype and then crypto Winters you know that are sometimes on almost unrelated to the price of these things like for a while it wasn't like not cool to talk about Bitcoin but it was cool to talk about blockchains for some reason and then uh I don't I never understood that like um and and then I don't know there it was interesting to talk about uh like defy and ethereum and things but uh but it was not interesting to just like talk about more traditional cryptocurrency I mean these are just I'm describing like the trends in the media um and I think that to some degree the cryptocurrency world has sort of been wrapped up in the tech clash as well you know this idea that like we are wired I think have gone through our own cycles of like wired was once you know if you read like very early wired um issues as I have done like the optimism and the idealism about how technology would change the world are just like you know so complete and then I would say with our last editor-in-chief Nick Thompson we sort of started to embrace more of a of a more nuanced and ambivalent view about the effects of technology and I think that came with a lot of skepticism around the effects of social media and what it did in 2016 um about a lot of cyber War kinds of things that I cover in the dystopian potential Futures that that the insecurity of the internet and the ways that it's tied up in our lives is included in all of that and then with our new editor-in-chief getting a Litchfield it's been very interesting because at one point he actually kind of told the staff and I think this is to his credit like it was a a smart interesting thing that like we um are not going to be like Party Poopers uh in a simple way about web 3 and crypto and all of this stuff we are going to understand it and we're going to tell complicated stories about it and um I think that maybe you know it's it's it was possible that like we wired we're starting to become too skeptical of crypto I think there have been so many different promises about cryptocurrency over the years that didn't pan out that eventually it becomes almost like a reflexive thing to the doubts every cryptocurrency promise and I think it was it was you know we in addition to the kind of like big features that I've written about cryptocurrency crime specifically that's my interest um and the subversive and illegal and dangerous uses of this stuff you know um we we also galad Edelman did a great cover story about web 3 for Wired uh last year that was it's one of my like favorite pieces I've read about that world and his adventures in it and we I think we tried to take like a more complete and nuanced view of all of this stuff okay well before we started recording you did also say that you felt that the FTX story which was blowing up right when your book came out was also a story about tracing movement on the blockchain so I was curious for your thoughts on that yeah well right I mean I think most people are looking at this FTX thing maybe not you you know so much about all of this um and the details of the case but they're seeing it almost as like a Lehman Brothers or like a theranos kind of meltdown like this was a hyped up sort of shady company making false Financial promises maybe doing irresponsible things with people's money but then um in the midst of all of this like in the middle of that may all be true but in the middle of all that there was also just an actual theft it seems like unauthorized just grabbing of half a billion dollars or so some hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fdx's funds we don't know who took them we are still like the actually the the tracers that are the subject of my book are watching that money move you know we're they're like watching it on blockchains in real time and that's like the bizarre thing about these big cryptocurrency thefts is that you can basically watch the getaway car like move through the open plan of the city like and watch every turn it takes and if the if the thief or whoever they are in this case like tries to cash that money out I think it's going to be very difficult for them to do it in a way where they won't be identified and then we will I think at some point sooner or later I think hopefully know the answer to whether this was an actual external hacker or if it was wait what are you talking about because uh isn't the I mean I so initially when you said theft um I thought you meant of the exchange you know of its customers money but or by the exchange of its customers money but when you now I'm getting a little bit confused well we don't know yet whether this money was pulled out by FTX insiders or actual external hackers who are taking advantage of this meltdown to just steal this money are you talking about the hack that happened after the the bankruptcy was filed oh got it okay yeah exactly so I see um that that's sum of money I mean it's almost like history repeating itself of Mount gox in 2014. uh where Mount Cox was bankrupted but half a billion dollars went missing in 2014. a lot of people suspected that that was the CEO of Mount goxa had taken that money or lost it with some kind of financial irresponsibility in fact it was Russian hackers that had stolen it and he was Marco Palace the CEO of Mount Cox was actually Vindicated by cryptocurrency tracing through cryptocurrency tracing and I'm not saying that's going to happen here but it's just like interesting to see history repeating itself we're still in the phase of this meltdown where we're trying to figure out if it was external or internal theft so I think a lot of people suspect it was internal that it was you know this is just another part of the actual potential crimes committed by Sam Beckman free then at the ex as staff but we don't know that yet so I think cryptocurrency tracing may tell us the answer sooner or later yeah I probably agree with you there all right well this has been a truly fascinating discussion I have just loved diving into your book and um your philosophy and thoughts around um cryptocurrency and analytics where can people learn more about you and your work oh I guess um uh my well my my website is andygreenberg.net you can find like my books and articles there you can just like look me up on wired and I'm you know still writing for Wired all the time perfect well it's been a pleasure having you on Unchained it was a really fun conversation thank you Laura thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Andy
