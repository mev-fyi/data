cbdc without clear support from the executive branch and from congress ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law interestingly the paper did discuss what a potential cbdc would look like a potential u.s cbdc if one war created would best serve the needs of the united states by being privacy protected intermediated widely transferable and identity verified notably the fed's definition did not mention either crypto or distributed ledger technology in its definition of a cbdc in fact in the 40-page report about issuing a cbdc the fed only mentioned crypto 13 times and stable coins 17 times when it did discuss crypto the analysis was biting cryptocurrencies have not been widely adopted as a means of payment in the united states they remain subject to extreme price volatility are difficult to use without service providers and have severe limitations on transaction throughput many cryptocurrencies also come with a significant energy footprint and make consumers vulnerable to

what miami and rio de janeiro aspire to do buy bitcoin according to bloomberg el salvador's bitcoin trades which seem to come directly from president naive buchelli's personal device appear to be down roughly 14 based on the timing of buchelli's purchase announcements an analyst from moody's described el salvador's btc trading to bloomberg as quite risky particularly for a government that has been struggling with liquidity pressure in the past the analyst also noted that el salvador's holdings of 1139 btc does not pose a significant threat to its debt obligations however increased buying could induce greater risk to repayment capacity remark to the analyst notably el salvador faces an 800 million dollar bond that matures in january 2023 moody's already downgraded el salvador to a rating of caa1 which judges el salvador's bond to be a very high credit risk when investing.com posted on twitter that moody had downgraded el salvador's debt due to bitcoin trades naive buchelli replied breaking el salvador dgaf i'm sure you all can figure out what that means judge rules ripple can gain access to sec communication ripple won a battle against the securities and exchange commission last week when a federal judge granted them access to emails regarding former sec director of corporation finance william hinman's 2018 speech in which he said putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of ether based on my understanding of the present state of ether the ethereum network and its decentralized structure current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions with a decision the sec cannot claim that emails about hindman's speech are privileged meaning ripple will have access to communications from valerie steponic the sec's cryptozar and other regulators discussing the wording of the speech notably the federal judge's reasoning was that she felt the speech concerned hinman's personal views rather than sec policy although hinman and the sec admit that agency staff discussed his speech it appears that this speech was merely peripheral to actual policy formation and not an essential link in the sec's deliberative process with respect to ether accordingly emails concerning the speech or draft versions are neither pre-decisional nor deliberative agency documents entitled to protection speaking of regulation per bloomberg sec chair gary gensler said this week that crypto exchanges should expect stricter scrutiny in 2022. i've asked staff to look at every way to get these platforms inside the investor protection remit if the trading platforms don't come into the regulated space it'd be another year of the public being vulnerable the sec chair reportedly said in a virtual conference on wednesday omg d5 2.0 takes a hit ohm the native token of olympus dow crashed to an all-time low of 98.35 cents on monday marking a 91 decline from its all-time high in april 2021. according to dphylama olympus style's total value locked has al also plunged by over 1 billion dollars since december 1st olympus dow is a decentralized reserve currency protocol each ohm token is backed by a basket of assets like die or fracs in the olympus treasury giving each token a baseline value below which it should not fall essentially the purpose of ohm is to act as a store of value not tied to the usd own tokens are generated when users bond other cryptos such as dye frax or wbtc to the olympus dow treasury this allows olympus dow to own its liquidity olympus dow also allows home holders to stake own tokens in return for more ohm tokens om has often traded for above the treasury of olympus dow allowing for olympus dow to print more om via staking rewards aka high apy to dilute the value of ohm back to the value of its treasury this has created a virtuous cycle in the past as users stake ohm to earn more ohm which they then stick again however when users stop staking their own and cash out the price of om can be wiped out quickly as happened sunday night according to crypto reporter colin wu etherscan shows a sushi swap transaction in which roughly 10 million dollars in ohm was traded for dye causing 25 slippage on ohm trades and over 5 million dollars in liquidations since the initial sell-off ohm has yet to recover with the token price sitting under 120 thursday morning down 46 from seven days before crypto.com

wrong spiced out is an investment doubt that crowdfunded around 3 million to purchase a rare copy of a proposed adaptation of the famous sci-fi novel dune in november this week the dao tweeted their plans for the book which included produce an animated series based on it and support community projects i guess no one told them that buying a copy of a book does not give them the copy right to it i have genuinely spent 10 minutes staring at this but no it really does appear to be true that a bunch of crypto bros just spent 2.6 million euros 100 x the asking price for a book at auction in the
