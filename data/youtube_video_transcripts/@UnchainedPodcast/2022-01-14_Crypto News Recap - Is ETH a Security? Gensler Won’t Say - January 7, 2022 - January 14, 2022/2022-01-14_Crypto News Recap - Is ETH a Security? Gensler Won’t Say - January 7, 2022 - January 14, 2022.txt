turkish lira notably ezra alpe the chief marketing officer at the turkish crypto exchange bitlow told the wall street journal the turkish lira's volatility and rising inflation seen in recent months

hood was acquiescing to a request from citadel however the actual reason was because robin hood did not have enough collateral for the compliance demands from the gamestop mania the move to take money from paradigm which backs quite a few crypto powerhouses like compound cosmos sky mavis and uniswap is an interesting move by citadel securities because back in september founder ken griffin said the company did not trade in crypto due to regulatory uncertainty however based on comments from paradigm co-founder matt huang in the press release it sounds like citadel will be moving into crypto we look forward to partnering with the citadel securities team as they extend their technology and expertise to even more markets and asset classes including crypto wrote huang coinbase enters the
