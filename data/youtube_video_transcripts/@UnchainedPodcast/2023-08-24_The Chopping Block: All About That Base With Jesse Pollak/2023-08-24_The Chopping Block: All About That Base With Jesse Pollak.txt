not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry Insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick insurance first we got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and the Czar of superstate then we've got tarun the gigabrain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and today we've got a special guest Jesse Pollock the layer two linchpin and leader of bass and finally I've received the head height Mana dragonfly there were early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block that XYZ for more disclosures Jesse it's great to have you on the show we've been trying for a while to get you on and we've been talking a lot of about bass and so we thought it was probably time to get you on here to be able to defend your your creation um how has it been seeing bass popping off like this it's it's actually crazy over the weekend it's been going nuts yeah well first off thanks for having me guys I've been looking forward to this I think since we tried to do it at the test net announcement uh we couldn't make it happen then and now we're back here for mainnet so I'm excited to be here a huge fan long time listener uh how does it feel that base is popping off I mean it's cool it's awesome it's exciting to see so much of the ecosystem excited about what we're doing I think um it also feels like it's still day one you know like we have so much more to go uh so much further to build uh I think when we think about what success looks like it's bringing billions of people on chain and I think the reality is that today there's hundreds of thousands of people on chain kind of best case scenario and so there's just a lot more work to do and I don't want to get distracted by the short-term stuff mostly just focused on the long term we're building towards what do you think of internally as the North Star like what is the what is the one true metric that you guys are optimizing for is it transactions is it users is it tvl is something else it Developers what do you think about the two the two ones that we repeat every day are a million Builders a billion users um so it's a million people who are going to create the next experiences that uh the a billion people actually come on chain to use and I think we're starting to see uh kind of that next wave of experiences really being built this summer uh stuff like friend Tech stuff like base paint um you know obviously the D5 stuff is happening too in nfts but um I think it feels to me like we're a little bit of an inflection point right now where we're starting to see real consumer use cases that actually have the potential to bring in millions of people tens of millions of people um and that's that's probably what gets me the most fired up actually I have one question related to that is which is you have this like thousand to one ratio between users and Developers in other ecosystems is that does that exist is there like a reason you chose a thousand to one or is it just that it's like easy to add three zeros I think it's it's mostly that it's it it is it's medic and it's easy I think when we look at the like uh scale there's also some alignment right there's something like 30 000 developers in crypto today and it feels achievable for us to get like 100x or something like 100x on the developer side similarly on the user side you know there's like you know maybe a million people on chain but somewhere between 10 and 100 million people who've used crypto before and again there it seems possible to get 10 to 100 x and so I think mostly what we're saying is like let's set some ambitious goals that are um achievable but also kind of like pretty far out uh and those felt like the right ones and then they had the nice kind of balance of also being easy to say easy to repeat easy to drill home as kind of the north starts for our team which I think is really important when you're setting goals got it so one of the big mimetic things happening on base has been friends.tech actually just yesterday tarun and I were going and back and forth trying to trying to one-off each other in terms of our our key price sorry they're not called shares anymore now they're called they're called keys it was mainly you who cared about winning this let me see it for the friends to be clear now that I've lost I no longer care I've I'm totally over it it was it was all a joke uh but uh yeah so it's been taking off like crazy so I think we talked about it a couple shows ago and it seemed to be getting some attention and started dying off and then last weekend it sort of went even higher uh where you had a lot of actually normally started to get on the platform of like NBA players and some you know less crypto native Venture capitalists who started getting into the game what have you guys been seeing and how do you think about you you basically now have this kind of superintendent in the same way you know we often talked about this back in the day on Solana of Solana being like the sort of superintendent blockchain where there's one app that's taking almost all of the energy and transaction volume and uh tvl that seems to be friend.tech right now for bass how do you guys think about that and how do you think about supporting an app that is driving most of the attention uh for bass today yeah well first off I think it's been really exciting to see um and and racer and shrimp and the whole team are awesome you know they've been building social experiences on chain for a long time you know like steel cam before friend Tech uh I think was really Innovative and they learned a lot from that now it's cool to see them kind of like run it back and start to have some success with redtech so we're really excited about that and I think our general thesis is we want to help Builders be successful on base and this is a product that's starting to be really successful and so we're leaning in to figure out how we can support them there's a bunch of ways we're doing that um you know you probably see me talking about front Tech pretty frequently uh so trying to kind of just like support from uh messaging and narrative perspective from a technology perspective we're obviously leading in to make sure they have all the tools and resources that they need in order to be successful and then from a kind of ecosystem perspective in as much as they have dependencies or you know other things that they need to get solved we're kind of behind the scenes trying to make that happen and so it's kind of all hands on deck and I think in general my feeling on this is we're at this point where we're going to start seeing this happen like not one-off but frequently you're going to start having real products that get built and those products aren't going to kind of follow the growth cycle that we're used to in crypto for the last decade which is like kind of flat but like the technology is actually ready now where we're going to start having consumer products that are launched and they grow and they grow week over week month over month quarter over quarter and they reach millions of people and tens of millions of people and billions of people and I think that that is that's going to be so exciting and it for us it's like that's what it's all about it's finding and supporting the people who are creating those those products giving them everything they need in order to build them and grow them and then trying to just hang on and make sure that we can actually keep scaling the infrastructure so that it's ready for the level of transaction throughput they're trying to put through it um and and ready for the number of people who are actually going to come on chain what do you think the biggest differentiators are in terms of that ability to you know attract developers and applications and a lot of usage what what are the differences between bass and other L2 platforms you know how do you think this really offers something different than you know optimism or even arbitrum or you know something that's not exactly the same but similar like Matic yeah yeah I'm actually curious about this also in the context of friend Tech given that steel cam was on arbitrum and so I'm curious in your conversation with racer with kind of you know driving the decision to build on base this time around yeah so first off I think our general thesis on this is that like it's going to take all of us right it's not going to be just base that scales ethereum it's going to be a massive kind of team effort from all these layer twos that are working together to make ethereum scale and it's kind of like the bottoms up version of the original scaling strategy for ethereum um where we actually have a bunch of these layer twos that come together to provide kind of throughput for ethereum overall and so like first and foremost the pie is still very small we need to grow the pie uh and get it massive and that's going to be something that we all do kind of in collaboration I think the the second thought and the thing that I I think we have the opportunity to do really well kind of differentiate on is getting that kind of end-to-end user experience uh really seamless both for uh Builders and users and this comes really from the the kind of close collaboration that we have with coinbase bass is obviously being incubated inside of coinbase and what that means is that I think we have a really clear visibility into like these basically the whole cycle of a user from the kind of consumer interface and coinbase and coinbase wallet all the way through to the underlying chain infrastructure that exists with base and I think what what that's going to allow us to do is it basically allow us to look at every step in the user Journey you know from getting your wallet getting uh you know exceed phrase and figuring out how to back that up all the way through to funding your wallet all the way through to using the first app and then kind of being retained in the in the DAP over time and figure out how do we optimize that super super relentlessly and I think it's kind of a unique thing that base and coinbase have together in collaboration like I get to go and sit and work with those teams every day to make sure that they they are you know let's make sure we're working in the right direction now I I wish I could say that that was all perfect and like that's that's the solution it's like oh now everything works and if you build on base like it's going to be 100 seamless for every user that's coming in we're like the reality is we're not there yet um and we have a lot more work to do but I think that feedback loop is the thing that gets me really really excited and then in terms of just you know friend Tech specifically Tom going back to your question you know I've had a bunch of conversations with racer over the last few months um our team had a bunch of conversations with race the whole team over the last few months and they were excited about base we were excited about them um we found ways to support them and lean in and we're grateful that they're building with us and so there's not like one thing here I'd say it's more just like you know a bunch of opportunities coming together and us getting to work together to build a future so super excited about building with them let me ask one you know follow-up question then so you've mentioned a few times that you were able to really support them you know from the perspective of creating a chain you know what specific things did you do to support them yeah I think it's still really early in the journey right like you know they they started building this you know however many months ago um we kind of tapped in with them uh and started kind of like listening and hearing what their needs were or their needs around distribution and social and we kind of figured out how to make that happen although I think there's more we can do there and then right now we're thinking a lot about technology uh basically like how do we make it easier for people to get funds into friendtech how do we make it easier for them to kind of scale on top of bass how do we make it easier for people to do their first transaction and so those are a bunch of conversations that we're having right now basically trying to figure out like what can we do to make these product experiences more seamless so if I can read between the lines a little bit Jesse you know naively I would think that okay you guys are you guys are launching an OP stack roll up it's more as far as I understand it's more or less op stack off the shelf like there's not maybe a lot of modifications you guys are making directly to how the function runs um so I would assume that when you say look we're doing stuff to support them it's like co-marketing making the bridging experience easy maybe having an integration with coinbase wallet is that the kind of thing that you guys are are gesturing at when you say supporting them or are there other things that I'm not imagining there either oh yeah I think that that's exactly right yeah it's basically figuring out how do we make the experience more seamless how do we help them get distribution um how do we make sure that their users are getting in an easy first transactions uh into the app got it got it okay so one of the things that's interesting that many people have commented on between bass and the other l2s is that most the other l2s have a token and that token is often used to attract developers uh subsidize early applications you know there's there's a Playbook right and we all kind of know the Playbook we all we're all in crypto uh bass presumably does not have access to that Playbook because you guys don't have a token and you're and my understanding is that you guys don't plan to how do you think about that when you're thinking about hey I want to attract the marginal entrepreneur I can't wave a token around and say hey blah blah blah you know come come get it so what do you what do you think of as the the different kind of value proposition you have versus an optimism or an arbitrum or a ZK sync that that can make the same kind of claim yeah I mean I think when we look at the space over the last kind of five years I think that what we see basically is that there's been a lot of economic incentives for people to make certain technology decisions which at times have obscured uh like product incentives of like this product works really well uh or it's easy to use or it's something that we all want to build in from a community perspective and so I think our thesis is like there's actually an opportunity if we kind of decouple those things and focus on just building a really great product whether that product is the blockchain itself or the blockchain plus distribution through coinbase and and kind of the coinbase brand and channels and Etc or that plus the community that is being built around base and just kind of let that stand on its own and so that's basically what we're focused on it's like what can we do to basically make it so this is something that people want to use uh intrinsically rather than something that people want to use extrinsically I think there's still opportunities for us to use Financial levers right for instance right now how we were running a prop house round which is kind of nouns infrastructure uh for rewarding people retroactively for contributions that they made we're running that for on-chain summer and building on base and we we've seen more submissions to that than any prop house round in history because there's just so much energy and excitement and I think that that's a great example of like you you don't have to have a token to start experimenting with and using structures to reward people for contributing to an ecosystem and I think we're excited about doing that in a more rigorous way because we don't just have kind of this endless uh economic thing that you know is a little bit of magic but instead we have kind of like the rigor of trying to figure out how do we a make this product work really really well then B how do we create structures that align incentives and bring people in and reward them for their contributions and help them grow and be successful I I love that and I think it shows a lot of clarity of understanding what the value proposition is of having a layer 2 backed by you know a super massive consumer facing exchange like coinbase um you guys have a different set of advantages and it sounds like you're leveraging them really well it's been notable you know looking at the stats uh so I just want to run through a couple stats real quick about how quickly base has been growing the daily active address on base is now over a hundred thousand uh transactions per day nearing 1 million which actually puts you on a per day basis or like you know hourly basis you guys are doing more TPS than any other L2 actually you guys are now doing more TPS than than ethereum itself now interestingly a lot of this TPS seems to be Bots and specifically it looks like there's a lot of Mev Bots that are now playing around on bass and so what I was reading a thread this morning by Bert from flashbots and basically he describes um this phenomenon that when somebody bridges in so it's a little bit complicated if you don't understand how friends at Tech works but basically the idea of friend Tech is that when somebody signs up on friendtech they I guess claim their account and then you can start trading their shares but you can actually buy their shares before they even exist on friendtech so you can sort of buy them in advance of them claiming them and starting to Market themselves I assume so you can't buy you can't buy their shares before they or their keys um before they have to bridge in first they have to initialize their account yeah it's initializer Keys afterwards they get the first share for free and then it's the wild got it got it got it okay so my so yeah maybe I'm misunderstanding the thread but I I think the Bert's birthday is back running those transactions so if I see see the urban to sign up for fintech I can just you know you get the first free key and then I get to buy all the ones that are immediately after you exactly Yeah so basically the initial part of the bonding curve is just eating up immediately by these uh uh Mev Front Runners essentially that's how you got to uh get over tarun's key price right you add your own uh so interestingly interestingly just this morning I guess the backgrounding Bots that must have ran up my body because I didn't when I signed up I was like huh my price is like actually weirdly high like this seems like kind of difficult for people to buy because it's like 200 bucks when I or like it was like 100 bucks when I first signed up and I was like really like you start with 100 bucks like that's really weird but I was like oh maybe it's like tied to my Twitter followers or something I didn't even think about it and then you know over the day I was like oh hey guys you know buy my shares whatever now they're called keys buy my keys dude obviously you're totally totally innocuous reasons they change the word from shares to Keys um and then this morning my the the price of my share is just locked in half and I was like wait what the happened because I didn't see any cells on the platform and uh somebody on Twitter said probably it's that the platform is not indexing uh sales that are happening off platform which meant that probably what happened was that the Front Runners who drove up my share price initially like Market sold everything this morning back down the uh the bonding curve uh and basically just dumped on everybody who wrote my keys so that seems to be what happened which is yeah which is a super bummer but like I also I didn't show any of this on the actual UI so anyway I thought it was very interesting Jesse I don't know if you have any thoughts on seeing this kind of organic crazy crypto sniping Behavior starting to dominate on base I mean it's a sign that things are working but it's also a kind of weird side effect of things working yeah it's crypto right like this is this is what we've been seeing in crypto for uh I think the whole history of crypto that when there's activity and excitement and energy you get a bunch of new emergent behaviors that you maybe couldn't predict a lot of it ends up up being put into fast running software systems uh that simulate what what humans might do if they had the opportunity to do it at the speed that the software systems can do it um and then you get like more efficient markets you get a bunch of learnings out of it and you get kind of a natural equilibrium where people end up uh you know figuring it out and so you know I I kind of see this as the the journey that we're on you know base has been around for two weeks friend Tech has been around for two weeks we have a lot more work to do to figure out like how do all these systems fit together in a way that uh you know uh can reach billions of people and so that's mostly what we're focused on it's like how do we make this work really well for the next million people um and how do we make sure that that's done in a way that's super thoughtful so as I was playing around with friendtech one of the things that I thought would be really great to do on the show so you know we're we're investors the four of us and we've spent a lot of time looking at different social apps and different pitches for social applications in crypto and obviously most of those applications have not really worked and so what I'd love to do is just kind of do a little bit of a tear down and a bit of a retro of like why why has friendtech been so effective like what are the things that it got right that many other applications that try to do the same kind of thing like this is actually the idea of speculating on your friends or on social media identities uh is actually an old idea it's actually been tried many times before in crypto and in previous iterations it didn't really work so I'm curious from a lot of you but Jesse and also you know Tom true and Robert what have you seen in friendtech that they got right that other previous attempts to do this have failed I I mean there's a lot I think there's uh technical decisions and sort of product decisions that have been pretty pretty spot on uh technically I think some of the choices they made I think I it's very easy to comment to Big clout which is probably the most you know in recent memory closest sort of uh similar product to to what frontex doing very very different sort of technical approach right like rowing its own VCH Fork that you had to like Bridge into it's like there's like this weird little sort of separate Thing versus building on an L2 with eth that's like you know much more approachable and and has sort of a much more adjacent Market but I think more specifically I think the choice of doing a progressive web app plus using sort of a wall as a service product like privy it like it feels like a as as pretty as good as you can get without building a truly native application which is obviously difficult with sort of the App Store policies so um can you explain a little bit what you mean by using a wallet as a service app and how that up how that updates the App Store stuff yeah so people can log login to privy which is this wall as a service company these NPCs sort of store your private key across multiple different computers but you can log in using your phone number which is kind of the standard you know auth that people use today you can use Google you can use apple um and so it that sort of off experience is what people are used to from a you know modern social application um and you know a lot of people have been trying to build these kinds of services or these kinds of products and push them through the App Store Apple has been pretty antagonistic with respect to their policies on crypto trying to either ban it entirely or push it through its you know 30 uh fee on on digital purchases because front Tech is not a native application it's a progressive web application so it it runs in your browser um but it looks and feels a little bit like a native application it doesn't have to go through the App Store you can just you know put it on your phone directly because it's like accessing a website um and you don't need to sort of um go through the app store policy so it's been pretty massive I think in terms of distribution and onboarding um in addition to sort of these choices around you know using uh a proper L2 like like base and not for any sort of ideological reason but simply for the ease of access to um sort of the developer tooling the user ergonomics that people are used to um I think those have been pretty massive um and then from a product decision again one of the issues with bitcloud was like sort of the exact thing you were talking about with back running where people could speculate on shares before people were live on the platform and so obviously that pissed people off but it also kind of created this sort of experience where it was not a very like dense party right you didn't know who was actively on the platform um who shares you're actually going to engage with and they would actually respond you you know that when you're buying a share this someone has actively chosen to be on the platform and it's like a live player and so I think those are some of the smallest decisions I actually add up to a cumulative different experience than um on some of the other comps that we've seen in the in the ecosystem I was gonna say so I signed up for friend Tech last night so I've been a user for like all of 12 hours or something like that and the thing that I think they've done really well is that whether it's you know sniper Bots you know accumulating the keys like humans accumulating the keys there's this very quick positive reward Loop you know economically and mentally when you log on you've been a user for like a minute and for some reason there's like more ether in your address than what you like deposit it so like you deposit like twenty dollars of ether and then you look at your phone you're like wait I have like 150 worth of ether like what happened and I think like the thing that they nailed is that like as soon as you sign up you have free money in a very like you know this or away and I haven't really experienced that um in too many other applications and I think like it's such a powerful mechanism that I think is underexplored and it's you know it's a function of that bonding curve combined with the fact that the you know individual is the one receiving the portion of the trading fees off of every purchase and sale but just like one minute into your application experience seeing extra money that's that that's a hook yeah a strong plus one on that I think that that is an incredible mechanic that they've built there I'll share two thoughts so first off like I think just from a virality perspective racer is the best in the game in crypto right now at creating that and so like separate industry from the product I feel like just watching him work is honestly it's like inspiring so something special uh in terms of kind of bringing the right people in playing the timing in the right way and so huge credit to him and the team for I think like Landing that um I think what Robert said on the the product side is is totally right they've they've really nailed the experience for just like the individual who's creating the room because you feel like you want to keep engaging because it's just it's a feedback loop that's positive where if you do the right engagement you're going to earn a little bit more money you're going to get access to more people people are going to start engaging with you and I think that that's that's really been awesome to see I think going back to what Tom said I think that the component of this where they I think are really the first people to bring together all of these technology pieces that have been coming but not quite there uh and that when they fit together actually make a better experience than kind of we've ever seen in crypto uh and that's pretty uniquely possible because of what ethereum does right like the MPC wallet privy right like we've been talking to them for a long time I've known Henry the founder for a long time and they added you know they built on base and they also support other evm chains and that just works like they could just decide to use that uh you know they were having scaling issues and uh you know we reached out and we're talking to them and we got them on a new node provider to have more scalability for their front end like that just works because of ethereum right like they uh when they first launched they they didn't have a bridging mechanism in the app and then they uh pretty quickly just added the ability to bridge natively in the app from L1 to L2 and that just works because of the way the op stack is built and so I think there's like a bunch of these pieces that just work but that just work is the result of basically like seven years of infrastructure Investments that have happened um from teams on ethereum L1 from teams on L2 from Team thumb building this kind of infrastructure around it all and that is what enables it to fit together and enables the person to get to the experience that Robert's talking about from a product perspective in like 30 seconds rather than what you were talking about has Steve with bitco where it was like 10 minutes you know and then when you're in that big cloud world like you don't have access to that kind of like rapid iteration where it's like oh this notepad doesn't work like swapping a new one like oh like this bridge experience isn't great like let's upgrade the bridge experience let's add a pay uh you know instant on-ramp from a credit card like that speed of iteration that I think is enabled by evm and the technology ecosystem that's been built about around evm I think is gonna enable this next generation of apps and I think uh friendtech is really big it's like the first one like they they're first through the line uh in trying that out making the pieces fit together and building a really compelling product experience around it so huge kudos to them for I think showing all of us like whoa this is now finally possible the other thing that I I found striking about friendtech versus the previous attempts to build these kind of social trading type experiences is that uh this innovation of like having the chat rooms so for those of you who are not where when you buy somebody's Keys you get access to a sort of private chat room where the people who are chatting can't see each other's messages but the person whose Keys they're buying they can see everyone can see their messages to everybody uh so sort of a one-way kind of you know Channel like almost like a telegram channel that you can just blast that updates itself is a little bit Half Baked right it's a bit simplistic it's like it doesn't it doesn't quite have a great affordance I think but it's something that is not just you know money number go up never go down and I think most of these other applications like they're just not as shareable and they don't have the same like reason to keep opening back up the app if you don't just want to obsessively check the prices um and this I think is another element that they figured out that even though the chat interface itself is like a little janky and it like is is not quite fully I think where it should be in terms of tapping into a real social Instinct um it it still I think actually puts it significantly makes it significantly more addictive than a pure Financial app especially because for a lot of people you know for Robert if you have a big following you sign up and people are buying your keys and you're getting this instant positive feedback most people when they sign up they're not getting that instant positive feedback right but you you buy you buy someone's Keys you start chatting with them they're chatting back at you and all of a sudden there is something that is engaging you in this app and pulling you closer into the ecosystem something you can share online that's not just hey I made money today but oh I had this like fun chat with this like super celebrity who I who I bought their keys that I think has been a real that I feel like is a real product inside as well that they managed to latch onto even if it's still relatively underbaked as a as a feature of the product I think the thing the thing that gets me excited about it is it's not hard to see how that mechanic and just the experience expands into more complex involved things and so like one thing that I did in my room was like I was like Hey like answer this question and I'll airdrop this nft like I'll send this nft to one of you right and the way I did it is people just replied and they send their ens address and then I picked one of them and I send it but like that adding that feature to this app because you already have everyone's addresses because you already have this chat room with everyone where you can see everyone it's like that's not a hugely complex feature to add which like show all your nfts pick one and airdrop it to someone in the room and do it randomly in a provable way like that I think is is what we're gonna see next from the team is like they're gonna start adding more functionality and they're going to start saying oh we started with this really simple experience but now here's all these other things that you can start to do and I think the people are going to be surprised or my intuition I don't have any like visibility really into the full road map but I think my intuition is that people will be surprised at how quickly they're able to iterate on that experience because of the platform that they're building on because it's just an incredibly powerful platform building on evm so Jesse you were mentioning a lot about the advantage of building on the op stack the great infrastructure one of the criticisms that has been levied at base and we've I think we've reiterated some of that criticism on the show is the fact that right now op stack has no fraud proofs which effectively means that op stack you know if if you guys so chose you guys being coinbase or whatever the the operator of the of the L2 if they so chose you could essentially modify the chain without having anybody able to intercede and actually you know say hey you you actually broke some validity rules of the chain here's the proof how do you guys think about that internally at coinbase there's been this kind of broad criticism I think it's going to die down now that there's something to do on the blockchain but you know last week I think people were you were mostly you know writing think pieces yeah exactly you know like when there's less to do people are just like they find ways to take pot shots including on the show I just wanted to give you uh an opportunity to respond and especially because we've also levied some of that criticism what's your take on this question of hey is it an L2 if you if the fraud proofs don't exist yet and where is that on your guys road map yeah well first off like getting fault proofs live and we call them fault proofs because fraud has a very specific meaning in a bunch of other places and so fault is a much clearer term for the the technical thing that's going on here but getting fault proofs live is like the P0 priority across all of the op stack contributors and so Ops is working on it we're working on it uh and I think if you look at the path that we're taking it's a different path that other than what other folks have taken but we feel really excited and confident in it and we think what it's going to get us to is it's going to get us to a you know stage two roll up with multiple fall proof implementations uh faster uh even if it take is taking us a little bit of time to get there for the first one um Layer Two or sorry what a stage two roll-up is yeah stage two roll-up is basically like using vitalik's terminology of stage zero stage one stage two it's the like furthest along in terms of decentralization and so there's kind of more decentralization and we think one of the really important characteristics is that you actually have multiple fault proofs running in parallel which allows you to turn down the level of controllability from an upgrade multi-sig and so what we're doing right now is we actually have two fault proof input implementations being worked on in parallel one using opgath which is kind of like the existing execution client for the op stack and then another one using opref which is another client that is being built around wrath which Paradigm is building and in general the way we built the op stack is such that we're not just gonna have opgath and Opera we're also going to have a Netherland and op Aragon and up pretty much every ethereum client which is going to give us more redundancy and that's that's the kind of whole vision of the op stack it's like let's build an open source composable modular framework that really inherits from ethereum so we can have as much resiliency from having multiple implementations as possible it's a little bit slower we literally spent two years rewriting the whole platform onto this stack with bedrock but now we think we're going to be able to move a lot faster to get to that ultimate end state so that's the P0 priority in terms of how we think about this at coinbase you know we talked a lot about like what was basically what is the minimum level of decentralization or sufficient decentralization that we felt comfortable launching the network with and where we netted out was um we didn't feel comfortable launching a network if there was going to be one single party that could uh make kind of these decisions around fault proofs or make these decisions around Network upgrades and so that's the way we've configured the network as well and we're actually gonna be talking about this on Thursday uh we haven't shared it publicly but it's all kind of on chain and basically what we've done is we've said hey like we need to configure the upgrade keys in such a way that coinbase is not a single point of failure and doesn't have a single kind of source of control and we need to configure what's called The Challenger Keys which is basically in the absence of the fully on-chain fault proofs who could challenge a proof uh and kind of revert it and so similarly there coinbase is not the only Challenger so there's actually another Challenger that could do that from the optimism side and and so both of those structures basically mean that if coinbase were to submit an invalid an invalid proof someone could challenge it and say hey like you actually can't do that uh and then if coinbase were to try and do an upgrade like we couldn't do an upgrade we are not sufficient to upgrade the chain or upgrade the smart contracts on the L1 in order to make some uh negative change and we've combined both of those things with a commitment to this thing called The Law of chains which is a like very formative doc that we spent basically nine months collaborating on with some folks at optimism we just opened up for Community review which basically defines what we think about as the neutrality framework for base for opium for other op stack chains that says hey like the block space of these chains has to be equivalent it has to be open it has to be permissionless and we have to protect the users who are running on these chains as the most important priority above anything else above coinbase's right to run the chain to govern the chain to sequence the chain protecting users and that access to open permissionless homogeneous block space is the single most important thing and so the combination of that decentralization of the upgrade Keys the decentralization of the Challenger keys and the commitment to this law of chains basically put us into a place where we felt comfortable hey this is sufficiently decentralized where coinbase couldn't unilaterally make a decision that would violate the law of chains it would actually require us at least convincing some other large set of people to do that uh and so that that's kind of what we what we felt was the starting point and then from there there's obviously a lot more work and we think we're going to progress to that work really quickly so if Jesse woke up one morning and turned you know into like a super dark you know exploiter you just go full black hat you know what's the most that you could do just running the sequencer you know to take money from users yeah so the the what what the sequencer can do is basically it can you say hey we're not going to accept certain transactions um like you can't take money from users there's no ability for the sequencer to take money from users you can't reorder the sequence once it lands on L1 and so as long as the sequence are submitting transactions to L1 reordering the sequence would require using the Challenger key or using the upgrade keys but prior to it landing on L1 if you if you were to turn into a full Mev you know uh yeah that I think like basically anyone you know in any L2 construction prior to the transactions landing on L1 there's the opportunity for the sequencer to make decisions about ordering and that's also a part of the neutrality framework and we'll be sharing more about this on for Thursday we're basically making commitments around that which is like uh transaction ordering is a free market and it's ordered based on and priority fees and time of receipt and that is kind of like the commitment that we're upholding and we'll be doing work to make sure that's transparent and visible and if that were to be violated that would actually be a violation of the law of change as well that would be something that would potentially put us at risk of losing the ability to continue being able to be a sequencer um and so we're very incentivized uh and very committed to ensuring that we uphold these commitments we're making around neutrality because I think at the end of the day the way we think about base is that it's internet infrastructure it's it's open extension of ethereum which has been this incredible gift I think that we've been given as a world because it is an open platform that puts everyone on a Level Playing Field that no matter where they are in the world and I think our belief is that that characteristic the open permissionless nature of ethereum must be extended to Layer Two if we want to have an open global on-chain economy and so from a kind of like North Star perspective obviously we have the North Stars around growth but I think for our mission which is kind of increasing economic freedom all around the world that North Star around ensuring this stuff actually remains open and accessible to everyone is equally if not more important let me ask a question that you know I saw had some controversy online it's possible that like you have the answer ready to go when base was originally introduced there was a specific percent commitment of the economics of running the sequencer that was going to go towards you know the optimism framework um and later that specific economic commitment was removed as far as I understand it what is literally published accidentally published on the website it was crazy I did so many reviews of that website and that was there from the beginning and it's like not a finalized number it was a placeholder at the time um and got accidentally published and then we just so what what is the number is it TBD coinbase doesn't yet know how it wants to contribute like what's yours decided we'll be shared more on Thursday yeah okay decided not yet revealed yeah not not publicized but will be publicized on on uh later this week is it 10 uh be publicized later this week um this show is coming out on Thursday by the way just FYI it's coming on Thursday um it is it's gonna be published today when you're hearing this just be careful yeah we'll put it in the show note we'll put it in the show notes once you guys do announce what those numbers are we're gonna be sharing more information about that on Thursday or when this when this podcast is released um you know we think that like being open and transparent about this is super important and I think the thing that one thing that gets me really excited about is and there's a specific number but B that's going to be all on chain so like the split that's happening is a smart contract and it will be directly visible by the whole world of like oh these transaction fees are coming in they're getting split here's how the split Works here's what the mechanics are here's what flows to who and I think that is like no one's done that before right like this is this is like totally novel and you have a large public company like coinbase really like leading the way in figuring out how this actually works and I guess the last point I'll make on this is to that point if no one's done this before like we spent the last nine months giving our best effort to try and figure out how to do this in the best possible way that prioritizes this neutrality commitment that we have that leans into what we believe is going to enable an open global on-chain economy and increase economic freedom globally um but there's no there's no paved Road no one was like hey here's the playbook for how you take a large public company and you work with you know a forward-looking on-chain Dao and you do a structure that lets you launch an open permissionless blockchain and so we have had to make a ton of decisions over the last nine months and we wrote the first version of the law of chains in collaboration with optimism we picked a bunch of numbers we made decisions and we think they're good decisions but they're certainly not perfect and so I think we are excited to hear feedback and and input from other folks across the ecosystem and we're excited to keep you know trying to figure out how to do this in the best way possible we don't have all the answers we just have have what we think are the right intentions uh to try and do this in a way that that feels and looks right so yeah I I just want to Echo that it's it's commendable that coinbase as a public company is able to innovate to the degree where it's able to launch you know what amounts to be like an incredible experiment and do so publicly in the public sphere in and it's something that nobody really anticipated so I you know I I I'm impressed by the fact that you know coinbase is doing it and you know coinbase is obviously subject to a lot of like criticism and you know analysis because it is basically you know the largest crypto business you know in the US and so you know I I think it just makes you know the fact that you launched um a chain within that environment even more impressive appreciate that day one we got a lot more work to do I will definitely Echo that that um you know obviously we all have uh different criticisms of you know there's there's never going to be a lot of criticism because it's crypto but here for uh very very impressive the the integrity and the consistency that you guys have shown in trying to execute on this vision and I know that it's a hard one one of the things that I'd like to dig into a little bit more which you alluded to is the relationship between base and optimism generally so you know you guys mentioned okay there's going to be a revenue split with the sequencer between um some Revenue split between uh coinbase itself and then the the optimism Collective what I'd like to dig into a little bit more is you know a base as far as I understand it's basically kind of an off-the-shelf implementation of the op stack and the same is true for optimism mainnet which is now the what they call I think the original optimism uh Layer Two before they started creating more little baby optimisms op maintenance sorry Opie mainnet open maintenance how do you think about the relationship between these two chains naively I would assume that they are cannibalistic to each other in the sense that you want great applications to build on base uh op uh holders want a great applications to be built on op mainnet and there is a certain kind of zero-sumness now I know it's also crypto and so you know we all kind of Labor under this uh this this ideology that well no it's not really zero-sum and like it's all Kumbaya and everyone's happy but like you know op has a token coinbase has a share price there is a real tug of war that's happening somewhere how do you think about that and how should we think about that yeah well I guess the first thing I'd say is the vision is uh what we call the super chain which like just to put it on like it's it's one unified chain that brings all these things together and so I think where we're going in the next few years is that these pieces are going to fit more and more together um they're gonna uh kind of be connected and they're gonna be one thing and so I think that that means that yes there are definitely components of like you know which chunk of the super chain is going to have more or less of the applications but I think there's also the component of like we're all building towards this shared Vision where these things work really really well together and so that's the starting point it's like there's not just the competitive nature there's also the collaborative nature and the vision of building towards something bigger than any one of us um in terms of how these things are kind of different or separate um I've been I've been trying to I think we're all trying to figure out the mental model for this uh and the one that I've been kind of excited about recently or have been thinking about more is a lot of this comes from the law of chains and the thinking that we've done on that is is almost like a federalism model where you have kind of like the national body that is the super chain of all these things that come together and then you have state bodies or you know sub-region bodies um that are the components of that and that are all you know similarly kind of compared they're right like you could say like California and New York are competitive but they're also just different they're like parts of the whole and they have they're just when you're saying super chain is this literally a single chain or is this like a metaphor that you're using I'm trying to understand what you're saying here this this is the vision of the op stack and and what we're building which is that basically over the next few years we're going to take all of these op stock chains we're going to make it so that they have a shared Bridge they have shared upgrades they have shared homogeneous commitments to block space they have shared commitments to neutrality and we're going to piece them together through interoperability and so we're going to basically build Bottoms Up a combination of all of these layer twos uh that's that's the vision because we don't think that it can happen on one chain we think that it has to happen across many of these things because that's how we actually get the throughput and I think if you go back to the original scaling vision of ethereum ethereum's original Vision was like we're going to Shard the L1 and then they were like oh no that doesn't really work because we want to have more of a free market and what we're now saying is like we're going to do the opposite of that we're going to build Bottoms Up and we're going to say let's start with a bunch of l2s that are disparate and then let's make a bunch of Social and Technical commitments that bring them together and actually make them one thing that can scale ethereum so listen this is very interesting this is very interesting the way that you put this because in the original vision of ethereum right you had all these different uh shards each of the which were going to be you know fully execution ready and able to do everything that ethereum one could do and those genres are all going to talk to each other and like you said be interoperable and so on but the difference between these shards and the vision you're laying out for the super chain kind of interconnected Super Highway thing is that each of those shards is the native token of each of the charges ether and the value flows it's sort of all socialized under a single state it's like sort of one gigantic super State what you're describing is like you said more of a federalist system where you have individual sovereigns right you have you know Kentucky and you have California and you have New York and they each kind of fight with each other and they find for resources and it's they're they're United but they're also they are sovereign with respect to each other and um in in a world where you have all these different chains that are working together in some kind of super State let's say um no connections it just float out of me I couldn't I couldn't help it are you are you telling me you're trying to get Robert to buy a bunch of your shares and that was just a little call out there buddy great I'm gonna dump your share I'm gonna dump you the single share that I own of you Robert that's our key key I I apologize I'm I'm just a boomer I can't stop calling them shares anyway sorry to finish the question and actually Let Me Maybe direct this at tarun and Robert because you guys are investors into optimism so you know Jesse's laid out this one Vision I want to get your guys perspective what do you think happens you guys are I mean you might own like we own a tiny amount of coinbase stock you guys might as well I don't know but you certainly probably own a lot more op than you own coinbase I'm going to guess um how do you think about the interplay between Opie mainnet and bass so you know there's a couple things first off I want to state that we have a lot of respect for all of the L2 ecosystems um I think like they're all actually taking quite different design decisions into which kinds of properties they're preferring so you know I think like in the polygon case it's kind of you know obviously the new token changes things a bit but I think the idea of like having shared ZK resources across many Roll-Ups in a way that amortizes costs for people building is super important I think in the arbitrim case like the programming flexibility is a higher value in a lot of ways and you look at things like stylus and then op I think the the key seems to be a lot more freedom and choices like what data availability layer you're going to use like which proofs are you going to deal with to Jesse's Point earlier about the multiple implementation so you know in in the ideal world I I actually really like all of these different models I I'm actually not uh like hey one of them is actually strictly better than the others there are actually certain applications where you do need DK all the time and like yeah you want to lower the proving costs amongst everyone right so in the in the say polygon version of this I I don't actually know that the ZK sync uh or Stark where exactly how the amortization is working I've only kind of read the polygon side it makes a ton of sense to share that cost across different chains and so I view these kind of collectives at least from an economic layer as like unions that are kind of sharing some resource costs amongst them such that sort of their average cost to a user is a lot lower the worst case cost could still be bad right and like all that's where the different design decisions come in is like some of them make certain worst cases easier to run into or harder to run into but they're all trying to go towards some notion of like certain types of actions or transactions have lower average case costs within our ecosystem so I think the op one from the perspective of giving the most flexibility to developers is really interesting and you know like I said I think all of them have kind of different trade-offs I don't think there's like a hey here's the obvious reason this one is the best if that makes sense like that that I I really think they're they all have a lot of different merits for different types of applications but I think op's flexibility is one of the reasons you see so many developers really quickly jumping onto it I think in arbitrim's case like they had a lot of consistency properties before op in terms of like how block times were very consistent Oracle is very consistent so like it was way easier to do defy stuff there in a way that worked better and there's they end up being like all these kind of emergent phenomena trade-offs as well so yeah I I think like it's still way too early to say like hey this is like clearly the winning you know all ecosystem that takes over if that if that makes sense I'm not trying to hedge and be like yeah well so you're describing the competition among L2 ecosystems what about within the op El to ecosystem I'll lay this out from my perspective very simply so had coinbase used a different Foundation to create their Chain versus using optimism and there's a you know as of Tuesday TBD sort of sharing relationship between you know the base sequencer and you know returning value back to optimism but just between these two paths it's clearly better for optimism for you know coinbase to use optimism as opposed to rolling their own thing fact but it's also far far far worse than coinbase saying we've selected optimism as our canonical chain that we're going to use and integrate into the coinbase suite and there is a path where you know I do think coinbase could have you know said well we're just going to you know select optimism and use it and integrate it and make this the thing that we use and to come up with some opportunity for our you know coinbase you know to be very involved in that process this outcome is like I would say like 75 you know down the chart in terms of you know benefit to optimism I'm not sure I'm not sure I agree I mean and this is this really depends on how you think about optimism if you think about optimism as that single chain sure like yeah that's the case if we're thinking that zero some way but if you think about optimism as the sum of all of these chains and the super chain I actually think having coinbase join and lead the way there which is now being followed right you have Zora you have public goods Network you have Evo like you know how many op stack chains are following the lead of coinbase doing this and my my intuition you know from all my conversations with Osman optimism is not OP main net optimism is the super chain like that's that's what optimism is and um that's a shift right it's a shift from where we were a year ago but that's a very intentional shift driven by the team because I think all of us believe that there's something bigger than a single chain that a single chain can't do at all um and going back to your point hasib I've been trying to think like I kind of shared this federalism mental model and the way I think these things are ultimately gonna play out is if you believe that if you believe that op mainnet is not optimism but optimism is all of these things then you have to think about what is op mainnet and my best mental model I've been trying to figure out like what is what are these things is open maintenance basically Washington DC and maybe bases California and maybe Zora is like Brooklyn New York right like uh you know these are different cultural places and I think the thing that is going to happen with OP Mainland is in a world where you have many chains that are all part of the super chain and you have optimism which is kind of this the body of all of these things the place where op lives is the like it's kind of sacred like it's the place where the governance lives it's the place where like you have the seat of the government that's kind of helping Define and figure out how all these things interoperate together and so you know does DC have an economy absolutely like does it have creativity absolutely but like is it all of the economy of the United States is it the biggest Financial Hub is it the biggest art hub no it's not those things because it's the government and so I think that there's like uh I think this is what we're gonna see happen more as optimism and the super chain becomes more clear like what this thing actually is we're basically going to start to see segment where we see different cultures different products different applications find their natural home in the the individual component of the super chain that makes the most sense for them it's a very heartwarming Vision that you're painting of uh you know like uh basis California and they're you know DC you're the Roman senate or whatever over in op mainnet um it does feel to me a little bit like I think what we might be alighting in this description is the difference between optimism as you put it and op token and op token is also not the same thing as optimism and you know I think from the perspective of an investor in optimism which we are not but Robert into an R um there is a real uh there are real distinctions to be made between op captures 100 of the revenue of this chain it captures 10 of the revenue of this chain 20 of the revenue of this chain um and there's a certain real politique that emerges when you have to get increasingly granular with hey when we have a marginal shift of demand from the chain that we have 10 on to the chain that we have five percent on um that it presumably I mean uh you know again I don't know it's obviously very early for these things I think that's the question yeah exactly that that is going to affect what people in DC think right you know when you start seeing people moving from a place that plays high taxes to a place to play low taxes the real problem is is not even that the real problem is the Alabama's of the world right like the the states that contribute nothingness always yeah exactly exactly you look at the net flow like they cause the biggest problem they get all the like subsidies they get all their Puerto Rico building stuff speaking of crypto yeah or people like literally saying look I'm no longer going to be paying federal taxes at all I do I do agree but I think the idealism of the Union is sometimes more necessary to force it into being in the beginning and like yeah you deal with those problems later like that you have to have that my that level of optimism ahead of time to even want to construct such a union right and I think this this is I mean we'll be talking about this more on Thursday but this is this is like this is the thing that I think optimism very uniquely has at this moment is you have a bunch of people who are making this commitment and saying hey we want to be part of something bigger than ourselves and that that's the commitment basis saying right we didn't go and say we're going to do this by ourselves instead we said we believe that at the end of the day this is going to be bigger than us and we want to help build that thing that's bigger than us and I think that that's what optimism is saying I think that that's what Zora is saying I think that that's what a bunch of these folks are saying and my intuition is like we've seen crypto be positive some for the last decade in really new ways and I think that there's an opportunity for us to build something positive so I'm here that's way bigger than base or op mainnet or any single component of an L2 and is actually a super chain that brings a billion people on chain and so is that a little crazy is it optimistic yeah but like here we are we're gonna do it hey so you're saying optimism has a lot of optimism if I'm hearing that right based and optimistic I guess if only there was some way to know um all right so I think we're up on time so we gotta rap uh Jesse it was amazing having you on the show thanks for joining us and sharing your views and taking on taking our questions yeah so grateful to be here thanks everybody [Music]
