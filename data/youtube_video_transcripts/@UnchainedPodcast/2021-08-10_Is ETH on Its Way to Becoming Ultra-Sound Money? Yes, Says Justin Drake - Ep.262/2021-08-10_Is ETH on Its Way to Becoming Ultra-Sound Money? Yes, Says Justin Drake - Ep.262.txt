to discuss eth as ultrasound money but before we dive into all that why don't we start with you giving your background and telling us what you do at the ethereum foundation now because i think it informs our discussion about the idea of ethes ultrasound money sure so i've been at the afm foundation officially since uh december 2017. and also explain how you got into crypto before that so i got into crypto in late 2013 it was the the bubble all the way up to a thousand dollars for bitcoin um and i fell down the rabbit hole pretty quickly um i started the cambridge bitcoin meetup group in the uk and then i started operating a bitcoin atm and then i started a company that was uh trying to make open bazaar which is a peer-to-peer um marketplace built on top of bitcoin easy to use um and then my startup didn't do so well openmezar also didn't do so well when i left my my startup basically i was looking for open problems in the space and i was especially interested in ethereum and vitalik gave this presentation on what's called the data availability problem so i spent some time uh thinking about this problem for for a couple weeks and i had some ideas that seemingly no one else had in the space so i emailed vitalik with my ideas and you know he he liked my ideas and you know we had this this kind of long email thread um and uh kind of a few weeks later he he hired me and i joined different foundations so that was in uh december 2017 so i've been at the ethereum foundation for a bit over three and a half years and i guess my my role has has evolved as ethereum two has evolved because i've been focused on ethereum too so when i joined there were very very few people working on ethereum two it was actually quite shocking how few people i thought you know there's this multi-billion dollar project you know looking to make this huge upgrade surely they must have like a massive team it turned out it was like a handful of people um and so i joined in uh then and basically working on pretty blue sky kind of design questions like how are we gonna design sharding you know i i started focusing on sharding and then as time went on you know we went from research to spec design so the film foundation part of what we do is um producing the spec for the efferent protocol that then gets implemented by various teams around the world this is a very unique um kind of model where there's a decoupling from of the protocol and the spec versus the implementation and i guess now that a lot of the the research has been has been done you know my role has shifted a little bit so for example i've helped uh hiring so we're hiring we've hired actually some security researchers because one of the things we want to do soon is the merge basically securing ethereum purely with proof of stake no more proof of work and so we want to make sure that the proof of stake foundational layer which is called the beacon chain is as robust as possible so we really want to have this very strong before the merge another thing that we're doing and this is kind of a general theme is that as blockchains become more and more sophisticated they rely more and more on cryptography and so we're building in-house within the ef um a relatively large team of cryptographic experts um helping us with all sorts of primitives um that will be part of the ethereum consensus the layer one my role in you know in the last few months has changed yet again um you know now i'm kind of um at the meme layer what we call layer zero the the kind of under layer one like the the people um you know being uh navigating this this new space for me which is very interesting uh through the ultrasound monument oh interesting okay so there are so many things that we'll dive into um based on what you talked about but but just uh to mention for people some of the terms that you named there the merges where ethereum one apps uh move over to this beacon chain which is the beginning of this new ethereum 2.0 the proof of stake network and so we'll talk about that more in a second but first let's talk about the most recent news so we're recording on friday august 6th and on thursday ethereum underwent a major hard fork which implemented ethereum improvement proposal 1559 and that essentially changes the monetary policy of ethereum pretty significantly so tell us what eip1559 does fm1559 does a lot and you know the one of the original motivations was around user experience to improve the user experience and one of the main things there is that right now when you want to use ethereum you don't know how much you need to pay so there's basically two options option number one is you underpay in terms of the gas price and your transaction doesn't get included on chain or it doesn't get included on chain when you want it it becomes pending for a period of time that you don't want option number two is that you overpay and then you basically end up wasting um some money putting your transactions on chain so one of the benefits of eip159 is that users will know 99 of the time what fee to pay and if they pay that they will just get included on chain so it's a much better user experience eip1559 also improves security and this is a bit of a subtle thing but it turns out that transaction fees so called mev are the fuel for reorgs if you have a transaction fee which goes in the block another miner could go and take that transaction fee and put it in another in his block as opposed to that other miners block and so um one of the things that eap 1559 does is that it reduces the value that can be extracted by by miners or by validators simply by burning some of the transaction fees that would otherwise potentially be used as fuel for for re-orgs and then this final aspect which you mentioned which is the monetary policy aspect is that we don't want to be overpaying for security so when you look at the fuel for the security engine if you will so the the consensus engine which could be proof of work or proof of stake is fueled by one issuance and number two by transaction fees and what we've done in the theorem is that we've set the issuance to be large enough such that alone they are sufficient to secure the blockchain and so anything above the um the issuance is kind of overspending for security and so the idea here is that instead of overspending for security let's destroy the eve thereby reducing the the eve supply basically strengthening the monetary properties of eve and so in a way this the goals of eip1559 were to create more efficiency both from a user standpoint in terms of paying fees and then also from a security standpoint and so you know why does that matter necessarily for the security of ethereum just to make it more efficient you know what is the problem with maybe like overpaying for security or i don't know were there ever times when ethereum was underpinning for it or just kind of describe for me how security worked prior to eip1559 right so what we're actually doing with eip1559 is actually reducing the security in a way and the reason is that we're reducing the the security budget that would go to miners so the amount of revenue that miners will be receiving will be reduced and that will most likely reduce the hash rate in terms of what we're trying to achieve here is two things one is guaranteed security and the way that we achieve guaranteed security is using issuance right issuance is the best form of fuel for security because it's 100 predictable it's non-volatile you know you can just set it to be exactly the same amount for every single block and it cannot be stolen right the the issuance uh in a given block can't be kind of stolen by the next miner uh in in the same way that transaction fees could right if there is a transaction which is worth a million dollars that transaction could be included in block a we could be included in block b and that really affects the the game theory so that's the first thing we want to achieve we want to achieve guaranteed security with issuance and now that we have that we want to achieve economic efficiency in the sense that we don't want to be wastefully paying for security if we don't have to expand the security budget let's not let's not do it it's just wasting money so instead what we do is that we're we capture the value um from the transactional utility of ethereum in terms of transaction fees and this is done through the burning of transaction fees and that as i mentioned is going to provide a deflationary pressure on the eve supply is going to be reducing the the total amount of if uh in circulation thereby improving the monetary qualities of of of ether all right so this leads us to the main topic for today which is this idea that eth could be turning into what people in the ethereum ecosystem are calling ultrasound money so what were the characteristics of eth as money before the upgrade and what would you say they are now and why would you call that ultrasound money right i mean one of the things that's kind of uh useful is to understand what what what is money right so money for me is a money candidate with monetary premium okay so what is a money candidate and what is monetary premium a money candidate is an asset which has various characteristics which means that it could potentially be used at money it's durable it's divisible it's fundable it's transmissible blah blah blah so if you look for example at a cow a cow that will never be money right because it's not easily divisible you know the head is not equivalent to the tail and you know it's not durable and it's not transmissible easily um on the other hand if you take an asset like you know salt for example that was using money and money or gold or bitcoin they have all these basic properties but it's not sufficient to be a money candidate you know you can look at all the coins on coin market cap most of them are not money and the reason is that they they haven't really achieved monetary premium now what is monetary premium is this idea that the asset the money candidate has value beyond its is raw utilitarian value and maybe a good way to illustrate that is gold if you look at gold which has a market cap of 12 trillion dollars it has um kind of utilitarian value as an industrial metal so for example gold is used in every single iphone and people have estimated that the utilitarian value of gold is roughly a trillion dollars and so there's this extra 11 trillion dollars which is you know monetary premium um because you know central banks will keep gold and in vaults and all sorts of of reasons around money and so monetary premium is really kind of this magic meme power where somehow society agrees that this this one asset is special in some way and we're going to endow it some special value and you know various assets have achieved this idea of having monetary premium one of which is gold another one for example is bitcoin um and ether as well arguably has monetary premium now in terms of how efo is actually used as money today it's mostly used as money as a collateral money so what does that mean it means that if as a programmable asset can be placed as collateral for example in a small contract and this collateral can be used to fuel defy so right now there's about 10 million eve that is placed as collateral in defy and and so this this money is this if is used as money in the context of d5 um there's actually a second way that if is used as money also as collateral but here it's at layer one not layer two is with staking so there's about 6.5 million if which is used as collateral money in the context of staking if is also used as money in the sense that it's used to pay for transaction fees now this aspect of money in a way is relatively weak uh because it uh doesn't improve scarcity like what if you used if you know a week ago to pay for transaction fees uh then this eve will go to the miners and basically just be circulating if it's kind of a closed system whereas now whenever you um going to spend if it's very similar to gasoline you're just going to burn it and it's going to be destroyed and you're kind of improving the scarcity of the thing and so that's kind of a a way in which eip1559 improves the monetary qualities um of eve yeah and it does so in a way where the value of ethereum contains within it the amount of usage it's getting so the more popular ethereum is then essentially the more eat that will be burned which should then make you the asset more valuable so in that regard like it yeah it kind of captures that then for this term ultrasound money um how would you say that that description now applies to your or will eventually apply to ethe i guess once once all these changes are implemented first now eip1559 and then later eventually the merge right so i guess before talking about ultrasound money it's maybe good to understand what is sound money so the word sound money actually comes from silver and gold and the reason is that there was this thing called the ping test which was kind of a sound based test to determine if a coin was a real silver or real gold so what you do is that you put the coin on your finger like this and then you take another coin and then you tap it and go ding and there was this characteristic ding that you know silver coins and gold coins had and you could use that to check if they were real now this is kind of a metaphor for something kind of deeper which is this idea that sound money is a money that cannot be debased and and here you know we're using these metal based monies in comparison for example to fiat money so in fiat money um you know you have a central entity who could kind of arbitrarily debase the money and what does the pace mean it means just arbitrarily inflating the supply increasing the supply with these metal-based monies you have this idea of a capped supply and that's very powerful because you protected against debasing i guess ultrasound money takes this no debasing idea to kind of the next level where i guess the opposite of debasing might be rebasing so it's not only preventing kind of the debasing but it's allowing the rebasing of the money it's kind of strengthening over time with this idea that not only do we have a supply cap but we actually have a decreasing supply over time because as you said the transactional utility of ethereum is being captured by this fee burn and if the transactional utility is greater than the security budget that we're expending then the supply decreases and just to give you an order of magnitude in the last 20 well in the first 24 hours since eip1559 was launched um we've had 4.6 000 if burnt and that's the equivalent of roughly seven million dollars so that's about five thousand dollars every single minute being burnt um now historically um if you look if you if you really zoom out the fee volume which is the the total amount of of fees on the ethereum network since genesis has grown a factor of 10 every single year for the course of six years so that's that's how long that's how old ethereum is only six years old and what we've observed is that over the six years of ethereum we've had an exponential growth a factor of 10x increase in the total fee volume for ethereum now today even today the the fee burn is greater than the proof of stake issuance uh by a factor of four um so um in the last 24 hours the proof of stake issuance was 1125 whereas the um the burn was over four thousand five hundred so um you know what what we say colloquially is that we've reached ultra mac four in the sense that not only have we broken this the ultrasound barrier but we've broken it by a factor of four and so once we don't have the proof of work issuance which will happen at the merge then almost certainly the supply will start decreasing and as i mentioned because the fee volume historically has just kept on increasing and it's a very nascent uh system which is providing relatively little utility for the whole world we can expect that the uh the total fee volume will dramatically increase as the utility that the firm is able to provide grows okay so um before we get to the merge at which point it could be that the eat supply does become just truly deflationary we will also um or or now we do have these three main drivers of eth and i know that the ethereum community likes to describe them in terms that might be appealing to people who like physics because they're described in terms of features like a solid features like liquid and like a gas so can you explain that analogy absolutely so i i like to think of of money as as water kind of flowing in in the system and water has different states of matter depending on its temperature and it turns out that there's three scarcity engines in the theorem that have that corresponds to different states of matter for water so on the cold side of the spectrum on the minus zero we have this idea that money if is frozen when it is staked so when you stake if you take your if you place it as collateral and you don't get to touch it while you're validating and if you do want to exit the validating process there's an exit queue so that not everyone can leave the queue at the same time it actually takes several months you know for this ice cube to melt as it were on the other side of the temperature spectrum we have the very hot we have the above 100 degrees where basically water becomes gas and this is the idea of the burn the fee burn where we're literally vaporizing if and we're having it leave the supply and then on the middle uh we have this third scarcity engine which is d phi so what is d phi is basically as collateral but it's not as cold as staking in the sense that you can take it out you know more freely and you can think of it as being liquid water which is trapped in the pipes of defy and so these three mechanisms in their own different ways are basically sucking out the liquidity and like literally the liquid money that is kind of on exchanges and things like that um thereby effectively reducing the liquid supply of if and improving the the viscosity properties of eve yeah and for the liquid version um when you talk about it being stuck in the pipes of d5 since it's used as collateral of you know if in the case of maker dow it's put up as collateral to mint dye then that dye is used for something you know unless that person gets their um position liquidated then that each there is also kind of it's not exactly cold the way it would be if it stakes but you know it's it's kind of temporarily locked up and and not um and not easily burnt um so one last question for you um i think that each of these states has a fun sound effect attached to it do you wanna absolutely let me get my states so we have um gas money which is being burnt which sounds like this and so every time you make a transaction on the theorem you need to here in your mind the satisfying sound um and then we have um you know the process of taking liquid if and solidifying it when you're staking which sounds like this so you should imagine kind of the the water crystals forming as you're um freezing the the the money and then you have you know the the d5 pipes where you have water splashing around that sounds a bit like this [Laughter] great great i love it all right so let's now talk about that big milestone that we keep referring to which is the next big step to eve potentially becoming ultrasound money and that is called the merge so can you explain a little bit more about what the merge is and why that is going to be such an important step to eth potentially becoming ultrasound money so um the merge is a very important step for ethereum because it fundamentally changes the way that ethereum is secured so right now we have proof of work and proof of stake running in parallel both at the same time but all the economic value all the defile all the daps and whatnot are being secured by the proof of work the proof of stake really right now is in its testing phase right we want to we want to make sure that it is robust and that there's enough if that is being staked so that this this proof of stake beacon chain is solid enough to receive all the economic value that's being secured by ethereum now add the merge which is when we will determine that you know the beacon chain is secure enough we will basically remove the proof of work and replace it by proof of stake the the contracts don't have to do anything it will just keep on working it's just that underneath um you know behind the curtains um the the security mechanism will change so that's one big change is like from a security standpoint where we're changing and we actually dramatically improving the security of ethereum and there's basically two reasons one is around the concept of economic security like how much does it cost to actually attack the beacon chain and you can look at basically how much if is being staked so there's roughly 17 actually maybe 18 billion dollars of if staked right now and so if you want to perform kind of this 51 attack you have to match as an attacker the 18 billion eve it's a quite is very expensive attack from a budget standpoint but we have this other cool trick uh up our sleeve which is that if an attack does happen and it is possible that an attack will happen then we can penalize the attacker economically with slashing so we can take a very large portion of this 18 billion eve and just destroy it and this is a process that can happen automatically with automatic smashing um so we basically have a system which is self-healing so it is possible to attack it but it's self-healing and this is very different from bitcoin if for some reason or another on bitcoin an attacker has more than 50 percent of the hash rate then they basically have god mode they can do whatever they want they can do arbitrary long kind of censorship they can do these re-orgs um you know they they really have a god mode without the possibility of the system healing itself so that's the security aspect but the other very exciting thing is the economic efficiency the we will be dramatically improving the economic efficiency and the reason is that proof-of-work issuance is too damn high to use a kind of this common meme and just to give you kind of a reason for that is because the the proof of work issuance has to pay for two things it has to pay for the mining hardware and it has to pay for the electricity running the mining hardware and these are two expenses that we don't have in proof of stake the main expense for stakers is the cost of money right so they're taking their eve they're locking it and so the the opportunity cost of not having this eve kind of working for them somewhere else that's the real cost and so that's what we need to kind of account for and compensate in terms of issuance for proof of stake and to give you kind of an order of magnitude then the cost of money is roughly you know three four five percent kind of the low single digits percentages on the other hand the cost of economic security on proof of work systems is more like a hundred percent annualized so for every one dollar of economic security um you're gonna have to spend in terms of issuance one dollar to cover both the hardware and the electricity and so you have this roughly factor of 20x improvement in the issuance and for ethereum specifically the insurance is is actually going to go down roughly by 10x and we have this meme which we call the triple happening right so in bitcoin land every time you haven't you the issuance uh is it reduces by a factor of two but we're going to be doing at least three happenings in one go because we'll be reducing by more than eight x the the issuance and so once we remove the proof-of-work issuance we're left with just the proof of stake issuance and as i mentioned the proof-of-stake issuance is smaller than the burn at least in the first 24 hours where the burn was four times larger than the proof of stake issuance and so if that trend continues meaning that if the if the proof-of-stake issuance continues to be smaller than the burn then the eave supply will decrease and the the rough projection is that the ethereum supply will peak at the merge and that will be when the eave supply is roughly 120 million so 120 million will kind of become the equivalent of bitcoin's 21 million but of course you know bitcoin will inflate for another century until it reaches 21 million uh firm will be kind of a century earlier reaching its peak and will from that point uh onwards start decreasing yeah which this part is incredibly fascinating to me so um in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about your projections and how all this will play out but first

engineers conservationists entrepreneurs collectors game developers and artists from around the world are building creating and using tazos every day discover how people are reimagining the world around you on tezos back to my conversation with justin drake of the ethereum foundation alright so you came up with this pretty interesting spreadsheet that had different projections for how this issuance versus burn and and all that would play out and you know as you mentioned it's kind of too early to really say how well your projections have done because we just have 24 hours worth of data but why don't you just describe what those projections look like from the conservative to the optimistic viewpoint there's various variables that come into play for example if you want to estimate um at what if supply we will have when we peek at the merge and by the way i there's this this really good tool on ultrasound.money where you can just play with the assumptions as sliders and there's a pretty graph which will just show you the projected supply but basically the three key variables are one how much if is being staked so it turns out that the more ef is being staked the greater the proof-of-stake issuance and kind of in the in the worst possible case if if you know all the if is being staked we're looking at less than a million if issuance per year the second variable is how much are we burning every single day so in the first 24 hours we burns about uh 4.6 or actually closer to 4.7 000 if but you know we will see how that progresses my guess as i mentioned is that this amount of feedback will increase for example as we provide more utility through scaling right because scaling is an opportunity to provide much more utility to many many more people and so even though the individual transaction fees will go down the aggregate fee volume will be greater at least that's what we've observed historically uh where the fee volume just keeps on increasing despite the scalability uh increases um okay and wait just so i understand that because when there's congestion on the network people tend to pay much higher fees um so what you're saying is even though the individual fee per person will decrease because scaling will enable so many more transactions that aspect of it will increase the fees for miners or the tips we should call them or or well it's it would be both base fee and tip i guess right exactly yeah basically yeah well i mean one of the things that we've observed historically um as ethereum has scaled and it has scaled so for example the gas limit when a firm was created at genesis was only three million gas per block and now it's 15 million gas per block so we've had this 5x increase in scalability we've also had indirect scalability improvements for example as smart contracts get optimized for for gas so for example you know unit swap v3 versus uniform v2 and various other defy contracts have have tried to optimize for for gas and of course we also have various rollups which are on our life providing even more scalability and what we've observed historically is that you know as you increase um utility you also increase the the transactional value that's provided by this by this utility on an aggregate basis what might happen is that in the short term as you increase the supply you'll have a supply shock in the sense that you'll have you have too much scalability and then the kind of the fees dip but over the long term as adoption kind of picks up and fills this this uh this gap this demand gap um then the the end result is that the um the final fee volume is much larger than the initial fee volume okay so that's the uh the fee burn per day and then you have the final variable which is when we're actually going to merge right because the proof of stake insurance is extremely high it's 13.5 thousand eve every single day and so the the sooner we merge the better it is because the sooner we we remove um this this huge fire hose of issuance that we're drowning under in the context of proof of work yeah and so i've heard you talk about that as net cell pressure can you define that and um describe what the net cell pressure used to be and how it's changed now or or you know eventually will by the time of the merge absolutely when a miner receives income in the form of either issuance or fees they will sell most of that income and the reason is that they have to pay their expenses and there's basically three forms of expenses one is hardware two is electricity and then there's a third one which is a bit more subtle which is the income tax so my rough estimate you know because we're in a competitive market basically the the profit margins tend to zero but let's say that product margins are five percent you know very very low for the for for the miners um if in effect they're going to be selling almost all of the eve that they receive now when you compare this to a proof of stake not only is the income much much lower because the one the uh the issuance is roughly ten times smaller but two a large portion of the fees are burnt when you compare and contrast the two systems kind of from a week ago to post-merge we're actually in a situation where we're going to be reducing the cell pressure of ethereum by 7 million if every single year that's roughly the equivalent of all the eve being staked right now every single year that is not being sold so you can kind of think of it as by pressure relative to the past um so yeah in the recent past we've just had this huge damper dampener on effectively the eve price and the reason is because there's lots of eve that just goes on the market to be sold to go buy for electricity to go pay the taxes and to go buy the hardware um and and this seven million if um is is is no longer um going to be to be sold and seven million if at current prices that's what that's something like 20 billion dollars right so that's the equivalent of roughly 20 billion dollars of buy pressure in the future every single year relative to the past the taxes you also mentioned you you were gonna describe that so can you talk about that yes the income tax pressure so in the in with proof of stake the the main cell pressure because there's no uh expense in terms of hardware or electricity the main cell pressure is actually income taxes you receive if rewards and you just have to pay some fraction of it to the government and in order to pay it you know you have to go ahead and sell it and you know income tax in most jurisdictions is let's say around fifty percent uh and so the profit margin for uh stakers is also roughly percent roughly fifty percent uh a hundred percent minus the the fifty percent that goes towards taxes so we have reduced cell pressure for kind of two reasons one is because the profit margins for statuses are much higher and two because the the the income that comes in in the first place is much much smaller in this new system with eip-1559 and proof-of-stake relative to the proof-of-work system without eip-1559 so one other aspect i wanted to draw out for this period between now between now and the merge is i was looking at the burn leader board on the ultrasound.money website and it's fascinating because it's basically a snapshot of what's hot in ethereum right now and um so it at least when i checked right before we recorded it led with open c then it was followed closely by coed punks which i actually hadn't heard of until that moment then unispot v2 then axiomfinity then tether then unispot v3 metamask and finally usdc so um i was just curious like what does that say to you about how those were the biggest contributors to the burn and you know how do you think this will play out in terms of like what will be driving uh eth to get burned in the near future right so i mean if at that kind of a macro level the the fact that we have almost 5000 eve being burnt in 20 24 hours kind of suggests that ethereum is providing a huge amount of transactional utility now as you say it is very interesting because now we have more insight into you know which contracts specifically are providing you the utility um and you know you highlighted a few for example which are nft and a few which are in d5 and i guess roughly you know ballpark is kind of 50 50. um and you know you you mentioned this this this covet punk you know they basically what happened here is that there was this this really intense period of roughly i know half an hour or an hour where the the the the base fee kind of uh spiked uh you know to something like uh 300 gray or 400 gray and there was a huge amount of of burn in in that concentrated amount of time because they were actually um minting a a new nft set and so people were kind of competing to grab this nfts because there was the limited supply um and the openc also suggests that people not only are kind of buying these nfts but they're also you know trading them um and that's that's that transactional utility is reflected in in the burn for open sea and then there's this these this our category which i guess is the d5 category with uh things like uh like uniswap um and actually we we do have this other category which is interesting which is gaming um and one of the things that i'll say is that at the ethereum foundation our main remit what we focus on is the consensus layer the layer one the the layer two we kind of wanna we want it to be as organic and as you know flamboyant and and permissionless as as possible um and so you know i'm just very excited to see you know all this this this ecosystem be so vibrant uh with you know as you said there's these things that i had never heard of before like this this coveted punk is kind of just came out of nowhere and just burnt 500 eve in the matter of half an hour which is a kind of a crazy idea yeah i mean to me when i looked at it um it just reminded me because when i first started reporting on nfts i didn't realize how kind of gas heavy they were because i didn't understand from a technical standpoint you know like it's not like an er c20 token where you just have that one smart contract like you have to mint each of these individual objects and so you know it just reminded me like oh right nfts take a lot of gas and um yeah and then the axi infinity thing you know i i've done some reporting on that and yeah like you can see oh yeah this game is very popular right now um but yeah i think one thing i want to draw out here is you know there were people expressing surprise at the fact that gas fees increased after the upgrade which was counter-intuitive since the change was being touted as something that would make them more efficient so can you just explain why that happened one of the things that i mentioned is that generally speaking the the fee market is extremely volatile and so it's difficult to compare it kind of one day to another because there's there's a lot of noise another thing that i'll say is that eip1559 does not reduce the the demand for making transactions and as such it doesn't it doesn't dramatically improve the efficiency so it does it does to a small extent try and avoid overpaying this idea of overpaying but it's it's not it's not a huge thing um and so one of the things that we'll be able to do actually in the coming weeks is kind of look at the data and see how much were users actually overpaying the miners to get into in into the block one thing that i'll note is that there's this concept of induced demand like when you improve something there's just more demand for it um so you know i already mentioned induced demand when you have scalability when you improve scalability just more people come in but there's actually more subtle ways in which you can have induced demand so one thing that we mentioned already is that eip-1559 improves ux it's just better to be transacting on the firm and so because the user experience is better people will just transact more it's induced demand you know one one example for example is i mean even personally like let's say i want to make a transaction i'm going to spend 10 minutes making my transaction or five minutes because i you know i i don't overpay for gas so i set a relatively low gas price and then i wait a few minutes and it doesn't go through so i kind of give up and then i i bump up my gas price and then you know it's just a whole fast and then i end up taking you know a whole 10 minutes just to make one transaction if instead the ux is i want to make a transaction it just happens well now you know 10 seconds later i'm ready to make another transaction so there's also induced demand in that sense another aspect in which there's induced demand is what i call eco pain so right now or at least before eip15f9 every time you made a transaction and you paid for example 10 in transaction fees i knew that these ten dollars would really be bad for the ecosystem in the sense that five dollars roughly roughly half would go to the landfills in the sense that you're gonna buy this mining hardware which will you know deprecate over time and then the other half is going to be used as electricity literally like as an electric heater like five dollars worth of electric heating uh somewhere you know in in the data center and so i i didn't feel good about making transactions on the theory in that sense but post eip159 is kind of the is good for two reasons on the on the one hand there isn't this echo pain aspect but there's kind of this this monetary uh pleasure i guess in the sense that you you know that you're improving the monetary properties of if when you do transact um and i so i think the the the behavior change of ethereum users will will affect this the demand so there'll be this induced demand i find that interesting um so one other thing that i wanted to circle back to was we did talk about you know how bitcoin is sound money and how now you know ethos ultra sound money um and one thing that i do know um you know you have thoughts on is what bitcoin might look like once it transitions to only transaction fees and there's no block reward um can you talk a little bit about yeah the security of that because um that was something i don't feel like i had heard before and was really interesting to me right so when you look at um the security of the other system there's kind of multiple things at play like one is for example what is the the flavor of consensus so you could have proof of work versus proof of stake you could look at decentralization of the consensus participants and then you can look at basically what is the fuel to the consensus engine what are the incentives for these consensus participants go to their work now every single blockchain with no exception as far as i can tell is um secured by issuance uh meaning that there's freshly minted tokens that are given to the consensus participants as incentives to go secure that blockchain to go provide scarce resources to secure that blockchain now a bitcoin um hopes to be secured by transaction fees which is different from today where it's secured by issuance and so there's kind of this this grand experiment that bitcoin is embarking itself on from a very from a security standpoint which is that can it be secured by transaction fees and my i guess is that the answer is no and the answer is no for several reasons one is that you can look at transaction fees from a quantitative standpoint so transaction fees originate from transactional utility now bitcoin is not optimized for transactional utility the utility of ethereum is non-transactional it's in the huddling right so the way that you benefit from the utility of bitcoin is you go buy bitcoin you put it in a hard wallet you forget about it for a decade and then maybe in a decade you go make another transaction to send it to the exchange and sell it so you basically made two transactions over a period of a decade and so the transactional utility is very very small and so the the amount of transaction fees that the blockchain could hope to extract are relatively small as well um and you know there's other aspects like the fact that there's very very little block space in the first place and so because there's very little block space there's also very little opportunity to go extract these fees and this is reflected empirically today um you know when you look at the total fee volume so if you go to crypto fees.com i believe you will be able to see um that ethereum has roughly 20 times the fee volume than bitcoin and the the fee volume for bitcoin is kind of laughable almost like it's half a million dollars versus you know 10 million dollars there's no way the money of the internet you know 100 trillion dollar market cap can be secured by you know half a a million dollars in fees but there's actually um another problem with transaction fees so let's let's just assume that magically um you know transaction fees will will be sufficient to to secure blockchain so secure bitcoin for example let's imagine that um you know every transaction fee is a thousand dollars people are willing to pay a thousand dollars per transaction there's this other problem which is which i alluded to which is that transactions can be stolen from one miner to another so if you have a transaction with a very large transaction fee let's say a thousand dollar transaction fee or ten thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars it can get included in block a or it can get included in block b so let's imagine that block a included a transaction now block b has a you know the miner for block b needs to ask himself do i mine on top of block a or do i mine on top of the parent of block a because if i mine on top of the parents of blockay then i can go take these very juicy transactions and include them in my block so that's the concept of basically minor extractable value mev which is the fuel for reorgs now in a consensus system you want this idea of convergence where you want all the miners to agree and converge very very quickly on a chain and this this is actually through issuance um in a way transaction fees is the opposite of convergence it's divergence it encourages forking and so would be in the uh you know in in a situation where bitcoin is is unstable now another thing that i mentioned is that transaction fees are volatile um and so and and they're also cyclical for example we know that on weekends there's a dip in transaction fees and then during the the weekdays uh a bump and so if there's zero issuance what will happen when bitcoin is only secured by transaction fees is that block times will will closely match the incoming transaction fees because that's the incentives that are coming in and so on weekends you might have 20 30 minute block times and then on weekdays you might have five minute block times you know um because on the weekends the least profitable miners will have to disconnect their mining hardware because they there's not enough transaction fees to um to justify them running the hardware and paying for the electricity and so very very quickly you you realize that um bitcoin will be a very unstable system and it won't happen you know a hundred years into the future when the issuance is zero it will actually happen 20 to 30 years into the future where the issuance will be you know close enough to zero and the reason is that issuance decreases exponentially every four years it has and so even in our 20 to 30 year time scale the issuance will be very very small and most likely insufficient to secure the the the bitcoin blockchain and so one of the things that both bitcoin is and ethereums uh agree upon is this idea of predictability right we want to have a system which can be relied upon for decades and centuries and we've taken a very different approach to predictability bitcoin has taken a short-term approach to predictability we want they decided to not change since since day one and basically the fact that you're not changing means that you can predict what will happen in the short term until of course you know the system is unsustainable and then something massive has to has to happen you know for example they could um remove the the 21 million block limit they could start increasing the issuance again and and and start reviving the the blockchain from a security standpoint or you know another scenario that i have in mind is that there is a decoupling of bitcoin the blockchain and btc the asset and btc the asset which is super scarce like gold can go live somewhere else on another blockchain that will host it for free and that blockchain for example could be could be ethereum so that's another scenario that i see yes another scenario is for bitcoin to start adopting some of the technical innovations that we've had on the firm like for example implementing eip1559 or implement implementing proof of stake and so this this approach to predictability for bitcoin which optimizes for short-term predictability is very different from ethereum where we actually we are happy to trade off short-term predictability so if you look at ethereum over the last six years it's changed its monetary policy for example three times it's once it reduced its block reward from five eve to three eve and then it reduced it from three eve to two eve and then it's reducing again you know with the with eip1559 and then it's gonna reduce it again with the merge so we know we have this um hardening i guess of the monetary policy over time via these various um innovations and we want to be in the in the point where we're very happy with the system we have one guaranteed security and two we have this idea of being economically optimal in some sense so once we've reached this this optimal point there will be no more reason to change a theorem because it will it will already be kind of either optimal or kind of close enough to optimal and so we'll have a system which will have evolved in the short term and not have the short term predictability and then it reaches a point where it's good enough and then it can go live for decades and centuries wow this whole thing has been so fascinating um i just wanted to ask when you said that potentially bitcoin the asset could just live on another blockchain that was you know that provided the security um and you said potentially could be ethereum would that be in the form of raft ether or like you know there was that project that tried to do trustless btc before like how what do you think that would look like great question so in order for this migration to happen i think in it needs to happen kind of gradually it's the the the the bitcoin community is very opinionated and i i it's and it's difficult to reach consensus and they've they've designed the system and the culture in such a way that the bitcoin blockchain kind of never changes and so you kind of need to find kind of a sly side door and strategy to to try and and and migrate the the bitcoin the asset onto ethereum and i think the strategy that kind of the plausible way forward that i have in mind is through these bridges now these bridges need to have two properties which uh we we don't have both for the first one is that the bridge needs to be trustless right because if if the bridge is not trustless then we're basically trusting this this centralized entity to to oversee the migration of you know one of the biggest assets in the world from one blockchain to another it's just not viable right which means wrapped wrapped btc is out because that is managed by a centralized party so okay keep going yeah and the other property that you want is you want it to be collateral efficient so there's this um there's this project called tbtc uh which which is trustless but the big downside is that in in order to create this bridge for every single bitcoin you need to have more effort in reserves in value than than the bitcoin so it's extremely collateral and efficient the good news is that there is this moon math technology which allows bitcoin to run smart contracts or to verify snarks so it's called indistinguishability obfuscation it's technology that we don't have today it's very very sophisticated theoretical cryptography but it's plausible that in 20 to 30 years we will have it and that will allow bitcoin to essentially run the evm and so once we have bitcoin running the evm even with their tiny blocks that's sufficient to have a two-way trustless bridge which is fully collateral efficient so you don't need any collateral and so we will be in a position where bitcoin will slowly start trickling towards ethereum and we're actually already seeing it um if you go to d5pulse.com btc you will see over time the unavoidable you know increase of btc on ethereum and i i believe you know we're around 1.5 or something like that maybe a bit less of the whole bitcoin supply which currently lives um on ethereum and then there will be a breaking point for bitcoin a breaking point from a security standpoint either you know the the blockchain gets 51 attacked because you know the assurance is way too low and the security is way too low or it could get attacked in another way for example it could get attacked in the form of a quantum attack so quantum computers are are coming if there aren't um you know suitable preparations which are done to protect the the assets on on the bitcoin blockchain what will happen is that uh one attacker or maybe a small handful of attackers would be able to basically steal lost coins from the past um and that would be um very bad it would be kind of the equivalent of the dow for ethereum where you know one of the worries of the dow is that a single entity would have a huge fraction of the supply um and and um and you know basically destroy you know the the monetary value and and also the security story around proof of stake which requires the stake to be to be decentralized and so once there's this event that happens you know the bitcoin blockchain breaks all the all the bitcoin that hasn't yet migrated over to ethereum can be deemed lost and the new canonical home for btc the asset can be ethereum wow i feel like this is going to be fighting words amongst the bitcoin community um this whole thing is very fascinating just out of curiosity because you started as a bitcoiner um do you still consider yourself a bitcoiner absolutely um i mean i i hold bitcoin um and i i i feel uh you know very uh connected to to to bitcoin and from a you know cultural not cultural but from a philosophical standpoint right what what satoshi was was able to to do was a real breakthrough for for humanity and we've seen over the period of 13 years all the innovation that's come out of it and i the way that i see it is basically ethereum is the accomplishment of satoshi's vision it it is bitcoin if theorem is bitcoin in that sense what aspect of satoshi's vision is ethereum like when you say that ethereum of satoshi's vision what do you mean part of the vision of satoshi was to provide a decentralized uh trust layer for for for the internet so one of the things that satoshi tried to do in the very early days and you have commits in the repo is he tried to build a peer-to-peer marketplace that built on top of this money layer so the natural progression of decentralized infrastructure is to start with money and then to start building building blocks that use this money and you could have for example marketplaces and you can have escrow contracts um and you can have stable coins and you can have you know reputation and you can have identity like the efferent name system and you can have insurance and once you have all these building blocks come together um you you basically have the substrate for the internet of value and i think this is the true satoshi vision and this is what ethereum is is delivering well this whole thing is extremely extremely fascinating talking to you um one thing i will say is i have said in the past that i wished i could be around when bitcoin transitioned to only transaction fees to see how that plays out but um if your theory is correct then it looks like i might get to see what happens in 20 or 30 years because i will still be around then um so um all right so we're over time but i really have to ask you about something super important which is this idea of eth as ultrasound money becoming a meme can you talk a little bit about how that's happening like what you're seeing in the community what are the aspects of this meme like what are you seeing in terms of the development of this right so um you know kind of when the meme was was introduced um i think it was something like october 20 and and 20. it got you know a reasonable amount of attention on twitter but then it kind of got got lost and people forgot about it um until i was um part of the of a bankless episode discussing ultrasound money and this is where kind of the concept really became popularized and people um you know started talking about it again and one of the things that happened which is very interesting is that david hoffman i believe started wearing the bat signal now what is the bad signal it's basically a two emoji the bat emoji and the sound emoji and it was trying to be a play on words where you know because bats produce ultrasounds kind of the bad signal is going to represent ultrasound money and people just started copying the bad signal all over twitter and now we have over 2500 twitter accounts no huge accounts including you know for example the axiom infinity account and many many d5 founders and you know lots of prominent accounts uh within the inference space just adopting the the the bad signal and so um we have this this meme which is now seems to be spreading across the whole community and now we have this this website and the you know the word ultrasound money was picked up on bloomberg it was picked up on cnbc and so there is kind of a possibility that in the same way that kind of bats kind of infected the whole world with with genes you know with with kovid um that a bat yet again will infect the whole world with with memes um so yeah one is kind of negative but the other one is is positive and actually it's interesting because the word meme um actually comes from jean the the inventor of the oh right the word meme kind of wanted to create a word to describe the propagation of cultural information and the kind of the the evolution process of these ideas which follows a very similar pattern to to genes and so i think the analogy is really really good in the sense that we have these viral ideas that go spread across the world now right now the the meme has mostly kind of infected the ethereum community but it is possible that it will kind of go beyond this boundary and in fact kind of a wider population well we will have to see um yeah this whole episode has been super super fascinating i really appreciate that you came uh on the show to talk about it where can people learn more about you and eip1559 and the idea of eth as ultrasound money to learn more about me you can follow follow me on on twitter
