in coins when the creator of ethereum makes Market moves people pay attention Jenny Hogan from Unchained has the update so vitalik buterin recently sold about 700 000 worth of coins which are these joke coins that are often a huge waste of money not to be confused with regular cryptocurrency which are non-jobe coins that are often a huge waste of money but like a hot girl in a bar vitalik actually got these coins for free turns out that sometimes people will send free coins to a celebrity in the hopes that their followers will copy them and then buy the coin it's not a bad strategy I mean people do copy vitalik that's why unicorn t-shirt sales have gone through the roof in recent years Anna can have positive repercussions one time Shiba Inu sent about half their total coins to vitalik and he donated them to a covid relief fund which I have to imagine is the sole reason why the pandemic is wrapping up after a mere three years is it rude to sell something that somebody gave
