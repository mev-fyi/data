what's your theory of the case of why other things haven't migrated onto the blockchain well I think it's a supply and demand problem so I think this is really like the Invisible Hand of markets not getting people excited enough because like when there's enough demand when there's enough of a pain point when there's enough excitement it will happen people will figure it out the one thing that has gotten people like moving so to speak are stable coins like there's a clear demand for stable coins there's clear product Market fit that is a use case where the market ushered it into existence because so many people around the world demanded it or wanted it I think when it comes to things like you know tokenized real estate the demand is like microscopic style right there's very few people who are like man I'd kill for that Skyscraper Live on the blockchain it's incredibly cool doing it is like you know achievement unlocked but I don't know how many people demand it I don't know how much like Capital demands I don't know how big the Invisible Hand is that wants to will it into existence it's super cool
