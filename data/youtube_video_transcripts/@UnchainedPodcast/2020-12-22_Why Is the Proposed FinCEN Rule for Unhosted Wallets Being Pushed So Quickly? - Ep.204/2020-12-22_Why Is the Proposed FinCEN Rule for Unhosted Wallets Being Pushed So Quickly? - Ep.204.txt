topic is the recently proposed fincen rule around crypto transactions related to unhosted wallet self-hosted wallets or just plain wallets whatever you want to call them here to discuss are jeremy olaire founder and ceo of circle and kristen smith executive director of the blockchain association welcome jeremy and kristin thanks for having us because this involves news i'm just gonna let the audience know up front that we are recording saturday morning the day after the proposed rule was published first can you guys explain what this rule is basically um the rule as proposed and and we'll come back to the fact that even the fact that this is a proposal versus a final role which has been a huge battle and kristin has been at the front lines of that which we'll talk about but the the proposed rule um is uh really around um transaction reporting for individuals that use a a custodial wallet or an exchange or it's technically in the in the rule a money service business or a bank so a regulated financial institution in the united states and any transaction that involves um you know essentially sending or receiving funds from a crypto wallet that is not associated with another regulated financial institution or money service business whether internationally or the u.s and it essentially says that if an individual is sending greater than three thousand dollars uh you know uh over uh crypto network um then you need to actually uh record their full kyc information you need to receive the name and address of the recipient uh and then keep that record and then if it's greater than ten thousand dollars uh let's say you're sending uh you know these days half a bitcoin uh to to someone to uh uh another you know bitcoin wallet that either you control or is some someone else you you also need to collect that name and address of the recipient and you need to report it um all that information uh to the uh to fincen but you know essentially to the federal government and law enforcement in the federal government um and so there's a essentially a data feed that gets sent to uh the us government with all transactions above ten thousand dollars with with uh you know that collected information and then they can go on and monitor that uh freely and track your blockchain activity it's bad and why do you say that well listen i think there are a couple couple reasons that's problematic one um and as proposed all of the comments for this rule are due on january 4th um which isn't a lot of time given that we've got you know christmas and new year's and a couple of things coming up it's going to be a pretty intense couple of weeks to to get that because um there are a lot of questions about how you would actually go around collecting this information and you know it's it's not that our exchanges can't get out there and and and do this type of work but um but it is it is a huge burden to just turn on a dime especially um there's no proposed you know implementation period here it would take a long time to do this um and so so yeah but i think more problematically and i'll let jeremy go into this is that they're not not every self-hosted wallet has a name and a physical address right if you're working with a smart contract um you know this is gonna prohibit um or prevent crypto from going from an exchange wallet into um smart contracts and that's the whole point of uh everything that we're all building here is to to get more services that are built on top of smart contracts but i'll let jeremy talk more about that yeah i mean i i think there's so many issues with with the proposed rule there's so many issues with the process by which this is happening this is you know a midnight rule making uh you know attempt this is extremely unilateral from the secretary of treasury himself uh despite uh significant objections throughout the government including from within law enforcement to this so this is a highly politically motivated individual who wants to jam this through and is doing everything in his power to do that despite uh despite many many good actors in the federal government who i think realize that something like this should not be just jammed through and requires really careful review deliberation and planning and thinking so we'll come back to that maybe but i i i do want to say yeah when you when you look at blockchains like the fundamental innovation today is this this infrastructure where you can actually have programmable money um the the breakthroughs that are happening this is what motivated me to get in the industry you know almost eight years ago was this idea that you could have you know money as a data type on the internet and you could program it and you could create contracts around it and that those could be enforced by code and work globally and interoperably and and that that would eventually allow for financial services innovation and access to that financial services innovation you know globally as well um really profound stuff and you know this rule basically just completely ignores the fact that that even exists it completely ignores the fact that um you know innovation in in open finance is built on this idea of you know smart contracts that whether they're providing lending markets or they're providing other forms of economic arrangements are executing in code and that individuals for the first time ever have the ability to access and interact with those that's a that's a huge breakthrough and i think you know there's obviously like the full decentralization movement which says well the whole point is to get outside of regulated intermediaries and as long as we have access to you know to this outside of regulated intermediaries it's fine it doesn't matter but i think we want a world where you know financial institutions are able to offer whether it's a business or consumer are able to offer people access to this offer access to these services around the world i think we want that world um and you know effectively you know this rule it's it says nothing to this issue and the the reality is that um individuals and businesses are going to want to be able to transact with smart contracts like it's sort of like duh like that that's like so much and you know so this is essentially i think you know really really limiting and by saying nothing to that issue um it raises very significant questions about how you know a coin base if you're on coinbase.com can you can you actually you know interact with a smart contract what is staking is staking interacting with a smart contract what are what are all these things what what can a a consumer facing or business facing institution do so that's a major issue and i think coming back to the procedural question you know what we ought to do is say okay we have these you know kind of concerns and they're i think they are legitimate concerns you know money laundering and financial crime is legitimate um and we can you know talk about that but you know you don't jam it through over the holidays without any consideration without any thinking without any industry engagement and you know the letter or the the rule says oh yeah we we had an hour meeting in march with a few people from exchanges and last year we went to california for a day big deal i mean that is not industry engagement so um the the reality here is that um we need we need industry to be able to work on this and in a really material way and not just this jam through kind of situation so let's parse out a bunch of what you just spoke about i'm so curious about what you said about how this isn't even a unilateral um motion from the government that you know treasury secretary steve mnuchin apparently is the one individual you imply that's really driving this and that actual people who work on in this area you know in law enforcement are opposed um why is he so driven to do this what is his perception about what's happening in the crypto industry that makes him feel that this is the right way to go yeah so we started to get wind that secretary mnuchin had serious concerns with bitcoin really um and crypto in general but um he really does not like bitcoin um we started getting a sense of this over the summer around the same time that we the fat f released their report that had some suggested policy tools that policymakers could use if they had concerns about self-hosted wallets and what we were hearing at the time was was very concerning because um you know we would hear stories about how he wants to just ban bitcoin entirely um that he doesn't like permissionless networks that he doesn't want any of this stuff he wants to go after it and you know that's when at the blockchain association prior to this we had never been concerned about bank secrecy act issues we thought that the guidance that finn said had put out um in 2014 and again in 20 or 2013 i guess and again in 2019 was very reasonable and we didn't have any issues with the policy but when we started hearing that mnuchin was so fired up about this we decided that okay if something's going to be coming we need to get into this and so we worked with our membership and drafted a report um called self-hosted wallets in the future of free societies um and that's the one that we went over in the episode with jake oh okay yeah yeah that episode will be in the show notes for people it was with jake chervinsky of compound yes and so we released that in in november and what had always kind of been going on in the back of my mind is like okay they're going to kick off a notice of proposed rule making that is going to go after self-hosted wallets they know you can't actually ban bitcoin you can't actually prevent permissionless networks from existing but they're going to try to go with the interaction between the regulated world and and the less regulated world and so you know we wrote this report and we sent it around uh to folks in government and um very quickly heard back from vincennes that this was very timely and that they wanted to meet as soon as possible and so we did some large meetings there um with with folks from treasury and folks from fincen we also did some meetings on the hill um but all this is to say that the reason we we wanted to lay the foundation is we always envisioned this would be a long battle right because you typically have a notice of proposed rulemaking there's a 30 60 sometimes even 90 day comment period there's often follow-on comment periods and it's a very open process and it allows for a lot of dialogue back and forth but what we learned a couple of weeks ago is that this was actually being floated as an interim final rule and an interim final rule goes into effect immediately there's often a common period associated with it but you know and then then it becomes a final final rule only in government can you have a final final rule but the interim final rule would go into effect immediately and and the reason that they were using to bypass the regular process is that there there's kind of this public interest um exception to to going through the process um but the reason the reason they they said this was that um well the money launderers will move their money around and they will be able to like get around the rule if we give them any advance notice so um all of that is to say that the real time has nothing to do with january 20th it has nothing to do with minutes actually being booted out of power and that he's trying to get done something that he personally thinks it needs to happen like let's talk honestly about this this is a bunch of bs yes but the motivation for this is that he the stuff and he doesn't understand this stuff there is no like we have tried to game out every possible angle here there's no like i want to you know leave and make a bunch of money in traditional banking i mean the guy's already worth hundreds of millions of dollars this isn't like a career play this isn't he isn't beholden to any interest he just fundamentally at his core believes that this stuff is bad i have a story about that and i think it's relevant um so almost a year ago in january at davos there was a closed session closed door meeting uh where um you know a small number of people from the crypto industry and and folks you know like david marcus myself and others but but basically like the heads of the leading financial institutions in the world major central bank heads you know the heads of the bis the swift uh i mean a lot of people and it was meant to be a dialogue on you know how what what kind of governance do we need around digital currency what should this look like and mnuchin was was brought in and he sat at the front of the room and and people kind of got called on to give their their perspective on things and and he got up he basically you just mocked bitcoin i mean he essentially just started by saying you can buy bitcoin you can do whatever the hell you want with it i think it's you know basically this is complete trash and you know you might as well just buy a bushel of bananas and you know i mean he he literally kind of went off on this personal rant about you know how stupid he thought bitcoin was and you know if you want to if you want to you know do that you know fine basically kind of mockingly um but you if you want to do that you know and you want to like transfer that and control it yourself no no way basically over my dead body um and so i think there's a mixture of of a personal sentiment that he thinks he just i i think there's you know i've seen this for eight years like people who come out of the traditional financial system have an enormous amount of cognitive dissonance about open finance about the idea of you know digital money that exists outside the realm of of the government or corporations and and i think um he's one of those people who is just it it sort of violates his frame of reference for what how the world works and it makes him angry and i think he felt like he was very much on a personal mission on on this issue and so that was the first time i i really saw that and um and obviously we're sort of seeing that play out in the twilight of the administration and yeah and i think i was going to say going back to your original question though laura he's he's alone on this he is 100 alone we have law enforcement agencies that don't think that this is going to be a useful rule uh we have fincen itself that yes the rule came from vincent but there are very smart people at fincen that understand crypto and they understand that this is going to be very problematic for all the innovation that's going on um but they're at the direction of the treasury secretary on this so we have you know staff level people at the white house that are um you know that have been helping to push back on this so we have members of congress that are wanting to push back on this and even folks i've heard you know that worked for the secretary directly don't think this is the right approach but he is on a personal mission and and the logistics by the way of getting a rule out the door are are incredibly complicated and what he has done to get this posted as quickly as he has is like really quite remarkable um he is you know it's like where there's a will there's a way and even though there's all this opposition against it he is um you know taken up a personal you know level interest in ushering this through at the last minute so fascinating one thing that i'm curious about though is you know as you mentioned earlier vincent did release guidance twice that the industry largely felt was pretty sensible so i was curious at this point in time what do the people who don't think that this is a good role you know in fincen or just pretty much any of the law enforcement or other uh people in government that you mentioned what would what do they think should be done like do they have any kind of uh proposals on their wish list yeah no i mean i think that you know so the way this has played out over the past couple weeks is um you know there was a big stakeholder meeting um because with with different leaders at these various agencies and everyone does agree that there's something needs to be done in general about concerns of illicit finance i mean it's hard to not have that position especially when you're you know sitting in government there were a lot of concerns around the process at the time um i think i think the smarter way and those that are more informed understand that blockchains are actually a little bit different than cash i know we like love to like make the comparison and it's useful in certain circumstances but they're actually really cool amazing tools that are used every day we have chain analysis and elliptic and cypher trace that are all out there working with law enforcement working with companies to help track down and figure out you know who the bad guys are and where the illicit financial activity is going and that is like very cool and different than how you would go and chase down the bad guys in the traditional world and in the traditional financial services world and so the right way to have this is to have a conversation is what else could we be doing how can we use the unique characteristics of the blockchain to help us find these transactions that that are bad and the people who are associated with them as opposed to taking a you know regime that is meant for an old system and trying to apply it on top of crypto and i think there are lots of people that are very interested and open and how to have that conversation um but they want to have that conversation first before you know crafting this midnight rule and and cramming it down um at the very last minute and one other thing that i really wanted to ask about a little bit further is um i actually already engaged in a little bit of a twitter debate about this with ari paul but i actually i think the point i was arguing was wrong and he was right um he was saying that actually this doesn't really affect people who already primarily transact in wallets or even people who would choose to do so um which i actually honestly at this point in time do think um probably would describe the description of the majority of people who operate in d5 at the moment that they're not doing it from a business that they're doing it from their own personal wallet so if you know in the future people have to you know on ramp through something like coinbase but then transfer for under you know 3 000 or 10 000 or whatever to their own personal wallet and then engage in d5 from there like what is the problem you know does it because like my sense earlier even also from the fincen guidance was that in a way that that guidance would probably just drive more people to interact from their own wallets and i understand you know that raises maybe some security issues if you're using you know huge amounts of money but um you know for most average people you know it's just it's just going to be how they're going to interact and a lot of people kind of like that idea that that's how most people would interact so so ari was saying this is really going to affect businesses more than individuals that's what his point was right i i i read his threads and i think he makes some very strong points and i and i agree with most of it and and and just to maybe reiterate what that how that translates is you know i go to an exchange i go to i i work with a custodian i'm getting some usdc or bitcoin or whatever i'm doing and in this new rule let's say i want to you know take fifteen thousand dollars and and move it so i can use that and put it into uh defy or dex or whatever it is yeah i need to say i i'm putting this in a self-hosted wallet it's my wallet you have my name and address that's what i'm doing and you know i can imagine a user interface where there's essentially like it you know the service uh identifies okay you're you're not sending to another vasp you're sending to an unknown wallet a checkbox that says this is my wallet and you know it goes and then you go and interact with d5 right so at a practical level i think that is accurate now here's the difference here's the challenge under this rule this this rule will mean that effectively though the record of you as an individual doing that uh and the blockchain address those just get sent in a data feed to the federal government and law enforcement and they can do whatever they want with it and so whether you're transacting with another person using an unhosted wallet or your own on your own account so to speak now basically i mean we know how all this works the data feed goes to the government and i'm they're quite capable of writing software and so you can imagine okay well now we have this data feed and now we can basically have surveillance downstream over every transaction on chain tied to a specific identity and tied to that now in in the traditional financial system there's nothing equivalent to that you actually the government needs to subpoena to get that information unless the financial institution deems that the person is doing something suspicious where they have reason to believe that there's a money laundering or financial crime or some other action if they do then they have to report it to the government now anyone who transacts above ten thousand dollars is presumed to be a money launderer and are now under full surveillance and monitoring um they can be uh without consent and that is what this rule does um when you take cash out of a bank uh you take ten thousand dollars cash out of the bank that does get reported but you know there's not someone looking over your shoulder everywhere you go and seeing what you did um so there's a huge difference and as we move into a world of quote unquote you know digital money on internet on blockchains um this is a a small step towards radically higher levels of surveillance and it is different than the way it works in the existing banking system and so while it might feel good to say oh well i can just put it in my self-hosted wallet and then i can do what i want well you've also you've done that and your blockchain addresses uh and your your transaction downstream transaction activity are now you know under surveillance without you can without you knowing or being able to do anything about it and um just remind me also what is the information that is required to be reported it's what identity um yeah can you just list all the things yeah do you want to talk about that question well no for the self-hosted wallet the customer registered with the exchange there's information reporting about that but the identity of the self-hosted wallet the wallet ad self-worthy world address has to be have a name and physical address the physical address is kind of a particularly complicated one for some of the d5 stuff but yeah i mean the real question is does that does and the rule does not specifically say that the ctr the the what is the kind of currency transaction report yeah does the ctr include um blockchain address um or wallet address uh now like the sars for for virtual currency uh exchangers suspicious activity report yeah sorry suspicious activity reports that are filed do require inclusion of of blockchain addresses and so that's a that's certainly an open clarification but i think if in fact these ctrs do include your wallet address um that is a an enormous amount of you know sort of oversight that becomes possible and then someone else also said something like and i don't know if this is true that then if you interact with somebody then the exchange also will need to know their entire transaction history or something like that if you're transacting above a certain amount i don't think i don't think you need the whole transaction history no you need to the money service business or or bank who's providing you know interaction with blockchains is required to keep those records for statutory five years basically so so for you know transactions of three thousand dollars um you know you need to essentially internally log what is like your own ctr that you need to track that so that that is on record in the event that you got a subpoena those records would be available to the government um you know over over a statutory period of five years one other thing that i want to ask about this was so vincent also is going to try to propose these rules around structuring which is you know ways in which users might try to break these larger transactions that would trip these requirements into smaller ones so you know they don't have to report but then i actually try to glance through the document to figure out how they're going to do that and it just looks like all they're saying is like it's prohibited do you get a sense of what that would look like or how they would prevent that i mean my take on that is so as a as a financial institution we are required to have aml programs and monitoring to identify structuring activity and report it um i i think it's not entirely clear what how that translates in this proposed rule um i think effectively what i think it says is if your internal systems that are designed to identify structuring identify structuring then you need to presumably uh either freeze the transaction or close the account or again the details are not there but it's essentially to um having a more intense intervention uh than just uh i'm i'm seeing structuring and i'm filing a sar okay so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the impact of this and also what can what the industry plans to do about it but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible one inch is a decentralized

have a better understanding of what's included in the world but is there anything else that we should let people know about like what is you know the con the content of this proposed rule before we move on to other topics i think we got all the okay level points well one thing that i was wondering because you know we did talk about d5 but i also wondered how this role could affect the wider world of dapps in general or web three like you know if you wanted to buy like if you had um some ten thousand dollar crypto kitty or something you wanted to buy from somebody um how would that affect things like would you need to get the kyc from that person or like i don't know how this would impact well i i think this gets back to your comments about your thread with ari paul right which is basically um you know if if you're using a dap um you're you're using that through a a non-custodial wallet because that's that's how web 3 works and if you're transacting with an nft exchange that nft exchange is something you're connecting to through a non-custodial wallet as well and so you know effectively what that would look like is i move uh you know ten thousand dollars of of usdc or ether or bitcoin or whatever it is and um i'm interacting with the marketplace and i want to transact for an nft and i'm doing that you know on a permissionless infrastructure and i then take possession of that uh etc that activity is sort of in a in that kind of parallel permissionless blockchain world now if a a custodial service wanted to allow you to you know buy an nft from a marketplace and the custodial service is interacting directly with the smart contracts that's where it starts to get complicated this gets back to the whole smart contract discussion like there are lots and lots of services now where it's a it's a custodial uh service that itself behind the scenes is you know putting you know stable coins up into d5 contracts or is putting ethereum up into d5 contracts on your behalf and interacting with smart contracts to give you access to it where you don't actually need to you know do self-custody et cetera that set of activities that is there's a giant question mark about that like is that even legally possible uh because there is no way for that exchange or that custodial service to know the name and address of the smart contract like what's the what's the name and address of compound protocol uh you know it just it just doesn't work this is again back to the rulemaking why if this was serious in terms of process like we would take the time to think about okay how do financial intermediaries deal with defy in the context of these uh you know financial crime concerns and like let's think think that through and and frankly give the industry time um in my letter to the senior staff including secretary mnuchin i specifically believe that there are ways for decentralized identity and identity protocols and other things to be layered on this in a way where you can both have financial privacy and you can have accountability and record keeping and that is compatible with you know this emerging world of smart contracts but it's going to take a year or two to figure that out and so the right thing in my mind is create the space try and work with industry to figure it out don't just jam it through so i think that's really where the big question marks are all right so let's talk a little bit about this process um you know as you guys mentioned earlier the comment period for this proposed rule is only 15 days a normal length of time is more like minimum 30 or more often something like 60 days coin center even published something where they he talked about how there's this one proposed rule for the banking industry that's been under consideration for six years so yeah like has a 15 day comment period ever happened before like is this um not out of fincen they have never done a 15-day comment period so i mean i i know this sounds crazy we're actually grateful to have these 15 days because as i mentioned before there was going to be zero days so um you know this is at least something but it's you know a very inconvenient time and um though the good news is it could be the grounds for an administrative procedure act case against them for not taking enough time um and allowing enough time for this to happen so we've been working um with jake schravinski who is um you know one of our he chairs our d fight working group at the blockchain association um we've been working um with the team at kirkland and ellis including paul clement who's a former solicitor general to try to figure out what is the best sort of legal strategy so you know going forward we're going to obviously comment on the letter and you know work through christmas and probably not go skiing as many days as i had hoped because we're going to have to be figuring out how best to respond to this but simultaneously we're also coming up with a legal strategy to figure out how to push back on this and prevent it from going into effect because we do think that the process here has not been followed i mean it very clearly hasn't been followed and that um you know that they shouldn't be allowed to move forward with such a short time frame i would add one thing to that just and this is almost a little bit of a call to action which is there you know i think there are probably 30 to 40 million people in the united states who are you know interacting with digital currency and um who probably care a lot about this and that's a huge number of people that are impacted uh so the impact is broad but the the call to action is really people who care about this need to be they submitting their own comments but also you know reaching out to congress reaching out to their representative you know elected officials and making it clear that they feel very strongly that this is not a fair review process and that this deserves a review not just uh on this administrative level uh but you know frankly they're you know this is something that congress has not even had an opportunity to look at and so i think um you know people need to get out there and and apply as much pressure as possible uh so that there is a a more extensive review period on this so that you know the some of the issues that we've identified here can be thought through there's also an interesting time frame ahead of us um i mean as we mentioned before i think mnuchin is going to do everything he can to make this role final prior to inauguration day on january 20th but if we could succeed in extending the the comment period or extending the period of time where fincen has to review all of the comments to get to january 21st i think this would be a totally different ballgame i think we would be able to work with the new administration and start over on something like this and so going back to jeremy's call for action every you know sort of unique argument that is brought forth has to be addressed as part of the regulatory process and so you know we highly encourage people to to comment and um that will you know lengthen the time needed um in order for fincen to to meet all of the requirements before making the roll final so um so getting a lot of comments in is is going to be important it sort of um reminds me of a common tactic in crypto which is you know the um denial of service attack but anyway um yeah one thing that i was curious about is you so you mentioned this administrative procedure act and legal action does that i don't know what that looks like would that mean like a literal lawsuit against this or or what oh okay yeah so there's a couple ways there's a couple ways we could do it um and we're we're evaluating but one one way to stop this thing from going into effect is to to sue the government and say that you can't put this out there um and so yeah we're looking to do that um and that would probably be in the form of a preliminary injunction at the time that a final rule comes out but we're looking at all of the different options that are there right now the other option we have because if the rule does become final it does become quite difficult to undo the rule right once it's finally can't just but if it's in this proposal stage i think like you said um the coin center folks had mentioned some of these rulemakings go on for years and sometimes they get pulled and they or they get you know they get stopped along the way um and so if we can keep the rulemaking open to get to the next administration that's our best chance but if it does go final we have the lawsuit route that i mentioned and we also have something called the congressional review act which is a tool that congress has to undo regulations that they don't like that is going to be a that would be a fairly heavy lift to get the votes to to essentially undo this rule but it's not necessarily impossible so we're looking at a legislative strategy on that side and then we're also looking at um you know working with uh working through the courts in order to um get this thing slowed down um [Music] before it goes into effect and then i want to add sorry go ahead no go ahead jeremy i i want to add one one one thought here as well which is somewhat tangential which is um essentially you know i i don't want everyone to be all doom and gloom here because i i think um you know you've actually seen you know a week a week or so ago obviously there was some heightened uh concerns about you know an outright ban or you know more more aggressive measures which were in fact being contemplated and the market obviously reacted to that uh i think um you know gradually you know there's so much interest in the market right now it's obviously it's obviously grown but but even you know specifically after 5 p.m yesterday when the details of this rule were published the market is up um and and i think um you know i'm very close to you know some of the biggest market makers in the world and i think people have kind of shrugged it off and and i think they've shrugged it off um for two reasons i think one is the perception is you know as if you refer to the report thread as well as sort of like okay well d5 can go on people can continue to utilize you know permissionless infrastructure yeah there's there's some hassle around it um etc um but it's this is not this is not somehow uh you know gonna destroy the ability to use permissionless blockchains right so i think that's one piece i think the other piece which is actually more subtle is that you know i have been you know obviously you know trying to work with mainstream financial institutions to and to work with the crypto industry for a very long time and the number one issue that has always been limiting financial institutions banks specifically of getting involved is the compliance teams the compliance officers basically say there's no way for us to have a way to keep track of what people are doing with permissionless blockchains and we can there therefore it's impossible for us to meet our bsa obligations so we have to stay completely away from this as the occ has basically said hey you guys can get into crypto you guys can keep crypt on your balance sheet you can provide custodial services you can support stable coins stablecoin networks as that has happened that's been a really positive thing you're seeing institutional participation that's meaningful that's coming into the market right now and you're seeing more and more banks saying hey how do we get into this the paypal announcement is another example this issue and having some resolution around this issue i believe will lead to massive scale financial institution participation in these markets because they will finally at some level the compliance departments will say okay compliance departments don't like gray area they don't like not having rules they like rules if they have a rule then they know what they need to follow and so this in some ways answers that question which has been looming over this industry for seven or eight years and so you could decide whether you think that's a good thing or a bad thing to have more banks involved in crypto but i think that um some resolution of this issue whether it's this specific rule as it's proposed now or some more extensive period where the industry can work on it and address some of the issues that we've identified will lead to the mainstreaming of crypto in in a larger way and i i want to make sure that that's not lost on people as well yeah although i think what's fascinating to me about this is that so i totally get the point that you're making and i do agree that it will lead to that just having more clarity um however it goes also back to what we were saying you know was my debate with arie paul where i do think that the rules the way they're written now will actually cut off certain revenue streams and lines of business for some of these bigger companies um you know like i don't know how this would affect yeah like different things like staking or any services they may want to offer in yield farming or whatever it is so um in that regard i feel like it disadvantages less technical people like like people like me who you know it's not like i interact with metamask all the time and then the one time i did for the first time in a long time i literally lost five hundred dollars in like five minutes yeah it was terrible like and i i haven't used metamask since i was like so burned so the more tech so that i feel like this drives a thing where like it it opens up crypto only to more technical people and not to everyday people yeah i think i think that's a risk and i think like worst case scenario this thing could stand through there's no way to stop it it goes into effect there's some you know some period of time the next the next step is we need additional guidance we need additional clarification we need additional amendments we need to we need to we need to work on that issue so that you know mainstream financial institutions that want to tap decentralized networks for services and provide those as value to their users have the ability to do so and do so in a really clear way so we have to continue to fight for that and so just to go back to kristen's points earlier about the biden administration jeremy you did say on cnbc that you expected the biden administration to ultimately be positive toward crypto but i don't i don't know in the context of your comments did you did you mean like around this type of issue or you know why did you say that and why did you and and what do you think their attitude would be in the short term if the rulemaking does go uh past the trump administration well i mean i i would i would say a couple things i mean i i think there's there's obviously you know uh career civil servants that work in agencies there's a tremendous number of people who work in the treasury department in the occ and fincen in law enforcement in uh you know in other key agencies who are getting more and more educated on crypto thanks to kristen and team and and you know a broader just general awareness in the space and i think there's just so much more understanding now than there's ever been and there's a real recognition that this is very significant and important infrastructure and so i just think at the federal government level there is just in general a more constructive view on all of this and i think that's getting more and more heightened as this you know grows around the world i think specifically with the bind administration my view is that there's going to be a major focus in the biden administration on you know american competitiveness in critical industries and infrastructure areas i think that the approach that the biden administration will take is not going to be one of you know the the standing up massive you know uh federal government initiatives it's going to be to tap american entrepreneurship it's going to be to tap the great you know technology capabilities the great you know private firms to to do that in a way where the public sector and the private sector work closely together to advance those things and blockchains and what they enable is clearly a category and digital currency is clearly a category where you know the united states needs to have a leadership position not just in this sort of u.s china thing which people tend to over dramatize i think but i think just in general um you know that this is you know i always use the 1996 metaphor and i think it's very apt you know we might have a netscape moment with coinbase's ipo which was similar to back then but i think very specifically people are seeing that the global economic system and the financial infrastructure is going to get rebuilt in in the image of the internet and on this and we got to get it right and um and so i i think that this is just a time it happens to be when biden and team are coming to pick to to power and i likewise i think that in general we'll want to kind of govern from the middle um and and try to you know approach this in a bipartisan manner there are i think this is an industry that has uh you know people on on on every which way of the political spectrum who are who are interested in seeing it move forward and i think that that uh will contribute to uh general uh engagement and support and so just so i understand how this will work if indeed the rulemaking does go into the biden administration do you expect at that point then it would be kind of more of the you know career level just bureaucrats who will carry the ball forward and then therefore will institute like a more typical process is that your sense of what would happen or you know because i also like i mean not that i've looked into this but i feel like the bind administration probably has a lot of priorities when it comes in i don't know how high this is gonna rank so i just wonder is it going to languish or um you know there there could be a number of things at the very least i think we can expect it to slow down um at the very best maybe it gets pulled entirely and then the conversation can start um you know anew with with folks in the administration um you know fincen is one of those agencies that it is all career people so the the team that's in place now um will continue to be there um you know going in you know at post january 20th and so we're hopeful that um that the problem we have now is that we have a treasury secretary who's for whatever reason made this his number one priority i don't think this is going to be ellen's number one priority out of the gate and this will be um yeah sort of reverted to the the normal process where we have really well educated talented people in government that are trying to think creatively about these issues and um you know those are the ones that we want to be engaging with on these conversations not um you know treasury secretaries that are difficult to get in front of so one other thing is that you know pretty much this whole conversation has been pretty focused domestically but collins belton who's another lawyer in the crypto space told me that he thinks this breaks down gdpr compliance uh in the eu and he just was super skeptical it would fly over there so how do you think gdpr issues might affect the ability to implement a rule like this well i hadn't thought through that angle but um yeah i mean there's just a lot of information that's going to be stored in one place and um but yeah no that's an interesting thought this is this is i mean i i believe that there are exemptions around you know basically you know uh information uh sharing associated with tracking uh associated with financial crimes enforcement i don't i don't know the details on that but i mean for example i mean the the european union and its members have been very proactive around the travel rule and fat of work and that requires a massive amount of pii flying around all around the world uh you know creating you know kind of honey pots for for uh for cyber criminals um which is one of the issues with with travel rule and jeremy when you say they've been active with that you mean that they are requiring kind of more absolutely yeah i mean 5 amd is is very very you know clear on that and what is 5a mld okay so the european union has an anti-money laundering directive they're now in the fifth version of the anti-money laundering directive it has a whole series of things specific to virtual currency firms to registration requirements to kyc procedures and it is the the sort of regulatory framework that binds those virtual asset service providers to the fatif guidelines that have been you know laid out as well so actually the european union is is pretty um pretty strict on on a lot of this and i think you obviously saw what happened in france last week you know all this came out of the g7 meeting this has been worked on as an issue this has been one of the top issues for for the secretary of treasury in the g7 uh and frankly at the g20 level and so you know i i think there was essentially a kind of handshake around the table that everybody's going to go roll this out in the g7 so i don't think we're done uh with with uh with this i think we're going to see you know g7 and other g20 member states introducing rules or or regulations similar to this in a coordinated fashion uh as we go into the new year oh interesting so it seems like the eu does not see a conflict between these types of rules and gdpr no i mean if you if you look specifically at what france has already done if you look at what the german finance minister announced around this coming out of the g7 meeting uh whatever that was on the 10th i i mean his words did not need mincing and so i would expect certainly in germany um that's something in this space is imminent yeah i don't remember the exact quote but i did include it in my newsletter and unconfirmed one week recently so i will try to find that and link to that in the show notes um all right so i mean we kind of talked a little bit about um what you thought people should do in terms of the comments over the next few days but i don't know if you have any other kind of like tips for people because i kind of was like are we gonna see some mass exodus of crypto from the exchanges over the next 15 days like yeah no listen i would encourage individuals um you know to to submit comments if you go to treasury's website you can get a copy of the rule on their instructions in there on how to email in a comment there will probably my guest be some activists that come up with a streamline way for people to do this so i'd keep an eye out for for those links um that make it easier to submit comments but you know if if you're listening as someone who is participating in the cryptocurrency industry um you know that this is a i think this is a really this is the biggest bullet that's been fired at us um so far um in the united states and and you know we need to fight back against these types of attacks and um if you're not a member of the blockchain association and putting in a plug like please join us like we are a very small team because we have a very small budget we could be a very big team if we had a big budget and we could do more work if we have more support so um you know for for those companies that are out there that are not yet working with us please join us like we are um working together we had jeremy and i were in a war room that we set up on our signal here where we were all sharing information with different people that we were speaking with in government and coming up with a strategy and also you know analyzing it the information when it came out last night and so um you know it's a really great team of really smart people um you know both here internally at the blockchain association and also within our membership and so um you know this work doesn't do itself so we want to get more boots on the ground i want to i want to reiterate that and i was going to say the same thing which is kristen and her team are amazing and the work has been incredible and just witnessing even the the ability to change some of the things that have been happening on this particular matter just in a matter of weeks it's tremendous you know there's sort of the one percent rule which is everyone in the world should put one percent of at least one percent of their wealth into crypto well every crypto firm and every crypto firm's treasury they should probably take one percent of it and and contribute to and become members of blockchain association because uh th this is uh extremely high value high leverage work um and uh would really really encourage that one other thing i wanted to ask about kristin was i've been noticing on twitter that coin center has been raking in the the bucks they raised 300 000 last i saw via gitcoin is that something that the blockchain association could do or i don't know if there are any particular rules around yes we've we've thought about trying to do something um you know we do we are stewards of the defend crypto fund um which is you know a separate project that that we have oversight of um but the um no the way we're structured is we represent um the companies and the organizations and individuals should absolutely and companies too should also support coin center um you know i think those that's a fantastic fantastic team we do a lot of sharing of information and strategizing back and forth with them um but they have a different point of view they represent the technology and um and they're a great way for individuals who want to get involved uh to go over there but yeah from the industry perspective that that is the blockchain association's point of view so um very similar missions but slightly different perspectives and um yeah they do fantastic work okay so i i know you may not want to make predictions but i was just curious how you thought this was going to go like what do you think is the most likely outcome of all this i mean we're going to give it our best shot to continue to throw sand in the gears and slow this thing down based off of how aggressive and how personally involved the treasury secretary is you know i think he is going to push this out to a final rule um and i think we're going to have to go to court i think that's that's the most likely pathway we see jeremy i completely concur wow it's very you know i've never worked in government um but it's just very interesting how one individual at the top even when everybody around that person just doesn't agree how that uh can force things through um all right well so we will check back and see if you guys were correct um but anyway okay well it's been so fun having you on the show thank you for doing this on a saturday morning where can people learn more about you and this proposed rule well if you go to the blockchain association.org and you go to our policy positions page wallets issues are right at the top and you can see our report you can see our letter that we sent over to treasury i guess a week or so ago when we were in the middle of this lobbying blitz and we've got lots of information there and i would just say i you know i communicate publicly on this here and there on twitter at jrlair so follow me there and um you know i'll have more and more to say about this there as well and you also have your show money that's right the money movement um so yes you can tune in the money movement the money you know youtube.com the money movement um and and uh certainly we'll be picking up the conversation there as well all right great well thank you both so much
