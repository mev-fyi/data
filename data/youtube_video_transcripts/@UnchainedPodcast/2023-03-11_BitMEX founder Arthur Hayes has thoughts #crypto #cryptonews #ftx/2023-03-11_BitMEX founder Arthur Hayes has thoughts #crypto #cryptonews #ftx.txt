it's hard to lose 10 billion dollars like you look at all the financial scammers around the world like at Banks and all these other different places like 10 billion dollars a ton of money to lose in like months span of months um it just La it just reeks of an organization that was successful because people thought they were successful rather than actually having real trading acumen and then unfortunately they made the bad decision to take customer funds to try to plug the hole and help the market turned around and then there are liquid coins that they own would rise in value and then you know that it would have been okay right if the market went up he would have been fine if the problem was that the market went down for the Terra Luna and then it continued falling uh and then it put pressure on on his you know sand castle and it came all crumbling down and now everybody who backed him is super embarrassed right
