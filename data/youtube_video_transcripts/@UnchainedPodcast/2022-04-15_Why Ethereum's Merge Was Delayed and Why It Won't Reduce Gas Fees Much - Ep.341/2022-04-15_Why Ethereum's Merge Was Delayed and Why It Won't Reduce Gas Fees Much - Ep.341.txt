this week that ethereum's long-awaited merge would not happen in june as was previously projected before we dive into the details on that just to just catch any listeners up to speed explain what the merge is and then tell us how long it will be delayed and why so so to start with the first part right like what what is the ethereum merge um so today ethereum uh basically has two chains running in parallel one of those is a proof of work chain which uses mining just like bitcoin to generate new blocks on the network and this is the chain that most end users interacting with ethereum would kind of know as ethereum this is where smart contracts get deployed where most of kind of users funds sit previously we would call this ethereum one we tried to move away from that in parallel to that we've also launched in december 2020 a proof of stake chain so proof of stake since the very beginning of ethereum was on the roadmap uh we already we always knew we wanted to switch from proof of work to proof of stake and it just took a ton of word to get to something which we thought was secure and decentralized enough for ethereum so we even when we had that to be sure that we would not kind of break the network and all the applications that are running instead of just switching directly we decided to launch a chain in parallel and so since december 2020 that proof of stake chain has been running and now has tens of billions of dollars kind of securing it and basically runs the entire proof-of-stake algorithm but the blocks don't contain any end-user transactions so all the blocks on this proof-of-stake chain they contain you know some metadata around proof-of-stake and the consensus algorithm itself but they don't run and use their transactions and so the idea with the merge is that to move ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake we're going to keep the current chain which has all of the applications which we call the execution layer now and basically change the rules by which it decides how to how to create a new block in the chain to go from proof of work to following the beacon chain and what happens in practice is you know we set a total difficulty value which we can dive into later once we hit the certain mining difficulty on the network the current execution change basically stops listening to proof of work and instead we'll start looking at the proof of stake chain to tell it what is the next block and from that point from like the proof of stake perspective validators will be producing blocks which now include transactions from end users and and smart contracts and this whole process is basically going to be instantaneous from like the ethereum chains perspective so you'll have like the last proof of work block and then the next block gets produced by a validator on the beacon chain and we just continue that way and so it's been kind of years of work but now we have a design which will be kind of seamless from a smart contract perspective for the transition and so most people thought and this wasn't official but most people expected it to happen in june but you tweeted that it will probably happen in the months after so why is that right so we never we never had like an official date for the merge and i appreciate you know that we've been saying it's soon for many years and the community is very eager to see this happen and the reason why we don't have a date is just fundamentally it's impossible to predict these things because there's so many unknown unknowns right like nobody has done this ever and so at best what we can say is like look at how well things are going and kind of project in the future but that assumes we don't hit some unknown issue which which we kind of always end up doing because this technology is so new that there's so many moving parts so we we tried to shy away from giving dates um but then you know there's always like some pressure for like when is this roughly coming and within ethereum this difficulty bomb so this this feature that means we need to upgrade the chain every so often otherwise the chain stops working and this will start kicking you off around june so when we get to june we basically have to make a decision around you know are we ready to move ethereum to proof of stake or do we want to push this back this bomb back again and so obviously no one on the the the development side wants to move forward with the merge if it's not ready and if it's not safe for the network so if we did get the the june and and it's you know we're not ready uh then we'll just push back the bomb and and and make sure that that we are in a spot that we're comfortable with before we go to mainnet and i guess the thing uh that's also worth noting is this difficulty bomb is kind of a gradual process so it doesn't make the network unusable overnight it's you know slowly gets worse uh and then it's an exponential curves at some point it gets much worse much quicker so we kind of have this range between june and like probably late july early august where you know you might see longer block times on ethereum and if if we we thought that you know we were just ready we might choose to not push back the bomb and have longer block times for a month or two and i think this is kind of where we're at right now like we are pretty far along in the development process we're starting to think about you know deploying this domain net but we're we're definitely not at the point where you know it is completely bug free and there's no more issues and it's a no-brainer then just deployed the main net um so we're kind of in this this middle section where you know we might have to delay the bomb uh there's a chance we might not and and and we're obviously watching and and testing very closely to see exactly what to do so what needs to happen or what needs to be in place for ethereum to feel comfortable actually executing the merge right that's a great question and historically you know what we've done when we have upgrades is you know we'll write all these eips into clients we'll run a bunch of tests for them and we'll sometimes deploy a couple new test nets to test them and then we'll move to the existing test nets on ethereum so like rinkeby gourley roxton and whatnot the the thing that's happened over the years though is like these test nets now have a lot of usage so like ethereum's test nets have as much usage as some like actual layer one blockchains uh like reddit for example has a ton of its infrastructure on one of the test nets and so we we don't want to break these if we don't have to so we've kind of introduced a new step in the process which which we've called shadow forking and what shadow forking does is we basically launch an upgrade on on an existing network but only using a very small number of nodes that basically the testing teams and client development teams control and what happens then is you know these nodes will fork off when the the block is hit but they'll only be a small number of nodes and they'll still be able to replay all of the transactions from the from the main network and that gives us kind of a way to test as though we were forking test nets but without bringing the whole thing down if there are errors so we've been running through this process we first ran through it on gordy this week or late last week or early this week we had the first run on a mainnet shadow fork as well and so we've basically those forks have been successful in that we've managed to get the network to finalize after but the thing to note there is like the the way the proof of stake algorithm is done is it's meant to be resilient to a lot of things going wrong um so that in case there's an attack on ethereum or something like that ideally the chain keeps keeps chugging along so even though you know these test nets have like shadow fork successfully and they keep finalizing on the other side we have noticed like a a lot of issues with clients in a bunch of different edge cases and whatnot and those are the things we're trying to fix now because i said this on twitter yesterday like yes we could you know ship this tomorrow and like maybe the network wouldn't completely crash but that's not like the level of certainty we want to have before we transition ethereum uh which just has a huge amount of value sitting on top of it um so the next few weeks like maybe months for us is really like running these shadow forks making sure that we catch all the issues we obviously fix them and once that is stabilized then we can start looking at just forking the existing test nets and and making sure those work all right and once that's done then we would fork maintenance yeah and just to make it clear for people you know obviously ethereum is the second largest crypto but as i heard some people discussing on coindesk there are so many assets built on top of ethereum as well so when you out of all that economic activity i mean it's huge um so that's you know when you're just trying to shift that all over to this new chain that obviously is is a delicate transition all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about kind of like you know the specifics about how this will happen but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10

[Music] back to my conversation with tim so one thing that you kind of said a little bit earlier was that will not happen at a certain block but rather at this difficulty number and we have talked about the difficulty time bomb but just can you talk a little bit about how that transition will happen the difficulty bomb and the total difficulty or separate concepts which they have similar names but um the way that that proof of work works is every block there's like a specific difficulty that it takes to mine it and when more people try to mine on the network we raise that difficulty so that the block time stays the same and blocks don't get mined too quickly and similarly when less people mine we lower it so that it's easier to mine blocks and blocks don't take too long but we also keep track of what's the total amount of difficulty that's been mined on the entire chain so this is basically the sum of every single block's difficulty since the ethereum genesis block ford emerge instead of using just a block number what we want to do is use a total difficulty value so to say once the network hits this much difficulty on the proof of work chain then we transition to the proof of stake and you mean for all time yes exactly for all time and the reason for that is that difficulty is just costly to fake maybe a an aside here is miners might not be happy with the merge right like at the very least we can't assume they'll be happy with the merge so we want something which is as hard as possible for them to fake and as independent as them for the for the process to happen and so by using the total difficulty you basically make it really hard to fake kind of the second merge chain because you would then need to like spend all these binding resources to to to create that chain so it just gives us a bit more confidence than a block number where if you use the block number you could imagine a minor mining kind of a shadow fork or shadow forks probably the wrong term because it's a real thing now but a minor mining like a minority fork in secret for months and then you know they might hit be able to hit that block because over time the difficulty has lowered on their fork and they can kind of reveal that right at the merge and mess things up because there's now two competing forks so in order to avoid that we just look at which fork actually has the greatest amount of proof of work and once we hit kind of that threshold value which we call the terminal total difficulty then we kind of hand everything off to the proof of stake chain and the thing that's that's kind of interesting here is like there might be different blocks which hit this terminal total difficulty because ethereum you know has uncle blocks happening so it might be possible that you know once we get to the merge there's two or maybe even five blocks that all show up at the same time but the way it's it's designed only the first block which hits or exceeds that terminal total difficulty is like a valid final proof of work block and then the validator on the beacon chain who creates the next block gets to choose which of those valid blocks they see as as the previous canonical block and so just like today how you can have like an uncle block on ethereum um which just get orphaned by the chain we have the same situation where maybe at the merge you know there's a handful of competing blocks but then we just rely on the validator to choose that and then you know the validator afterwards will will will point back to the block that the previous validator chose and at that point we're 100 rely on proof of stake and and proof of work and minors generally just don't influence uh the fourth choice rule for ethereum so i know you're probably loath to put a projection out but can you give some sort of timeline of when you think the merge now is most likely to happen i'm i'm not gonna gonna do that like unfortunately if there's one thing i've learned this week because i won't put an explicit uh so i will say you did tweet probably in the months after q2 which sort of implies to me q3 right like i think you know we we are pretty far along in the process we think you know we're almost there there's always this unknown unknown thing right like we could find something the day before which is like some fatal flaw and have to delay everything for months because it's a hard thing to fix so that's like the thing you know it's just very hard i think sure if everything keeps going like it's going now like you know clearly we won't catch june just because the reason we won't hit june is just the amount of time it takes to go on test nets and the main net because we need to like you know choose when we fork then put out those releases give people the time to update their nodes have the forks happen make sure that they went well and just you know we're already mid april so just the amount of time if we decided like tomorrow that we're go we're going for mainnet it would take probably more than two months to like get from you know that decision to like it actually happens on main net um so that's why you know i was pretty confident saying like june is not gonna happen um and i think we've we've kind of shared that in the past on like awkward m's but like yeah sure if if you know if things keep going well then like there are no more big issues that we find then probably the months after june's still seems reasonable whether that's like one or four like or five like i don't want to to make a call there like something really terrible would have to happen for it to be delayed like a year at this point like i don't know what could cause that you know like nothing like that we've ever encountered like on ethereum so it's just like but it's just very hard to tell you like maybe we find some weird sync issues which take us two months to debug like that could happen uh but there's no way to know really so there are some misconceptions out there about what will happen on ethereum after the merge particularly around weather and how gas prices might change can you clarify what it is that people should expect in terms of gas fees right so in short gas fees should basically stay the same uh the merge doesn't really change the throughput of ethereum it does a tiny thing which blocks are now 13 seconds and they'll lower to 12 seconds so you know you get like 9 more throughput and so in practice if all things were perfectly stable you would imagine fees go down by like eight nine percent but there's so much volatility on ethereum that like that's you know basically nothing but scalability is like super important that it is like the next thing we're kind of working on so just for to give some context you know the main way ethereum thinks about scalability today is like through roll-ups and those are already live right like there's optimistic roll-ups live there's zero knowledge roll-ups that are that are that are going live as well um and these today already provide way lower fees than the ethereum mainnet for end users and a large part of what what users pay for when they pay a transaction fee on rollups is storing data back on layer one so the way that rollups work is that they they generate all this transaction data just like the ethereum main net but instead of executing every transaction on layer on layer one they execute them all on layer two but then they then need to post back the transaction data on layer one because if something goes wrong uh they need to then be able to execute it and this is for optimistic roll ups zero knowledge roll up work a bit differently because they don't post the full data they pull back proof but the general concept that like users on l2 pay for posting data back to ethereum l1 that's true across zero knowledge and optimistic rollups and so one big thing we can do to lower transaction fees on rollup is just make it cheaper to put data back on ethereum layer one and so the long term roadmap for that is a full sharding infrastructure and sharding is basically a whole separate kind of data network on ethereum that runs in parallel to smart contracts which just stores data for a limited period of time so that rollups can just use that as a way to post the data back it's a bit complicated to ship all that and the fees are high today so we want to do some things quicker we basically have two short term things that we're working on one is just straight up reducing the cost of storing data on layer one the challenge by doing that is that it does grow the rate at which like an ethereum node will will grow so if we make it cheaper to store data then more data gets stored and so the the the blockchain grows quicker and we think you know we're probably at the point where it might make sense to do something like that if uh if we really have to because the fees have gotten so high the other thing that we're working on uh which we we hope we can we can get done is eip4844 and this is kind of an in-between where it doesn't do the full sharding infrastructure but it basically creates a new type of transaction on ethereum which has a little bit of shard data on it and then rollups can just use these new types of transactions to store kind of data for a cheaper price than they currently can and the thing that's neat with that is that it would lay from like an application perspective's point of view all of the infrastructure that we're going to have in sharding so it's like we can do this thing which doesn't provide full sharding yet but it gives them kind of all the scaffolding that'll be there when chardonnay is so that if like say optimism or stockwear or arbitrage need to update to use this they won't have to update again once we have full sharding so it is a bit more complicated to get done than just straight up lowering the cost of storing data but it does feel like a happy medium and hopefully that's something we can do kind of in the upgrade after after the merge and so if you were to put a timeline on that what would that timeline be no idea and i think i think yeah i think the upgrade after the merge timeline will probably depend on whether we think we want to do this more complicated new transaction type with with data in them or just a simple a simple data reduction cost but yeah it's it's it's the merge is not even over so it's hard for me to predict how long it'll take us to ship the next thing yeah no i got it i got it i was half teasing with that question okay well this has been incredibly fascinating and um yeah just hopefully it will clarify a lot of things for people thank you so much for coming on unchained of course thank you for having me don't forget next up is the

the depository trust and clearing corporation a private financial markets infrastructure company announced a central bank digital currency pilot program dubbed project lithium the dtcc will be working with the digital dollar project to explore how it might use blockchain technology according to a press release project lithium hopes that its program will help provide clarity as to how a cbdc may reduce trapped liquidity increase capital efficiency solidify delivery guarantees and add regulatory transparency and provide other benefits as well to the settlement process a cbdc could improve time and cost efficiencies provide broader accessibility to central bank money and payments and all while emulating the features of physical cash in an increasingly digital world explained former cftc chairman christopher giancarlo aka crypto dad who spearheads the digital dollar project according to the atlantic council and cbdctracker.org this is the first cbdc pilot in the u.s the dtcc claims to provide custody and asset servicing for securities issues from 177 countries and territories valued at 87.1 trillion dollars although the announcement came weeks after president biden's executive order announcing research on a central bank digital currency the dtcc and digital dollar project are private sector entities that are not part of biden's executive order in his book crypto dad the fight for the future of money john carla wrote money especially digital money is too important to be left to central bankers block in blockstream to test bitcoin mining using tesla equipment at bitcoin 2022 in miami adam back the ceo of blockstream announced a pilot crypto mine in texas that in partnership with jack dorsey's block will be powered by tesla solar and storage technology the project is expected to be completely offline with tesla's solar array powering the mine during the day and tesla batteries powering the mining facility at night the partnership will be small to start with just one megawatt of energy capacity the 12 million in development costs will be split between block and block stream the pilot project is expected to be up and running within months data regarding the program's energy consumption and hash rate will be publicly available people like to debate about the different factors to do with bitcoin mining we figured let's just prove it have an open dashboard so people can play along maybe it can inform other players to participate back explained to cnbc 63 months for ethereum developer virgil griffith 39 year old former ethereum developer virgil griffith was sentenced to five and a quarter years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to violate the international emergency economic powers act last september griffith was originally arrested in 2019 after giving a presentation on cryptocurrency in pyongyang the capital of north korea despite being denied permission by the department of state to do so prosecutors allege that griffith gave north korea information that he knew could be used to evade and avoid u.s sanctions and fund its nuclear weapons program specifically the department of justice says that griffith and his co-conspirators also answered specific questions about blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies for the dprk audience including individuals whom griffith understood worked for the north korean government in addition to a 63-month sentence griffith was also fined 100 000 speaking of north korea the u.s treasury department is alleging that lazarus a north korean hacking group is tied to the 600 million dollar hack of the ronin bridge from earlier this month the treasury department has added a wallet holding 148 000 each to its sanctions list celsius shuts down yield for most u.s citizens u.s regulators continue to force crypto companies to halt offerings of retail-based crypto yield this week's mark was celsius a crypto rewards platform that much like blockfy offers an earned platform where users can deposit crypto tokens and accumulate yield at a rate between 0.65 and 18.63 percent per year according to a celsius blog post this week non-accredited u.s customers will no longer have access to its yield product starting april 15th due to regulatory uncertainty as we have previously acknowledged celsius has been working closely with regulators around the world it is our intention to be as transparent with our community as possible celsius wrote more specifically we have been in ongoing discussions with united states regulators regarding our earned product as a result there will be changes to the way our earned product will work for users based in the united states this means that celsius customers who make less than two hundred thousand dollars a year or do not have a net worth of one million dollars will be barred from earning interest on the platform celsius customers who had deposited tokens before friday april 15th will be grandfathered into celsius's earn program and can continue to obtain yield on their investments the news is not surprising to anyone who has kept up with the crypto yield space notably celsius has been under scrutiny from u.s regulators since 2021 and has faced obstacles in new jersey texas and alabama furthermore celsius's major competitor blockfi paid a 100 million dollar fine to the sec and state regulators for offering a lending product which the sec believes is the securities product to us citizens without registering additionally the sec threatened to sue coinbase after the exchange announced its intent to launch a crypto-interest-bearing product for u.s citizens coinbase listings spark skepticism and an insider trading allegation in an effort to increase transparency and token listings coinbase published a blog post revealing 50 tokens for which the exchange is considering offering support the decision seems to have backfired first of all the list of tokens being considered was met with skepticism on twitter at pastry eath was one of the more vocal voices and cited certain red flags with some of the tokens on coinbase's list for example bottle b-o-t-t-o has a market cap of 4 million dollars chrom k-r-o-m is at roughly 10 million and mona is less than four million dollars while ric is about two million dollars with zero volume out of all the assets mentioned in the blog post by coinbase i have heard of maybe 10 of them pastry eth wrote additionally nearly half of them are under 20 million market cap and some as low as even 5 million dollars pastry eth then wondered is coinbase just stupid or is there something else going on secondly in a move that has sparked insider information debates an ethereum wallet purchased more than four hundred thousand dollars worth of tokens from the list three minutes before the list was made public however while the tokens briefly spiked in the hours after the announcement it does not appear that the trader was able to turn a profit as the wallet address holds less than four hundred thousand dollars despite hitting five hundred and fifty thousand dollars plus at one point in related news robin hood announced four new tokens on its platform customers now have access to comp matic sol and ship circle raises 400 million dollars and partners with blackrock circle the company behind the stablecoin usdc announced a 400 million funding run
