and actually for this whole past week there's been a fair bit of drama at the coin mining giant bit mean what happened well so long story short and it was a it was a coupe so from October 27 to 30 years there was a video surveillance camera Expo in Shenzhen and my crew Jon he was the he's the co-founder of a man and he was at the expo it was there to launch some kind of a I'd ship from be meant for video surveillance cameras and then one day after that Jihan there one day after that there was a change of the basic registration data of Beeman of Beijing beaming technology so in that registration change my career is no longer the executive director of email he's he was also taken over by Jihan as a representative and our that yeah G ha woo who is also the other co-founder of B man so a couple of hours after that change Jehan will send a email to all staff to be man employees saying Michael John is basically dismissed of all his roles at B man and any employee should not engage with Michael anymore and he should not take any directions from him so basically shut him down and that was basically it an hours after the email hey ji hyung will submit someone all this stuff to All Hands meeting to tell everybody what happened so that was what happened on last Tuesday and on today one week after that Michael Chen finally spoke he's what we share in a web ball and said he's going to take some legal action to return to the office I mean so let's go a little bit into that staff meeting what was the backstory that Jihan gave to explain or justify his actions well so that email was kind of like a shock to many employees because I guess not many people have seen a word like expecting that so he took that opportunity to explain to everybody what happened and why he had to come back and why he had to take such actions and he basically used one-hour meeting to explain what happens from December 2018 when when the kind of conflict has started between him and my crew John yeah that was pretty much all of the one-hour meeting and what was that conflict so the backstory of the December 2018 was that at that point you know the Bitcoin price was like there was a big big comprised crash and Payman was thinking about a layoff so ji-hye and a couple of other founding members of the company was were like pushing for that plan to lay off the employees because at that time I think Beeman had about like 2,000 people initially based on what jihun said in the meeting was my crew John was up was alipio against the plan so they had a bit of a struggle then on December 17th Jihan said on that day Micra John returned to the office and called for a second meeting and on that meeting he wanted to be the sole CEO so as of this as of December last year Jehan and Mike Roberto CEOs and co-chairman of Beeman so he said on that day my crew John returned office wanted to become the only CEO and he said that is the way to so to save the company so that was what happened at that time so there was a conflict of where the payment should have a layoff but then they come to agreement that there should be a layoff and they also come to agreement that they both will step down from co-ceos and they will ask the second a third person to take on the CEO new CEO role and they will step down from the day-to-day management so that was the conflict back then but as time moves on like Damon official announces nanos then use in March of their stepping down to the public after the Hongkong IPO failed but what jihun said was Micra didn't really stepped out from the management role he's still kind of micromanaging the details and wanted to kind of spend more efforts on AI stuff instead of was a crypt of mining equipment so that kind of that kind of diverse big business a little bit so that kind of started the the conflict started to escalate yeah one other thing is I think Jehan also said to the employees that bit mein almost didn't survive that period and actually what he said is the only reason it was able to pull through was that the price of Bitcoin hadn't increased later I'm assuming he's talking about kind of you know through the spring and an even a bit the summer we saw the price of a coin increase but has bit Maine struggled this year in 2019 still I think in 2019 I mean he said himself in that meeting based on the transcript I got that the market share of big demands mining equipment has declined I mean I think they're still the number one has that the most dominant market share in terms of making mining machines but the market dominance has declined and at the same time their rival competitors like Kannan and what's miners micro Beatty in a silicon they have been able to seize on the opportunity of the price price jump since earlier this year so I mean they are I think they are doing during fine but in terms of a market share the mining equipment business has declined and also the mining pool business is also declining if you look at the hash ray real-time hash red distribution PTC command ampoule used to dominate the top two ranks but this year it was taken by pulling and f2 pool yeah and one other thing that is just so curious is that at least last year McCree was chairman and he owned 36% of it main holdings while Geoghegan actually owned only 20% so how was jihun able to oust machree if McCree was the larger shareholder and I mean it was pretty dramatic the way he did it I think you know not allowing him back in the building after this trip and having his email access already cut off like it was like the you know this this was a huge surprise to McCree I guess we could say yeah that's also one question I haven't been able to figure out to be honest if you look at the IPO process that they file to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last year as of September last year there were co-ceos co-chairman Mike Reiss you're right my crew has about six thirty six percent I'll be may Holdings Jian has about 20 percent and cognition and under to two or three other family members they have 46 percent respectively and another 18 percent was hold was held by a trust for the employment style option incentive that was the all the ordinary shares that counts for about like nearly 90 percent I think and all the others like nearly 10 percent were held by external shareholders now they were basically preferred a and prefer B shares through the equity raising payment did in 2017 and 2018 so technically I don't know how he managed to do it but that's just give you the breakdown of their equity structure based on the IPO filing they they filed last year I don't know if they have change it in any way but what jihun said in the in the in the in the meeting was he stepped when when they step out step down as co-ceos he also step down he also led my crew John take the Chairman role so supposedly he was not a chairman and now he is a chairman so I don't I don't technically how they did it was somehow they did it yeah I saw Debbie one tweeting that she she doesn't think and and Sampson Mao I think tweeted the same thing that it doesn't appear that the shareholders were consulted the other shareholders so yeah so maybe find this out later alright so in a second we're gonna discuss kind of what the next steps are and both for my curry as well as 4-bit mean itself but first a quick word from the sponsors who

or my Cree I guess his name is is now saying that he intends to bring a lawsuit against bit maze so how do you expect that aspect to play out so I mean I tried to reach out to to him for a couple of times but he didn't really pick up the phone didn't respond to us so I don't know how exactly he's going to do it going to to do it if you look at the the IPO filing the date last year the structure of Bhima is actually that of the Beijing women technology is the operational body based in Beijing and it has a company based in Hong Kong and they have they have a parent company based in Hong Kong and the holding company is richest are incorporated in Cayman Island so I think the way he wants to do might be taking the taking losses somewhere outside of meaning in China but he may not I don't know if he is actually going to bring it to the court or if when he said in the in the later letters this morning he said he's going to return it off with some legal action so he's he didn't specify what kind of action he will take but lets it remains to be seen how exactly he institute he's going to do it but I will mention he will he will resolve it somewhere outside of mainland China and do you have a sense of whether the others shareholders support him or Jihan I mean at this point none of the shareholders have actually spoken anything about it I mean we tried to reach out to a few but they kind of do not want to say anything at this moment okay I did see that in the Financial Times Liu Fang editor-in-chief of Chinese crypto news outlet chain News said quote everyone is on woo Jihan side except for our John's assistant people in the Bitcoin circle believe in blockchain encrypted currency not AI and they blame last year's mass layoffs on on jean meaning my curry so another and then there's another article in the FT which quoted somebody as saying that Jihan coming back as like Steve Jobs returning to Apple is that your sense of that's of you know that being hell employees or other people in the community view this COO yeah I kind of I have a kind of sense of that there's another article in Chinese written by attention news outlet the way that writer describes here was it was like a Spring Festival during the the All Hands meeting people were applauding it people were cheering for it because G Hines back that was that was one I got from the article because people were feeling is actually coming back to the to save it because when the article said when I think it was starting from early October this year the Makri has had some corn called crazy ideas to reshuffle the human resource to shuffle the company structure internally which caused some complaints among the employees so when Jihan got back and he announced that they were gonna put a pause on that kind of crazy ideas and the people were like cheering for it so that was the kind of color I got from that article which I do feel it's to some extent it does reflect how people respond to this this whole drama in the past though the company has also made a big bet on Bitcoin cash which many especially in the crypto community later viewed as a mistake so what do you think that that will be Jihan strategy going forward or well you know how has that kind of debacle affected bit mean and also jihun's stature and also his plans going forward to be honest I don't know if he's gonna continue I don't know if he has any like plan a strategy for that part but what months he have observe is since later last year after the Bitcoin cash half-orc I think he himself has been pretty quiet about all these things he used to be very like jihun used to be kind of very active on both Weibo and Twitter about Bitcoin cash you know the things he believed in but I think since later last year he has been kind of quiet down on that front so I think it remains to be seen if he is gonna being active again and vocal gamba this but I think he might be continued to focus more on the mining equipment business or and yeah so this leads us to bit means next move which is I guess that they have confidentially filed for an IPO with SEC how do you think all this drama will affect its IPO plans well I think the if he's sure that they have a confidentially filed and IPO with SEC they're gonna have like a back-and-forth conversations until the until they officially reveal the f1 form so I think it may have some impact on the whole process because they want to be I mean the the regulators want to be sure that this company has a sustainable has the wealth structure the company management so now you have houses a main shareholder a chairman and a legal representative of this company how are you gonna make sure that it will sustain to be a well-managed company going forward so I think that is a question mark not just from the regulator but from I think from people in this community biggest because still never figure out like how that actually happened and whether that amounts to illegal or illegitimate removal of a chairman for a company at the same time the its rival is it kanan or what did you how did she pronounce it earlier kanan crazy or kenan Kanan creative so they also recently filed for an IPO in the US on NASDAQ they're attempting to raise four hundred million dollars do you think this has had any effect on G Hans decision to oust my Cree and do you also think that this drama bit mean could kind of give an opening to to their competitor well I think I mean the the news of the news about kind of finding IPO has in being around for like months before they actually filed the submits application to the SEC so I think both of them know that they want to go public and both know that their competitors are trying to try to get ahead of the game but what we see is this year women's mining equipment business because the sales of the miners actually like 90 percent more than 90 percent of the man's business so the mining pole is really really small for bit man so the decline of market share on that front is definitely a sign that this company's facing a serious challenge from the arrival competitors so I think the with Widow without the IPO front canal they may is filming the pressure because they see the competition when the when the Bitcoin price jumped in April starting from April both canal ela silicon and micro PD which makes the Watts minor they have been able to ship the products because they have enough they ever have been they have being able to actually have the capability from their ship suppliers to ship the car to ship the miners whereas Bhima has had difficulty of doing that so they kind of lost a bit part of the opportunity to their competitors so I think that is one push that makes you hunt to you know really come back to pull this company strategy back to the main business which is making the pickle mining machines and wait why couldn't they ship but their competitors could well so that that all boils down to the bottleneck of some big  mining the Bitcoin mining equipment so most of these companies they are trying to make more advanced equal mining machines and that depends on the chip so many of them use 7 nanometers 8 meters or 10 millimeters and you actually have to have the ship from say tsmc or sims and the foundry companies to supply you with enough wafers and because the wafers can be also be used for those ship can also be used for like smartphones and other electronic devices and those are like big orders even much bigger than the mining companies so TSMC and Sampson they have different priorities for supplying their chip they have their own problem of producing enough chip and they have to have to prioritize which customer they cannot supply to so all the mining miner makers they're facing the same problem which is the capability from the from the wafers for the foundry business but so why was it that the competitors were able to overcome that problem but that main wasn't so Bhima has they all have different kinds of products so if they use a less advanced mind ship the product will have a less powerful hashing rate and it will be cheaper so and then because this cheaper the suppliers will have more can supply a much bigger quantity for that because it's less advanced technology so that they can produce more but if you if like Bhima has trying to try to sell their empire s17 for example or estimate impro and they're using chip from TSM see that is the seven nanometer chip from tsmc and at the same time they're their competitors are using a little bit less service like saying in our mirrors or 10 nanometers so the suppliers we have will have a stronger capability to supply for that kind of chip because that's less advanced so they have a better they have the capability to produce more of that to supply I think oh that's interesting that's it's kind of weird how it means competitive advantage sort of worked against them in a weird way I raised well this has been incredibly fascinating and I guess we're just gonna have to see how all this drama continues to play out at bit main but thank you for explaining everything that happened in this past week and how this coup went down thanks for coming undone confirmed sure my pleasure don't forget next up is the news recap stick around for this weekend crypto after this short break will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and

everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap before we get to this week's news I just wanted to mention that after seven months in almost a hundred emails I finally got an interview with one of the co-creators of Libre Christian cannellini who is now the chief economist at calibra on this week's unchained he answered a huge range of questions on everything from how Facebook will earn money from Calibra to how Facebook and the Libra Association plan to satisfy the contradictory desires to both prevent and money laundering but also Bank the unbanked I try to ask some of the questions that lawmakers asked but did not actually give Mark Zuckerberg time to answer during the congressional hearing as well as to understand further the issues relating to China's digital currency and whether Libra really is the best countermeasure to that if you haven't caught this episode be sure to check it out ok now on to the news the first circle is one that I have not actually seen widely shared but I found it fascinating and this is my headline on it how Russia and other rogue States are creating an alternative financial system with crypto this long read wired article looks into how cryptocurrency mining is booming in post-soviet countries and why Hannah Lucinda Smith writes quote there there are layers to how Russia might weaponize cryptocurrencies in the era of hybrid warfare the first is already well underway using cryptocurrencies to pay for acts of political sabotage like the hacking of Hillary Clinton's emails the next appears to be in progress the mass stockpiling of cryptocurrencies through intense mining using Russia's huge gas reserves if it manages together enough it could secure itself an influential position as blocking usage continues to grow perhaps comparable to the place the u.s. holds to the dollar in the traditional banking system in the meantime it provides the Kremlin with access to a vast hoard of capital that is difficult to control and trace but the third layer is most troubling experts say at some point in the future perhaps within the next decade Russia and other rogue states could create an alternative financial system based on blockchain that allows them to freely trade with one another channeling money to armed groups and attracting investment to keep their economies of float despite international sanctions as I mentioned it's a long read but there's a lot of color and detail here it really goes I mean she went to all these places that I had a look of on Google Maps they were names I had not even heard of before just little forgotten places in post-soviet countries that now are seeing this huge crypto currency boom so it gives her really fascinating to look into how the crypto space race is playing into geopolitics which i think is going to be a big theme for the coming year all right the next story that I want to highlight is bit Mex reveals tens of thousands of user emails the sublease obviously happened last week but it happened after I released last week's unconfirmed one of the most absurd security breaches happened last week when Bitcoin futures exchange bit Mex emailed the majority of its users with the email addresses in the to field exposing what Larry Cermak of the block estimated to be 30,000 email addresses he tweeted there is already a 30k email dump selling on dark net for any user that was involved in this leak get ready for constant phishing attempts and emails from competitors be careful the next story I want to highlight the etherium marketing Dow has been summoned it was only a matter of time theorem now housed at marketing Dow while other blockchains such as - and decried have built in funding function built-in funding for functions such as marketing aetherium isn't going that route it's going a particularly aetherium a way via adele one forked from Moloch Dow the founders of the etherium marketing Dow include consensus advisor and former CML Amanda Cassatt former etherium foundation advisor and blockchain author William mu gr medic cartel douse Alexander nation I'm not sure if I'm saying that name right former CMO shapeshift CMO and current director at Waksman elementally Coleman and more than 50 others first up on the Dow's to-do list is creating an etherion brand positioning statement as well as a catchphrase akin to bitcoins digital gold handle next story squares Bitcoin sales hit 14300 which the blocks estimates to be one hundred and fifty million dollars also the block notes the square notes that first time BTC buyers from the square cash app have roughly doubled since its redesign in September and the strong performance in q3 partially from BTC sales has prompted Square to push its 2019 revenue guidance upward the next story I want to highlight the silly study saying one whale drove bitcoins 2017 a price surged if you're gonna read one article about that far-fetched study saying that one individual was responsible for the Bitcoin bubble of 2017 how about the Elaine oz or use bloomberg opinion piece which gives several more plausible explanations to the author's hypotheses first she says that they attribute one of the custodial account addresses like that of an exchange to one for an individual which that's a huge mistake if that is true Jeremie layer also said that that was what he thought also their contention that tether seems to be issued in response to a decreasing Bitcoin price could be explained by tether being issued in response to user demand she also has an interesting hypothesis having to do with how traders in China have been using tether after the Bitcoin trading ban in that country but her final paragraph is the most important point and here she's referring to the loan that tether gave to BitFenix when one of the phoenixes business partners had hundreds of millions of dollars of its funds seized by authorities quote perhaps the takeaway is that when banks refuse to do business with crypto traders or when a government bans trading altogether it doesn't stop traders from trading it just forces them to find creative solutions if it were easy for a crypto exchanges to use the traditional banking system there would be no need for tether at all finally fun bits this isn't exactly a fun story but I wanted to highlight a piece that Aleks Gladstein wrote in Bitcoin magazine where he expounds on his idea his ideas from last week's unconfirmed so of course as I mentioned this isn't a fun read because if you remember that episode he was talking about what he sees as the significance of China's digital currency and it's a little bit of a dystopian view and however while he was describing just how dystopian he could it could be in this Bitcoin magazine piece he basically he said that a blockchain based digital yuan could be quote lipstick for app an optical Pig so this is definitely worth a read because it highlights the issues in a great way and is is well well written ok that's it for this week's news to learn more about the topics that Wolfie and I discussed as well as the stories from this week's news recap be sure to check out the links in
