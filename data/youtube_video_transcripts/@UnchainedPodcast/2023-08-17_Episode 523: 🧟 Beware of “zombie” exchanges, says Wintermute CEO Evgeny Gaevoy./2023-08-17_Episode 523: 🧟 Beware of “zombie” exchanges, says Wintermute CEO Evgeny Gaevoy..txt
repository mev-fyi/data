my biggest challenge with current environment is like I think there are a lot of zombies still out there like an exchange site and we don't trade on a lot of them because we actually think that a lot of them are zombies can you elaborate which changes which exchanges do you suspect would be nice I wish yeah no it's that that's that's kind of weird which exchanges do you not trade on we don't need any yeah which large exchanges which which exchanges are the top ten do not trade on no comment on whether or not they're zombies yeah I mean that's it's kind of like it's overlapping circles pretty much like our suspect isn't being zombies and not training on them yeah I mean look after what happened with FTX last year I do feel like it's a bit of a public service to you know you can say look I don't know I'm not confident you know caveat and tour we don't have all the information but here's where we're not training the hardest bit is you just like I mean I can say it and then I just make a lot of enemies for no good reason and that's that's basically the unfortunate truth of it
