liquidy and compound check them out on ethereum mainnet arbitrum and optimism today's guest is wassi lawyer a lawyer specializing in restructuring and insolvency welcome again wassi hi Laura I'm glad to be back it's unusual to have a guest back right after their last appearance but after the first declaration from new FTX CEO John Ray and the company's bankruptcy case we definitely need to unpack this for listeners who didn't get to read or hear about this yesterday here is the section that set the tone for the rest of the document Rey starts by saying I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience and he references his participation as the chief structuring officer and what he calls several of the largest corporate failures in history and here he mentions a few including most famously Enron then he says that almost all of these situations were quote characterized by defects of some sort of internal controls Regulatory Compliance human resources and systems Integrity now here's the money quote never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls in such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information has occurred here from compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals this situation is unprecedented onesie when you read the document did you have the same reaction is the f2x bankruptcy quite possibly worse than many of the most notorious bankruptcy cases in history I mean can you really blame CZ from walking away from trying to buy this dumpster file um yeah this this it's it's kind of insane right because um like two weeks ago like like genuinely um everyone looked at FTX and little media as you know Untouchable and you kind of thought that they were just Giga Geniuses are being every inefficiency making billions of dollars Stockholm figures Etc but they are not and the controls were terrible um there's a there's a there's a quote I kind of want to pick out here when he when when John ray goes through every single balance sheet of the sort of four silos that he's that he's identified and in every single one of those financial statements he says however because this balance sheet was produced what adapters were controlled by Mr Bank read I do not have confidence in it and therefore the information there may not be accurate as of today stated so effectively for large bits of this filing is basically telling us this is what we've been told this is not audited this is what SPF gave me I have no faith in this whatsoever yeah that line stuck out at me as well you know I mean it's sort of a more bureaucratic and polite way of saying do not trust this person and another thing that shocked me was you're right so for people who haven't read it basically he divides the Enterprise that's going into bankruptcy into kind of what he calls four silos and it's like some of the different corporate entities then what he does is he breaks out the assets and liabilities of each interestingly I noticed uh every time he presents those balances he will write balances of customer crypto assets deposited were not recorded as assets on the balance sheet and are not presented and it would be in bold and underlined so yes can you break that down for listeners what does that mean um it means that when when SBF said oh we have more than enough uh assets to cover all the liabilities and all the customer deposits he didn't even know what the customer deposits were because he just straight up wasn't recording them so when you deposit one into the sdx deposit into the STX it should have recalled an FTX just wasn't so he was literally just talking about his ass yeah and you know this puts comments around things like internally poorly labeled Fiat account in New Light because essentially um as we saw in his text messages with the Vox reporter there were no um separation of accounts when it came to Alameda and um FTX when customers deposited money into FTX they were actually literally just putting it right into alameda's bank account which I mean that it like that just absolutely blows my mind there was no attempt whatsoever to keep customers money safe and some notion that they might give the money back to them at least you know I mean granted I'm not in sdf's head but based on that that would be maybe a logical conclusion yeah I think that's right um I mean just to sort of backtrack about the four different silos which you can identify is essentially for in layman's terms FTX us FDX International uh the ventures portfolio and Alameda so that's the four silos that's identified and he's still in the process of identity of actually figuring out what's going on he has shown us the uh balance sheets which he says it's not reliable whatsoever but that's probably a starting point interesting point to note is in the US you know balance sheet which were told unreliable whatever there's still a like customer custodial funds which is probably good for customers if there's certain facts that are being kept in custody whereas you don't see the same in the FTX International um balance sheet which again is um who have been told is not reliable okay so the so are you saying the FTX U.S customers have a greater chance or or even that it's very likely that they'll have a better claim on their assets and maybe even yeah I think it's I think it is my view and it has been from the start that FTX us is in a probably much better state strangely enough because of regulations um that FDX International because like we discussed previously Laura all the DJ and stuff was happening happening between International and um Alameda okay and so for some of those other groups Alameda or Alameda research so anybody I guess who had loaned money to them or uh the ventures silo or the.com group what would you say are um more likely outcomes for those creditors to be honest we still we still don't know it's it's obviously it's not looking good um ftx.com Silo were referring to is obviously FTX International silo um apparently there's 2.2 billion of assets which is reasonable amount of assets we have no idea what the customer liabilities are so if you look at that in terms of what sort of monies you can get in from Alameda you know like we're identified of the structure that seems to create the company loan um you know maybe you're getting some recovery there but again it's it's almost too early to say at this point because um the sort of new CEO is still going through the books it's still trying to figure out what the position is and he's sort of and he's actually mentioned um that the account was so poorly capped that daybreaks give to start from scratch all over again um to sort of a site for paragraph that you do because of historical cash back with failures the debtors do not yet know the exact amount of cash that efts group held at the point they filed the chapter 11. just so I understand this first day Declaration was there some deadline to post this or why wouldn't he just wait until he had some of that information I mean it's a first day declaration right so um I'm not a U.S bankruptcy lawyer you know I'm a UK bankruptcy lawyer down a bit of chapter 11s um couldn't recite the actual U.S codes to you but I think uh but generally what happens is that you kind of get a sort of early statement from the the new data protect I think possessions to abuse um yeah death in possession okay so let's pull out a few of the other um maybe shocking details I don't know you can tell me but some things that stuck out at me were for instance that the company used an unsecured group email account as the root user to access confidential private keys and critically sensitive data for the FTX group companies around the world there was the absence of daily reconciliation of positions on the blockchain the use of software to conceal the misuse of customer funds that one to my mind has alarm Bells around it the secret exemption of Alameda from certain aspects of ftx.com's Auto Liquidation protocol which okay a bombshell and then the absence of independent governance between Alameda and FTX do you want to can you just comment on any of those um I mean the comment on all of those is the same which is what the it's like any one of them on their own you have been like what the heck is going on here but all of them together Jesus so Alameda gets to djend and trade without fear of being liquidated by the engine everyone has access to private Keys via unsecured group either um you get a back door although at this point given how you know given how everything's been done it looks like he was literally just shoveling cash out the front door straight to Alameda but the the back door that allows you to co-mingle customer funds insane everything's just insane right and that's kind of why you know it's burning up the fire I just almost have no words um the more that I learned one last bit that seemed it raised my eyebrows was referencing two of the audits that he was able to find one was from a company armanino which he said it's a firm that he's professionally familiar with then he says that the second audit was by Prager metis with which he says he is not familiar and then he says quote whose website indicates that they are the first ever CPA firm to officially open its metaverse headquarters in the metaverse platform to Central land foreign content should I use you know just from people just for people in the space and sometimes I I tend to say look just go for the more legitimate ones because when it comes down to it someone looks at because you know some people say that you know accounting and auditing is um an art or other than science right some people are perhaps or creative than others or perhaps more negligent than others but it's quite clear here um that new CEO of Mr Ray clearly does not have any faith in the Integrity of financial systems has been provided which is why I said can you really blame CZ from walking away with it after looking at the documents for like 30 minutes all right so in a moment we're going to talk about another Wrinkle in the bankruptcy case but first a quick word

digital markets is seeking protection from creditors in the U.S under chapter 15 of the U.S bankruptcy code and the way that Reuters describe it is that this allows a foreign debtor to Shield Assets in the country and they say non-us companies use the measure to block creditors who want to file lawsuits or tie up Assets in the United States what would you say is the significance of this move right so this is actually far more interesting to me than firstly declaration not because the first declaration there's an interesting you've got a lot of singers in there but in terms of information there's there's not much simply because it's all unverified but this development is a very big one and a very very interesting one to me because and and I can say look I've done restructurings of the insolvencies a lot I've never really seen something like this especially because of what's in this emergency motion that's been filed by FTX I.E the new CEO of FDX so just to provide a bit of background chapter 11 is a bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S when you enter into chapter 11 you get a worldwide moratorium which says that um your creditors around the world can't enforce against you and you have time to reorganize and sort of reorganize your your assets you know whether it's just duplicate whether it's to sell it on basically to realize value for the stakeholders involved goodness chapter 11. what's chapter 15. chapter 15 is a recognition proceeding where you recognize a bankruptcy proceeding that's happened in another part of the world now you can have multiple bankruptcy proceedings and different bosses well of course but you can only have one what they call a main proceeding which is the main bankruptcy so what we're having here is a clash we're having a jurisdictional battle between the US and the promise because the Bahamas the Bahamas entity has been put into provisional liquidation which is also a bankruptcy process where professionals have been appointed professionals taking control of the of the company and their their role was provisional Liquidators is they're going to preserve the assets of the company to see if there's anything to do with it how to liquidate it how to restructure it if possible so what is happening to Bahamas but at the same time the same things happening in the U.S and and what's happened with the chapter 15 is that the guys in the Bahamas have gone and filed in the U.S in a different Court uh the state history of New York rather than the District of Delaware which is where the chapter 11 is held to recognize the Bahamas proceedings and if you recognize Obama's proceedings that means that you are saying all right all the asses the Bahamas can be sort of adjudicated according to you know the the process of the Bahamas but it doesn't that doesn't fly right because wait you're kind of trying to educate the same Assets in the U.S at the same time so that's what I mean by a jurisdictional battle was going on between two jurisdictions as to who gets to control perhaps not the whole process but at least part of the process and from what we can tell valuable parts of process well okay wait so unpack this a little bit because the first filing the chapter 11 deals with certain entities but this second filing deals with a separate entity the Bahamas unit so I don't really understand how there can be a jurisdictional battle when you so I understand when you say there can only be one main proceeding but in this case where it's different entities how would that be considered as you know them uh battling each other all right so look you look at the the FTX I think nothing is your markets which is the the Bahamas entry entered into provisional liquidation so you enter into process before the chapter 11 itself okay and it was uh it's kind of I think it sits under the FDA trading entity so it's in the FTX International Group and what we unders what we seem to understand here is that there are sizable assets I'm sitting in this promise entry but largely under control the compartment government but let's let's go let's go to that later now if you're an FTX us and you've put a whole group to chapter 11 right I think I'm fairly certain the Bahamas entity is meant to be the chapter 11 as well it should be but assuming your administrating thing the bankruptcy of the entire group obviously you want to have all of the answers to the group so that you can run to be structure in the US now if certain assets are so so in in a sort of Ideal World what happens is you go chapter 11. the Bahamas government the Bahamas legal system recognizes the chapter 11 and says all right we're going to cooperate with you in any way shape and form right you're running the chapter 11 you tell us to do a club you tell us to go ahead and do all this stuff we're gonna go ahead and enforce the world about us so that's generally how cross-bott and zombie works with other jurisdictions um obviously very familiar to UK you have this thing known as sort of mutual recognition uh recognition treaties and a lot of it starts looking a lot like International diplomacy right because when you're looking at companies that span the entire Globe your insolvencies will spend the entire Globe as well and for the for in solventy and restructuring to be somewhat sensible someone has to read it and there is first of all there's a lot of money in leading it just for for the country itself and that's why you see certain countries sort of start developing as what we call restructuring hubs uh the U.S is obviously one of them chapter 11. the UK is another one Singapore is starting to become more of a restructuring Hub as well so so so yeah there's this issue of of cross-border recognition because it only works if you all recognize each other's um efforts and each other's ability to administer assets um which are within the jurisdiction and also sort of without because we recognize that you know you're the main proceeding what they call is the center of main interests um especially using this sort of UK uh terminology set up main interest which means you get to run you get around this this insolvency and so how does it get decided kind of which one becomes the main one good question this has happened before it's this case called Bahama which I tweeted about earlier um there's someone to look at it because in this case Bahama we had pretty much obviously exactly the same thing it wasn't as much for dumpster fire but it was a yes I think it was a real estate development it departures and chapter 11 was filed and but the Bahamas Anthony also entered in the process in the Bahamas and in that case um the the the sort of Bahamas sort of one jurisdiction because the U.S said look it's it's pointless for us to do anything here um because all the Assets in the Bahamas and even if we made any um decisions regards to the assets the end of arms and the Bahamas they're going to recognize us so we just dismissed the chapter violent very very different case of course because now we're looking at a completely completely different situation with a company that with assets sort of worldwide and at least part of it in the US perhaps the more interesting thing are that is that there are certain allegations being made in this emergency motion regarding um the role of the bahaman government India now if you recall Sam was saying look we're going to let Bahamas people withdraw their money because you know because the Bahamas regularly just told me to do so the farmers I think was the Securities Commission came on said we never said anything like that but now this is being repeated by the new CEO of FTX that that the bahaman government may have had in all of this and when you say that you mean like in the malfeasance at FTX is that what you're saying yeah let me um well let me read this out here right in addition in connection with investigating a hack on Sunday November 13th Mr bagman Freedom Mr wanks later in record verified text that the Harmon Regulators instructed that post-putition transfers of debtor assets be made by Mr Wang and Mr Penguin free who would the debtors understand were both effectively in the custody of Bahamas authorities and that such assets were custody on fire blocks under control of the Bahamian government the debtors have credible evidence that the Bahamian government is responsible for directing unauthorized access to the data system for the purpose of obtaining digital assets of data that took place after the commencement of these cases I.E the chapter 11. the appointment of the joint professional liquid is and regulation of chapter 15 please asked us in serious question it appears that the automatic stay has been flaunted by a government actor no less this is no time to be arguing over venue so that's a direct quote from something that the new CEOs filed in the U.S court it's pretty bad isn't it wow okay so but then in that kind of situation what do they like force fire blocks to return the money or I I don't know like you know how when somebody's been transferred what what can be done I I I really just couldn't understand I I'm answer this question like it's it's absolutely well to be right because if you're saying that if it's one thing to say that the um to say that uh someone in the Bahamas or the Bahamas companies and cooperating right because if they're not cooperating what do you do you go ahead as long as you get it recognized in Bahamas you do your chapter 11 do whatever the hell you wanted it you go to the Bahamas and court order and you you're going to recognize this so please carry out uh on what's been agreed but now what we're saying is that the Bahamas government is involved that's that's a whole different ball game man it's a whole different ball game and so what are you actually going to do if you're if you're the United States Bankruptcy called here okay cool we're gonna have to chapter 11 anyway your chapter 15. We're Not Gonna you know screw this We're Not Gonna recognize your thing going on in the Bahamas but wait a minute the Bahamas isn't going to recognize the thing you have going on in there either  what does that leave us yeah and now they have all these assets yeah because they're sitting on the assets right right so so what do you think happens next I think we've grabbed the popcorn and we didn't see to be honest it's like a lot of historical presence for right where uh where allegedly a government Authority seizes assets and refuses to cooperate with another government or another jurisdiction I I think did I say earlier I have no words because I feel like I'm in the same position again but like in terms of kind of formal procedure type stuff what would be the next step they're trying to get it they're trying to get the some chapter 15 sort of transferred to the uh to Delaware which is where the chapter 11 is filed and then they're probably gonna sort of have a bit of a fight over it and then we'll see what the U.S court says in all the circumstances we wait for a bit more information to come out from the Bahamas um but the interesting bit sort of take away from from us I think uh for sort of listeners I guess and just general people is that Sam seems to really want the Bahamas to win they he wants for jurisdiction to be in the Bahamas and this is interesting to me because it it sort of shows you what he seems to have in mind and Sam does not seem to have given up altogether and he seems to think from some messages that they lead all published that he thinks he can still save the company that is likely the reason why I'm not sure if these chapter 15 things is being driven by him or being driven by the government we're driven by the promotional Liquidators um but for him what happened to the chapter 11 is that he's out because he's resigned he could have stayed on but thank Christ is out so he's out he's got a professional in he's a good professional and he says that you know he's unsophisticated completely out of his death and uh it's a complete show right and everything that he is saying is not on the out of the company he's completely out that's what uh John Ray has been saying truly speaking in the Bahamas he's kind of in a similar position because you've got a joint professional provision Liquidator in there it's a professional it's Office Professional coming in here to sort of security at the company and keep things running along but in a sort of provisional liquidation it's still not completely over and it's open if for Sam suddenly come up with hey I've got like eight billion dollars and I can now take this company out of joint professional liquidation and that seems to be what he is trying to do he seems to be trying to save his company outside of the US because he's been disenfranchised in the U.S okay and wait and so just to connect the dots so you're saying that you think that chapter 15 is being driven by Sam I I don't think it's I'm not sure who's driving it there's been noted here in in the statement that you know John Ray has spoken with the general professional Liquidators and they didn't tell us they were going to do a chapter 15. so I think it's custom hit them by surprise as well and in many ways it sort of hit Everybody by surprise like everything else in this story yeah but we but we can see from the messages that Sam has this have come out right which is to set you know what was the biggest single up and the guy whoever his first one who says oh and he says the one thing everyone told me to do everything would be about 70 fixed right now if I hadn't chapter 11. and he says we get there if both either Gary on the shot comes back presumably he needs a bit more support on the side right now and B we win a jurisdictional battle versus Delaware so it looks like he really wants the Bahamas to win because he thinks rightly wrongly that he has somehow fundraise and get a deal done outside of the chapter 11. which seems to be insane to me it could well be the case that he's just completely office rocker I was gonna say who knows but it's very unlikely because he was a very successful entrepreneur right his face was on all his magazines he was being um he was a media darling etc for someone like that it's incredibly easy to raise money and he probably still has that in his mind because I saw this sort of leaked term sheet that was going around I think it was on the financial times something where it was like pretty amateur kind of crappy terms where he sort of still felt like he was in charge because he's just used to that right you're used to people throwing money at you when when money is cheap obviously in the in the previous years when you're the fastest group one of the fastest growing business in the world where you're the face of crypto in uh the West essentially but it's not very very different it's a very different ball game when now you're insolvent the way you do fundraising is different the way you structure a deal is different you can no longer go out doing structuring a deal going promising someone infinite upside Etc because they know that you're in trouble now there's a whole new balance sheet the way you fix it the sort of financing you're looking at the sort of funding you're looking at is very very different yeah I commented to someone that when everyone you know thought he was the Golden Boy he raised 2 billion so now that his reputation is definitely in a different place I I was like how does he think he's gonna raise eight billion but anyway who knows there have been so many crazy twists to this story um you know I'm not gonna not gonna say it's impossible well was he this has been such an amazing discussion I'm assured that you're going to be back soon because apparently there's all kinds of twists and turns with this bankruptcy thanks again for coming on Unchained no worries happy happy to chat and I'm sure

tuning in to this week's news recap Alameda CEO confesses to use in customer funds and SPF may have used a back door the New York Times reported that Caroline Ellison the CEO of Alameda research declared an accompany-wide meeting that the trading firm used customer funds from the now bankrupt FDX to repay its loans Ellison stated that the earlier crypto collapses caused some of alameda's loans to be recalled according to her the firm didn't have enough money to repay those loans so it agreed with FTX Executives to transfer FTX customer funds to repay them Reuters reported that Sam bankman free the founder of both Alameda and FTX built a back door to FDX to change Financial records and move funds to Alameda without triggering internal compliance checks the news agency said that SPF could also use the tool to modify records so the State of Affairs wouldn't be visible to external Auditors bankman freed denied the allegations in an interview with Vox SPF blamed Messi accounting

Holdings of ftt ftx's exchange token Finance is reportedly cooperating with authorities on the case lawmakers use ftx's example to regulate the industry in addition to taking the markets the implosion of FTX grabbed the attention of American lawmakers who said that it proves that the industry needs stricter regulations to protect retail investors the anti-crypto US Senator Elizabeth Warren said that the collapse of FTX must be a wake-up call for Congress and financial Regulators to hold this industry and its Executives accountable additionally Warren together with Senator Dick Durbin sent a letter to SBF demanding information on its shocking collapse U.S treasury secretary Janet Yellen known for her Hardline stance against crypto also called for more effective oversight over the crypto markets senator Pat Toomey a former guest on Unchained who has been vocal about his opposition to the sec's enforcement actions on crypto said that the crypto industry has been operating with ambiguity because Regulators don't provide a proper framework and lawmakers refuse to act after spending months talking to regulators and lawmakers SPF told Vox  them they make everything worse he
