welcome Larry hey it's good to be here Larry since we're closing in on the end of the year what's your high-level overview of what's going on at a macro level in the crypto markets sure so like you already said I'm the head of research at the block and so we're you know mainly a research company and we just released our November report so I'm right now what we're seeing is that the markets are actually not that active the trading volumes which i think is one of the best indicators of the overall interest in crypto are really low so right now they're 12 percent lower than last month the daily average trading volume is about 1.4 billion last when I was 1.6 and if we look all the way back to June it was you know close to 3.5 billion so more than twice lower right now so the interest in the crypto market is is really low currently and you know that's that's reflecting on on the trading volumes and that's reflecting on the overall sentiment so you know like one really good thing to look at for trading volume is you know overall it hasn't been a really reliable indicator because there's just so much fake volume but since bitwise came out with their report and you know they identified the exchanges that don't fake as much volume we can get a really good approximation of what's actually going on the market and like I already mentioned it's currently not doing so well and that's that's mostly for spot exchanges but if we look at you know derivative exchanges for like a bit max volumes we look at gbtc traded volumes all there all of these volumes are currently at eight months lows so yeah the market is not doing that well right now but as we both know that can turn it out really quickly so you know even though the trend this it's not super favorable right now encrypted it doesn't mean much you know next month it's getting shoot up again and everything's going to be fine and one of the aspects that you mentioned is the Bitcoin derivative data so that is self-reported so you know I'm wondering you know what is it that is important about this data you know and what can you glean when you look at that as opposed to the spot market is there anything different that you're noticing and how much can we trust that data sure so it depends what kind of derivative data are you looking at right so there are multiple derivative markets right now and I think 2019 has been a really really good year for the maturing of the financial infrastructure in crypto especially for Bitcoin so they're currently multiple different derivatives markets one is the regulated one so you have futures on the CME and backed back launch Inc fairly recently and it's already getting you know it's growing fairly well recently it's currently at about 5% of the CMEs volumes so that's regulated you can trust that 100% because that's those are regulated futures then you have two unregulated markets so you know the main player is bet max they also self-reported but Rhythmics has historically been reliable with reporting the volume you know there are multiple things that you can do to cross-check that so for example for spot exchanges what we do at the block is that we look at the reported trading volume and compared it to the website visits so you know you get an estimation of how many people actually go on the site and then you compare that to the amount of reported trading volume and you get a ratio if the ratio is too high compared to other exchanges it likely means that the self-reported numbers are not correct but for bitwixe that is not the case but max has been historically reliable and then you have they have options so the biggest player is there but and those have also been historically reliable so you know quite on the country actually the spot exchanges are the ones that are the least reliable so you really have to be careful there you know eighty percent of all the volume maybe even more that you see on corn market cap is fake so you really need to just stick to the exchanges that have been reliable most of them are regulated in the u.s. one other thing that I saw in your report was that you noted that hedge funds are seemingly crowding into a short position right now why do you think that's happening and what could that signify so you know that it's really hard to say what could that signify but I guess you know the obvious position right now is like I already mentioned markets are not doing that well and I think what that means in crypto is that when volatility is really low and you know the prices haven't been moving drastically it means that people are anticipating that you know the markets are just not going to recover like it you can identify the cycles in crypto you know like the one we saw in 2017 and the one that we saw that we see right now in 2019 you can identify them through the volumes and when the volumes are dropping you know for a lot of hedge funds and for a lot of funds over all that that means that sends I'm a signal that we're entering into you know another downturn and as we both know that sometimes takes years and you know the market basically peak in June and ever since then it's been going down and it's hard to tell them when it's going to recover so if I were to guess these hedge funds are probably thinking you know we're in another in another down cycle and this could take better you know multiple months so that's probably why they're there in in short positions but again it's very hard to speculate on that and you mentioned that you know especially the infrastructure for Bitcoin in particular has grown quite a bit this year and I used to know what you have been seeing in terms of just like the basic liquidity like is it that the infrastructure is there but still there hasn't been a lot of interest or yeah so so the infrastructure this year has really improved drastically and especially especially in the in the regulated markets so the CMA and backed are now you know going head-to-head back has been gaining a lot of lot more interest lately and then you you know you also start having back 10 cm he also announced that they're gonna launch options fairly soon so you start having these regulated markets on top of the unregulated ones that we had before and the reason why this happening with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies you know like cerium is that there's just the most regulatory clarity and bitcoin is you know by far the most liquid cryptocurrency I I did some research a couple weeks ago and at that point Bitcoin was four times more liquid than etherium and I think about seven or eight times more than and then X RP and then there's a big gap after that so you know it's the most liquid by far and it's also from my experience at least institutional players that started joining this year it's really the first year when large players are starting to join their trading Bitcoin they're not trying anything else so so the liquidity has been there in in May June and July now it's it's a little bit it's a little bit lower again but the infrastructure is getting better and what that means is that when there is another you know another market cycle the infrastructure will be you know better at that point they'll be ready and that will help the market overall this year we've seen a lot of maturing on that part we're gonna talk a little bit more about the differences amongst he exchanges but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible got an eeo script Oh calm is adding more utility to it you

back to my conversation with Larry Cermak of the block so when we're talking about the liquidity of the Bitcoin pairs what are you seeing in terms of the difference you know amongst individual exchanges and your report also breaks it down in terms of the depth at 1% versus 10% and I'm curious also to know what those differences are between exchanges and what those differences mean sure so you know I already kind of mentioned it but but 20 volume is is not a very reliable metric that's for multiple reasons one is that a lot of exchanges are faking second one is that you have market makers that you know depend on on each exchange but it's not the most reliable metric for traders because you know if there's more traded volume it doesn't necessarily mean that there's more liquidity and liquid these more important for traders because you know they want to have the most liquid markets they want to have the less the least slippage possible so liquidity is really important and what we're seeing there is that you know BitFenix overall which doesn't have the most value not even close it's probably the sixth or seventh exchange by volume but has the most liquidity on on its you know the Bitcoin Paris is here in Paris and XRP pays respects really stands out you mentioned one and ten percent order book depth difference so what that means is that you look at a certain section of the order book so with 1% you only look at a small section you only look at 1% of the order book and and bits there and on the 10% you look at a larger size usually in my in my experience 10% seems to be a little more a little more reliable for comparing all these large exchanges because 1% sometimes it's thrown off by all the market makers so if you look at tempers and it seems to be from at least from my experience more reliable better understanding of which exchanges have the most liquidity and like I already mentioned Beck seems to be the the most liquid you know even though its reputation hasn't been that great lately it still has the most liquidy and it's still to go to for the largest traders mainly because of the liquidity in their trading tools and their trading algorithm it's real advanced and then you have the other exchanges so some coinbase is I think trailing crack and bitstamp and and finance as well but all the other exchanges are usually fairly fairly far away from these and you also talk about how some of these have more retail adoption and institutional adoption and I also just wanted to link that to the depth issue because I don't know if I fully understand what it means to have you know greater liquidity at 10% versus 1% so when you see that BitFenix does have that even compared to the 1% metric is that sort of saying that maybe there's like a bigger diversity of traders or is it saying that there's bigger traders like more whales or what does that mean it just means that there is more or less combined on that on that or work so it fits on 10% and just means that there's just overall more trades that can be exactly executive so for 4-bit FedEx there's just you know the most traders with the most money on the line so if you want to go to an exchange and little slippage which means that the price you know that you want to sell it by doesn't change much if you're selling a lot then you go to those exchanges because they have the most to sell or to buy so really the simplest explanation is just it just has the most traders that the most money on the line in these order books and as you know I just mentioned some of the exchanges have more retail adoption versus institutional adoption which ones are attracting which markets sure so BitFenix historically has attracted the largest traders but I you know in my experience this mostly mostly Wales and not you know like really large funds but it could be as well Betamax has also historically been mostly focused on really large traders as opposed to retail once and the other side of the spectrum you have finances to buy for the most retail base exchange so you can also see that I already mentioned this briefly but if you look at the ratio between the trader volume and the number of website visits Finance is its scoring really low on these and coinbase is trailing so going basis and Finance seem to be by far the most retail based exchanges but then you have some exchanges like Lmax for example which is really unknown by almost anyone in the crypto space and they're fully institutionally based spot exchange and currently they're almost at the coin base level in terms of trading volume they just surpassed bit bitstamp and crackin so they're a really good example that purely institutional based not even really accepting any retail customers and do you feel like any of these exchanges will have a tougher time in terms of their business model you know based on whether or not they're attracting the to sell versus I think that's a good that's a really good question and I think one interesting thing about this year as opposed to 2017 and early 2018 but that bull run back then is that before it was very retail based so you had hundreds of thousands of really small retail investors you know putting their money into Bitcoin aetherium ICL's all of that it's a really really large amount of small traders as opposed to this year you know all the data they have looked at this year indicates that there isn't any new retail coming in or if there is it's it's very small amount of small amounts of retail customers this year has been really largely driven by large traders whether that be you know Bitcoin whales from you know that have been holding between four years or institutional traders hedge funds these you know they're getting more more important this year as opposed to retail so Finance hasn't you know this hasn't been a good year for finance because there just isn't that much retail customers they've done well when they did the ayios but that's also been dying recently and their interest is decreasing but the exchanges that have been doing well are the institutional base so so L max is done really well and yeah so the market has has changed a lot but I don't think that you know that's an indication of what will happen in defeat what will happen in the future that could just mean that you know a lot of the retail investors that invest in Bitcoin 2017-18 date it's just got burned they lost some money and they're discouraged from investing again and you know if we ever surpass the the price that you know was reached in 2017 or 18 that could mean that these people jump back in so it's really hard to say which platform is better right better position right now but they're clearly differences between these exchanges one other thing that your report talked about was how there are actually other exchanges aside from the ones that bit-wise noted as having real volume that you also believe have real volume I think you named eleven and we don't have to go into all eleven but are there any particular ones that you want to talk about and also if you could talk about how you determine that they also have real volume that would be great sure so I would have to plop the list so mainly these exchanges are the smaller ones the ones that both you and I wouldn't really hear about if we you know didn't do this analysis and that's because most of them are based most of them are focus on one particular market so the exchanges that we talked about already you know bid for next coinbase bitstamp kraken you know even though they're based in the US they serve different markets most of them are open to you know trade for almost anyone in the world you know Europe even Asia but the exchanges that don't get in included in the bitwise stand are the ones that are focused on specific market so you have some exchanges in South Korea that are only focused on the South Korea market and they do have a bunch of real value exchanges in Japan that have a lot of real valium you have changes in Indonesia that have a ton of real volume but you usually don't get included because they're just so market specific so and and the way I determine this and you know it's not an exact science but yeah by using the number of website visits we used similar web as kind of the proxy of how much traffic each side gets and so what you do is there you go you know you record the number of visits that each eye gets and then divide it and the ratio between that and then the traded volume and so the ratio is really low that means that the volume is likely real but then you get exchanges like for example like Kobe or okay X where the ratio is really high and what that means is that they likely are faking a lot about you but seems like you know at least like 40 to 50 percent of the volume there just cannot be real because the ratio is just too high on that or like pretty striking it's very obvious that those that volume is a clear outlier from every from other exchanges and so some example say I know you mention I've pulled it up just so we have some examples for delicious but ended X is one you know which is mainly based in Africa see X is a Japanese exchanges yogurt packs like smoke orbit so they're very unknown exchanges for you know the regular people but they're fairly widely known in the countries where they operate and one more exchange that I would like to add financed us also seems to have real volume and it's not included in bitwise ten because it didn't exist back then but it's not getting much traction so far so almost all these you know in terms of volume they're not getting a big piece of the pie but they do have a lot of real oh okay yeah and I'll make a plug for Indonesia I used to live there and it's the fourth fourth most populous country in the world so you were just there yes very magical place highly recommend to everybody absolutely loves living there anyway so we're coming up on time but just the last quick question is one other thing is you looked at the value settled on Bitcoin to kind of see you know the utility of it and what did you find there so the value said a little bit coin I think is a really really good metric and that's because it kind of shows you you know how much actual how much actual value gets actually settled on the Bitcoin blockchain and that's relevant because you know it just it's real transaction on the blockchain that cannot be affect in any way so what I did is that we look at the value settled adjusted to all the externality so for example you know if you have some repeated transaction that gets canceled out and we find that you know Bitcoin gets by far the most value settled on it and when you look at you know so we looked at multiple different cryptocurrencies one was you know Bitcoin and obviously theorem XRP Bitcoin cash and it'll I scored and when you look at the ratio Bitcoin gets by for the most and you know when you look at Bitcoin in relation to the theorem theorem I was actually falling and you know in in the ratio so that means that there's less settled on theorem when compared to Pittsburgh and then I also look at that what when compared to the gold market and how much is sold in and gold OTC markets and it turns out that there is you know on Bitcoin there is probably going to be more than 900 billion dollars settled in 2019 in gold I think it's about 400 to 500 billion dollars so it's a little bit less or you know not a little bit but almost twice as less so the value that is settled is is real on Bitcoin there's one can we do which is that a lot of this is very closely correlated to trading volume as well so you know this kind of supports the this thing that everyone is saying is that Bitcoin is mostly used for speculation and that in my experience is still true I think you know the latest estimates are that about 90% of all the Bitcoin transactions are used for sending you know money sending Bitcoin from wallets to exchanges and there and back so that's still about 90% and it's really good that you can see how closely the exchange volume correlates with the value settled on Bitcoin so what that tells you is that you know when the when the value is high on exchanges the value sell also is a lot higher on the blockchain and you know that's not necessarily bad I think people often say you know a Bitcoin is only used for for trading that's bad I don't think it's necessarily bad it's a use case and you know but bitcoins traded 24 24 7 it's a really good instrument for traders so I don't think that's necessarily bad and I think you know if we continue going down this path that will likely change in the future but yeah so far it seems to be mostly used for speculation all right well that was really fascinating about how 90% of it is going to exchanges but it does make sense well we will see if any of this changes in 2020 thanks so much for coming on

believe the best interview I've ever done on the show based on the responses on Twitter I think a lot of other people felt the same way while on the surface it doesn't seem to have a lot to do with cryptocurrencies it most definitely illustrates why crypto people so often speak of the ideals of decentralisation and censorship resistance Chris Ron Carlos said wow what an episode jake Trevon ski
