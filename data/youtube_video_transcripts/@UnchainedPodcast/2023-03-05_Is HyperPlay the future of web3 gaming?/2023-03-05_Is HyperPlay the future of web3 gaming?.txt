today web 2 monopolies like Steam and apple are forcing 30 transaction fees on game developers and their d platforming game developers if they include any sort of web 3 features inside of their games this is Jeff Benson for Unchained and I'm at East Denver Jacob c.ether a former operations lead with ethereum wallet metamask just released a new game launcher for web 3 alongside the Dao game seven so Jacob what is hyper play hyperplay is a web 3 native game launcher it Aggregates the Epic store Gog and our own game store it allows the player to connect their metamask or wallet connect wallet in to our native desktop application and passes these wallets directly into desktop games what's the business model for hyper play we're trying to create a competitive market between many different game stores so that game developers can choose whatever platform makes sense for them and our own store the hyperplay store which exists inside of our app we don't take any cut from the developers in-game economy instead we have a business model really similar to metamask you can take metamask into any Gap metamax doesn't take a cut of that we have optional convenience features inside of our app that the user can choose to use or not use and we provide a censorship resistant platform where developers can build the worlds that they're dreaming of and make better game experiences by bringing the wallet directly into the game itself for those people who haven't checked out web 3 games since say axi infinity what are they immediately going to notice that's different about hyper play the previous generation of web3 games they all had to accept one of three compromises maybe they built the game as a browser game and developers were building as browser games because they needed to integrate with wallets and you could do that really well in the browser but the performance of browser games is really poor and many players had subpar gameplay experiences because of it so some other developers the second kind of compromise was to make a native game and then you can bring a wallet into a native game so they made a separate website for all the nfts and tokens were swapped and so every time there was an on-chain action the player would have to close out the game go to this separate website swap some nft and then come back which was both an annoying user experience for the player in for the game developer it heard their revenue because their revenue came from protocol transactions how do you think hyper play is going to benefit users we think that the the most inspiring web3 models are carrying assets from one game world to another game world or using these for reputation or using these as collateral in a D5 protocol and in fact when I was at metamask the the largest growth was coming from players who were onboarding in countries like Philippines or Vietnam Nigeria these were places where people were historically locked out of the financial system and they were onboarding to play games but then they were discovering the whole decentralized Finance ecosystem and they were becoming able to LeapFrog the traditional Financial system and getting power in community and for hyper Play We want to we want to use gaming and the fun of gaming to bootstrap a new economic system that's more ethical and more sustainable power back to its Community I know this is designed for gaming but are there potential use cases for non-gamers it's definitely possible that you can access other gaps inside of hyperflex so we like we support browser games so we could also be an app store for unit swap or Ave and things like that and we want to make those protocols available to Gamers to help Gamers discover the world Beyond gaming as well that's that's actually a really important part of our vision crypto prices have been depressed recently but jacobc.eath and others are quite optimistic about the future of web 3. let us know in the comments whether you think blockchain gaming has a bright future or if it's still just kind of a fan this is Jeff Benson for Unchained [Music]
