Japan is just an example of a country where you know for a while regulation looked too strict and it looked really unfriendly but now they're sort of reaping the benefits of their approach hi everyone

thank you it's great to be here this week Hong Kong outlined a plan to allow retail trading of crypto assets like Bitcoin and ether tell us what that new regime could look like and how it will work okay so this is a really interesting development and it really is a signal of a lot of activity picking up in Asia so basically the big news here is that Hong Kong is essentially setting up a licensing regime for crypto service providers so the idea is that if you want to operate a centralized Exchange in Hong Kong you're going to need a license if you're there and you don't have a license you're gonna have to go that's kind of the big news now the retail trading thing this is something that there's kind of a consultation process like they're talking about opening the doors to allowing retail trading but I don't think there's an exact date for when that would happen so but the the top headline here is that basically Hong Kong is talking about really creating a very regulated environment for crypto and I think a lot of people are seeing that as very bullish for for Asia for China and just for for crypto in general because Hong Kong has been giving mixed signals over the years yeah something that was interesting is Bloomberg reported that this opening toward crypto seemed to be sanctioned by the Chinese government which famously has banned things like crypto trading in recent years so what evidence did they provide for that and why do you think that that news would be significant so you know these things are always a little bit signaling right and so there's not really hard evidence that you know China is supportive of this although one would imagine that if Hong Kong is doing something Beijing at least is aware and and probably at least tacitly supports it but basically what Bloomberg is pointing to is that they're saying that representatives from China's liaison office which is kind of like the mainland representative in Hong Kong has kind of been showing up at Hong Kong crypto Gatherings you know over the past few months and and this this can seem like okay really this is a signal of Mainland support but when it comes to China you do have to sort of read signals like that and so yeah I think the idea that you have these sort of Mainland Representatives literally showing up at crypto events is some sign of I don't know at least at least willingness to engage you know there's been other signals with China but again they're all very you have to interpret them but you know for example there was um a statement from a former Central Bank official who said something along the lines of you know China might need to adjust its regulations on crypto to ensure that it doesn't miss out you know again former former Central Bank but still you know this was published this was out there so I think there's been some little signals and the reason why this is important is because as you know China cracked down on crypto very very hard I mean it first started cracking down seriously in 2017 and then the Crackdown kind of accelerated over the past couple years and I think there were some people who thought China was basically out of the game and I never really believed that I never believed China was out of the game but I think this is more evidence that China is going to come back in some form into the global cryptocurrency world and wait so first of all why did you not believe that China was out of the game and then what could that look like if China gets back in well I didn't believe that China was out of the game because it literally was not out of the game right so you know I've spent a lot of time in China and in that market and you know so China cracked down on very specific things in 2017 it cracked down on you know exchanges a Crackdown on icos but trading did not completely end in China if you wanted to have access to crypto in China you found a way to do it and that's been going on all along and even when the Crackdown accelerated and they started cracking down on over-the-counter OTC there were still like if there was a will there was a way you know if you wanted to trade crypto in China you found a way and I knew people who were doing it I heard about people who were doing it it was clear that it just wasn't completely dead and I think the important thing to understand here is like what was China's motivation and I think a lot of people get this wrong I don't think China ever intended to just like Stamp Out crypto entirely I don't think that was ever their goal what they were worried about is kind of the is using crypto you know when China had this Ico boom and there were scams proliferating and I think what the government was worried about is that you would have all these sort of like new unsophisticated investors betting all their life savings on some weird Ico and losing everything and then going to protest or going to complain to the government and I think you know China the thing that they emphasize almost more than anything is this concept of like social stability right like keeping things stable so they wanted to avoid that they wanted to avoid a massive crypto meltdown that's not the same thing as saying absolutely nobody can hold crypto do you know what I mean so I think like what they did establish that you know it made it much harder to trade crypto it raise the threshold for crypto investment but it didn't stamp it out entirely you know and I think Hong Kong in a way that's kind of what this is right I think that's what this is I think this is a way for you know basically moving kind of the crypto Center to Hong Kong you know it's still China is still a part of it China's still in the background but it's not something that's gonna like DC stabilize the mainland if that makes sense so I feel like China is an important player in this to some extent okay yeah I think I read some commentaries saying that it was sort of like the Chinese government knew that if there were Chinese Nationals that did want some access then Hong Kong could be that place but it would be sort of like a limited playground for it and maybe perhaps it's testing the waters for them to open the doors to more of that in China itself yeah about it so you know there's all sorts of ways for um Mainland crypto investors or entrepreneurs to get involved if Hong Kong really becomes a crypto Hub as some people are predicting that it will right I mean one way is to open up a Hong Kong bank account you know in other ways is Jesus kind of moved to Hong Kong or moved to Shenzhen or move somewhere nearby um set up shop there I think you know with with China's Crackdown there's been a big Exodus from China to Singapore that's been a big narrative in Asia over the past few years a lot of these like Chinese crypto projects went to Singapore but now sort of you know I'm sorry to hear complaints that Singapore's too expensive or you know they watch something else so I think we could just start seeing some Chinese talent and some Chinese projects and some Chinese investors actually moving to Hong Kong or moving closer to Hong Kong yeah and after Singapore's experience with Tara Luna and 3ac um who knows maybe the regulatory wins her are shifting basically from one place to another so something else that I'm sure you saw on crypto Twitter is that a number of people in the crypto Community seemed to think that these developments meant that Asia would kick off the next crypto Bull Run what did you think of that idea yeah I mean you definitely don't need to convince me of that like I think that's really possible and Laura you know I've been listening to your podcast and and listening to Unchained and listening to the guests you have talking about the situation in the U.S and these two things are not unrelated right because look at the signals that the US is sending and look at the signals that Hong Kong is sending or look at the signals that Japan is sending we can talk about Japan in a minute but you know we have the US basically doing this sort of Regulation by enforcement you know the SEC cracking down on various players even if you agree with what the SEC is doing I think most people in the crypto industry do not agree with the process right they think that this is incredibly confusing they think that it's kind of going to scare crypto projects from out of the U.S you know the US I think if you just take a step back and look at the message that the U.S is sending it's kind of sending a message that crypto is something to protect people from first and foremost right and so then you look at Hong Kong and don't get me wrong I don't think it's going to be easy to to set up a crypto business in Hong Kong not at all like I think they're going to be very strict but you also kind of get the feeling that they're they also see it as an opportunity right they see this is like they're kind of welcoming like they see it as an opportunity whereas I don't get that sense from the US at all right now you know so just in terms of the signaling you know they're very very different and I'm sure you've heard this I mean I've heard this anecdotally I've heard this from lawyers I mean I think I've heard people on your show say this that people you know crypto projects are now threatening to leave the us because it's always been a jurisdiction whack-a-mole and you know if one jurisdiction isn't friendly people will just go to another one yeah so one other thing I was curious about was how you thought this might intersect with some of the macro movements um the Chinese Central Bank is apparently doing quantitative easing and it's I think done its largest liquidity injection ever recently and I wonder how you thought that might intersect with what some of these crypto moves are yeah it's really it's really hard to tell I mean all I can say on the Chinese economic front is that you know China is opening up right I mean you know a big part of the story also has been how and this is relevant to Hong Kong as well you know like Hong Kong was completely closed off because of kova China was completely closed off because of covert this had a major economic effect on you know on that whole region and so that is one economic story that I think plays a role in all of this but yeah I think we're just gonna have to see how it plays out all right so in a moment we are going to talk about other parts of Asia especially Japan but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible ever wanted to use D5 without

app at railway.xyz to find out more back to my conversation with Emily so now let's talk about Japan which has been the center of a huge crypto story for a long time which is obviously Mount gox um but when you visited recently you noticed uh several different Trends and why don't we maybe start with kind of the Fallout from gox and then maybe talk a little bit about how that has affected what happened with FTX Japan yeah I really feel like the world or the crypto industry is really sleeping on this Japan story you know because it's really funny you just hear a lot of people saying like oh you know the next hot spots of crypto and they mention you know Hong Kong or they might mention Dubai or they might even mention Europe and nobody really is mentioning Japan and I think Japan what is happening in Japan is really really important so yes I was recently in Japan and I have to say again just on like the way people were talking about crypto there was very different from how they're talking about it in Washington I mean there actually is which I think you could appreciate the Rarity of this in this moment of time there's actually still like enthusiasm about crypto in Japan right and and I think like and I'm talking more at sort of like the politician level regulation level you know like and I'm and I'm talking about in the context of post FTX you know I didn't get the sense that people in Japan were particularly freaked out by that that they were worried about it it was just kind of like they were actually positioning themselves to embrace web3 further so I thought that was super interesting now you mentioned Mount gox yes this history is really relevant it's really important to understanding where Japan is now so you know Japan was home to mount gox basically this you know exchange that kind of like the one of the first you know really well-known sort of crypto exchange disasters I would say you know and then but that was only the first part of it because the second part of it was coin check which was another Japanese exchange that was hacked uh I believe in early 2018 and at that time it was the largest hack in crypto history so Japan got hit twice and they got hit really hard and what's interesting about it is like if you went to Japan after the coin check hack the impression you would get is like it was over you know because I think Regulators were really freaked out by that and like activity kind of really slowed down it was really hard to list tokens it was really hard to do anything but really what they were doing is they were sort of like figuring out a path forward so in in in reaction to those two kind of crypto exchange disasters they put in these sort of regulatory measures so one of them for example is like making sure that exchanges hold like the vast majority of crypto on cold wallets right not hot wallets um that's you know to protect against hacking but the other one which is really relevant event to the FTX situation is basically requiring at a regulatory level that exchanges segregate assets right so like you can't intermingle customer assets and exchange assets they're separated and this is really what sort of Saved FTX Japan so FTX Japan is like one of the only sort of FTX I don't know parts of the FTX structure that actually is returning money to customers because they sort of had a lot of these safeguards in place you know so Japan is just an example of a country where you know for a while regulation looked too strict and it looked really unfriendly but now they're sort of reaping the benefits of their approach yeah you know when I was reading about that something that struck me was that like this is sort of why you need regulation because you would imagine that any business owner would want to do that to ensure the viability of their business but that's like assuming certain things about their mindset or whatever but obviously there are certain people who don't have that mindset and so then you would need the regulation to make them do the thing anyway that they may not be inclined to do so one other part of your article that was super interesting was Japan looks like it's ready to move forward with regulation on stable coins so what did you see there yeah so again you know Japan at least what they were saying is like okay we're going to be you know some people are saying we're going to be the first place to regulate permissionless stable coins again if that's true that's a pretty big story that I don't think a lot of people are paying attention to um but you know here's the thing so here's the thing that a lot of people don't realize about the Japanese Market stable coins are basically not allowed there now you know they're not allowed on Japanese exchanges they've been very very conservative about stable coins so basically what the stablecoin regulations will do is and I think they're supposed to take effect like sometime in the middle of this year they will pave the way for stable coins including overseas stable coins to come in so there's two things that are interesting about this one it's like at a time when everybody is kind of freaked out about stable coins you know with like the Terra Luna thing and people are worried about tether Japan is saying okay we're actually sort of slowly open our opening our doors to stable coins kind of counter-intuitive um but the second thing that's important to remember is they're coming from a very low base right they're coming from a place where stable coins essentially do not exist so this is like a modest opening and do think that um the stablecoin regulations especially for overseas stable coins are going to be super super strict right I mean I think like they're going to require like you know I think I saw something that said they're going to require reserves or so you know actually kept in Japan and I mean it's not going to be easy it's not going to be easy for an overseas stable coin to come into the Japanese Market but still you know it is a step towards opening further and and that will take effect like this summer or something right so there could be Clarity quite soon on that interview yes well there are already is Clarity like those stable coin regulations are already sort of laid out it's just about there it's just we're just sort of waiting for them to take effect yeah I think there was also movement on nfts there I don't know what you're seeing what you saw while you were there so basically on nfts what they did do is they at least there are guidelines for nfts I don't know if I would say there's actual movement but there's very very very detailed guidelines like talking about you know sort of Ip concerns and you know what is an nft and I think the reason for this is because I think there are some Japanese politicians who want to get more big companies into the nft game you know like Japan has a lot of amazing content and they have like a lot of kind of amazing companies and and I think they want to get them more involved in in nfts but there's this fear that if there isn't a clear legal regulatory framework around nfts and those companies are going to be reluctant to jump in so I think those that's what Japan has but if you look at the nft guidelines I mean they're very very very detailed they're not like law or anything like that they're just kind of detailed you know suggestions almost but you know somebody took a lot of time to lay those out and interestingly Japan is also moving forward on Dows it's digital Ministry is creating Adele and they're doing something similar to Wyoming giving Dallas legal status so can you talk a little bit about what it is they're doing and you know how you think this will move forward like Dad I feel doubs are very nascent and so maybe this is I don't know sort of yeah a nascent law but I was interested in the movie that I saw there there's at least a handful of politicians in Japan that see daos as a big opportunity and I know like one of the things they're trying to do is basically get like LLC protection for a dow so like you know you have a Dao and you run into some sort of problem like you have that kind of like protective framework um that was one of the things that I heard talked about but yeah I mean again I think same thing I think they see Dao's as this big opportunity and they want to get more big players involved in it and the concern is that those big players are not going to get involved if they think there's too much legal uncertainty around it right if they think they might like accidentally get sued or or they might accidentally do something against the law so I think they're trying to like establish some guidelines that will make it easier for people to enter that space and actually even just thinking about this like it strikes me all of a sudden that Dows maybe work quite well with Asian culture which is sort of a collectivist or more collectivist I think than like a western mindset so um that's interesting well one last piece that I just wanted to ask you about was you know I've heard over the years from different people in crypto who've spent a lot of time in Asia that the Asian kind of culture around crypto but also money in general or even investing is quite different from the US and I wondered if you still saw differences in that when it comes to attitudes towards crypto today I think it just really depends it's so different country by country right so I mean if you even look at like Japan and if you look at Korea and you look at China they all have like very sort of different crypto cultures you know um so I don't know no I think it would be difficult to like kind of summarize or if you look at Singapore they're sort of doing their own thing too but you know I think like in all these markets I mean or in in like Japan and Korea specifically I mean there's you know a very active retail market and has been for a while and just like a lot of enthusiasm for the technology yeah I mean I think there's just a really big opportunity here you know and I think um yeah I mean I think we're going to see more activity from Asia especially you know if the US isn't able to get its act together on the regulatory front yeah yeah who will be uh Justin Sun I should say made an announcement that will be Hong Kong will be opening up or moving back there or something and so then it got me wondering about what movement we'll see from other businesses so I think we'll have to keep our eyes on that yes I think we're gonna hear a lot more about this in the coming months yeah all right well thank you so much for explaining it all on Unchained thank you don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick

made off with four billion dollars from victims ignitova has thus far eluded authorities and hasn't been seen in five years new evidence suggests a potential reason she might have been killed back in 2018. this evidence comes from documents recently acquired by The Bureau for investigative reporting and data a Bulgarian news Outlet bird claims that a Bulgarian drug kingpin put out a hint on ignatova and that she was killed on a Greek yacht in November 2018. prior reporting from the BBC suggested one coin might have been affiliated with Eastern European mobsters ignatova who was born in Bulgaria may have been found hiding out with the wrong people time for fun bits this week Tim berners-lee creator of the world wide web made some disparaging comments about crypto Jenny from Unchained has some commentary about that on a recent CNBC podcast episode World Wide Web Creator Tim berners-lee referred to crypto as dangerous and compared it to the.com Bubble which feels unfair to me because the.com Bubble at least has the decency to be over listen I believe in anyone's right to criticize anything but is this not a little bit of a Frankenstein in his monster situation if he wants to take credit for all the people who got laid because of Tinder he's also got to accept responsibility for whatever happened at nft Miami in berners-lee also wanted listeners to know that he is dissatisfied with the way that his original vision for the internet played out we know have you been on the internet recently it's all pop-up ads no he didn't intend for that to happen I don't mean to be too hard on burners Lee he is doing his best to write the internet for instance he created a startup with the aim of giving people more control over their data the only problem with the startup is that he named it and robbed which I have to imagine is supposed to evoke images of disruption within oneself to be honest I'm just thinking about that time that I ate four or five or One bars in one
