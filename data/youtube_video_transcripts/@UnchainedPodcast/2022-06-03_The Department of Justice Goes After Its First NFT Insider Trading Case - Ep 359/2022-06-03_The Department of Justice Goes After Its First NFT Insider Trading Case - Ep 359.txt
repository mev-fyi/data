and cohen and chair of its regulatory enforcement and white collar practice welcome jason hi laura it's great to be on with you quick note for all listeners i do not have my nice mic with me here in europe and also i am stuck here in europe because i have covid so i will try to mute myself but i may cough during the episode listeners may recall that last fall the then head of product at open sea nathaniel chastain was alleged to have bought numerous nfts that he later featured on the openc homepage then turning a quick profit at the time he was asked to and resigned immediately this wednesday the department of justice arrested trusting jason can you explain what the charges were sure absolutely so as as you noted uh chastain was arrested and he was charged in an indictment with two counts now there is no such thing as a federal charge for insider trading generally so the charges against him are wire fraud and money laundering the core allegations are that by misappropriating confidential information from his employer from open seat and using that confidential information in order to make a profit he was committing a fraudulent scheme and because he was doing so over the internet that satisfies the wire part of the wire fraud the money laundering charge is a little bit strange we can talk about that more if you'd like the money laundering charge charges that he was using uh proceeds in a way to conceal the profits of a crime or in some way in furtherance of the crime but it's a little bit of a more awkward fit than the wire fraud charge so as you mentioned the exact charges are not insider trading but last fall when the crypto community discovered that this is what chastain was doing that term insider trading was used frequently and it's kind of you know i guess the behavior that people would associate with that term but why is it that there are questions about applying it here well it's funny right because if you think about insider trading it seems to fit what's going on here he is an insider he was trading on that inside information so it seems like that's that should fit but insider trading as i mentioned is not its own cause of action either under the civil rules or the the criminal law the most common kind of insider trading we see is in the securities world where somebody gets a confidential hot tip either because they work at a company or because they overhear it or get it from someone they obtain it in confidentiality and then they go and trade in the stock on that hot tip so that's what we think of as sort of classical insider trading but that's covered under section 10b and particularly 10b5 there under of the securities exchange act of 1934. and the theory there is you are committing fraud it is some sort of fraud on someone generally the person who doesn't have that information that you're trading against although nobody has to plead who that person is or what damages they've suffered all the sec would have to show in an scc case is that you got information that you were supposed to have kept confidential and you didn't instead you traded on that information so when we think about insider trading that's sort of the classic insider trading we think about it in securities the cftc also has authority to go after insider trading in the civil context under a couple of sections from the dodd-frank act 180.1 and 180.2 which are generally coextensive with 10b5 and would allow the cftc to go after insider trading in commodities in this case a criminal case brought by the department of justice not the sec not the cftc it is a criminal case and it has the same sort of flavors you got confidential information from your employer you had a duty to keep it confidential and instead you used it to profit for your own game so it sounds a lot like those other cases but because this is brought by the department of justice as a wire fraud case the doj doesn't have to say whether the mft is in question or securities or commodities or anything else they just have to show that there was a scheme to defraud over which the defendant used the internet and i should say that all of the allegations in the dogs doj's indictment they're just allegations right we're going to take them as they are written for the purposes of this call today but you know he is innocent until proven guilty and that will come out later so as you mentioned typically when people hear that term insider trading it does typically apply to something like a security and in this case we have no statement by the prosecutor about what the status of these nfts were so what was interesting to me is when you read the complaint by it was the southern district of new york this case or uh classifying his behavior as insider trading stems from the employer agreement so can you talk about you know why that is and um how applicable that that really is here sure it's actually very important because that duty of confidentiality in insider trading cases is core to those cases for example in a typical stock tip case right let's say you're the cfo of a company and you know that your company's stock is about to go down because you'll release disappointing results you can't go and sell all your stock in advance of that news because you have a duty to your company to keep that information confidential now what happens if you're the cfo and you're walking on the street and you see your friend and you tell your friend hey don't tell anyone this is super secret and confidential and definitely don't trade on it but our stock's gonna go down tomorrow if your friend goes and trades on it your friend's in trouble and the cfo is also in trouble but what happens if the cfo is walking on the street talking on a cell phone and saying yeah you know our company's stock is going to take a nosedive tomorrow if you are happening to be behind the person and you hear the cfo talking about it there's no duty of confidentiality that attaches weirdly enough there is no law against you going out and trading on that information the insider trading law as it's constructed does not reach that behavior now maybe it should maybe it shouldn't and maybe we have we should have an insider trading statute that that reaches that kind of behavior but because there is no duty of confidentiality that attaches courts have pretty consistently held that that person is not going to be in trouble if they didn't receive it in in confidence and if they didn't know that it was in confidence there are some other nuances to the law but that's that's the the essential part of it and you know we've we've seen this before there was a second circuit case it was decided on bank back in 1991 usb chestman where a person was convicted of wire fraud as well as violating 10b5 of the 1934 act by misappropriating information the second circuit held that there was no duty for the person who traded to keep that information confidential it vacated the 10b5 charges and it also vacated the wire fraud charges holding that they were effectively the same theory as the 10b5 yeah and i think that mark cuban um famously was i guess the word is exonerated um in a case where he had been told confidential information and traded on it but did not agree to keep it confidential and so you know eventually you know i think he spent a lot on court fees but eventually he was vindicated it's actually do you want to go back also to the money laundering charge which you said the government had kind of um a strange fit for its case there so can you describe how it is that they're why it is that they made this charge yeah you know in some ways a money laundering charge and this is specifically under 18 usc 1956 is is an add-on charge it sort of says if you knew that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity then you can be guilty of laundering that money and this is a sort of time-honored tradition in our in our criminal justice system of following the money right we all sort of famously we had a prohibition gangsters who are busted on tax evasion al capone rather than the the crimes that he had allegedly been committing we follow the money and if you can find that you were using the proceeds of a crime and trying to to hide that or use that or using it to conceal what you had done that can be money laundering it fits very strangely here according to the the doj's criminal resource manual to be criminally culpable under this part of the money laundering statutes 1956 a1 a defendant has to conduct or try to conduct a financial transaction knowing that the property involved in the financial transaction represents the proceeds of some unlawful activity so hold on let's compare that to what's alleged in the indictment the indictment alleges that mr chastain concealed the purchases by starting fresh accounts with no wallet history by separating it from his name so it was allegedly or purportedly going to be anonymous so the government is saying well hang on maybe this is money laundering right you're trying to hide the tracks of what you're doing but interestingly that's all hiding the tracks on the government's theory of committing the crime this doesn't have to do with what happened afterwards now as i read the indictment there's nothing after that saying he took the proceeds that he earned from the alleged insider trading and tried to hide them in some way right put them through a mixer tornado cache or into some foreign exchange and then took it out later there's no allegations of what he did with the money afterwards what you did with the money afterwards is a more classic money laundering charge but obscuring the trail of the money as you're going into the crime it's a little bit of an awkward fit on these facts and i i do wonder about how the the doj is going to prove up those elements now of course there may be other things that we don't know right now all we have is a very brief indictment but on the language of the indictment it's it's an uncomfortable fit for that statute in a moment we'll dive further

learn more [Music] back to my conversation with jason when you talk about how the money laundering charge is sort of a strange fit one other question i did see raised on twitter was that chastain had been moving money between self-hosted wallets and some people wondered does that mean that that behavior is classified as money laundering or is it just in this case because of the intent of what he was doing what's your take on that question well i think it's an excellent question and i guess shout out to crypto twitter for raising the good ones um moving something between unhosted wallets or self-hosted wallets itself seems hard to say is money laundering i mean this is the same thing as using tornado cash if i took all of my crypto right now put it into tornado cash and brought it back not doing anything else remotely illegal that in and of itself is not illegal if you committed a crime and then tried to obscure the trail of that money by putting it through tornado cash or other means that could arguably arguably be money laundering so again we come up to the question that we talked about before if he had the proceeds of the crime and he was moving them from wallet to wallet to wallet in some attempt to hide his trail one could make an argument that that would be money laundering now i don't think it's a very strong argument right this isn't legal advice but if you're going to commit crimes it's usually not a good idea to do it you know on public blockchains that leave an immutable permanent trace of your activity that that's not legal advice the legal advice is like don't commit crime but if you're going to do it leaving a trace like that doesn't strike me as as very effective money laundering now of course ineffective criminals are punished all the time right if you try something and you do it in a stupid way and you are caught you can't say what i did was so stupid you couldn't possibly have believed i was trying to rob the store like no that that doesn't work but there really is a good question about whether moving money from one self-hosted wallet to another could really count as trying to hide a trail of money when the trail of money is all going to be right there for everyone to see and of course that's even before we get to the questions that we raised earlier about doing that in advance of a kind of purchase that would be allegedly illegal so overall this case just raises a lot of interesting questions but what would you say could be the ramifications for the wider nft space if any i i think that the prosecutors in the southern district charged this one at least on the wire fraud in a very smart way for a couple of reasons one they're not taking any position on whether an nft or an nft drop or drop many nfts is or isn't a securities offering they're not taking any position on whether an nft itself is a commodity which is a position that the cftc would almost certainly take so they're avoiding the questions of what is this thing exactly and they are focusing more on the nature of a fraudulent scheme right it doesn't matter in this case whether it was an nft or whether mr chastain was an employee at foot locker right and in the back of the store for two weeks they had a pair of air jordans that weren't selling so he found out that they were going to put them in the front window the next day so he purchased purchases them himself without telling anyone they go into the front window and all of a sudden because of their featured placement they're much more expensive and he plays middleman and gets to take that that skim that profit off the top for himself that's effectively exactly what's happened here and in that case it doesn't matter whether the air jordans are securities or commodities or anything else they're they're just sneakers so it doesn't matter in that case what this is so to answer your question i'm not actually sure this case has a lot of deeper ramifications for the nft space if it plays out exactly as as alleged a lot of us in the space the crypto space have been warning literally for years that insider trading charges are coming at some point but you don't really have to get to these notions of whether their security is whether they're commodities if it's a criminal action it can be brought under wire fraud of course there's a higher burden the burden of proof is higher right it's innocent until proven guilty you have to prove that he's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt whereas the sec and cftc have just preponderance of the evidence standard so they've got an easier time that said the doj doesn't have to show what the nft or any other coin or token or anything is the sec and cftc would have to show those however the cftc should probably have a fairly easy job of showing that any token is a commodity we've already seen two federal judges in brooklyn and then in massachusetts hold that the cftc has broad anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority over cryptocurrency whether the courts would extend that to nfts as well is an open question it's an interesting one we can get into but on the rationale of those cases it seems pretty a very a very short step to conclude that a court could conclude or would conclude that the nfts are commodities that are protected under the cftc's anti-fraud rules one other instance i think that uh this is quite reminiscent of are how when coins are about to be listed at coinbase or when they're about when there's about to be an announcement that they'll be listed the price of those coins has seemed to be moving up in the days ahead of of those kinds of things happening so how do you think this case might affect policies at places like coinbase any platform that is listing tokens should have for its own employees an insider trading policy a policy that spells out for employees what they can be doing and what they can't be doing what they should be doing what they shouldn't be doing and among those rules really has to be the the sort of core rule here if you have information about a particular coin or token you should not be trading on that these rules are very familiar in the corporate world most uh companies law firms have insider trading policies where if the law firm for example is representing a publicly traded company people at the law firm who may be in possession of confidential information about the client they shouldn't be trading that crypto companies need to adopt these kinds of policies and enforce these kinds of policies otherwise i've been saying for years they're going to be issues where as you said the the price starts creeping up before something is publicly offered or publicly listed and inevitably we're going to find that there were people on the inside maybe with some insiders who were buying up the coin because they knew the price was about to pop so folks in the crypto world my friends if you're working for her project and you know that your coin is about to pop because of an imminent listing or something else please don't trade talk to a lawyer don't get yourself in trouble here going back to the chastain case from a legal process standpoint what happens from here on out so uh mr chastain has been indicted i believe that he has been released on bail and you know in the coming days we're going to see a process where the prosecutors have to turn over all the evidence they have to mr chastain and his counsel there there may be some procedural wranglings about for example whether the evidence is is admissible whether whether any of the evidence should be suppressed but ultimately unless there is a plea agreement there there will be a trial and the government will put on its case uh mr chastain has a right to remain silent so we can testify or not as as he and his lawyers decide and it's possible that we'll have a jury decide if there's no plea agreement then it will go to a jury but even then that's not necessarily the end of the analysis because com some of the key cases that have been decided in wire fraud and insider trading have gone up through the trial courts and to to the appellate courts so we talked earlier about uh about the the chestman case on which there was a conviction at the district court an appeal to the second circuit and then a reappeal it was heard on bond the entire second circuit heard the appeal and vacated the convictions going even further there was a case back in in the 1980s where a report called carpenter where a reporter at the wall street journal was writing an article where he would talk about you know what what what stocks are are hot or what are what things are being considered and he saw pretty reliably that when they published the information about these stocks the prices would go up so he was tipping that he was going to be writing about those stocks and that case went all the way to the supreme court and the supreme court unanimously held that that could be wire fraud and in insider trading and so one other thing that i wanted to ask about was i noticed a lot of people commenting on how the charges each potentially could be you know for sentences of 20 years each so 40 years total and i saw some people wondering why it is that the potential sentence for each charge is so long and also what the odds were that you thought he might have to serve some jail time if if convicted right well there's there's a long time between here and at any jail time i mean obviously first you would have to be uh convicted but the maximum sentences are just that they're statutory maximums there is a complicated federal sentencing guideline system that deals with the severity of of the crimes how much money he made in these instances and there are statutory ranges that can be calculated from the guidelines that after conviction if he were convicted here or if he uh pled guilty the prosecutors would argue for where what they thought was appropriate within the guidelines they might even argue for an upward or a downward departure usually the prosecutors argue for upward if they're going to argue at all the defense can argue within those guidelines as well and argue for the lower end of the range or a downward departure and then ultimately the judge would hand down whatever the sentence is and we can see that those vary wildly so for example in the bitmex case with arthur hayes and his compatriots they eventually pled guilty and the the crimes that uh mr hayes was alleged to have committed were in in addition to other things of money laundering or or evade you know evasion of the the bank secrecy act a violation of the bank secrecy act the statutory maximums for those are also very high but you know at the end of the day he got a few months of house arrest and no time actually behind bars this is something that we see very often these statuary maximums can be very very high and the unfortunate effect in my view is it gets defendants to plea because nobody wants to go to trial and potentially face that even though it's very rare for someone to actually be sentenced to the full amount of those sentences all right well we will have to see what happens i'm sure a lot of people will be watching this case thank you so much for coming on unchained great to be with you don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break hey builders looking for one of the best scaling solutions in crypto that's easy avalanche's breakthrough subnet design lets you minimize transaction costs and maximize your speed consistency and user experience to experience web3 like never before head to avox.network to learn more thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap ethereum's big dress rehearsal for the merge is underway ethereum's oldest proof-of-work testnet has begun its transition to proof-of-stake according to ethereum core developer tim baiko who described the event as the network's first dress rehearsal for minors the transition better known as the merge is scheduled to occur on the robston test net around june 8th about 10 days after a new roxton beacon chain was launched on may 30th ralston must activate its bellatrex upgrade to make the proof of work chain merge compatible and trigger a terminal total difficulty or ttd hash rate number on the proof of work chain once both of those occur which is estimated to be around june 8th the merge should occur in two epochs or approximately 13 minutes this is the final testing stage for ethereum previously testing had been implemented on clients and shadow forks roxton is the first public test net to undergo the merge after robston gourley and sipolia will also be put to the test the robston news comes just a week after ethereum's beacon chain experienced a seven block reorg meaning two beacon chains were briefly running in parallel as nodes attempted to find consensus due to some validators running updated software which processed blocks faster than others eventually after seven blocks the validators agreed on the correct chain resolving the discrepancy the core issue of the reorg was validators not running upgraded software it will be mandatory to upgrade before the merge occurs speaking of ethereum and the merge a recent report from ethereum researcher danny ryan noted that liquid staking services like lido where users can earn proof of stake yield without locking their tokens into the beacon chain pose significant risks to ethereum notably ryan suggests that liquid staking protocols should self-limit the amount of eth they stake to avoid centralization and overall system risk for example ryan wrote if pooled stake under one liquid staking derivatives protocol exceeds 50 percent this pooled stake gains the ability to censor blocks in a regulatory censorship attack we now have a distinct entity the governance token holders there that a regulator can make requests of censorship depending on the token distribution this is likely a much simpler regulatory target than the ethereum network as a whole roll up token op stumbles upon rollout optimism the second largest ethereum rollup by total value locked officially launched its governance token op on tuesday via an airdrop that saw 50 of ops supply released however the token drop was not without its issues as op started trading hours before the official optimism website was ready to go due to traders claiming op tokens directly from optimism's smart contracts the early op trading took the optimism team by surprise we have not officially announced yet but we're already experiencing an all-time high demand the team tweeted on tuesday afternoon we're working to heavily provision more capacity before our official announcement in the meantime the public rpc may respond slowly during the time op became available via smart contract and the optimism front end was ready the token dropped from a high of four dollars and forty cents to around one dollar giving the highly skilled one three users interacting directly with the smart contracts a huge advantage in trading the airdrop at 11am we deployed and loaded our smart contract with the op tokens for drop number one optimism explained our biggest mistake here was failing to make this contract possible claims were open and we had no way to stop them op is trading at a dollar and 29 cents giving optimism a fully diluted market capitalization of 5.4 billion dollars this comes in a bit lower than masari's projection of a launch market cap of roughly 9 billion the op token will be used in the optimism collective token house one of two entities that will help govern the optimism treasury and network over the coming years the cftc goes after gemini the u.s commodities futures training commission is reportedly suing the crypto exchange gemini on thursday bloomberg revealed the regulator is accusing gemini of having misled the cftc in answers to questions about the trading of a potential futures contract pegged to the price of vtc on gemini's platform in 2017 and is alleging that the winklevoss lead exchange has violated the commodity exchange act along with various regulations solana goes down again according to data from solana's status page the mainnet blockchain went down for four hours and 10 minutes on wednesday the network was restarted late wednesday afternoon after coordination by solana validators on a google doc based on a report from solana the network was taken down due to a durable non-spug that led to non-determinism in the blockchain where nodes generated different results for the same block notably this affected withdrawals from major exchanges as explained by stakewiz.com a solana validator on twitter a durable nonce is a way in which a transaction can be signed offline ahead of time without requiring a recent block hash which expires after two minutes usage has recently increased particularly by exchanges possibly due to their cold storage setups network outages are becoming a trend for solana the network also faced two hours and five hours of downtime respectively on april 30th and may 1st of this year solana also experienced down times of 16 8 and 10 hours in january 2022 and 17 hours in september 2021 furthermore solana recently lost track of real-world time and is currently 30 minutes behind schedule due to slot times executing at a slower than expected pace while this does not have any real effect on the network it does hold economic consequences for the sole stakers as slower slot times mean less staking rewards tara suffered a 90 million dollar hack months ago and nobody noticed until now a 90 million exploit from october on mirror protocol a synthetic asset platform on terra was discovered this week by a blockchain analyst who goes by the moniker fat man blocksec a blockchain security firm also confirmed the exploit due to buggy code a hacker was able to drain 90 million dollars from mirror due to a flaw that allowed an attacker to use a list of duplicate ids to unlock more collateral than they had the bug has since been rectified though it is unclear whether mirror developers were aware of the hack when fixing it mira joins ronin as the second time a significant hack went unnoticed for a substantial period despite the public on-chain nature of the exploits in addition to the 90 million dollar hack fat man also pointed out another mirror attack that allegedly happened this week which saw over two million dollars drained from the protocol due to a bug in a luna classic pricing oracle as a press time this has yet to be confirmed tech experts criticize crypto a group of 26 tech experts in academics published a letter to u.s lawmakers that took aim at the crypto industry the group included the principal engineer at google cloud kelsey hightower harvard lecturer bruce schneier along with noted cryptocritics david charrard molly white and stephen deal the group urged pro-crypto lawmakers such as senators ron wyden patrick toomey and maxine waters to take a skeptical approach towards crypto assets and to resist pressure from crypto lobbyists because blockchain technology will remain forever unsuitable as a foundation for large-scale economic activity five on-chain stats to

optimism's airdrop as explained above was somewhat controversial this week due to a messy rollout the air trap became even more contentious this week when xerox john posted on optimism's governance forum calling for all op sellers to be cut off from future op air drops kobe a pseudo-famous crypto expert took umbrage with the idea in his troll-centric way i was extremely pleased to see this proposal cancelling the future airdrops of those who have sold their initial op airdrop seems sensible well-considered and targets the heart of any crypto protocol the price of its token wrote kobe in his parody governance proposal he went on to propose exceedingly sarcastic ideas like cancelling the op airdrop for actresses that sold any tokens in the past six months physically beating up any op sellers and my favorite considering issuing debt tokens that are acceptable by local debt collection agencies as an added revenue stream for optimism seems like the optimism governance structure is
