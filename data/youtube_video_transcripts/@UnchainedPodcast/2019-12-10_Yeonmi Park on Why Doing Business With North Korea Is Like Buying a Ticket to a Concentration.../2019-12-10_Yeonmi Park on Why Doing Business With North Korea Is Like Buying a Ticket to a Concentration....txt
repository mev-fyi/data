those of you interested in giving an Unchained t-shirt hat or mug as a Christmas gift order by December 13th which is this Friday second I wanted to say a few words about this episode I think it's one of the best interviews ever on this show yes the news hook has to do with the arrest of Virgil Griffith but if you listened to the show it's really about the two main tenets of the crypto ethos decentralisation and censorship resistance as you can probably tell from my tweets and even the thoughts I expressed last week on unconfirmed I've been thinking a lot over Y the reaction to Virgil's arrest just boggled my mind and I realized what he was doing is pretty much against what most if not all of my sources have told me drives them to work in this space North Korea is the most centralized and most since aureus place organization entity population government group country whatever you want to call it on the planet as Alex clans team put it on an episode of the scoop he recently recorded with Frank Chaparro quote this is the least cyberpunk thing you could possibly imagine to aid and abet the world's most vicious tyranny seeing people defend what Virgil was doing made me question whether I understood or even heard my sources correctly Ali's ears like all along had they actually been saying censors assistance people who are forwarded centralization and censorship resistance and who understand the situation in North Korea would be fighting against the regime not trying to help it the interview for this episode starts with young me story which takes a while to get through since as she puts it North Korea is so different from a world it's like living on another planet toward the end we talk in broad strokes about who could have benefited from what Vergil did the general impact of doing any business even tourism with North Korea and the controversial issue of sanctions I hope this show gets you guys thinking about why you're interested in this technology and industry and the larger impact it can have on the world and why you all hold the values of decentralisation and censorship resistance now on to the show hi everyone welcome to Unchained

the North Korean girl's journey to freedom welcome young me hello thank you for having me you're not an obvious guest for my show because you're not involved in the crypto space however as I'm sure you're aware from Alex GLAAD steam the chief strategy officer of the human rights foundation who has been a previous guest on both my podcasts cryptocurrency and North Korea are two topics that are intersecting much more often first Kim jong-un's regime has been trying to get its hands on cryptocurrency and then recently I don't know if you're aware of this news but on Thanksgiving someone involved in a cryptocurrency called aetherium was arrested here in the US for giving a talk at a blockchain conference in Pyongyang and then later allegedly trying to help the regime send cryptocurrency to evade sanctions so I thought just yeah you know from the crypto community it became aware to me many people were not aware of what life in North Korea was really like so I thought it would be helpful to have you here to talk about your experience to talk about what it means when people do business with North Korea and about the information flow there so why don't we just start with a really basic question why don't you tell us what it was like to grow up in North Korea yes so I think thank you for having me and I'm really grateful for this opportunity to talk about because I mean a lot of people in the West who have very strong interest in South Korea and they somehow wanna like participate in some way but not all the times they're like involvement is necessarily helpful to improve North Korean human rights situation and it ends up just like helping the dictatorship yes I didn't hear about the news around Thanksgiving and I was you know not really surprised because there are so many people that I met which is so naively somehow their involvement is and I open up the country at some point so when I was born in North Korea I was born in Indore like almost mid 1990s so that was you know after civilian collapse and North Korea I was not going down here because they were not getting all this help from more other like communist countries and so when I was born you know there was no public distribution system was running and just the country was you know such a deep concession and there so just starvation was everywhere and I know there was a big you know information blockage even to this day there's no internet in North Korea of course the elites in Pyongyang if you have access to but the most common is like myself they don't even know the existence of internet and with a blockage of information and the lack of food you know putting us all you know in a spotty just like survive and so that's what I was you know doing in North Korea I was I don't remember ever living living there it were just every day with a survivor to try to find further trying to you know survive from the oppression from the regime and you didn't go to school for a period what was school like there yeah so I was in tuition area leader class and I'm was able to go to school if everything that I learned from school was you know nothing like we learned here it's not like you're learning about any like you know science or history but rather everything was propaganda by the government saying how our enemy like American bastards were trying to kill us and how our dear leader so bravely defeated our enemies and also why we did our dear little to to put that test from our enemies because the you know Americans are trying to attack us and kill us and without our dear leader viewer would be bad so they told us and they taught us that why we should all be grateful so for instance like every every room in North Korea needs to have a portrait of our dear leaders and if their house caught fire the first thing the father's like you know put back is not in their children the first thing they have to protect is the portraits of their leaders and if the porters get you know get burned or get banished they're not only the person who's responsible but the three generations of that family member is gonna produce concentration camp and get punished so the you know even in school we even it's a fire an accident no even though even the earthquake happens there was a case where a man who did not know so in North Korea every front page of newspaper have to have a portrait of your leader and tell us what you did but on the backside is more like you know the writing so he didn't see though the other side and he ripped it and then he you know smoke David is a cigarettes and then that was the reason he was sent to police political prison camp so the degree of the terror and the oppression and the like zero tolerance is what Kitching North keep going right like like when I for like 70 years you also said in your TED talk that you were taught that the Dear Leader could read your thoughts yeah how do they make you think that and how did that affect your own thinking so you know in school so if you try to understand North Korea as a country if they're completely is a harder topic than just fun but if you think of it as a religion the North Korea apparently it is one of the ten religions in the world and we often don't know that we think we just some crazy country but little accords so the North Korean regime you know copy the Bible so under there people believe in like God so you know it's not completely absurd like North can people believe in Kim so basically daily told us that our daily that the first came loved us so much and he was chosen by this universe who could do me occurs gave us his son Kim jong-un so even give them your guide but his body died but his spirit is with us forever so therefore his spirit knows what I'm thinking and I'm slaving I'm awake and he can show up in the east and the West the same time she's you know he can do anything in this world and then there's more like information coming in and if that's all you can leave and that's all you're taught to believe from your voice of course that's what you're gonna believe so when in after I stated China when people saying like you know Kim is a dictator and that's why you're starving and I was like why are your pastor talking about my dear leader that way you know I was so afraid but I wasn't going to commit a thought crime so thinking even in North Korea is a rebellion you know it's not it is not a degree of you are asking for like freedom of speech even my freedom of thinking is not allowed in North Korea that's how trust a country is you also wrote about how when you would leave for school your mother always told you to watch your mouth and she also told you things like that if even if you whisper the birds and mice would hear you what message was she trying to give you even in North Korea everyone exists to become a revolutionary to die and serve for the vision we don't we are nine divisions people and fulfill our dreams or our aspiration and even elementary questions it's like there's no concept of human rights or minor so you have to go to a public execution and people get disappeared all the time and usually the biggest crime you can commit in North Korea is not raping somebody or not murdering somebody the biggest chronic in committees saying something not right about the regime so that is just like the biggest crime you can commit so you know every morning that I leave home to go to school it's not like my mom saying Oh be careful you know the roads or strangers or anything should say you know always remember even if you think no one is listening the birds and mice always can hear you so that our thousands of teaching from my mom and you know that isn't made me to mom and never think what critical thinking is so when I came to South Korea tip 3 said like you know how did you believe that Kim Jong Il was starving good in North Korea they can't tell us our their leaders are hungry for us because they are working so hard and they don't get enough to play and as a young girl I believed it but you know and then I escaped to South Korea and I look at the picture of Kim jong-un and then the first time I and that they were saying like if she's a fat guy he hickey cannot be possibly starving and like so mature had to teach me that he was fast otherwise because I would never think critically I couldn't sit in myself and that's how I learned that you know everything has to be touched including you know that critical thinking we think we somehow understand the critical thing you naturally and that satsang beas doesn't come that you if you were born in North Korea who never heard the concept of a critical thinking your father was sent to a labor camp when you were 10 what crime had he committed or crime and I should say exactly I mean if he were born in the free country who would be a complete normal person but in North Korea it's a socialist country so trading is a crime so he so when he called black mark in North Korea that does not mean we are selling messenger drugs or human trafficking people literally were selling rice crop clothes she was Miss on a daily life item and he was involved in black market business initially he was installing shiver fried fish in class but later he saw them matter like a copper silver you care and doubt and then that was a crime so he was sent to labor camps and he was sentenced to more than ten years for that and how does your life change after he was imprisoned right so as I said in a nurse creative someone commits a crime that crime didn't start with the person who committed suppose Korea there even though it's a socialist country they there's no really qualitative government the regime made us hundreds that is humbling system which is like different class system and because of my father was a criminal there my status was going down too and they would call me know I might blood was painted and I wasn't pure anymore in the eyes of the my dear party and I could never be able to ever like marry someone who was in the higher higher life status and I could all my fate was determined to be always siding and possibly the size from the dgn foundation and how do they enforce that I mean how do you enforce the orders like yeah like the song one caste thing like how do they is it that you're not allowed to go to school or like what happens is such a human way of oppressing and controlling people so there are three big categories we say core it's like top we are very royal to division maybe have one percent or the people who are in Pyongyang and though we say you know wavering is like a middle class who are like more chance or you know like it teachers like some person should be like in the mirror and the way when you say hospital class in the bottom who have about his new South Korea or whose family members who left to South Korea or whose family members like my father who went to prison camp so so arrived most of them are in that bottom class and some of them in the mirror and the very time if you stand on the top but environment three big categories that apply to another 50 cetera ways of different class the craziest thing is that you can't even know your self that we are your homies exactly but you know if you're in the wavering or hot fire or during the quarter class so when you are trying to be Mary or become more like little sister I've got a job there all the people doing the background the check and tell you where you are and what you can do like cannot do so we are somehow like no our faith when you're born we know which our grandpa was in the south or which my like uncle was in the prison or who very do home and also of course of you if I remember buying somebody but then if not only only under there but if the women marry their family members but then the other side family members were in the prison and if you're someone that is going down too you can always go down but you can never go up unless there's a miracle happens so it's so easy to go down in this whole cast but like never going on so the guys when you sever Melanie because my my home was extremely low and you find Barry even someone who was the high caste and they were gonna only come down they can never go so that's how people make each other hey you know and each other to divide and be read-only same right background so the core people will not get painted by the people like us like we're in the hospital class you also somehow saw the movie Titanic which is an American movie while you were in North Korea how did you see that and what impact did it have on you so there's no internet North Korea but luckily we have this law right order opened up we did China and a lot of outside information comes from China by this mobile smugglers I'm watching this also the information isn't something you know like it's a extremely risky thing to do it will be only unimaginable think for us to think that people can take care for watching a movie but apparently it is in North Korea there are people losing their lives for watching outside information and my case I was young but my uncle had a Google Titanic somehow they got I don't know how they got it but they were like you lent it to us so I watched the movie along to my parents and that was the first time I I saw some humanity and also had a little bit you know taste of freedom and it didn't quite like challenging me to think the rest of the world was going to be free and very prosperous but I just thought maybe though in outside the world not maybe that saturable as my we employ Denis and you also talked about how it changed or or introduced the idea of love to you that previously I had only one definition of love what was that definition and then what did that movie open your mind to yeah so if you have read I mean read a book 1984 by Georgia where every way he talks about the importance of the language he did the the big brother he comes up with a new state right and basically that's one North Korea regime did they come came up with a new new dictionary the dictionary does not have defamation for freedom human rights or even gay you know there is no way you can look up in the dictionary what that is and also love the dictionary only defines a love as something the love that you have for Dear Leader or the party if you can never use the word to describe your emotions to another human being like your father or mother your lover so if you don't have that word then you don't understand the concept therefore your ability to think those complex complex things it's getting very limited and investigation in those creative don't have the concept of those love that there was another movie made to show that I love it and die for another lover every movie North Korea made to show us that how you know the revolution is dying for the party and revolution and how what on everything that is so when I saw a movie Titanic I was like extremely confused because you know there's not a similar thing oh by revolution and at the end this guy is dying for a woman and I was so shocked like why with the animal make a movie you know out of such a shameful story and I that was something in a dying for your love something never valued or it never talked about I didn't even think that was a possibility and then I was keep thinking and I thought you know it is so beautiful I felt like you were still not sure to just love somebody and die for love her and and that's when I thought you know that's when I was started thinking slightly differently and caution really you know very minor my own way and you eventually escaped when you were 13 how did you escape and what made you try to risk your life to escape yeah so now with this day from North Korea you know it's very different it's like I never seen the map of the world I never I never knew you know how many contents we had how many countries we had got democracy Roger of freedom on I was luckily living in a town called the heaven where we are facing border with China so we just had a one beaver that was flowing between China and North Korea and at night I was able to see China and they were they had electricity and night if you see North Korea right now from the satellite pictures you know it is literally the darkest spot on the world they don't have 24 hours electricity and extreme a star tonight and right being advantages living in the border town I was you know seeing the lights and I just ultimately I became really really hungry so doors my vision often we think is there such a poor country but it isn't it has all the money in the world to build all those luxurious resort for the party members they have all the money in the world to spend for billions of dollars every year making more nukes and testing them and regime chose to starve us because they can't control us that way you know if you are four and you have food to eat the next thing you're going to think of is like meaning of your life and working be better in my life but when you're like on the verge of starving to death you don't think of any of that you just only try to survive so northern region possibly like starving us the class that I was in and I wasn't able to find anything to eat in North Korea and only way for me was think that time was if I go where the lights were maybe I find something to eat and I also heard this luminous rumors in my town that you know dogs in China it's right and I thought that was like such a joke you know my people in that inner state dying from not eating food like how pastor we all know like dogs can eat rice and I still thought maybe you know what can I do if I don't do anything it in my life I might not be alive tomorrow partying and that was you know risking my life and crossing a frozen river to China and see what happens and that's why I decide to escape and due to that journey and what happened when you got to China I was tricked by human traffickers so once I arrived in China so before I before I stayed I had really I just I was going to risk a be to my own sister so I was 13 years old and she was 16 years old and me two of us who were going to escape together but one day I got such a horrible stomach ache and then I went to hospital and you know in North Korea the hunters that I was in we don't have x-rays or any machine to know what's going on so just simply my doctor rocked my belly and he said oh I think you have some appendicitis you have to operate on you right now soon and they take on my belly without any pain killer and they you know opened it and they realized it was just a lot of bad nutrition in fashion and they closed me down so most of people in North Korea in hospitals do not die from a cancer or any other disease we get kids really before that which is a lot of times just starvation infection and so my sister couldn't go with me you know I wasn't sure my surgeries and I'm successful or not get infected so she escaped a few days before and left me a note saying go follow this lady because she's gonna have to go to China so luckily I got a hospital without infection and as soon as I removed my stitches I didn't find a lady with my mother and she said she couldn't send me to China and she lied to me that if I go to China I was gonna find food and I find my sister so my mother and I cause the frozen river into China with the help of the Oh guy but later we realized that was a human trafficker the base told us two Chinese men they sorted my mother for like around 75 or something dollars and they sold me for less than $300 because I was a virgin and young and I said we got into China challenging and trafficker raped my mother in front of me and then they told us if you wanna survive in China then you have to be soared as a success rate and I was I was yeah that's the moment when I completely lost my faith in humanity and I just stopped feeling things I think and um during this time I heard about how somebody said the word free to you and you you didn't know what that was can you tell us about the first time you heard the word free yeah so while I was in China as I say for two years at the end of two years time it was extremely dangerous and I in China Chinese regime constantly cracking banners and they catch us an incidence back to North Korea to get tortured and decay care so in China was living it there I was so so unbearable even as much as being in North Korea and one day we Mariners can detect a woman and she told me actually if we go to South Korea then we are be free and I was so confused I asked her like what do you mean I would be free and she said oh you can wear your jeans you can watch your movies and no one ever asked you for that and from someone from North Korea people killed like killed by watching movie or reading like jeans or getting you in torino prison and getting punished it was something so revolution and that I couldn't believe like how can on earth that is okay and she said I get more it is really true that if you we go to South Korea that you know we will be free we can you know wear jeans and watching movies and no one else to you so I thought that's amazing I'm gonna risk my life for that that's when I decided to cry walking across the Gobi Desert in minus 40 degrees and we don't accomplish in my hand I cross the desert to Mongolia in 2009 when I was 15 years old and that's how I became free in a moment we'll discuss more about young me historian why so

calm that's KRA que en calm back to my conversation with yeonmi park so you made it to South Korea and why don't you just fill us in on everything that has happened to you to this point where you know now you live in the States and you have a degree from Columbia and you know you speak at the UN and you just you know have written a book why don't you listen and what happened once you reach freedom once I reached it freedom arrived in South Korea it was and I thought like oh I'm at the end of the journey in my life isn't it great but it was completely opposite learning to be free was so painful it was so difficult that I actually said if there's a guarantee that I'm gonna you know get enough like you know frozen potatoes and enough like some some food I might go back to North Korea I mean if the region don't care me and dr. Howell Hardy was adjusting to freedom and in South Korea because South Korea also had a such a heavy discrimination against North Korean defectors and I was made fun of to speaking the way that I was like having our skin accident and also touching up read the society like South Korea was so advanced and they the competition is so vigorous that there was no way for me to compete when I arrived I was a mother Authority and the kids in South Korea were like going to study English when there were models that come again studying English in their kindergarten and Bailey you know there's so much for education and it was you know just in every pathway was so difficult and but you know after all that difficulty when I was in University in South Korea one day I read a book animals by George Olin and that was my turning point so until that point you know so biggest thing after North Korea is of course yeah understanding freedom or clear or to modernity it was all challenging and it was completely going from one different planet to different planet but what was the hardest thing was trusting again right so when I arrived in South Korea they said o kings or dictators and you know Korean were started by chemists all not by Americans and South Koreans and they say oh you're brainwashed everything you believed was lie and everything I'm telling you is true and I was so shocked and I was like so everything that I believed was right and how do I know what you're saying is a lie at that point is that you just so confused like how it is possible everything that or I believe you know all my heart was lying and you know I was start trusting again and when I read the full blanket and I did by anybody Georgia where I got you I mean on farm I Christian North Korea and I could see my grand mine that okay is I could today just don't pick it's like in myself everything made sense to me why everything became that way and then I started really trusting the information that I was finding online the folks in South Korea and then one day I was sailing in the room and watch the TV in South Korea and it was a you know big big emotional concert a fundraising concert the celebrities were crying and and then suddenly it was showing like you know a donation and it was a campaign for Anna's right and make my jaw drop I couldn't believe you'll have any minds right like what is animals rights I didn't even know I had a rights as a human being that we are living in same planet there are 25 million people don't even know they'll press don't know even they are enslaved and they have rights but other part of the world they have a room to care by any Mars right and that's when I decided something was so wrong and and then I realized there so that is the word they had no idea what was happening to know some people because the media in the rest you know when I was studying my activism is when the movie and I feel her the more because if the interview came out by sunny yeah I saw it I have a friend she was in it but anyway every newspaper was so busy making fun of nurse in Decatur and North Korea Happy's are these people were marching on the square the old people were so brainwashed and like acting like Robert and how these are this particular looking like Carson character with the funny haircut and everything was so funny that people didn't get the gravity of this tragedy that we are having it's a holocaust happening but the words are so busy making fun of it and that's when I realized I have to let the world know what's happening it is not so funny I mean I think if people were confused about our spirit that of course Yuri have v to make fun of ours Korea that's our freedom and that's our privilege but when something is so funny then you lose the gravity of the seriousness of this issue how much people are being you know affected by this tragedy so I think that's when you know started educating myself and really understood like why the world is not caring about this issue was not just because the people were in freedom were just you know and having no compassion but just because they did not know Oh what's happening and that's what I do now it's really I dedicate all my life to let the words on what's happening and just tear the word that this must be stopped so we're gonna get to how you do that but I actually also just want to ask a little bit more about foreign media in North Korea nowadays if you know how common is it for people now like do you do you think is there still literally no internet access because you know you defected obviously a while ago so I'm not sure how much you know how things have changed or you know because I as far as I understand I think a lot of groups working to free North Korea their main focus is still on getting outside information in why is that their strategy and how do they do that yeah so yeah I'm sure working with a lot of underground or networks and I have contacts in North Korea so I get that they up-to-date news from North Korea and you know I work to do a lot of NGOs there who does rescue and I miss people gets information and based on what I hear from the people in Austria right now is that yes the other side the information is really easy everyday life at least analyst minimum more than 80% of people 87 even of the percent even have access to all the information especially among the elites and though in this metropolitan cities end up in the border town they have a lot of access through the outside information and the fact that that is changing the people's mind the young generation like myself grew up with after the information that they do really have not slowly to charge the regime of course they are staying silent because of the fear because of this punishment inhuman punishment by the regime but inside they know that the regime is not a good one so you know for me is that to change in North Korea it's not like the answer should be the movement should start the Vedic knowledge can people they issued demand their freedom and their rights and that to true like possible positive changes and it's going to happen in North Korea and that only can start with liberation of their minds and also the information is delivering their minds they are slave and even if their minds the regime but this information is going and they feel and there are not slaves anymore unleashed with their minds and I think if we get enough information and tutor them what they deserve and what humans deserve I do think this is the real chance that when we can free North Korea with the information and when you say that there's a lot of outside information in North Korea yeah does that mean that the punishment for watching it is less or like how can it be a lot and how do you define a lot do they still have to do it in secret or like how is this happening yeah so the one I mean I felt like you know it's so because of the country right now because it's very corrupt so North Korea regime you know has one of the worst collections in the word and because the key think about it as are you your officer in the comments we don't really get the Russians that look your sellers is really low they said are you the doctor salary of overall dollar you cannot possibly survive without money amongst the doctors or fissures in the party members have to find a way to survive and that mean accepting the bride and the bride is coming from people who commit the crime so of course their Theory people going to prison camps and still getting executed for distributing outside information but for doing that they they get money you know you need to make money somehow and that you have to say also information but when you get caught then you have the price but if you get you're gonna get executed so of course this issue the Bender's thing but also it opens the opportunity for the people to survive and and that's so that's a way of course you cannot now go to move it there and publicly watch also the information but you do it at your home it TV and the electricity is a real problem but then these people getting ready by corruption and they get this in on staff of somehow it is like a natural way or vertical or something they get the electricity that way and they get this like you know the devices like we call it not my kind of broad I mean that laptop at the hotel that doesn't have internet but can't lay asleep yes to be special SD card so all this like a modern technology is helping us Koreans to access to information and also there's so much amount but good this NGO is you know is increase the supply they the oldest in the information like USB sticks and all it's like oh they cut a cost when across North Korea and that just makes it so much available for people to access and they're so if to get out because of the coefficient than before and people sorority has changed you know everyone is trying to survive so maybe like it my mother's generation there were like so many true believers and they would like go to Authority and you know complain but now just people just want to survive so less royalty makes it available for people to trust each other and selling these things underground and drive each other to survive yeah I was just realizing like I bet you probably watch Titanic on a DVD but now on a u.s. it was really all Connie was I get fillings were it it was before the DVD was like in the late nineties North Korea always catching every technology if you take it later so you know my time was like this right before I stick it was like a DVD but when I saw like Titanic was something I really old oak I said almost look at me right now Cosette yeah I used right now though when I talk to my like North Korean contacts in Austria they used like SD card like USB very tiny devices I can even swallow when you are in trouble can you swallow them and but you know the officer is trying to relate behind in you my time was so hard to highly but they were so big but now it's so easy yeah and not only that but you can only watch one movie on one tape but with yeah SD card or a USB you can watch hundreds or thousands even I how much you can fit on there but yeah even like I remember you did a few tapes even I could watch my colleague was such a long movie you know it's like hard to finish it a Titanic lack of electricity or lpkf II sometimes took like my comm like you know sometimes you took want to finish your movie because we only get the electricity on the like but I do leaders like birthday or New Year's Eve something like only - a holiday gifts deficit electricity but now you know yes we just noticed only that entire goodbye to the power you can charge and you can last for many hours no me and those Koreans are also benefiting by this like you know technology advances right now yeah so one thing I wanted to ask you is there's this increasingly popular trend for tourists even from the United States to go to North Korea when people go to North Korea as tourists what impact does it have does that have on the country so it is a thing so in North Korea I was there they really told us you know everyone wants counterparts Korea we are the most envied a country in the world literally there was song called nothing to envy so we had nothing to envy disorder because you're the envious country now and they say every one of the Myers our Dear Leader's and they are all like worships our Dear Leader's today will show us the pictures of the foreigners come to North Korea and foul in from the Statue of Kim and of course at midday you know yeah everyone really admires our dear leader and so when you go to North Korea as a tourist yes you reinforce these propaganda the nursing people are doing the second of all the dictatorship wants to say hi to currency by destroyers and the tourists idea and the argument of them go to North Korea is such a such a nice way of arguing it they say oh if I call North Korea I'm gonna change some people's mind because I'm not such a generalized forever and foreigner and the Russian if I show them that I'm not such a kind person they were change their mind about themselves and then there then I know maybe start a revolution or like open up but the craziest thing is that you know Kingdom one was educated in Switzerland here at the school in the country that is most democratic they respect human dignity and freedom so by teaching them what how generous nurses it is not gonna change North Korean elite of course not everything they not to learn that they don't want change they know that if the the system collapse they lose their privileges they lose their lawyer status they are not the course children anymore and they know that those defectors go to South Korea they all become commoners even they were the highest ranking in the party from the defective South Korea of they just become one of everybody they are not special anymore their children don't get those benefits for their lifetime this made people go to school in Beijing or Europe Germany else unlike in Moscow they they see the rest of the world they know what's happening exactly and they have every intention to keep the system going for their benefit so when you go your your guys were the ones who was studying in Beijing and who went abroad to study foreign language and who are the children of the most elite people and when you only interact with those people and when you were staying at this hotel or dislike casinos or anywhere you go the people that you meet the ones who are penetrated by the regime's who doesn't want the change so you don't like helping anyone who finds that and you also give money to the regime to maintain it power I know so it's ethically so wrong it's a night of your visiting concentration camp but not as a liberator but as a friend as though in a celebrator of the district you know imagine you you right now when you're a leader in the world war two we have a ticket to concentration camp and not only bring them by show them how you're still very bad in you're free and that's what you were doing going to North Korea and looking at miserable starving North Koreans and look at me I'm free because I was fortunate enough to throw in democracy but your man so in so many possible ways this is so messed up and I just I can't even describe I think a lot of people do not have the bad intention to go they are just so genuinely naively believed that they can change people's mind and this is not benefit in some way but that is so shown that and actually is a such a destructive behavior in the movement of living ours Korean and yeah it is so sad how sometimes you're so naive that way yeah and I wanted to ask because this is similar but a little bit different that cryptocurrencies are I mentioned before his name is Cole Griffith he had permission from the North Korean government to give a talk at this conference in Pyongyang on blockchain technology so knowing what you know about how the Kim regime works how they you know interact or how they allow interactions with foreigners who do you think the audience would have been who would have benefited from such a talk so right now North Korea Venezuela or those countries are interested the regime's are interests other people because they want to avoid the assumption they want to make them more nukes they wanna North Korea makes money by selling drugs by human trafficking its own people by selling weapons to Middle East so they do all this dark crime and they need more money and aid me to avoid the international sanctions and they need it I could the currency so it is I mean of course it could the current earning power a lot of individuals oppressed by the regions but also we have to be cautious because it can be also used by the dictator I don't know how North Korea went far to create their own currency and cook the currency and I do it but anyone who would benefited by this free society going there and helping this murder is it's a crime and I think she is about to prosecuted by the US government right and yeah yeah it's not clear what will happen obviously but you know he was charged Yeah right he was really benefiting this dictator that is a crime so I think it's uh I don't know itself to going to another or entire crypto in a benefit I think when it comes North Korea or I can say is North Korean government is extreme interesting cryptocurrencies because they want to avoid the fashion in there illegal illegal like activities and they need a technology and support and I just hope that people stay on the side of you know people neither the dictators and how can i really say he had a freedom to go to North Korea and give that speech but that wasn't bigger apparently and I think we have rule of law in this world and that's what keeps our work better at North Korea yeah I also you know earlier when you said cryptocurrency could help people and oppressed regimes I mean I think obviously that's true if they have access to the Internet but in North Korea where they don't I think it would be quite difficult for anybody who's not part of the regime to benefit that cryptocurrency conference that she was in she would absolutely benefiting the regime not the people obviously didn't go there to empower the people here and there to empower the dictatorship the people who came only attend that cryptocurrency a conference is the ischium had a league who was trying to become hackers who trained it through all the deliver activities and who want every intention to want the regime to say he didn't goal of some like you know you know commoners conference your everyone could attend so you know he just went there to attend over the dictator and try the entire division so that yeah that's at the end the bad bad could occurrence like conference she wasn't like so much any conference yeah yeah I'm so glad you sent us because people on Twitter seemed to think that he could have interacted with everyday North Koreans and I you know I'm not an expert on North Korea but I have read so many books on and I was like what I was like I don't think you guys know how this place works because he would be in a prison camp right now if he did that know you he might get shot so you know all Ranger guys got tortured and to death the American poor he was a student here right from version like Harlem and there's a South cameraman who went to Qumran like a mountain the tourists and the old fishers are there you cannot pass that line and she didn't they shot her right on the spot oh my god people truly believe that they can't go to North Korea I meet everyday life why don't they dare to try it it's a heart making them not because it's the information is only controlled for North Koreans North Korean regime controls the information both ways they control what most people can hear about the rest of the world and they control the information day why we can't know about those young people even outside or Outsiders we can't know so when you even go there as a tourist you cannot describe all like take a bike you know hiking around and like go anywhere you want or like you know there's a backpack traveling that you doing the Southeast Asia you have to be review of guys all the time otherwise that you can you know you'll become a trader and sendeth prison camps like what Otto Otto blame beard is yeah yeah and all he did was taking a poster or something yeah I was a crime can you believe that they took his life for I mean if North Korea has got to treat a white person white American that way can you imagine what that you are doing to North Koreans who doesn't have always could not visible in the rest of the world that is if that's a brutality they do with a white person from America it's like yeah that heard a North Korean and are going through is something beyond our our in our comprehension yeah and and just to the you know to ask a finer point on this because I also saw people in Twitter saying things like you know sanctions hurt the citizens of these countries more than they hurt the leaders so you know yeah and he was one of the things that the Department of Justice charged him with was helping the North Korean regime of vanes evade sanctions so if he actually had done that what effect do you think that would have would that help North Korean people or hurt them so I have so when I was young I said is the most nineties right North Korea had a great famine it was a man-made a femine the regime chose to starve us so more than even like over three million people died not in Pyongyang but the people were like in us in the hospital cause in the northern part that was a lot of people you know sing that about it on the streets every day life for me I never thought that was such a seizure that I had to be shocked and Investigation Bureau this I was I'm still very affected that North Koreans are average three to four inch shorter than South Koreans even though you were sane people because of the malnutrition and so just malnutrition when we were there they were gathering in study children and they guessed on the foreigners to come and see and they get me no food from some junior chef I don't know you read our other countries there's so much cash and medical aid all of this and they use us as like a toys and show them and that report is coming they all kept young young so those eight those money does the rice was infer that you send doesn't come to us that goes to North Korean elite people so if don't aid helped why did I escape and became a sexual slave and being raped in China the first thing when I arrived in China and after getting my mom raped and they said you have to be sold and get raped and and then say if you don't like it you can go back to North Korea my mother asked me what they did I wanna do is just an idea that you want to go back what you want to do one thing made me to change in my mind was when I for the first time so a trash bin in China I do not know what it was but the lady told me that's the way you throw away things that you don't want I was so shocked like how how on earth did you have things to throw away this country I never did it a trash can in my not like in my life in North Korea there's not to throw away North Korea and people like in North Korea if they really get benefited by all this international aid in the knowledge to be dying in doesn't mind is when I was exactly North Korea South Korea all these like issues come there or these big groups when the King doesn't he want another to surprised he gave millions of dollars in the billions of dollars money and the food cash and every possibility he could be gathered in South Korea and the international couldn't be helped none came to the most of all people like us and it all went to the region so those are people right now keep arguing the function is hurting every day life there's no way we can be heard and while we are already now there's no way people can suffer more than what we are suffering right now and those things that we keep smoking regime only only penicillin regime and how is our so hard as people understand computer science and economics all of these things if you do the thing that the dictator doesn't want that means you are dreaming if you want to give the things that the killer wants that you are benefiting him Merkin dictator won't for such attention to be lifted that means it is definitely benefiting him and we don't want the benefit to dictator right like it when I got attacked by the motion regime I thought oh I'm winning I need to be hated by him I need to be criticized by if I was praising for him I would do definitely something wrong the most in region wants to sanction make kids and they want tourists to come in and if you do the exact opposite I know that we are on the right side of the history this is really not that hard it is so easy and I just don't know why some people are so like somehow invested emotionally of this word of sanction function in the context of North Korea is exactly meaning of despising the ellipse starving division sanction items is like North Korean regime cannot buy the items like in a ski resort item they cannot buy so sports cars they cannot buy Shanghai bags or Prada bags those are the items of the sanction items and even those food IV stand is not going to the most fun of people so why are the so many people are so passionately using their time and resources and arguing that how we cry we should benefit the dictator who is so far enough and who is always somewhere fat why do we need to fit in more with the oil resources that can go to benefiting so many so many starving people right now so given the fact that the Kim regime has nuclear weapons and you know is apparently now finding other ways to fund itself what do you think is the best way to deal with Kim jong-un you know obviously getting information in as one but what else do you think could be done to help free the North Korean people so there's several ways I think there are really number one is awareness that people really don't know exactly what's happening why do so many misinformation and they need to understand the regime has no intention ever can I give up the neko reference volunteer Lee they are just playing with the rest of the world and they just try to use this as though you know Carla that I grew up and I get rid of the new so you give me my money and so they can actually secretly do the more on use they you need to understand that that's why one we need a sanction we need to strive the regime as much as we can and and as much as we can and I think that's why that transaction worked that's why we got North Korea out of their Hermit Kingdom and true in the conversation table should we need assumption and the second is empowering people reliever disinformation to go in North Korea so people get empowered they know they deserve this right they know that the rest of rewarded the prosperous and free and the third that I personally care is to rescue the Israeli during Nazi Holocaust right this this defectors escape just China with everything they have and they become humans like modern stress they become sexual slaves and there are so many NGOs they rescue them to South Korea to America to free country and they are currently up to like almost 300,000 the factors are hiding in China and most of them are women and girls who are being raped right now every day and we need to rescue them and I think that's what I just say that there are three ways one is awareness they became pressure on vision more and second is getting information and third is arresting this most of our people oh I know the words to safety and there are so many NGOs that are already involved in this like a movement right now and for people for the listeners who are hearing your stories and are moved to help North Korea are there any particular organizations or like what do you suggest they do I is exactly the reason is that the reason why I found a shoe is that human rights and rights foundation of course they are you know interesting getting involved in getting information so North Korea but they are helping all these other groups you know doing the rescue basking working outing the the entire agreement or this most of our people and they have you know connection to all this NGO hmmm so if you reach out to each other you know they know every NGO they are working interferes and they're gonna connect you the people that you want to have to it and they have every connection to everybody so you know it's very easy all you have to do is reach out to people who are at the hrs and what do you care about and how do you get involved and what you can contribute and they always find your way to you know how they connect you and do the right thing yeah and listeners who haven't heard my episodes with Alex Gladstein of the human rights foundation I will link to those in the show notes he is just a font of information about human rights issues as well as cryptocurrency and how Bitcoin can help oppressed people so young me where can people learn more about you and your work maybe our Twitter Instagram I I also wrote a book so it has a lot of more impact of North Korean history why we can ballet and they are there they're heading to so if you just really want to know the perspective of North Korea not from the perpetrators now from the vision or distilled a people if you just really want along the the perspective that this we're survivors are having then you should founded by me more but there are a lot of others are written by defectors and I assure that none of the defectors who survived the regime is gonna tell you tourism is the answer and listing the function is the answer none of us are saying that everyone we experience the region the firsthand we all say the opposite and if you believed matters we know believe survivors and if you choose to believe in perpetrators and that's that's you know out of my control but please listen to all the other survivors so happy to do many more thing you know they're risking their life area you know raise their voice even though I escape right now I'm recording because I'm speaking out right like right now and tell the world about the truth oh my relatives three generations of my relatives back in North Korea then disappeared I don't know they've been executed or in a concentration camp but that's the thing yes this is a regime that we are dealing it that's how over this regime is they are steer they're punishing people even though I escaped so I don't know how else I can describe however this regime and how you should be so careful with your actions if that's where they're gonna benefit the regime or the people because sometimes without it our ignorance can't you know how to evil I think that we are responsible for our ignorance I do hope someday that you know you you can reunite with your family and yeah they're alive yeah before we end I also absolutely need to give a ringing endorsement of your book in order to live do you know a couple years ago I read it before meeting you at the Oslo Freedom Forum and listeners should know you know there are many moments where you know it's quite heartbreaking about what young me went through but honestly by the end young me you're just you're indomitable spirit just really shines through and I just was so moved you know it made me feel the depths of sadness but it also made me feel the utmost hope for Humanity and for listeners even if you don't listen to my
