hey everybody welcome to the chopping blog every couple of weeks the uh usually four but currently four but uh three regulars of us get together and give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so uh quick intros first we got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next we've got robert the crypto connoisseur and captain compound then there's myself haseeb i'm the head hype man at dragonfly and as special guests today we have joining us do kwan who is uh chief terrorist at terror sorry i i i i have to do that no dokwan one of the co-founders of tara the tarot foundation and the uh the lfg so the the the three of us uh are early stage investors into crypto dokwan is a is a founder in crypto but i want to caveat the nothing that we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice do how are you doing and uh i apologize for i apologize for the intro i was i was feeling myself no worries at all yeah that's thanks for having me yeah how's how's life in tara land oh it's great i know i know i i'm hoping that we don't take get taken off the air now that we have you on i'm in singapore right now um and so by the way anybody who's watching live i'll have to excuse if the uh if the connection's not great but my connection in singapore has been a little a little flaky but um you and i actually ran into each other i didn't even realize that you were you were in town how's uh how are you liking singapore uh it's good it's super hot so i uh find my sleep schedule all weird so i try to maximize the time uh where i stay awake when the weather's still cool so i wake up very early go to sleep very late at night and then i take a nap like at like two to two to three to two to four yeah yeah i'm i'm living the same way because i because a lot of my team is on us hours and you know a lot of the entrepreneurs i speak to in u.s hours so basically i get up super early and i work a lot like 7 a.m to like you know it's like 1 p.m and then my day gets really slow which i'm not used to and so then i have like time to like nap or like work out or whatever and then at night it picks up again because then east coast wakes up and then and then i have a bunch of calls at night so i'm i'm getting used to that routine but uh it's uh it is it is a little weird when you when you first get into it yeah for sure well one of the uh interesting one of the interesting uh uh piece of news that we wanted to chat about this week was um so you've been on a betting spree lately it's it was reported that there were there were two bets that you made with some uh some folks in in the crypto universe first you made a one million dollar bet i can't remember who it was was some rando on crypt on crypto twitter who was was yelling at you and then um you made a second bet it was 10 million dollars with another person a a trader in crypto uh tell us about why you made these bets what was the um what was the impulse behind them and uh and why you're so bullish on the prices why the other side made the bets and what you're going to approve or disprove brutal i mean so obviously like i i can't be objective about what i think about you know luna price is going to be over the next few years right so uh if i was in bullish i wouldn't be working so hard so i think for me it made a lot of sense to bed in a direction that i have very strong belief in but at the same time like one of the things that i regret about making this bed is that once i made it i got hundreds of dms from a bunch of people asking me to bet on everything running the gamut from oh like can we but luna at a different price point can you give me different odds can you yeah can we bet on the outcome of this game can we bet on something but can i be the custodian and i promise not to rug so a massive massive headache and it definitely wasn't worth that hassle yeah also i think it had the side effect of giving you know two people that which are okay but mild or mildly annoying lots of publicity in the process so that that definitely probably has some cost to it as well maybe tara will be the uh the very first protocol to nail the uh decentralized prediction market but it'll just be dough you know you can place a bet on chain escrow a smart contract and those gonna be you know the counterparty for everything well the odds would be great so let me ask you a very basic markets question just so you know because i'm a markets person um at heart is there a positive or negative carry on let's say like luna perps like is the expected price of luna in a year higher or lower than it is today and did one side of this bet you or the other folks you know enter into this at a very quiet disadvantage based on the sort of like carrying cost of the bet uh so i think the second trader most likely hedged his butt and you're right from uh from an actual cost perspective it doesn't actually make sense for me but um but like for for example like the first bed for instance uh i have i had the luxury of locking up capital a significant amount of capital for for somebody that's kind of annoying so it prevents him from making you know trades right well at the same time he might make a modest return from hedging but not as much as he would like to right so definitely worth it but if your question is just from like a pure trader's perspective can these guys hedge their bets and still make money the answer is yes got it so like they right now there's a carrying cost that they're profiting if they hedged it and if you hedged it it would have been losing to just run with that for your hedged definitely interesting maybe you were going to say the same thing i'm i'm actually curious why they want to bet with you specifically on the price of luna when i feel like so much of the discussion i see around tara on twitter is around ust and the price of ust and there's like these these constant you know battles back and forth around how ust works and if people you believe in the ust peg and i feel like that's the interesting bet in my mind versus luna like i think you're great and i think you've been putting on some great product but like there's so much you know fluctuation in overall crypto markets it's hard to sort of know well i mean there's a simple answer to that right it's harder to hedge of that for ust depending right whereas it's very easy to hatch of that uh in terms of what luna's price is it's it's a very simple option right so i think that's why in fact i think for the first person who took the vet uh he was initially proposed to bet on usd depending risk even though he's been bitching about it for a year and he wouldn't take it precisely because it's not hedgeable i mean it feels like though the the real story is so there there are a bunch of details about market structure that are that are interesting to delve into but the real story here is that like there are a lot of annoying people on twitter and you like were like you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna pick you and you and i are gonna go head-to-head in like gladiator combat on crypto twitter and the question is like does that work like do you do you feel like you have learned something about how crypto twitter settles fights well i mean depends what you're going for but if it's you know if you're if you're trying to apply a utility function to my time my money and um you know net positive publicity it was probably negative right um i'm pretty sure i'll make money so you feel like the publicity was negative no i i mean the publicity itself wasn't negative i think the publicity was net neutral we got attention but you know there were other things going on in the backdrop leading to that publicity as well but i think the main cost was now basically my twitter inbox looks like poly market it's probably more liquid so i see yeah i see okay so probably this might be um the last bet that you make for a while with uh absolutely yeah with twitter critics i see okay um any any advice to um to to focus on on how to deal i mean obviously you know the rise of tara over the last year has been meteoric and naturally that's that's probably gotten you both a lot of supporters and a lot of enemies what have been your overall lessons on like how to deal with the the the clamor and the noise in crypto twitter for somebody like yourself well i i feel like you know when i talk to a lot of founders the one of the biggest sources of burnout is that they tend to take stuff that people say on discord or on twitter or in telegram personally right and that's a really bad way of looking at things because especially if like somebody's saying that you're you're a scammer or like whatever that you designed is not gonna work yeah they're not doing it so that you are going to take it personally right even if they're fighting their bags it's just good business right and even if they're not it might be because it's a part of their job or because they don't know you personally but insofar as like you you treat it as an opportunity to potentially like say something clever or to ratio somebody then it becomes massively fun robert i mean you've you've also been through this of course with uh with building compound what's your perspective on that question i i think it's really simple crypto is more front and center as an industry in like the public domain than i think any other industry on earth like if you look at the ceos of like fortune 500 companies they have like a thousand followers and crypto even like the earliest stage projects are like immediately in like the public arena right in a way that like most corporations aren't or most like leaders of corporations just aren't and i i think it's both extremely positive and you know extremely negative especially for the mental health of a lot of the participants another thing that's interesting about it is like we also live in an industry unlike every other where almost everyone's anonymous um or a very large contingent is anonymous versus any other industry and so it makes it a lot easier in a good and bad way to like spar right and so i actually think it's a great skill and i think like the folks that are looking to create something in the space have to just like assume that they're gonna get it that there's a lot of people who are comfortable and it's helpful for a lot of founders and negative but like there's a lot of folks that are ready to engage you know with like the positive and the negative and it's just not something you're ever going to get with web 2 like i founded a web 2 company the number of people that like were like positive or negative on twitter about it was like zero right and so that's just it's just so fundamentally different and i think some people like just it's fuel you know and if like it's fuel for you like you should probably like consider founding something and if it's not fuel and if it's scary find a co-founder that like it is fuel for dough i mean you know i remember um i remember the very very early days of terra back when you know it was primarily just payments uh and you know i remember there was chai which was the payments company that was kind of the sort of the primary tenant of the tara blockchain way back in the day before before you guys adopted smart contracts when do you feel like the experience of building terra really changed from being kind of like what robert's describing of like uh people you know it's like it it matters but mostly people are like just kind of using the product to now this is like a you're constantly fighting every single day on crypto twitter and it's like it's just a war zone when did that change after some point we sort of made a conscious decision that it's not worth a lot of trouble trying to build a payments company across like 12 different jurisdictions there's a reason why it's never been done before and it's more of a compliance business than anything else right so the reason why like all the payment interfaces look pretty much the same it's not because the entrepreneurs working there are stupid it's because like there's a lot of red tape in trying to get anything done and um actually the less developed the market is the harder it is to get things done so for example if you look at like indonesia they haven't caught a payment license in i think over the last decade and then in order to do so and like if you talk to the people on the ground there uh they stuff like they say stuff like oh you need to know the right people or like oh you need to be ready to pay and i'm like dude i'm not going to bribe people right so yeah i mean so after a while we sort of decided that you know trying to build a payments company and have that be sort of like the central consumer of a blockchain just doesn't work for lots of different reasons so we started to think about what are some other things that you can build with stable coins and that's sort of when the terra ecosystem starts to take off and when do you feel like that if you guys hit that inflection point of like oh crap now this thing is more than just a product it's now like a movement so actually uh in d5 2020 um we we spent a little bit so like in early 2020 we split the two companies all together so chai um my my co-founder daniel shin he split off and he started to run chai and then i started running tfl and the tfl had um i think 12 people uh when the split finalized and um it was both almost all deaths so uh we said hey look i think we need to you know think about different things that we need to build so we you know sat and looked at the whiteboard and twiddled our thumbs for like three hours and then we decided okay yeah we gotta try to do this uh in another ecosystem where there's more activity right so we started to spend some time um you know looking at d5 ecosystems on ethereum and then um i think around d5 summer we anonymously launched a fair launch project on ethereum and i think i spoke to more than one of you here which was super fun because terra didn't really have a d5 ecosystem back then so understanding the mechanics of fair launches and what gets people excited about defy and lots of other new innovations that were coming into the space that was a huge learning experience so we took a lot of those learnings and started to launch things like mirror and anchor and some other things which ended up doing pretty well yeah full disclosure robot ventures invested in mirror yes and uh dragonfly invested into anchor um i think we i think we got some mirror through secondary uh you know through secondary markets so we're uh we're also very avid investors in the uh terra ecosystem speaking of speaking of investments um one of the big news of the week that unfortunately tyrone couldn't be here to experience our our love and admiration it's more fun actually it is more fun who's out here that we can we can we can talk and talk about the real stuff so gauntlet just closed around raising 23.8 million dollars led by rivet capital at a one billion dollar valuation which makes gauntlet a unicorn so congratulations to tyrone crazy crazy outcome i i realize that a lot of people listen to the show probably don't even know what gauntlet does so actually we are early investors into gauntlet gauntlet for those of you who are not aware gauntlet is basically a how would you how do you describe gauntlet so basically they're like a kind of uh analysis simulation company that what they do is they is they work directly with protocols layer ones uh d5 d5 platforms things like that and they try to use actor-based simulations to determine what optimal parameters might be and and what the what the risks are to different um protocols is that is that a good description robert yeah i think compound was gauntlet's first customer so i'll explain it from the perspective of compound so compound has all these parameters to determine how risky it is to borrow assets from compound or to like provide liquidity and earn an interest rate like how useful is each asset as collateral like what are all these different like bells and whistles and levers and buttons and things right the parameters of the protocol gauntlet built a super smart computer program that analyzed like the one key important number which is will the protocol suffer losses in the context of all these parameters and you know configurations and they built like a computer program that analyzes it and simulates it and runs it through 800 million monte carlo runs and it says are these parameters good or bad you know based on what the market does do that for compound they do that for ave they do that for all sorts of other d5 protocols it's like simulation monte carlo box to analyze if a protocol is safe or unsafe so they could theoretically build a simulation engine to look at ust or different terra things or any other d5 protocol but it's a bunch of like phd types that are building models of how d5 protocols work and they get paid by these protocols which is like the new approach yeah it's actually really interesting they were the first um i think they were the first company to really get paid in a very significant way by protocols so i think it was ave that first did like a dow proposal to pay them and i think compound pays them as well right having compound both pick on that via the protocol itself right sort of in protocol payments which now i think has actually become more of a thing since uh since gauntlet kind of pioneered it um and now i think we see like auditors starting to get paid within protocols and and other things like that do you do you guys do anything like that within um terrorists or paying companies within the protocol so i think there's been a number of grants but um no we've never really had an association where like the dao was paying for a service provider some of the things that we've done or things like you know for example like the washington national sponsorship so like the the nationals team made a community pool spent proposal against their community pool and then the community voted to unlock the funds to give to the nationals and that was like the only instance that that happened this scale that's pretty cool though that's legit that's definitely taking a step further to do like a like a sponsorship by uh by a doubt proposal that's pretty sick well we now now we know why tyrone didn't show up today is that he's too good for us now that he's a unicorn founder so hopefully we can try to convince him to to hop back on the show in the future but um congrats again to tarun and um doe any uh do you want you want to take a bet on what gauntlet's gonna be worth in 10 years no i wouldn't bet against tune but you could take either side i'll uh yeah yeah you don't have to bend forward and you can bet against him you can bet against him i promise there's no there's no carrying costs on this one so the pure is the only way to do it right right well i am less educated so i don't think i'll bet on that one okay okay all good i was hoping we could i'm sorry we could hedge some of our gauntlet exposure well uh moving on in news so that was not the only major fundraise this week there was another pretty blockbuster fundraise so there's been a lot of news in the last couple weeks about yuga labs which is the creator of the board ape yacht club as well as other associated franchises there's a big pile of news and i'm just going to kind of run through all of it and then kind of hone in on the most interesting bit so the first of all uh yuga labs announced a fundraise so they raised 450 million dollars at a 4 billion valuation led by a16z so obviously the the the second now most valuable company in the nft space behind open c they also announced that they had bought the rights to all of the crypto punks from larva labs and what they did is they decided to give the ip rights of the crypto punks to the owners of crypto punks so uh board of yacht club has always had uh as part of their ip agreement or the licensing agreement that if you own the board ape you have the ip writes that board meaning you can put it on merchandise you can put it in a movie you can do whatever you want to with nip that was not the case with crypto punches you have the commercial commercial rights yes you have the commercial rights the commercialized excuse me and so that was not the case with crypto punks but after yooka labs bought up the ip rights to crypto punks from uh larval labs uh they now do the same thing with crypto punctures now gives any holder of a crypto punk commercial rights over using those crypto punks however they choose subsequently that that brought them a lot of fanfare a lot of cheering a lot of people were very excited and it caused a resurgence in trading volume for both punks and for the board api club franchises then yuka labs launched apecoin which is a token that is uh airdropped to all owners of uh anything within the crypto or sorry not the crypto pumps the border yacht club universe uh apecoin did an enormous amount of volume it was huge event tons and tons of excitement around it uh it is currently trading at um 1.5 billion circulating market cap uh what's the ftv right now i think it's like 11 billion or yeah 11 billion something like that yeah 10 10 to 11 billion uh ftv acorn right now it's a little bit underspecified what it does uh what exactly does a point do a lot okay so one it's going to be the primary currency in a project called other side which they're releasing shortly which is going to be like their universe other side they're going to sell land it's going to be competing with like you know decentraland and the metaverse projects on facebook one day and all these things also they're really working hard to make it a currency that's usable everywhere so like time magazine announced that you could purchase a time magazine subscription in apecoin um it's likely that they're going to be you know working on many other use cases for the token but it's meant to really be a currency it's also a governance token in their platform and it's also going to be if you've read some of this community discussion proposals on the apcoin forums which i have and i don't know if many other people have it's also going to be distributed to potentially distributed to those who stake their board apes mutant apes uh et cetera i think it's one going to be one of the most powerful economic forces in nfts in the history of nfts but that's a whole separate conversation so let me ask you guys this why why would somebody buy board apes versus like you know those like mutant skull things like what makes this collection special well the mutant skull things are weird interesting ugly and important so you know i'll just go through why i think they have you know an interesting place in the nft history books so what really set board apes apart from crypto punks and crypto punks are og and i'm an og crypto punk maxi and i used to only support crypto punks and i've over time been converted to someone who also has board apes but you know crypto punks existed larval labs created me bits and gave a large number of me bits to the holders of crypto punks mutant apes were a similar fork slash airdrop to board a pollers but they did it in more interesting ways um as opposed to just like you have a crypto punk you get one meat so the mutant apes are you know it's more complex offshoot where there's different tiers of new names there's mutation serums that everyone got you basically like you know evolve these um original board apes into these mutant names and where they also have relevance in the apecoin ecosystem and i apologize ahead of time if i sound like a board ape you know crazy person but where they also have relevance is that they're one of the other primary assets in their ecosystem and in terms of the distribution of apecoin in terms of the distribution of future call it airdrops of different like properties that they're creating in there they've announced that they're creating many different properties to coincide this universe you know these are like the primary identities that they view as having value you know they bought all the ip of crypto punks and me bits but they don't view them as like the primary actors in the ape coin or you know yuga ecosystem in the same way they do you know this tiered system of like board apes and then mutant names as sort of like the recipients of the economic benefits of their ecosystem so what's interesting is that board apes and mutant apes and the kennel club which are the dogs all have sort of like a ratioed economics which were integrated through the ape token and so you can see this in like the ratio of value that was given away in terms of how much ape for each of these you can see it in the proposals around the staking rewards for the different asset classes there's basically you know through the early experience been like a ratio value between these different assets and the interesting thing is to see on secondary platforms like openc and looks rare and potential future marketplaces whether or not they continue to trade in these given ratios and why i imagine at some point this is like my utopian future there's going to be a hedge fund that's like a yuga arb hedge fund that just like arbs between relative value between like mutants and apes and like dogs right and it's going to be an actual professional job title for somebody in like a year and if you're an up-and-coming person that could be your future so i i mean so it it almost feels like with nfts you're sort of inverting the ip publishing model right so before um you needed to create sort of a centralized lore like harry potter or the marvel series and then there will be one person writing it one canonical lore that codifies all the stories and the myths and all the fantasies in this world you know once you make that story successful you now get to sell you know little tokens uh that represents some associated value of this ip so you could either sell like harry potter ones or capes or yeah i don't know whatever people buy or like a little scart sticker or whatever but um i think nft is like it has the same value capture mechanism or maybe even saying valid capture mechanism is sort of the middle of the bell curving it but the idea is that you sort of publish these tokens first and then like you sort of rely on the community to create provenance and lore around it in a way that doesn't really have a canonical center but um it almost feels like the value of these collections the the collections with more provenance with more more lore more culture built on top of it is going to eventually be more valuable am i looking at this the right way so i i would disagree with that i think that's true for some nft collections right i think it's very true for loot i think loot is the canonical example of that i think it's somewhat true for crypto punks but i think apes are probably the least probably the polar opposite of that where i think yuga labs actually done themselves a tremendous amount to create that lore to create the universe to like actively market to build those relationships and and kind of build relationships with celebrities like get get this thing into uh into you know tv spots and make news and do really dramatic things in order to keep the lore going and make it really powerful and so it does feel like there's some nft collections who's whose cade whose valence has been built in a very bottoms up way and it's true to an extent like every nft collection can only be successful if there's bottoms up engagement but of all the nft collections it feels like the the ape universe has been the most top down and the most successful in large part because of that right like there are some um you know if you sort of compare nfts to luxury brands there are some luxury brands that become really really powerful like sort of in spite of themselves right they sort of because like oh this one like wood maker from you know however many years ago only made like 200 violins and that's why like these are the most famous violins in the world or whatever and then there's rolex and rolex just goes out and they just do the freaking work to make rolex's what they are right they get into all the rap videos they make sure that people on tv are wearing rolexes they make sure that the most famous people are flashing it when they're you know on late night talk shows like that's to my mind what yoga labs is and they've and they've shown that execution can get you there can get you into that central spot in the nft ecosystem it's manufactured but it's brilliantly manufactured i think i mean you just want a point with like the rolexes and with the mutant apes which is like i think in my mind it's i feel like a lot of brands struggle from this issue especially in nfts where supplies are so limited of wanting to be broadly desirable and you know recognized but also being having some level of accessibility right like you know a ferrari is kind of more accessible than like a pagani huayra even though you know it's like more expensive but there's more ferraris and so people kind of know about it more and has like more of a legacy or something like that and so i feel like there's you want to sort of find room for yourself to go down market and if you're supreme you know sell a box logo shirt for 80 but not everyone can buy the ten thousand dollar jacket or something like that and so you have some amount of accessibility without ruining your brand but um still sort of you know preserving that that your top to your status um and i think that's what you name is trying to they're trying to explore that line right now i think a lot of people were really excited about the larval labs acquisition for you know sort of the commercial license reason that you mentioned but i think if anything it's in my mind sort of a big advertisement for cc0 and sort of you know ip on chain ip native nfts as opposed to having ip live in this sort of weird meat space and be arbitrarily reassigned you know at the whim of you know vcs or entrepreneurs instead of like live with the entities themselves um so who's to say that you know the commercial licenses cannot be revoked or changed or sold somewhere else um and so it's it's weird that it's been given but it can also just as easily be given away or taken away oh so the question that i was going to ask is regardless of the method by which collections get this metric but would you say that there's a similar relationship between nft collections to cultural exposure and let's say relevance to layer one block chains and their tibia uh it feels quite different to me it feels very different to me i'd say you know nfts like you know getting a lot of cultural cachet and getting a lot of attention is not enough to make your tvl go up that that just seems obviously true is that you know there are things like um andrei disagrees i mean just who disagrees andre disagrees um like there there are platforms like i mean take cardano for example right cardano has an enormous amount of cultural attention and awareness and like eyeballs and and users uh who like own cardano token are excited about cardano relative to its tvl tvl is like infinitesimal right it's like well that's because the blockchain doesn't really work yet you know if yes functional l1 sure i mean take even ethereum classic right ethereum classic is a good example of a blockchain that way punches under its weight relative to the number of holders of atc i think there are plenty of examples of this where there's a divergence between the actual you know because the number one thing that's going to give you tvl is builders building things that actually require tv like that there are reasons to put money on there right tvl is more a function of whales to those point this would i agree with they're both vaguely like hype derivatives in a way in that like you know how successful it is is sort of like you know a derivative of just how much attention and excitement there is for it and there will be you know things that don't fit into that model like cardamom right but i think in general there's a high correlation i i want to push back on that like i think you need more than hype to get tvl right just getting hyped doesn't get your tv out it gets you eyeballs it gets you uh trading blockchain has to work if cardano was like avalanche let's just say it was like as functional as avalanche i guarantee you would have crazy tvl yeah there's a lot of latent tbl for cardano just because i haven't moved it in yet does not mean it's not tpl i know the thing is i think like the ability like the willingness to like buy cardano and trade it is very different from the willingness to put your money at risk in the protocol right like there's a much smaller number of people who can actually deposit tvl into protocols than who can buy tokens you know guys i was actually just thinking about this one thing so it it almost feels like if there was a service provider like yuga labs but they make they sort of do this thing of creating culture and stories around nft collections as a service instead of doing it just for that one collection this company would be massively successful kind of like decentralized disney if you will no disney owns vip disney like makes it very genuinely part of their universe it's not like a if disney was outsourcing their create like their creation of the the the ip uh like that company that did the that did the outsourcing would be worth a lot less than disney right like nike has a bunch of suppliers but nike is the thing that's valuable not the suppliers right but what you could do what you could do is that in some ways by being a service provider instead of issuing all the ip yourself you sort of subscribe to the game publisher model so if you look at game publishers they don't actually initially come up with the game scripts or the initial game ip themselves they wait for indie uh indie game developers to pitch the games to them and then they see early traction so they they have the comfort and the ability to use the data that they see from that early attraction to publish multi-billion dollar games but what they can do is that they make an investment right before they publish such that take they take a meaningful stake or meaningful loyalty royalty cut of the potential revenues that are generated and this could be exactly the same thing so i mean for example like off the top of my head and i i'm kind of like definitely not an nft expert but what if we just like got a collection uh hired a bunch of novelists to write fantasy novels about you know uh 10 different characters and then just made like a simpsons like tv show uh by gathering a village of 30 different nfts together and then we got like four guys and then made a girl group out of it you know higher like you know you know for four girls from asia actually you can hire 12 and have three groups compete i don't know i feel like there's a publishing model here that could potentially make money i i agree that there's an opportunity to expertly manufacture nft experiences in a way that's more than just like here's 10 000 pictures that i like pseudo-programmatically generated i i like doe's point here especially on the the disney topic there's this phrase inside of disney feed the beast which is the idea that the way disney makes money is not by like selling movies it's by selling merchandise and parks um and that's where they make all their money and so in reality it's like you generate the ip to sell all of this other stuff and the ip is almost like secondary in a way and so really what disney's been doing lately over the past you know a few decades has been buying distressed ip and then like marvel star wars which no one really cared about and shoving it through the disney machine and you know making insane amounts of money by busy taking this distressed ip and yeah showing you how to make money on it and so i don't know if there's like a comp here for nfts like maybe the question is what would you guys buy as like distressed ip in the nft space like what do you think are underrated gems that you think deserve polishing from like the sort of community and like uh yeah merchandising and narrative side well i think the key point though that you were just bringing up is that those brands had fan bases that were passionate right and ready to like vote with their wallet on those brands you know what makes them distressed is that the price that the market was valuing them was too low relative to how many like die hard and loyal fans they had right i don't know if the same model is going to work with nfts because most of these at least today in 2022 and we're in chapter one of nfts which is gonna be like a 100-page 100 chapter book but like as of right now like there's so many of these things they've all been around so short an amount of time and in very few cases you have like loyal fan bases for them right there's no loyalty there because there's nothing to be loyal to like there is no content they're just you know profile pixels that are pumped out you know in short amounts of time and so i don't think it's the same thing yet maybe in 30 years someone's going to look at board apes or crypto punks as like wow that's an undervalued brand because like people are still die hard about their punks but like it's worth almost nothing on the market maybe the realization here is that like board apes is the first real franchise that we've seen within nfts right like they're the first real kind of full stack not just you know four dudes get together and like pay a bunch of service providers to like mint a 10 000 you know pfp collection but they do something much more much more muscular and much more like what we would identify as like what disney might do with star wars that feels like the thing that yuga labs really got right that almost everybody else gets wrong in this industry yeah they onboarded celebrities and through events and through parties and like they took what otherwise would be like every other profile pick 10 000 nft set and actually made it awesome yeah you go labs i guess disney crypto punks right these these neglected punks and uh they're popping up through the yugolabs machine you know i i saw the the hugo labs deck and um and obviously you know they're now teasing other side which is like this metaverse thing that they're going to do and it did feel very disappointing to me and i guess this is like the other side of the disney machine you know if you if you sort of take seriously the idea that okay these guys are good at creating uh you know these sort of this brand identity right that's what these guys are good at building a metaverse building like a game universe is like incredibly hard and it's like obviously going to take many years and it's not their proficiency it's not what got them here uh but then straight away land sales right there's two hundred thousand or what is it ten thousand or a hundred thousand plots of land in like a metaverse that's currently unspecified it it feels like just incredibly money grabby to me and yeah i don't know i don't know if anybody else felt that way but i'm just like this is like you jump straight to the end of the disney line of like now you're like pre-selling tickets to your theme park and like you have no ability to even build theme park you've never built a theme park before or maybe a theme park has never even been built before and you're just like oh yeah you obviously you're you're gonna want season passes to my to my future uh you know ape themed theme park and um it just kind of i don't know yeah it is a bit triple dippy in that they sold they sold the apes and they sold equity in the company that made the apes and then they dropped the token which is non-dilutive for whatever reason and now they have a bunch of the token and so it's like yeah they just kind of keep keep dipping it's got to be which is working yeah volunteer it is god tier it is definitely got to your monetization for a company that launched three pfp or four four pmp collections but to your point tom that is the power of disney right disney is not the massive company that it is because the ip is so creative and generative or whatever it's because it's really freaking good at monetizing vip that it does have and uh maybe that's the the ultimate takeaway from yugo labs is like beyond just the execution and the creativity it's the fact that they were somehow able to ring billions of dollars out of launching you know a bunch of apes what do you guys think about like these web 3 games that are launching so how does everybody feel about something like axey and you know like it's kind of interesting watching a bunch of aaa web 2 gaming publishers trying to jump on the bandwagon because they saw the ax the axis success story and they think they can do better axi was the success not because the game the game sucks and is horrible and is not fun it's completely stupid but because of the economics of the game what they really launched was a d5 protocol with a better pixel front end they didn't launch a good game you know candidly the game sucks right but the economics are what made it interesting to the world right i think there's going to be a lot of people that launch web 3 games and they're all going to suck i think at some point someone's gonna launch a game that's absolutely amazing and it happens to coincide really well with like cool crypto economic systems and it's gonna like it's gonna like win the whole world and it's gonna be like the greatest game that's ever been created and like everyone's going to be obsessed and played 24 7 and like economies around the world will collapse and like people won't leave their house anymore but like i i think that might be like a long way away until like someone just like nails like an incredible game and an incredible economy at the same time yeah yeah i find x infinity incredibly cynical and uh very like very i i think it was incredibly bad precedent um that taught a lot of people the wrong lessons about what crypto gaming will be and what it'll be about uh and i think i i i actually placed a lot of the blame at vcs as well because i think a lot of vcs were kind of amplifying this narrative because it sounded good and it got a lot of attention that like this is the future of gaming this is the future of economies you know people in the third world are gonna stop you know uh growing crops and gonna stop you know attending stores and instead they're gonna sit around and you know do repetitive game loops all day and like just mine fake currencies and fake universes and like this is just obviously like not only bad for the world but it's also just like a a very it's like a perpetual motion machine level understanding of how economics works and um there can't be a game where everyone makes money there's no economy where everyone makes money some people must spend money for other people to make money and the the idea that like everyone in third world is going to get paid to like play some dumb game over and over again that doesn't actually produce any net value to anyone else is unsustainable like i i had this uh tweet a long time ago that was a little tongue in cheek but also very genuine which is that you can't show your own poker hey it's our show i can i can show whatever it is tweets all right there was somebody from dragonfly who tweeted that poker is the original play to earn and i think actually this is a um i the more the the more time i've thought about this the more i actually really strongly believe this is that poker is a good example of a game that works within play to earn because some people make money some people lose money some people don't you know some people break even but like that has to be how the game works there cannot be a game and poker manages to make that fun and that's a good understanding of what the game probably will feel like if there is this this economy within inside of it right there can't be a game where everyone's making money that doesn't exist there is no game like that and so what are you talking about yeah as people who bought it as people bought it in in january over any long period of time like come on you can have things that aren't zero sum i i agree there are positive some games right and and but in order for in order for there to be a game where where uh people are are making money there has to be spending and there has to be value creation and so it's like okay where is that spending coming from in x infinity very unclear most of what's happening at x infinity is basically like digital sharecropping sure but like here's like the whoa man like you know vision though what if you just put a game layer on top of the actual real world economy okay like what if you just had like a sick like metaverse on top of a real economy it's not zero sum right where you're not like in a zero sum like mining and spending loop but where you're like actually running like the corporations that exist in the real world you know like some like ender's game like thing like you don't even realize that you're playing the real world and like you're controlling the corporations and business units of like things like what if the played earnings like you're running a corporate treasury of some corporation in argentina and you don't even know it right so like basically this right now is the better verse uh what well what i would say what i'd say is that like look if you imagine jobs in the metaverse right here's here's one of my core complaints about the you know kind of play to earn vision is that the jobs that are conceived of as being the jobs you'll do in the metaverse are extremely repetitive simplistic tasks right like you know mining in axi infinity or you know growing your axis and battling them and whatever and basically you know in action infinity i mean here's the first telltale sign that like your system is  up is that in actual infinity you cannot run bots right if you run bots they have like an anti-bot detection mechanism okay why why why do they prevent bots the answer is because they want you to do it manually they don't want you to write a bot that will do this very repetitive stupid mind-numbing thing over and over again because otherwise there'd be too much mining too fast and they're like no we can't do that we can't automate things and make things more efficient we have to make things inefficient so that we slow down the rate at which this ponzi ends up getting unwound right that's why you're not allowed to bot in axe infinity in the real world right like if you can bought this thing of course you would bought it because that is the way that we've improved the world is by having human beings not telling the fields but machines filling the fields right so human beings get freed up to do more complex things like you know design ponzi nominated games so you know the the jobs that you'll do in the metaverse that will actually pay you will be things that only a human being can do like for example you know being like a you know like a like a like a virtual host you know where you like you come in and you like entertain people and and make them excited to like come into your virtual cafe and meet other like that's the kind of job it's very hard for an ai to do probably you will need a human being to do that and it's more like a real job it's not like a rote clicking buttons over and over again that's what every play to earn game today is like i'll visit the cafe that you're the virtual host that sounds awesome once you are a virtual host let me know there you go there you go i had i had a more colorful example in mind but i went with virtual host all right i hope i don't think that is what i think that is no don't worry about it don't worry about it it's uh anyway let's let's let's move on so last piece of news that we'll run through is um mr mark zuckerberg who actually uh tom used to work for i don't know if everyone knows this tom used to be at facebook and instagram so he's very he's very he's very close with the uh the zuckerverse mark zuckerberg announced at south by southwest which is a big um you know sort of multimedia conference in austin uh that nfts are coming to instagram so he he was a little bit vague on the details but supposedly uh there will be minting of nfts and presumably there will also be pfps that can be uh that can be used natively on on instagram so uh tom given your insider's perspective on the the zuckerverse what do you think of this announcement about instagram you know i was going to say i think um our portfolio company founder alex message might say instead that instagram is coming for nfts you know showtime joke afts are coming for instagram no because that's what you said uh nfts are coming to instagram it was a joke about show time trying to do instagram instagram it's coming i don't know i think it's okay yeah yeah sorry that's okay we get it we got the joke great yeah i've heard about this you know coming for a while i think the impression i get was this was initially sort of designed or started as like a creator modernization movement within instagram which has always been sort of this conflict with a lot of these social media platforms now of how do content creators get paid some obviously platforms pay out pretty generously like a youtube others such as instagram less so and they sort of do it on like a more ad hoc basis um with respect to you know negotiating contracts and things like that and the idea was this going to be a way for instagram to sort of uplevel its game here and you know get instagram creators paid and i think since basically the pivot to meta zuk's become much more interested in this area and so now it's becoming almost more of a metaverse kind of play that instagram is a part of so i'll be curious to see how this plays out i don't quite know what they have in store but i mean at this point you know twitter has already sort of broken the gates open so we'll see what happens when it comes to you know like adopting uh nfts so how is the meta metaverse going because i keep seeing like these like tech demos come out every once in a while but it seems very underwhelming to me yeah i i don't really know to be honest i don't really know what everyone's doing i do say you know i think what facebook does better than than any other tech company is growth they can pretty much build mediocre products and then just like grow the out of them and so i really have complete faith that they're able to get a ton of users on whatever it is that they build independent of the quality i think it's a question of what is it going to look like when does it come out you know all the sort of you know nitty-gritty details around it i think they're going to fail and instead partner with the yuga verse wow i think they're going to be hugo's coming free for instagram they're going to buy something what would you buy if you were if you were zuck if i were stock yeah you could be honest i would not buy yuga or apecoin because it's probably too expensive but you buy like the sickest early stage team in the entire space and you buy five of them right buy 20 of them i don't i don't know if that's facebook style though they might buy like a category leader yeah so maybe it's maybe it's like something like openc openc would be really good open2 would be a great investment also also very expensive if facebook buys sorry if meta buys openc you heard it from dell you heard it from dell do you want to you want to take a bet on the value of eight point in ten years not at all well zero that's good i'll bet on bitcoin with you though okay i'll bet on zero doses going to zero oh you think that's one zero way higher than that i'll take the current price higher in one year than the price right now oh wow you think okay higher one year than is right now let's say let's say 10 months let's say 10 months to be specific 10 what do you think is the terminal value of a point honestly i think it's a very asymmetric situation but like i actually would be long i personally i am slightly longer so not materially but like wow did you see the uh labs round yeah did you do your investor now no you did not invest okay are you open to sharing your rationale of why you pass on your collabs listen i only invest in things less than like a 50 million valuation i'm a pre-seed person you're pretty you're preceded you okay got it i was looking at some of the uh uh like some of the big luxury goods companies or like the evaluation of like nike and lmph and brought you know all these companies that that maybe you can think of as like the non-metaverse analogies to what your labs might be or is trying to be obviously if they if they do build the metaverse then the comp is really different but nike is the most valuable company in that category it's worth 36 billion today and um right now apecoin ftv is like 11 bill so that's like a third fully diluted i mean i think i think to be clear i think ftv is kind of a nonsense metric in a lot of ways like i don't think it's like really that comparable to looking at the market cap of a traditional company but because of the differences around dilution and how to actually understand what dilution means in crypto versus in traditional companies but um it does feel rich but you know with with a coin right now having uh 1.5 billion circulating that actually seems if you just take the the nominal circulating market cap it actually seems pretty reasonable to me yeah i mean i i don't know how you can say it's rich when they just created 11 billion dollars i value out of thin air you know i think um if anything it's kind of like people underestimated you know tech companies in the early 2000s compared to you know sort of brick and mortar you know legacy businesses and you know sort of doubted the ability for these companies to maintain software like margins at scale and instead they turn into like the biggest companies in the world and i think you know we could see something like that for luxury goods where yeah maybe nike just isn't a great business because you know they have this sort of you know lower margin brick and mortar you know high up x ex sort of uh business whereas you know if you just have only the ip and that's pretty much your only cost um maybe you can actually just get way bigger than all these other sort of legacy um you know luxury businesses i mean the best counterpoint is i don't think i've bought any luxury good ever like the most expensive watch i ever bought was like eleven hundred dollars like i don't buy nice shoes i don't buy nice anything but dropping a hilarious amount of money on a picture of a monkey i'm like yes give me that digital monkey now right like hundreds of thousands of dollars right in a way i would never over like a lifetime spend that much on luxury goods offline shouldn't you only invest in pre-seed nfts great questions what happened to being a pre-seated investor right yeah what's what's up with overpaying for nfts when you should be getting pre-seed exactly that's that's that's my pro i meant only that's my approach i'm very inviting effect once the nft is awesome and everyone agrees it's awesome that's what i'm like in got it aping and indeed okay well on that note we i think we had time um so want to thank you doe for coming on board and jamming with us on everything going on in the ape verse thanks uh that's it that's it for this week see you everybody on on the other side
