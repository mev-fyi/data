[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline bitcoin crosses 10k after months of treading water the price of bitcoin surged past ten thousand dollars earlier this week although it's not clear why recent news has been bullish for crypto for instance the office of the controller of the currency is now allowing us banks to custody crypto and the pandemic continues to have a dampening effect on the economy some industry analysts also believe that defy gains are being redirected toward bitcoin the impact was also felt on derivatives as backed and cme both saw record volumes in their bitcoin futures markets crypto analytics firm skew tweeted cme bitcoin futures had the most active session of the year yesterday 1.3 billion dollars notional traded open interest also climbed to a record high on a side note coinbase institutional published a report on the first half of 2020 that gives a good overview of the year in crypto so far it said new people are purchasing bitcoin and an increasing number of investors are treating it as a store of value it also highlighted a number of positive metrics in areas as wide ranging as defy to stable coins to derivatives to mining for instance ethereum is up 73 percent stable coins have more than doubled and derivatives have also seen an increase with btc options tripling next headline an easy to understand ethereum 2.0 primer ethereum 2.0 is coming and it's complicated if you haven't fully wrapped your head around it yet coindesk published a detailed but accessible report on ethereum 2.0 that includes everything from the definitions of terms like serenity casper and shasper to explanations of why at first a eth created on ethereum 2.0 cannot be sent back to the original chain it breaks down what will happen in each phase of the transition for instance phase 0 launches the beacon chain and proof of stake phase two introduces sharding phase sorry phase one phase two is for deploying dapps and phase three which is the least defined as of yet will likely include more complex technological features such as ones that increase privacy there's also a deep dive into the economics of ethereum 2.0 which may lead to the creation of digital assets that will be the tokenized versions of staked eth and rewards earned by validators also if you're wondering what ethereum 2.0 will look like and want to hear it the way that a friend might explain it to you check out haseeb qureshi's article in bankless on d5 and ethereum 2.0 the dragonfly capital partner writes quote ethereum 2.0 is going to create a bunch of shards which will work like loosely connected blockchains but all the d5 stuff will end up living on a single shard since it all wants to coagulate together he further adds that d5 shard will be the place where the major d5 protocols settle those that benefit from high velocity and being connected to large liquidity pools for liquidations flash loans or whatever maybe there will be one major financial shard like london or two city shards with their own specializations like new york city and chicago i expect if there is a second city shard it will be for centralized exchange settlement separated from defy and all of its chaos next headline what is the best way to upgrade bitcoin governance in a protocol that takes decentralization as seriously as bitcoin does is always a tricky subject with the taproop softwork upgrade nearly ready the bitcoin community is pondering how best to activate the soft fork if you're wondering what the main issues are a recent big mac's blog posts breaks them down into quote one should the minor threshold signaling period be followed by a flag day activation two which parts of the activation logic if any should be included in bitcoin core three should minor signaling eventually become mandatory for the uninitiated flag day activation refers to nodes and miners switching to a different code after a certain point in time whereas threshold signaling essentially requires miners and nodes to signal support for a change bitmix created a decision tree that goes in order from least amount of centralized decision making to most for instance the least amount of centralization will be for there to be no flag day activation and also no activation logic included in bitcoin core the most centralized would be to require a flag day activation a flag date in the bitcoin course software and also for minor signaling at the end of the period the report recommends a compromise where bitcoin core follows the bitcoin improvement proposal number nine which includes quote a 95 minor threshold activation logic without a flag day and mandatory minor signaling which is basically a goldilocks version next headline why everyone keeps talking about yfi in the world of d5 yield farmers seem to chase high interest rates from protocol to protocol like lemmings maybe not jumping off cliffs but perhaps parkouring between them i made that up and if you don't like that joke too bad but one new defy token stands a bit separate yfi as community member ross galloway put it in a recent why earn dot finance messaging board quote yfi is a mechanism to claim reward and yield farm tokens that are earned with the funds in why earns various and upcoming products it may also capture some revenues of upcoming or current products as decided upon by the community through the governance process at its core yfi is the token of a collective yield farm that leverages unique elements of defy and ethereum to capture yield for users of its products for those of you who have been following this space for a while to me it seems similar to a dow token if the dao had survived and we all know how excited the world was about the dao which raised 150 million dollars in 2016 and that was quite the feat considering how low crypto prices were back then on top of all this yfi was distributed almost like bitcoin in what the community perceives as a fair distribution in which no insiders or vcs or even the creator benefited the token was released via the why dot curve dot fi pool in what ross calls a continuous farmed offering and he describes that as quote the newest fairest crowd sale alex saunders of nugget news tweeted quote over the weekend yfi broke the record for the fastest coin to 100x it jumped from 34 dollars to 4500 in seven days however it actually traded at three dollars on uniswap after wi-fi creator andre cronier released it meaning i earn finance did 1000x in a week next headline wth is yfii chinese yield farmers unhappy about the fact that wifi could only be earned through liquidity mining forked wi-fi to create yfii which has a larger issuance plus a having mechanism this may not seem like a big deal but this spin-off became an example of the differences between the east and west crypto communities with the western d5 community calling it a scam and the chinese defy community hailing it as the next big thing yfiii adoption exploded in china with crypto whales traditional c5 businesses exchanges mining pools and other entities adding it while western projects had a different reaction balancer quickly blacklisted the yfiii dipole from its front-end interface which sparked a separate debate about whether balancer was truly decentralized the chief analyst at token insight minion act abct whose first name i don't know so sorry about that summed it up in this tweet thread quote communities in the east are not super fussy about risks compared to the west some experienced ones are willing to gamble to chase the high yield and some are putting a small amount of money just to try it out and experience the excitement on such high yields and speaking of the east china arrested 109 members allegedly behind the plus token project bitcoin's biggest ponzi scheme ever with over three billion dollars worth of crypto being scammed so next we have a d5 roundup because there is kind of a lot of activity in d5 so we're just going to do a quick run through some of these developments first with the explosion in d5 the number of contract calls to ethereum hit an all-time high on july 25th with more than 3.1 million daily contract calls the majority of them being attributed to d5 according to coinmetrics next headline our next bullet point maker doubt became the first d5 protocol to reach 1 billion in total value locked however kyle simani of my multi-coin capital tweeted that total volume locked or tvl is not a useful metric at least for lending pools like compound and ave since it subtracts demand from the main metric meanwhile synthetics replace the synthetics foundation with three dowels one for protocol upgrades one to fund public goods and synthetics and one to manage and deploy funds to contributors d5 protocol ave also went fully decentralized transferring governance from the ave core team to ave token holders dharma integrated with uniswap and enabled support for over 2000 tokens on the uniswap v2 platform betting platform augur launched its version 2 which integrates d5 features such as ipfs the file storage system 0x mesh dye and uniswap's v2 oracle network and finally ftx is launching a dex called serum on solana according to ftx ceo sam thinkman freed solana can process ten thousand times as much as ethereum and it's one million times cheaper time for fun bits an adorable way to view live transactions txtreet.com is a very cute transaction visualizer which represents bitcoin ethereum and or bitcoin cash as transactions or sorry the the transactions on those networks as little people lining up to ride buses whenever a new transaction is broadcast on the network a person appears to board a bus they get to board the first bus if the transaction has a high enough fee otherwise they have to wait their turn all right thanks for tuning in and to learn more about dimitri and ethereum be sure to check out the links in the show notes of this episode
