hey everybody welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next up we've got robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound third we've got tarun the gigabrain and grand pub gauntlet he is going to be showing up in a second and then myself i'm vasib i'm head hype man at dragonfly the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice so it's been a little bit of a slow week in crypto land or slow couple of weeks i would say it seems like most of the news this week has been around hacks and things breaking which is only the biggest hack of all time but other than that it's been pretty pretty chill that's true that's true it's funny how just the passage of a few days makes things seem really whatever yeah it's like years ago in crypto speed exactly exactly i no longer even feel it like the the night that i saw that the the ronin hack took place i was just like oh my god like this is this is this is this is the worst nightmare for anybody in the crypto industry and then two days later i was like oh never mind no one cares well that's because you didn't have any of your own funds in the uh ronin bridge that is true that is true uh very much by choice i uh did not get my funds in the ronin bridge well so okay let's let's maybe just go through the news for those who are not aware what was this this was march 29th this was a little bit over a week ago as of the time we're recording this that uh the ronin bridge was hacked for a little bit over 600 million dollars worth of ether and stable coins so um the tl dr on how this thing got hacked is that basically so the ronin multi the ronin bridge was secured by a multisig that nominally had nine addresses in the multisig however four of those addresses were controlled by accounts owned by the axe infinity team or the sky mavis team which is the developer of axe infinity and so what ended up happening was that uh reading between the lines there was some kind of social engineering attack on some of the members who control them who had access to the multisig at axiomfinity and there was also a bug from a previous program that sky mavis was running that gave them access to another one of the multisig account holders so basically it was effectively five of nine controlled by one party uh and so when that compromise took place they were able to sign any basically able to forge a signature or not really enforced just actually write a you know create a signature that allowed them to say yep this is a valid withdrawal go ahead and send this money over the bridge and so using this the attacker was able to move an enormous amount of ether and usdc and also supposedly this hack took place six days before the bridge was actually shut down and although users noticed that like hey guys there's like something weird going on what are these big giant withdrawals the team was like oh no no it's fine we're looking into it it's no big deal and then later it was kind of effectively all but confirmed that like yes this was a massive compromise the ether was missing and they needed to shut down the bridge and somehow remunerate the the victims so the the axiomfinity team has pledged that they are going to remunerate the victims there was actually a big update to the game that was supposed to uh go live recently and that's gotten pushed back now because you know everyone's everyone's been hacked so it's a it's a it's a really it's a bad it's a bad look for x infinity they've cleaned up the multisig they're now you know we haven't they have more decent actually decentralized parties on the multisig at this point but it it doesn't look good so yeah tom robert perspectives on the largest hack in on-chain history yeah i think you mentioned it and i i thought it's very funny that normally something happens and i feel like within the hour all of crypto twitter is talking about it but this took place on the 23rd and the news kind of broke on the 29th and um crypto cobain kobe on twitter noticed this and and said that he took out an axs short but in in the time between you know when he took out the short and when it was noticed and made popular on on crypto twitter ax actually went up a lot and so he was liquidated on the short when we tried to sort of you trade on the news so markets aren't always you know super efficient in crypto unfortunately i was disappointed by this hack you know crosstalk bridges are extremely complicated this has been the basis of a lot of the different hacks and vulnerabilities of last year you know my expectation is that you know as more l ones besides ethereum become popular and more bridges exist between ethereum and other blockchains that the bridges are going to be the most likely place where funds get lost simply because they oftentimes deal with more complex systems than a simple smart contract so it took people a couple years to get good and putting that in the air quotes is never good but skilled and hacking salinity it was a very relatively simple surface area for people to learn how to write solidity safely a bunch of auditors you know learned how to you know check for the most common patterns of you know risk and over time we started seeing like basic solidity attacks go down multi-chain bridges are significantly more complex systems that use multiple different platforms multiple different languages multiple different security parameters they blend things from centralized to decentralized you know we've seen some of the biggest attacks and hacks here i think it's going to continue to be the number one weak point for crypto ecosystems and if you're a user i think you want to be especially cautious about crosstraining bridges until they've really stood the test of time and you know have an extremely in the effect well so you you say that you know bridges bridges keep getting hacked and bridging is extremely hard that's generally true although this was not a okay there's an enormous complexity of bridging and that's why they got hacked they got hacked for the most mundane possible reason in crypto which is that they clicked on some dumb link they got compromised and the multi the quarterback multisig was actually basically a one of one and this is like the most basic kind of attack in crypto for which they're to my mind there's no excuse so i i would not put this in the same category as the wormhole hack or the uh what's it called multi-chain what used to be poly network this was the most basic failure of opsec that you could possibly have in crypto and also it was just handled in an incredibly amateurish way of like deny deny deny and then six days later okay fine yes we got hacked for an enormous and massive amount of money well i'll pause it how many users you included me included before this hack knew you know the structure by which the funds in the bridge were secured i i i didn't know but i i'm not an axie player so i i had i had no interest in knowing right and how many people do you think even asked right yes no granted granted but i think there's a view in crypto that it's the responsibility of the user to diligence all the software that they use and blah blah blah right this has been forever this has kind of been the the core story about okay you know trust don't verify don't trust you know everything is open source everything not everything but most things are open source so you should be able to figure this out yourself read the smart contracts blah blah blah now in reality especially in the world as crypto is going mainstream this is a pipe dream right there's no way that we can expect normal users especially the users of something like axe infinity to go in and read the bridge contract and understand what the hell it's doing and of course even if you read the bridge contract you don't know who the signers are on the multisegs they're just a bunch of addresses right so you don't you don't know that they're all controlled by one party so it is the responsibility of sky mavis to figure this [ __ ] out and like look if you are using if you are using a multi-stick for a bridge okay fine i understand bridges are hard maybe a multi-sig is a good enough stop gap in the interim right like even right now you know look at stargate stargate is right now signing all their other oracles oracle reads with just a multisig getting the full decentralized nirvana vision of how to build you know cross-chain bridging is awesome i'm all for it but it's going to take a while and i get that this was this was a very very basic failure that i think there is really no good excuse for and it falls in the same category of like people who get their apes hacked you know like that was the level of incompetence that sky mavis exhibited in this hack so i i think they deserve the the program that they're getting right now it just ends up making the industry look really bad if this was some mastermind type thing you know like i think the uh the wormhole hack is a good example of look this was an incredibly complex hack and it was hard it was hard to catch right it was a it was it was a genuine edge case this is like the main thing that happens is like look if you if you control access to a multi-sig that has billions of dollars in it don't click random links and make sure that all the multi-stakeholders are different people that is your main job if you're managing huge amounts of money yeah i think in this case though to be a little bit more nauseous it's probably not you know emotions with people holding private keys and signing them directly i assume it was all server based where they had let's say four different computers with identical code each independently signing messages you know it probably was less about humans and more about keys on identical servers being compromised because humans were silly right and made mistakes yeah i think they mentioned that like they left like a whitelisting function in to like call directly into like one of their nodes probably one of the signing nodes that's like yeah you don't wanna wanna do that i um i do also wonder like sort of the implications for maybe the market more more broadly i think we've you know there's sort of a l2 versus l1 like bearable thesis where it's like you know l2's are supposed to be this nirvana of super cheap transactions and you know everything just sort of happens within the same ecosystem and that's kind of been i think foiled by the growth of these other chains and really you know cheap fast bridges and it's like well why am i gonna use optimism when i can just bridge you know avalanche and it's way way cheaper and you know faster and like the bridge is efficiently good or more about you know sort of network security or whatever it's like it's fine well sometimes it's not fine and so i wonder if this is going to like embolden people who are now you know maybe looking more to like build on an l2 instead of building on one of these you know cheaper faster up and coming l1 use maybe that assumption that hey the bridge is going to be secure and fine it's like not necessarily there i agree maybe ronan is not really emblematic of broader bridge building security but i mean wormhole also was you know a massive hack and uh yeah that's straight straight smart contract issue yeah i i would say that um i think this may be the first it may be the beginning of us starting to people starting to really feel like hey multi-cigs aren't that secure we've kind of gotten used to this idea that like hey multi-cigs are just kind of a fine stop gap and there's no real difference between a multisig and you know some kind of full you know decentralized security solution because of course central security solutions can also get hacked and you know you mentioned layer two of course there was very famously the the two million dollar bug bounty that was paid for uh that optimism paid out uh what was the name discovering a vulnerability that allowed unlimited minting of ether which could use to drain all of optimism right so the reality is that all this stuff is freaking hard all this stuff has massive surface area for bugs and and uh the one thing i think the reason why people default to multisigs is that at least it's a it's a it's a security model and surface area that we know and has been very battle tested right no one's worried about gnosis safes getting compromised then the the compromise just moves the layer up to like can you actually manage that nose safe in your own you know security surface area effectively and here actually it's one of the reasons why i like the avalanche bridge because the avalanche bridge they basically use intel sgx to ensure that the bridge operators are actually you know running according to a certain a certain program such that you know even if they were compromised you can't you know break into the i mean assuming that you don't have a compromise for sdx you can't break into the machine and cause it to do stuff that it's not supposed to be doing and you know ostensibly if that works and that setup is is uh running correctly which i think is a lot easier to do than a you know layer two or optimistic roll up or something you know even the near bridge which which is used as sort of an optimistic design the rainbow bridge is more complex and it's got more surface area to it so i think in the short term my expectation is that bridges are going to try to find relatively simple ways but lowering kind of the human error component to make sure that bridging remains secure in the long run we do have to find decentralized solutions to this stuff that doesn't rely on hey these like seven people i know i can trust you know if if if you know which of the seven people there are out there to try to go attack you'll you'll find them and you'll be able to attack them the way that you know you would think sky mavis was like okay maybe once some of the other other multi-stakeholders might be attacked but sky mavis like they have the most incentive in the world to keep this thing secure and it was them who got popped yeah in terms of practical impacts of this i mean i forget who originally posited this i think it might have been vitalik but it's a pretty logical concept which is wrapped assets that are bridged from another chain should be worth less than native assets so ether on avalanche no matter how good the bridge is should be worth less than ethereum you know no that that doesn't make any sense right isn't it would that apply to like tether should be worth less than a dollar not necessarily but the concept being that if you have an asset on another blockchain it actually has the you know bridge risk that the native asset just doesn't right fundamentally and if you always treat them as being worth the same at some point that's fine but at some point you know you have these it goes to zero type events right you know i think like this you know theory of like risk arbitrage doesn't exist yet and users always treat them as exactly the same asset on different chains but i think over time some extremely sophisticated you know market behavior will emerge to value them differently as it should because they are and should be worth something different than you know the bridge versus unbridged version i understand the shape of your argument obviously um but the reality i mean the reality is more complex because one of course bridging stuff has a pretty tight arbitrage loop so it's very easy to go and you know arb something that is a bridged asset assuming that the bridges are pretty liquid and pretty fast second if your argument were true it should apply to tether it should apply to uscc it should apply to anything that can't trade above the peg but can certainly trade below the pack as tether has historically but and same with dye right like die is dies all straight above the peg but you know tyler should never turn above the peg presumably absolutely it should potentially trade based on the bridge risk being able to bridge back to the asset right if you are completely have no issues bridging back to a us dollar then they should trade the same if you know you have the risk that you're not able to bridge back it's not the same which means that like in good times and you know most at equilibrium assuming the bridge is like fairly stable most of the time although a bridge asset always has more risk i think most likely it'll try to par somebody's not being compensated for risk right so then the question is who's not being properly yes although another way to look at it is that there may be a premium to like look if you're on avalanche it's like look i really want ether here i'm willing actually to pay a premium that maybe that may offset the risk premium that the the bridger is taking true so it's like you know importing you know dollars in other countries sometimes trade for more than they trade in the us even though it's it's complicated import them yeah but those dollars oftentimes don't go to zero i think one thing we actually have to think about uh in these bridges is that first of all we kind of have this notion of native bridges versus non-native bridges of like bridges that are like promissory notes on native tokens on another asset and bridges that are promissory notes on a local asset so like if i have ether and i went through wormhole right i get a promissory note of wormhole east but wormhole is actually a promise on another chain right it's a promise on the source chain versus like you know something like wormhole synapse they said that's a little bit more complicated but like let's say wormhole or sorry layer zero zero is really a promissory note on your local chain right and in some sense the problem is most users do not know anything about distributed systems they're not thinking about like source destination like whether i have a future or a promise so the number one thing i want to tell every listener who doesn't know anything about computer science but who is like oh like i have like 10 million dollars bridger costs 20 assets on 10 different chains read the wikipedia page for futures and promises in distributed systems because at the end of the day the choice of bridge is a choice of a future promise system and distributed systems and you will not get if you don't understand what that thing is you and how the how like the notion of i'm holding something that's promising me something in the future for something that's promising me something now versus something that's promising me something at the intermediate time if you don't understand that dynamic you don't really understand the asset that you own right you you have a mental model that might be it is the thing that i think it is right now but it might not be right it might be only that thing at some future time or at some event happening and the number one thing i think i've learned i've learned after watching all these bridge things is that people have not internalized a lot of like basic terminology from distributed systems and mapped up to financial assets the idea that hey this thing that i think is one to one is actually a future plus a swap plus an option and it may actually go to zero because like the future might collapse at the same time as the options the same time in the swap and that's a very important thing to remember that that i guess maybe if if i were i just wanted to summarize kind of the conversation i heard in kind of more concise terminology of like i highly recommend reading what the concept of future and the promises and distributed systems i think that's a very cogent point but i think probably the people who are bridging are more enticed with getting you know 1500 apy on you know burrito finance versus you know considering the uh the relationship that they have with it with their bridges so maybe a point to uh yeah haseeb's point on uh well the reason i say this is like some you know the the website l2 beat which shows you like a list of all the l2s and it gives you like the security assumptions and it lets you like have a little comparison matrix of this like comparison matrix for the bridges and like the notion of like what assets are synthetic and not and also more importantly for the end user which assets are like redeemable now which assets are redeemable only if i cross the bridge with that which assets give me some other kind of guarantee and i think the layer two community obviously maybe to some extent over extending on this they have focused on education in this frame and everyone on the bridge side has just been like yolo it's the same thing like we don't give a [ __ ] we're just going to pretend we're going to tell you you borrowed east on solana and you know so your yield is yield but i actually think there's a huge gap in the community of making l2 beats for synthetics on bridges and that like i hope someone does that yeah i don't know what the name is but yeah like the scene we'll find it you build it we'll fund it i i think i i completely agree with that i think the bridges right now and you see this you know the the big war right now in bridges is between um lair zero and axelr and i think they're both in the position where they're trying to tell the story i guess there's also synapse and multi-chain obviously they're trying to tell the story that bridging is going to be super easy it's just going to be like you click a button and you it's like it's like on the internet you don't care what domain you're sending your next request to and the same way you know in in bridging and blockchains you will just click a button and you don't have to care about the details of how your transaction's getting routed and where the funds are going and whatever and um you know to your point tyrone it's not like the internet because assets have to be sitting somewhere at rest and when assets are sitting somewhere custody on some particular chain that means that now you have some kind of claim on an asset that exists somewhere else and that claim the way in which that claim is redeemed depends on the details of what exactly was wrapped when and and how exactly it gets redeemed and if there has to be a swap in order to actually get the thing on the other side and so it's it's complicated and you've got to know the details and it's going to be a while until we actually are able to until people uh until it becomes more transparent to them what the bridging experience is going to look like when we do have robust crosstrain solutions today i think what we must have is beta software and not to to kind of feel like abstract concept that perhaps all parties in this zoom are invested in kind of looking forward to but these cross the notion of a cross-chain block explorer is quite different than the notion of a local chain block explorer and actually conveying to the end user what a cross-chain transaction looks like will look different than ether scan and i think that's something that we have to actually internalize that the ux for the end user will not be ether scanned it will be like a very different looking thing for how we search through blockchains and how we organize blockchain and that will kind of whatever ux is ether scan 2.0 is like the difference between like gopher and netscape okay well it turns out that ronin was not the only hack uh or not the only very significant hack that took place during the last two weeks we just recently saw another massive hack well actually a couple of them so one we saw a a massive hack in a protocol called inverse finance they were hacked for 156 million dollars through an oracle manipulation attack tom you were you were explaining this one to me earlier do you want to give the tldr and how this happened yeah just to be clear it's actually 15.6 million i think a decimal got got moved there oh whoops sorry 15.6 million yes not as bad what's the decimal point between friends you know i say that all the time there's no decimals on the blockchain man yeah everything is six points so who cares i'm kidding king don't please do not ever assign me that i understand what the shift operator so inverse is a lighting protocol um on ethereum and obviously i don't tell we have the lending you know daddy in this call you know a key part of a living protocol is knowing how to how to mark assets right so you have to know how much is this worth yeah am i am i properly collateralized what is the value of my debt what is the value of my cloud rule a lot of teams will use an off chain oracle system run their own like with maker but a lot of teams will use a t-wap so they'll look at an amm and take a t-wap over the a m and use that as an oracle which allows you to support a lot of different assets in theory it's more robust etc etc inverse was using a t-wap on sushi swap for a couple of different tokens the problem is that they were only doing a t-wap on one block so basically they were looking at the the previous block that was being traded and using that to mark the value of the assets in the next block so uh bert miller from flashbots actually had a really good rundown of this on twitter and because he called it one of the most sophisticated or any v-aware attacks that he's seen recently where basically the attacker used a private mempool to insert its bundle its bundle mind actually performed the attack so arbitrage bots couldn't you know therefore capture its oracle manipulation in the same block so basically they push up the price of a bunch of different assets in one block and they were able to borrow a bunch against it so way more than they would normally be able to again normally this is not a big deal because on an amm you can then just you know trade down and arbitrage against um the value of a overpriced asset but because they got this transaction privately mined um no one was able to see it and also because it's a you know one block t-wap basically there was no opportunity for the for that lending market to record its price so a very very clever attack and i think you said one of the most mev aware attacks that he'd seen recently lending daddy what's your take nobody should use a price fee based on one block of prices one block or zero blocks zero blocks or one block are both extremely bad right there used to be a whole lot of attacks because people are using the current price not even one block old tiwa they were using what's the current price and that was like the first wave of like you know price feed-based disruptions you know a t-wop of one block is no better right like the t-wop of one minute might not be better right or even like you know five minutes right so like it's extremely complex this is one of the reasons why if you are borrowing against assets the protocol has to assume that prices might be a little bit stale or a little bit out of date um because this is a huge huge huge opportunity for risk so dumb choices bad parameters then there was another cyber security story that came out yesterday which is that so open zeppelin which was running an audit on behalf of coinbase for convex finance found that there was a way for the convex fine i guess admin uh and or multi-stakeholders to basically rug the entire protocol and essentially drain all the funds in the protocol using some you know a fairly complex uh chain of operations within the protocol that is not supposed to be the case even if you have the admin keys you're not supposed to be able to take money out of the protocol but uh admin keys were capable of performing this attack now the it was an interesting story actually because the question is okay if you know that there's a way that billions of dollars and 15 billion in this case if you know there's a way that billions of dollars of capital can be extracted from a protocol but it can't be done by anybody it can only be done by the admin how do you do responsible disclosure for a situation like that and uh the the answer that open zeppelin ended up coming to was that they approached the team and they told them hey guys we found a very severe vulnerability that allows the admins to drain all the capital in the protocol but we can't tell you because look we love you guys and like i believe that you're in it for the right reasons but like look there's 15 billion dollars like we can't mess around here so in order for us to disclose this vulnerability to you you have to add more people to the multisig so that when we disclose it we are confident that you can't get a plurality of the multisig to sign off on any type of attack uh and so convex finance did that they added more people to the multistick and then opens up when disclosed and then they fix the bug so it's very very interesting almost like james bond-esque series of maneuvers that had to be done here to make sure that the everything could be rescued without the bomb going off um so i thought this was an interesting one but it's just another continuation in the the through line of this week which has been that smart contracts are hard and people keep messing them up i'm kind of surprised that convex has not migrated to a fully on-chain governance system um like i think in the early days of protocols it's like pretty natural for the core team to retain a multi-sig over you know contract upgrades and then basically respect you know the votes of token holders and so there's a sort of task agreement there and obviously for a treasury a lot of teams use a multi-sig you know but there's there's sort of less of an oven you know risk with that but it seems like they had upgrade abilities on a two or three multisig for a protocol with 15 billion tbl which is which is kind of insane i think the story of convex is also warranted here where it was like built around the curve finance contract and they kind of like built this allocation tool that is actually a lot super complex like i i think like i know there's like this general movement of like hey we want the ve model everywhere unlike tom i'm not saying any value judgment on whether it's good or bad i know tom has very strong opinions on this as we've seen on twitter ignoring the value judgment on that the code is actually extremely hard to reason about uh you know there's like a way of abstracting the ve model to something simple but the way it's actually written is much more complicated than the curve code which is extremely simple in a lot of ways minus of course the sort of like how do you compute the invariant gradient to something so i actually think there's like this weird thing of like convex is actually a little like it was made as a way to kind of like boost curve and then i think a lot i suspect based on the code commit history a lot of the early developers do not work on it anymore and and they are people are very afraid to transition because there's not like a good very good developer ecosystem around it and you can just go look at the code from the history and it's not there's a lot of like inconsistencies there in a weird way that if i were them i would be very afraid of transitioning to governance the alpha leak in this entire industry is read together right and the convex github tells a very interesting story what's the uh 90-second tl dr interesting story to leak all the alpha i think interesting story is very clear that the curve development team and the convex development team were very closely tied for a long enough time period obviously convex built everything around curve but there was a point at which they clearly diverged and it wasn't clear who the sides of the divergent sides were and then what the side that was maintaining convex sort of seems to have disappeared and there have been some community prs but there hasn't been a lot of like the main developer core uh contributing as much there's definitely been some patches but in a way that i think transitioning to governance would be hard if they weren't more involved that's it's interesting i haven't spent enough time thinking about that so i'm glad you brought that up to roone is the the idea that transitioning over into governance into you know fully on chain governance requires some confidence and stability in the underlying code right it's not just a matter of okay we were like we're not iterating as much or we're not as startupy anymore and like we kind of got product market fit and now it's time to hand things over to on-chain governance it is also confidence that like we're not very likely to come across a bug that needs to get fixed overnight we've got some good understanding about how to change the code and actually review code updates that happen via governance and like we're pretty confident that we're not going to accidentally pass through governance something that's just going to explode the entire protocol and if you don't have that then it's kind of hard it's almost like you know transitioning a project or like you know when when facebook developed some open source thing and then they're like right now let's like put it into some uh you know let's create some foundation around it or whatever and just spin it out into that thing and that thing can run it from now on um or hand it over to you know the the uh one of these one of these kind of open source cemeteries where projects stop getting innovated on that's kind of the i guess it's sort of equivalent for protocols is that you can only really fully move something out of the hands of the core team when you're confident enough that it can live on without the loving hands and the and the you know the the the upbringing that you need in the early days to have a secure enough code base and if you never get there you never actually get to that point where people are confident in how to change it and how to steward it then it might never cross that chasm there's sort of a latency thing right of like when you go to full governance governance is not instant the way you're multisig is right there's some latency of describing the problem and convincing the community doing the vote and the question is do you think the high severity bugs in your code base can be corrected at that latency they're not like something that needs to be corrected faster than that and and if you don't have the confidence for that it can be extremely difficult i think community wise to to do such a thing i think there are ways that had training wheels right there there are projects that have like an admin emergency stop which makes sense like hey there's a vulnerability no more deposits no withdrawals like we're gonna swap out the contract through governance versus like you know just winging it and throwing it in the wild but you know say you know one man's bug is another man's bounty and so you know true that like yes something like that might be difficult to go through governance but there's a there's like a reason why you want something that's like like that to get through governance because the flip side is that yo you wield an incredible amount of power to you know be able to upgrade uh an implementation contract like that yeah two comparisons right the convex contract is like very fresh contract written by this initial set of developers but they don't rest on any other code base in some way and so it's like a very new code base and then they're not super active and it's not clear that like it they've built enough resilience around it on the other hand terrorist codements if you look at the commits to tara there are extremely small number of developers who have committed to tendermint sorry to tara's fork attendant but yes they because the cosmos ecosystem has an insanely large number of developers that they're constantly upstreaming updates from you can actually believe that their ecosystem is sort of implied a developer ecosystem is actually bigger than what their code they says convex is much more weird it's really standing on its own and most people who copy it are people who are you know for instance tribeca dao has basically re-implemented convex and solano well that's not a very good comparison right like it's not like the tribeca dial developers let's say there's like a big emergency and comeback should actually go fix it because they're not writing this weird combination of viper and solidity and so there's kind of this kind of very boring people ma people involved thing that i think one has to consider when fully decentralizing in a lot of ways it's like really important to have like developer community that understands intimately what's happening that's just my opinion again other people may think it's safer otherwise but they're fair points all around and you know if anything this week is a good reminder of why this stuff matters and um you know we've seen a number of big failures and actually not last of which there's there's another story that we wanted to cover this week of this this stable coin that we don't talk about very much called the usdn so you people have probably seen that there's a smart contract platform called waves that's been pumping a lot over the last few weeks specifically after the russian invasion of ukraine and well it pumped a lot and then it pumped not so much and so waves is a smart contract blockchain it's been around forever i've i've only ever known it as like the russia smart contract chain i haven't known a whole lot about waves besides that but so waves has a project on it called neutrino which is a stable coin somewhat similar to terra but it's got different mechanics i don't actually i don't actually understand all the details about how neutrino works but basically it's supposed to trade for a dollar because it's stable coin so a bunch of drama erupted uh over this last week uh of the the founder of waves accusing alameda uh whom they you know they paid um they paid fda alameda is the market making arm associated with ftx the founder of waves accused alameda of despite the fact that ftx took like a you know million and a half integration fee to get uh waves and their ecosystem integrated into ftx alameda went and supposedly shorted an enormous amount of usdn to try to break the peg or some something along those lines or collect a huge funding rate i don't know there's a big argument on twitter about why exactly they were doing this but supposedly the founder claims that because of that neutrino is now trading below the peg and there's a there's a bunch of fingers getting pointed in every direction it's kind of like the spider-man beam and neutrino is now as of as of right now they're trading at something like 88 cents so it is trading very comfortably below the peg and does not seem to be moving very much from there so maybe it's stable at 88 cents i'm not sure i so we we were talking before we began recording we were like i bet tarou knows how this thing works so tarun do you know how this thing works and can you explain this to us i don't but there is someone at my work who runs a liquidator and who is explaining a very rough estimate of it and i can give you the analogy which is its titan plus terra so it does it has sort of like a very lossy stable coin like you know esc adjusting the insulation curve mechanism but then it has sort of like a it gets more tight under big price drops but the problem is that the oracle to the price drops is actually not that great because it mainly includes the on-chain liquidity and their weights are not kind of super super good for that which is apparently a great thing for people running liquidators that's that's the only thing i know so that is basically all i know so i apologize i i really tried to read their docs once and i really felt like i was like getting like a lecture on like something i didn't understand and like i somehow was like this scotty scam and i i just like a year and a half ago and so then i never looked into it again that is generally the worst sign for a white paper when you're reading it and you feel like you're being lectured to and you you feel like it's like wait why where are all these terms coming from like i've never heard like why are you making up a new word for this that is that is kind of the worst feeling although you must be very used to that giving you read math papers all the time and i feel like that's like how every math paper but like i feel like the the problem with like crypto these stable coin papers in particular is like everyone who's doing it you kind of okay here's my theory anyone who makes a new sample coin especially non-collateralized steel coins is a certain type of like theodore kaczynski they're kind of like a little bit crazy in a certain way we're like i am going to reinvent every [ __ ] thing in finance and it's going to be exactly this way and it's going and i'm going to make everything see and they have this kind of like crazed look in their face and it's not like their words are any different their words are also equally as crazy they kind of have this like kind of psychopath tendency because it's like to believe you're going to do this also without collateral like collateralized systems i'm ignoring right we're sure collaborative systems much more natural naturally purely algo stable coins the people have found these things often times number one thing i've learned they do not look at history they do not say like oh what are the attempts that have happened before me they're just like no no no i'm going to invent the greatest thing because i'm god's gift to earth and i'm this genius who knows what's how and they never look at history and this neutrino thing was like exactly to the t this thing of like oh yeah well like the central bank works this way insert things that partially are true partially not true but you know we're being suppressed by the like political forces x and so here's how we get around them by this kind of very simple like pid controller that's usually the pitch and neutrino was that except more political and every major stable coin especially led to your point the senior shares type models they pretty much always have a section in there about okay what what's gonna happen after the dollar collapses and how are we gonna how are we gonna become like you always need a section for what happens after the dollar collapses because obviously obviously that's in your that's the most important thing i need to know when i'm investigating crypto papers very few are as political as the bitcoin white paper and algorithmic stable coins those are the two that like for no reason will invoke political like fortitude that's like it's like proof of political might that's like what they want to do to you when you're reading that i i actually i think the bitcoin paper is actually surprisingly sober like it's actually not very political well i i guess i'm including all the forum posts in my my interpretation here's the shameless plug for the bitcoin white paper if you haven't read it in last like 24 months go back and read it it's delightful because it takes extremely big things that like people spend like years debating like proof of work and it's like oh no it uses proof of work and like with like an increasing difficulty and it's like two sentences like the white paper is so succinct in terms of like simplifying extremely big things into like a two sentence like i know it uses proof of work and the difficulty increases like as a function of you know the last difficulty and you're like that's the entire explanation of proof of work in the bitcoin white paper it's crazy it's so simple and it's not political i agree but i i guess generally like you read a layer one paper like a smart contract language paper it's like here is the future of computation right and then like you read a paper about like a d5 protocol it's like here's why goldman sachs sucks at doing this thing but then you read the algo stable coin papers and it's like wow you have to have a certain type of crazy to write that there's just no way around it they like they it's like it's built into them who else would write that i think it's true i think it's true i think it started with basis and i think basis kind of like i don't know if anybody here has read the basis white paper basis was basically uh it was not the inventor of senior shares senior shares was invented like i think in 2014 or something but i think it was robert sam's [ __ ] shares which failed don't forget [ __ ] hairs r.i.p well bishop bishop's not seeing your shares it was but they added senior chairs late at the end to try to capture the like while they were crashing it didn't work right i didn't know that it's okay the founders all sounded ears so they're fine they're fine they're doing they're doing well they're all doing well but um i think it started with with the basis the base has kind of taught people like look if you want to do an algo stable coin you got to just be maximally crazy like they're you cannot pull any stock like you have i'm going to completely reinvent money the dollar is going to disappear because of how awesome my stable coin is and like eventually this will just eat the world and everyone will use this and i remember i remember the uh the the back tests i don't know i don't know if you guys saw did you guys invest in bases back in the day i didn't but i remember all of my friends did okay yeah it was like it was i i did not in spite of being friends with nader for 10 years that's cold no no i love natter the sales pitch was crazy like i had i was like am i in what world am i in like i have to just be like i need more drugs if i'm gonna believe this pitch yeah to be clear i love matter i thought basis had a ton of problems and we saw in practice that it obviously did because everything that tried to implement basis failed and broke pretty pretty quickly right but i love nader but like the i remember when i read the back test so like this was this was early days of crypto and so anything that you wrote that was technical people just immediately believed and so he wrote this they did these simulations that basically showed that basis uh the question was always like okay this senior shares model is it not just going to break in times of high volatility and they were like all right we're going to do these simulations that proves during like the mexican peso crisis you know the ruble crisis uh like you know like the civil war uh we're gonna take all this economic data and we're gonna run simulations that proves that basis works even during like the worst possible periods in history and i'm like i don't believe you i do not believe you i don't i i believe you did something that shows a program that says something i don't believe you that basis would work in any of those circumstances yeah the real world when you have a bunch of dj's with the money in something it won't perform like you think yeah i'm working on a pet theory around these these seniority models around i mean obviously the issue is always like at some point the price of the share component starts going down there's like a crisis of confidence around the system and that inevitably sort of leads to this you know collapse but if you look at the ones that have been you know moderately successful so far it's terra and it's waves neutrino i think that's in part because the shares component is this like you know yield generating share in a proof-of-stake blockchain and so it's like there's there's something going on here it's like well you know this can't be worth nothing because i'm getting 15 a year staking my uh luna or staking my uh neutrino and so it's like you you you know some sort of like you know mental shift and like oh there's some fundamental value here versus like this is just some coin that they minted you know [ __ ] this like this whole thing's going to zero which is it tends to be sort of the end state for all these uh seniors models well it's also there's some exogenous demand right so for for tara you know tara has the senior shares type model but their people want tara for other reasons beyond just the stable i mean you know presumably people want terrific reasons other than stable point which is why you know it it has at least some nominal diversification of the value of the share token you mean anchor yes yeah obviously a lot of it is anchor a lot of the usd demand is and luna demand is anchor but um in principle at least it's at least nominally better and i think that was the key to actually being a layer once they were coined that like cello missed that basis miss a lot of the people who were kind of trying to gear for that model hoped that the organic demand would be payments right like the the dream of stable claims was always payments but it was wrong you can't really bootstrap stable stablecoins off payments you have to bootstrap def off lending and like more complicated things because at the end of the day the dumb users are not the first users and like that it's like impossible to bootstrap at that point right and uh you know speaking of stable coin we're going to see a bitcoin stable claim soon according to the news today wait which news is this it's lighting labs oh i did not see this uh if someone want to explain this i just woke up it's morning here in singapore in our last five minutes what what's happening with the bitcoin stable coin well lightning labs raised like 70 million dollars for uh a sort of bitcoin token standard in bitcoin i thought it was just stable coins on bitcoin through lightning is it actually a bitcoin backed stablecoin it's not it's not it's not clearly they're coming back i think the main thing is they have a sort of modification of this token standard that people have been like trying to build on top of lightning i i'm sure i'm offending some pure bitcoiners on when i call it a token standard but there is an overlay network that you can transfer value of assets that are not directly pegged to bitcoin sorry hopefully that's the politically correct definition of a token in that corner of the universe you know they want to actually build a low variance asset just like the winnie the pooh you know it's like the the low classes stable coin you got the high class the low variance asset i i'm just tell i'm just parroting what i've read i i i i want to offend no one so i well you failed at defending no one for sure uh yeah it's hard it's it's interesting how incredibly political stable coins have become they used to be a pretty boring and unobjectionable part of crypto and now it turns out they're the most exciting part of crypto just real quick last piece of news uh which is kind of crypto adjacent but i'm encountered as crypto elon musk was just announced as having taken a massive stake in twitter he was secretly buying up uh twitter equity over the last uh couple months uh he now owns 9.2 percent of the overall share of twitter he makes it the single largest shareholder in twitter and he was just appointed today to the twitter board of directors so elon musk is now uh going to be influencing stuff happening at twitter how do we feel about this everybody one of the greatest sec filings in history it is like the shortest thing ever it's like sec elon musk has joined the board of twitter he agrees not to own 14.9 the end amazing amazing edgar edgar has been blessed [Laughter] i was actually wondering about that why is it 14.9 percent if i had to guess in like the corporate raider 80s or whatever you know they said oh owning 15 percent has all sort of different things they said well it can't be 15. 14.9 is where like the limit is that sounds that sounds exactly like you know probably yeah i feel like um elon is living the uh the web 3 dream you know it's the the largest users of the protocol are governing the protocol in a very you know clunky backwards way but this is the way it should be i think it's great i actually think we're gonna see a lot more crypto native features come to twitter that's my prediction i mean we already saw it with jack getting kicked out like almost literally the next two days after he left well let's see if uh maybe spf is going to buy you know i don't know what what could he buy foursquare well the the espn part of the world is weird because every sp every sports person is making an nft platform right now that's true so it i don't know what the i don't know what the economics are [Music] [Laughter] yeah the the the unfortunate reality is that actually spf doesn't need to buy anything because everyone's already going all in on crypto so things will things will just kind of happen whether or not crypto people buy a stake in them one last news item is the ftx investing in iex thing a proof flash boys was wrong which i'm personally having worked in the industry i feels indicated a little bit but uh the second thing is that ftx buying iex tells you a little bit of a signal that like stocks and crypto are going to converge to the same thing five years well they bought a stake in ix right like they didn't they didn't they didn't buy iax did they no but they're basically i it seems like it's the type of thing where like they need ats licenses and they want to do ftx us doing stock trading and they want stock encrypted trading same place you don't know just the difference and iex is like the weakest dog at the you know it's like it's like the half mute missing one leg dog has two percent market share on a good day and not not exactly the like sharpest tool at the shed on the equities markets and equities markets are razor than margins right so it's like and they were already kind of struggling so like it was it was very pointed moves to people in the hft world we were all just like all my group cats woke up being like thoughts and equities are the same in five years wow that's a that's a bold vision that's exciting i i have a sneaking suspicion that it may be it's kind of like when sequoian paradigm invested into uh no sit sack is going to be ceo not even ken griffin that's great who's this like uh a stats pc guy professor former professor he was the one who was like going on cnn i was like what the [ __ ] like i can't believe that guy is going on cnn to represent citadel like it was a very it's a weird world like let's just say like the trading world is getting blown up by crypto and the iex thing to me was more of a signal than fidel because it was like the big dog crypto exchanges want to compete with u.s equities exchanges like like i and they could like the fact that they could is crazy like two years ago you would never have thought that one year ago you would never have thought that well speaking of crypto blowing up uh last actually last thing tyrone uh last time we announced the news of gauntlet becoming a unicorn and so now that you're actually here and are willing to grace us with your presence we wanted to congratulate you on the amazing uh progress that gauntlet has made any uh would you would you like to give us a word in your acceptance speech of your unicorn status you know given uh that award shows have not had a great couple weeks as we all know all i have to say is i hope i have better colored hair next time i'm on the show yeah what's going on man are you going are you going are you going clean now now that you've made a big ah no it's just that my i gotta re-dye my hair i've been lazy so i promise i promise the viewers something better soon yeah can we can we do like an on-chain vote for this i would actually that's great that's great what if you can start a poll and i will go do it okay okay okay okay i'm starting a poll right now all right for the for for the at home for the at-home listeners on the podcast side tarou's hair right now is jet black come join robert lesnar is going to be launching the poll come and vote on what tyrone's hair is going to be next time he pops on the show what are the choices oh he's got a few highlights he's fading okay okay i'd say i'd say at least magenta needs to be on there magenta what else green obviously green green's a classic uh what else two more white yeah just go bleach it you know all right i'm putting it as an option but i don't know it's non-binding all right it's a one-on-one multi-segment we need one more choice results more choice i was going to just go green because i always do green but blue yeah let's do blue let's throw blue in there absolutely it really depends it's like i've gone to the same hairstylist for 12 years and i only go the same person and whatever she says does kind of dominate so like just understand that this is not a final poll okay so okay well let's end the show here but i'm going to put up this poll imminently that sounds good all right thanks everybody in a couple weeks we'll we'll check back in and see how trun's hair is doing see everyone thanks again thanks everyone
