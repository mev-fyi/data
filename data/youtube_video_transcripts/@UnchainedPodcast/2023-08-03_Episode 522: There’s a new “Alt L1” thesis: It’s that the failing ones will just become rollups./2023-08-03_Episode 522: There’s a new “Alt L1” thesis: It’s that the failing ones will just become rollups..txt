most layer ones it and and when I say most layer ones I mean I think I think at this point there's I mean there's certainly dozens and there's probably hundreds because I don't know them all um the ones that don't have enough demand they're probably going to become Roll-Ups right because they built duplicative data centers that they can't maintain that they're going to bleed out value from and then people are going to eventually give up and be like well why am I eating all this annual Supply inflation when there's no transaction fee Demand on the horizon and so well some some will die maybe they'll shut off their validator sets I I don't know we we've talked before about how protocols don't die the way companies do and that's kind of a murky thing that I'll that'll leave there to the side but they'll certainly Fade Into relevance unless they kind of give themselves a second life um by moving to a roll-up system where a roll-up system you're going from having a pretty costly validator set to a few sequencers or a shared sequencer and there's teams working on shared sequencers now
