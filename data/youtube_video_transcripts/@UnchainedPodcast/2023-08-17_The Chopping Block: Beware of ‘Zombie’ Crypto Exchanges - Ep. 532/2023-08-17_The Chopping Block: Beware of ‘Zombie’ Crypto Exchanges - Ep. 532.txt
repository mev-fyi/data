not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so first up we've got Robert crypto connoisseur and tsar of superstate then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and today we've got a repeat guest of Guinea the markets Maven at wintermute trading and then you've got myself and received the head height man in dragonfly so we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block.xyz for more disclosures if Guinea it's good to have you back sir uh we were just chatting backstage about the fact that if you're in the market making world in the token trading world as you guys are at wintermute um what's notable right now is that it is one of the slowest times ever in the last basically like the last three to four years of crypto well how how is that you know on on the side of the trading firm because we see it from the Venture side what is it like on the trading side bridge is similar I guess it's like 2019 basically more or less you haven't seen those volumes since like early 2020 in general it's very slow especially in sport it's a bit more busy in derivatives but just primarily people are gambling a bit more but yeah it's ultimately pretty pretty boring and so I think that's that's what kind of drives all this like very short attention span for people involved in crypto all those like new scams once a week that pop up yeah it's all like people are just bought and trying to accomplish stuff to do which you know they'll cover there were news articles this week about a token that is a meme coin called Harry Potter Sonic Obama doing a lot of work there can't remember forget the 10. I was just reading about this apparently it is a meme coin inspired by a backpack that was found like a sort of bootlegged backpack that was using a lot of unlicensed images from different American icons so like Obama and Harry Potter and all this other stuff together and Sonic the Sonic which is weirdly kind of inverted colors kind of trippy Sonic and this has just developed this cult following and the the ticker for the token is actually Bitcoin so it is b-i-t-c-o-i-n is the ticker for this coin and right now it's like 150 million dollar market cap I guess the people the people are bored so if Guinea when you're at a trading firm and it's boring do you guys just like start trading meme coins like what do you what do you do when there's not that much to do um it's mostly built-in stops that we didn't have time to build during the bull market pretty much like it's kind of it's very similar to how it works and try to find to be honest it's like yeah slow days and well slow periods full markets bear markets like the same same kind of Cycles they just like longer usually and during the slow markets like I know in 2009 you just build stuff you work on better Algos you work in better software about the hardware that everything what's the most interesting thing that you've built during the slow patch uh I would say our G5 stack improved considerably I think that's something I think that's the coolest thing we built so far and yeah I think that's that's probably the main side and then on more on the like in general like they've been much more active on OTC side of things as well so we built but it's not really building now goes it's more like building stuff in the background on the back office side on legal side compliance side just being ready so without leaking too much Alpha how do you interact with D5 as an organization like yours I mean they've been trading on D5 since 2019 so it's all the usual stuff like we've been supporting the idx since the onset and knowledge incarnations and we're going to be there for the before uh with arbin mans pretty much since defy summer they are very bullish on RFQ Platforms in general so I've been providing liquidity there as well so it's yeah whatever we can be we can apply ourselves and especially the CRM stack it's it's really interesting like post marriage results like yeah is it building the whole vertical effectively not just Urban but also block building and like everything pretty much it's it became quite complex like you have to do it much more advanced things compared to like two three years ago interesting so actually um this this reminds me that back last year you were talking about building your D5 stack last year there were a couple of very very high profile snaf foods that took place at wintermute about your guy's defy infrastructure and Key Management I remember on the show tarun talked a lot of [ __ ] toward winter boot and uh I feel like that yeah I remember I'm sure you remember that as well and I feel like now that we have you on the show it feels like a good time to to address the underlying tension that that might be sitting there between you and tarun anything that you want to say in tarun now that you're here yeah like I no look it's it's more more like well let's put it like this I don't know uh during its history of intimate race I know 28 29 million overall and external funding ever they're currently sitting at about 450 plus million of Faculty so we've been having a pretty impressive growth overall the last three years um we made a lot of mistakes we generally like well we generally own those mistakes we are much more public about those mistakes in general we very much like to learn from it from them we build things better so like I have a G5 stack and whatever not and great thing about running a rope shop as opposite to fund is you basically yeah you own your mistakes in a very personal way like nobody else suffers with you unless you go bankrupt which we didn't um and ultimately hexocked uh like all this well basically those G5 Snuffles whatever you call up suck FTX sucked but ultimately Beyond it we learned from it we built from it and ultimately like only people who paid from it were the internet shareholders who are still doing quite well despite everything so that's also kind of fine and yeah this regards to that particular episode some people chose to be nice about it some people chose to be dicks about it and I made a notice about the letter pads and let's leave it at that very classy response to ruin what uh what's your response here I think I was more angry last year also just like there were a lot of I think especially around time FTX we saw a lot more kind of like let's say bad things that happened so you know I uh I I get that it's hard to to do these things at the same time I do still stand by my claim that culturally trading firms are usually very bad at opsec and security and that's why on the Block building side if you look at the top block Builders and what everything was talking about a lot of them came from being formal verification people and actually not trading like if you look at the top two block Builders so I I would say that it's so we are we are one of the top two block Builders lighting do depends how you measures them yeah I I I would say your your main competitor however is is much more comes from a different background let's put that away I I still kind of think that ends up being true and I think it's good that hey look if the institution learns to fix their mistakes especially if they're forced to them that's always a good thing I don't know I don't know what you want me to say hasid you're just like looking in particular I wanted you to say I think you're giving me this like menacing look like I'm waiting medicine I'm not I'm not medicine I just thought hey you know we had some bad blood we should air it out before we got on with the show this is the under the bridge episode the water is floating yeah that's right that's right this is I just feel like you're also forgetting the time scale that that when that happened like I feel like absolutely nine months ago of course of course of course yeah I mean that was just like the beginning of the you know parade of horribles that took place in crypto so I feel like I took out maybe more anger because it was one of the earlier mishaps then now I'm where I'm kind of like all right well it is what it is no that's fair and look in retrospect the the highest honor you can pay a trading firm is that they survived because of course a lot of trading firms have not especially ones that were as far down the risk curve as a winter mute you know it's it's easy when you're you know on centralized exchanges just doing like very safe stuff but when you're taking a lot of risk yeah you're gonna mess up sometimes and and I think this is the exact point that I made when we were talking about this the the winter mute hacks that took place last year uh is that I had the utmost respect for firms that are internalizing the cost of that risk right like when winter we got hacked nobody else paid that price other than wintermute and that that that means that you know the markets are working and that there is no there are a lot of situations last year where people lost other people's money and FTX being the the big gigantic principal example of that but uh anytime that somebody loses their own money and they learn from it and they rebuild and build back better I'm I'm a fan I think that's that's markets doing what they're supposed to do so anyway I I I'm sorry if uh for for causing said beef I guess it was a different era you know at that time it was just like the security he's got he's gotten older he's gotten gentler you know I mean I mean Gary was sending private keys for FTX in Gmail like all right if you're if we're comparing sheets Google you know like it's like after after all the other security stuff at this point I I view this as a itself there were just too many things after that and now my head hurts just remembering how many of those things happened so anyway I I I will give a public apology for for hopefully being not being too much of a dick at that time very very hard fight not not warranted feels very hard I'm I'm so tickled by this I feel like it's a product both of you uh kind of getting older and cuddlier over time but also the fact that every nothing else everything else in the bear Market was so much more embarrassing than what took place at winter Butte so it's also partially lowering standards yeah I I think it's just like also being able to survive all the venues disappearing on you and like dealing with like very I got a lot of respect for that because like think about how many times you got to move all your assets off in exchange in the last one year wait let me ask the question how many exchanges was Winter mute on that went under with winch immune assets let's not presume let's ask not just one really I mean that isn't like no the one they're not that many exchanges at Rwanda I mean okay like if you count liquid as part of FTX like we didn't really have anything on liquid anyway but okay like that's like more than one but like my biggest challenge with current environment is like I think there are a lot of zombies still out there like an exchange site and we don't trade on a lot of them because we actually think that a lot of them are zombies can you elaborate which changes which exchanges do you suspect of being zombies I wish yeah no it's that that's that's kind of moving which exchanges do you not trade on we don't need any yeah which large exchanges which which exchanges are the top ten do not trade on no comment on whether or not they're zombies yeah I mean that's it's kind of like it's over weapon circles pretty much like I suspect and Zen being zombies and not training yeah I mean look after what happened with FTX last year I do feel like it's a bit of a public service to you know you can say look I don't know I'm not confident you know copy item tour we don't have all the information but here's where we're not Trading the hardest bit is you just like I mean I can say it and then I just make a lot of enemies for no good reason and that's that's basically the unfortunate truth of it that we cannot name things that like they're just like too big to name things unfortunately when I can name things like when I can name Bad actors I do it bits much always but sometimes it's you just don't know okay there is an exchange and it belongs to the guy and he's a shady guy but I know maybe he'll still be around in five years time you know who knows okay I see there's one Exchange in particular that belongs to a guy who may be around in five years okay I see I think you might know the exchange you're referring to I I mean I I don't just mean like pulling off money around say FTX I I also mean like every time there's like a scare and then there's a rush of liquidity all off this exchange because of a rumor and you as a market maker you you have to stop quoting you have to like add all this extra Logic for like pull from X when y liquidy goes on you know I feel like it actually makes all your like exit trade logic a lot more annoying I mean yes but you only also kind of built for it like we had something like four five five drills well fire drills with binance for example of his last six months and yeah we just learned to do it to clean it up in matter of hours basically so Finance is one thing you do trade on okay so yeah I'm in you cannot because the Trident as a training family you cannot not trade on buyers and you might as well just closer like it's it's pointless that's that's why most of the creators currently especially at a time when liquidity is so scarce in general I I believe if I remember correctly there was also an article about you making an exchange oh yeah I remember that it's basically asked mentioned as it would be an interesting idea to explore so it's not like the same as making um which I still think would be it was like the front cover it was a front cover of a magazine this was not like oh like the block wrote a tiny article so I don't you know I wish it was a front cover no no it was just like online cover or something it was a big it was a big article I don't know no that that's what they chose to highlight how to follow it um I still think it's a really good time to build an exchange to be honest and like are you building in exchange not at the moment simply because it just it takes a lot of focus and I have a lot of other things to focus on primarily in the core business of intermittent it's just I cannot afford to lose this focus at the moment maybe in two three months time maybe but like currently just I just don't have mental capacity and frankly like the team like you need to do like building exchanges is such a massive undertaking that yeah I just cannot like take it lightly if we ever do it hypothetically if you were to build an exchange what would be different about it versus existing incumbent exchanges so I think like what's would be I think this exchange if you were to build an exchange that would be much more similar to CMEs and to binance a coinbase like I think it would be focused much more on the matching engine and basically like this Central clearing part basically stripping away all like kycml for retail people stripping away managing leverage sticking away like all the horrible things about running your own centralized exchange on crypto and just making it much more see me like and basically focusing on one hand and it's like what does BF try to do with FTX like making this Central clearing run a very efficient cross-marginine kind of like engine and on the other hands kind of like Improvement on CME side that would be basically running on the stable coins instead of Fiat so that you can do settlement Cycles faster and if you can do settlement Cycles faster you effectively can extend more leverage to the clear end members as a result have you considered hiring 20 kids feeding them a bunch of speed and sending them to an island yeah yeah they probably built something with that no no not at the cards okay like one big change for us over the last year or so we we started and we started like slowly incubating those products inside of interviewed like we did Bebop which was really just I'll play on RFQ uh like well you had Lawrence the other day uh who is built in Wildcat so we we started like dabbing into building products and like slowly moving in to become a product company and basically what I learned is it's a very different gig like building the trading companies especially if you just train the centralized exchange this is kind of straightforward like all you need is a former Traders and then like as it becomes more complex it like gives the more support with back office operations and like I have better developers and everything that that's great but ultimately yeah product is very different because as a training company you don't have customers like it's very easy right you just need to build Greek algorithm smart Algos as a product company actually to think about a lot more things and that's what I'm kind of like learning for myself and exchanges like ultimate ultimate boss to conquer because there is just so much to build well so speaking of product companies let's get into the news of the week so coinbase has launched of course this product that's getting all this attention now which is base they're L2 now base uh I think last week we talked about how based out of developer mode that was initially getting some traction getting some meme coins and rugbulls and all sorts of crypto chicanery but finally this week I believe as of August 9th base finally launched their main net basically meaning that now there's a nice little interface and you can you know jump across the bridge and start playing around on top of bass a bunch of protocols have been deployed there so compound uniswap Ave you know a lot of the big Protocols are now living on base the base numbers actually look pretty strong so the tvl on base is about 230 million uh as of right now which makes it the number five L2 by tvl behind uidx and then dydx behind uh ZK sync their daily active users seem to be our daily active addresses I should say seem to be around 100K they were growing quite a bit and now it seems like they've mostly stabilized although you know who knows there obviously could be a surge of activity but but as of right now it doesn't seem like it's going vertical from there the transactions per second is around seven now that's not like Peak throughput that's like the sustained throughput that it has over the course of the day which is again it's pretty high um if there was a while actually I think yesterday it was actually higher than both arbitrum one and optimism mainnet but now it's kind of gotten back in line with the two of them so it looks like the activity is pretty strong on base it's not crazy it's not quite binance marching levels but it's it's doing quite well uh it seems a lot of the activity on top of bass Is MeMe coins lots of farming lots of kind of degenerate excitement that seems to be the name of the day I don't know what you guys have been seeing on your feeds or if you guys been playing around in some of the applications on top of bass but what's your guys take on what's happening in this new ecosystem well I will preface by saying that I have not used Bass yet I am embarrassed to say I've created zero transactions on base with bridged assets or done anything um so I can only look from the outside but to me I think it's like pretty bullish in that a couple hundred million dollars it takes a lot of l2s a long time to get any tractor at all and I think people are sort of like preemptively you know migrate into base on the expectation that coinbase will make it successful and attract developers and attract you know a lot of like new applications and use cases and integration with coinbase the exchange in like novel ways that I don't think have been you know thought through yet and so like I I think this is demonstrating that the brand that coinbase has built alone is like selling the dream for a lot of users and if this was like a product of you know a random developer team I don't think you would see any similar activity or usage to Moon what's your take yeah I mean I think it's sort of a similar type of thing I think it has a lot more Integrations I I only sent one or two transactions so I can only say that that much it it the wallet experience is a lot better at least you know if you're using coinbase for instance I think the interesting thing has actually been the kind of cognizanti pushback against base in that like if you've if you are trolling around Twitter you'll see a lot of people complaining about the lack of fraud proofs and you can see all the other l2s kind of like really collaborating on their dunking of this uh that's true for every op stack none of the op yeah yeah yeah yeah but I I think they took took a lot of TBL from from other l2s so there oh this is a response uh it's very interesting to watch the social layer in crypto like flip like that because I feel like in in normal trading there's not usually that much benefit to kind of like having these like very public collusive events but uh you know like everyone seem to ever every other L2 seems to be on board of the like no fault proofs op stack thing and you can you can kind of see some of the wars going on there so I think that's kind of interesting it's like it will be interesting if if bass actually really pushes everyone to finally finish their implementations but I think like in general probably pretty good that people are gonna get used to L2 experience and um you know a lot of people were tagging me on Twitter from something I said on the podcast a long time ago when bass was first announced which was me reading someone else's tweet so someone people think I said this but which is that bass is BSC for white people I I think it's it is definitively seems to be true now at this point well so the the question is we've kind of an idea of what base is obviously you could continue to grow if something goes really viral has this over performed or underperformed your expectations one way I think it did over perform is that like most altitudes right now have either focused on applications that are like games run as there are no two or new D5 protocols that are more expensive or deploy existing protocol right like by and large that's like the majority of applications but the interesting thing with bass is that it because it kind of had this huge initial growth spur it was actually like a social app that kind of became very popular and the social app I think this is sort of the first time we've seen something like that in the bear market right like in the bull market you kind of saw things like this happen so there is clearly a thing where developers feel much more incentivized to build certain types of app applications on base as far as I can tell versus say other chains that maybe you know have different trade-offs or different types of users like the type of user who would go on base tends to have exercised now it's obviously the early days of this type of stuff but that that's where it deviated from my expectation I thought it would just be like like another L2 maybe have more stable coins on it because people are able to like move from coinbase products to it more easily uh but the fact that developers seem to have like are trying weirder experiments than they are on other l2s and this is not say that people aren't on other l2s I think it's just that those experiments just aren't live or haven't gotten as much attraction like this that that was sort of the most surprising thing to me evgeny what what struck you so far about the base roll out um I mean in general like I'm I think it's a good sign that we have more I'll Do's in the mix I would be very cautious about the user numbers like it's very clearly not hundred thousand users like I don't think it's seven percent of that like it's I mean it's like to me it was one of them it's one of the most like infuriates insane about D5 is because that nobody actually bothers us to try to estimate what's the number of users we have like everyone knows BC has the most of it and then polygon is like second but like how many it is actually nobody cares like everyone counts like wallets or transactions like others like vanity stats but nobody actually tries to estimate how many actual users do trade there uh benefit of coinbase is they like I would be very curious to see the numbers like how many coinbase wallet users trade on base because that's actually a pretty good metric and that's actually what kind of position it to success ultimately um I'm also very curious how coinbase is going to walk this line between on one hand maintaining this well either facade or like actual desire to keep it very decentralized and at the same time to avoid stuff like bolt happening basically again and again because you'll see more scams inevitably and like residents are going to be actively pollution it and trying to prevent it or is it just gonna like continue with Wild West yeah quite curious how's it going to take it yeah I mean this is a point that I made uh when we talked originally about the announcement of base before it was ever live which is that in the early days of binance smart chain binance basically had total control over the bridge that moved in and out of Planet smart chain and as a result binance sort of played policemen for the chain is that when there would be hacks or there would be kind of other rug pulls on toward activity uh binance would basically step in and kind of feel like they were responsible for uh making sure none of the kids bonked their heads against each other or you know got it got injured now coinbase hasn't shown yet the willingness to go in and start doing that basically policing Bad actors or making sure that like okay we're gonna like freeze funds or prevent people from going over the bridge but the thing is you know to tarun's point that all these uh you know other LTS are complaining about which is which is strictly true if there are no fraud proofs uh then it is strictly within the power of the the sequencer it's strictly within the control of the sequencer to be able to decide to censor transactions to rewrite state to basically do whatever they want to right wrongs and to dry tears and now I don't think coinbase wants to do it and I think they will fight tooth and nail to prevent them from having the responsibility to do it but you you could events an argument that basically you know this is like a Money Services business because they ultimately have control over what goes in and out and if they chose to they could unilaterally change it well I mean a sequencer in this way is very similar to and we haven't used as a society this phrase in like five years but like proof of authority change like this was like a concept like six years ago where it was like oh no like we don't have like you know a whole set of validators or miners or whatever we have like you know one key or entity that approves or controls the transaction finalization process and like a sequencer before is fully decentralized is that it is proof of authority and it's like what I find just so amusing about you know most Altus is you know six years ago if you're like oh that changed proof of authority like the crypto public would be like revolted you know it'd be like you know horrifying and now it's like oh that's cool like it's an L2 like you know of course like you know you just have like one company who runs the sequencer like that's the way it works and like now it's and accepted part of expectations maybe binance is the one that like you know sort of started to do away with the like a chain has to be decentralized you know yeah I think L2 has become less of a description of a security model Than A vibe and I feel like that's kind of what bases is like embracing L2 as a five rather than as like any actually explicit way of keeping your funds safe so I mean that being said I think it's obviously very likely coinbase is going to do any of those things and they've shown the willingness to to kind of be a lot more aggressive than they used to be in previous years about embracing crypto native values so I'm not accusing them of actually doing this but um you know I can I mean we've seen so many ridiculous lawsuits that I can imagine one taking the shape at some point in the near future which may end up putting pressure on a coinbase if there are no fraud proofs to basically say like you know hey this was under your watch you guys are making money from this apparently they've made what was it like seven million dollars so far from the sequencer something like that am I am I making that number up I'm just making that number up it might be it's true that's a pretty good number so far can someone fact check that yeah I mean one other thing about this that's interesting is yeah like these exchange POA chains seem fine and one benefit that I think people get from these kind of exchange POA chains let's put you know if we call them that is that they basically people are always complaining about proofs of reserves like how much in assets does centralized exchange actually have and there's not really a good way for them to prove it to you right they could have an OTC loan that's not on their books but it looks like they have a ton of collateral but they that collateral is actually really being can be called via a legal agreement for instance so proof of Reserve is already this kind of like a little bit of a smoke and mirrors type of thing but the assets on the POA chain are the reserves you can see right and so like BNB being the BNB that's on the Chain you actually believe is like truly there's that much versus they're not being and I think one way of viewing these POA chains from centralized exchanges so only from centralized exchanges is as a programmable sort of proof of reserves like they they have there's some subset of reserves that you can really know what's happening publicly and can validate yourself you might not be able to change the state of but you can validate the data that's correct and you have confidence in those reserves relative to you know the exchanges balances themselves uh this is a concept actually from a long time ago uh Patrick McCory who's I think at the harbor term Foundation a long time ago kind of in 2019 or 2020 I forget had this description of Poa chains by exchanges and I think in some ways that's that's why people are fine putting their liquidity there they're they're treating it as an extension of the this thing they already kind of trust which is different than say like another op stack chain right like another op stack chain is not really an extension of like something you already have confidence fund wise and but to that point I there is there's the question to me is actually more not the the rug pulls because I don't think binance really gave a [ __ ] about most of the rug pulls if we're being honest they cared a lot more about the bridge hacks right like the bridge hacks were the really big deals and like some of them were extremely sophisticated like the one that found the the Merkle tree defect that was an insanely sophisticated bug and like but but Finance sort of like worked with a bunch of D5 protocols to kind of patch it up so the reason I'm bringing all this up is just to kind of point out that I think there's always there's going to be some Crossing line and it needs to be like the hack or lost funds have to either be big enough or aggregated in a big enough pool or can bridged in some way for them to actually take action if they're going to be like binance now of course coin is a public company finances anything but so who knows what the differences in treatment will be where that line is so just quick closing loop on that fact check so base right now their annualized fees are about 58 million dollars now I don't actually know what the take rate is for coinbase on those fees so that's like the fees paid on the Chain I presume but just for a sense of scale right now they're making about half the fees of BSC which is which is roughly almost as much as Bitcoin Bitcoin BSC charge I have about the same in Daily fees so pretty significant volumes now of course a lot of this is because you know there's a bit of a frenzy going on right now but it's very impressive numbers some of those fees go to op holders also so is that already happening no no no no it's it's post talk Revenue sure that's what I thought but there is there is some so so I would say that yeah there's a bunch of portions of this fees you'll probably have to discount so what is that portion did I read at some point it was 10 is it not 10 yeah I I forget exactly because initially they wrote a percentage and then they edited the article that's right the percentage they removed the percentage removed the percentage so I I and I haven't followed it so yeah well okay we gotta get we gotta get Jesse a subsequent show it doesn't go to Foundation or like cause it distributed if you're listening to this episode and you have the answer please tweet at all of us well I think we really need like a fact checker on the show I think we're gonna have Jeffy from base on soon so we can ask him to to give us the details great and then he can he can he can neither confirm nor deny any of the things we ask him it'll be great cool okay well so it's really you were talking about the social activity that's happening on base a lot of this has been concentrated into one particular application called friends.tech so friends.tech it's become kind of a social phenomenon here's basically how it works so uh you go to the you go to the app friends.tech uh it forces you to install it as a kind of as on your mobile phone as an application directly like a shortcut and once you install it then you can buy meme coins of your friends so if you remember the the app bitcloud the big cloud protocol ended up rebranding as diesel but Bitcoin was this old application that was kind of uh on its own blockchain that that did this um so it's kind of a recreation of it but with some extra social mechanics if you own someone's token you can chat with them like with bigcloud you know the people who are your trading they get a cut of the transactions so basically in this case on fresnotech you get a cut of secondary Market transaction fees kind of like a royalty stream uh more or less if people are willing to trade your token so this app has gotten a lot of social media engagement so crypto Twitter seems to love friends.tech uh it's getting a lot of love I was looking at some of the stats it was going pretty nuts over the weekend but it started to Trend down a little bit in engagement so basically on August 12th it hit the height of something like 10 000 transactions per day now it's down today something like 600 actually this might not be daily I might be reading this wrong uh sorry this is an hour this is hourly so whatever do the math and if you look at the number of uniques they have been also leveling out so the buyers and sellers are stabilizing quite a bit as well as the volumes so it seems like the numbers are trending down although there's still a decent amount of Engagement in fresnotech did any of you guys play around with it or see what's happening there that was one of my two transactions who did you buy who did you buy true who did you buy myself okay that sounds like inside yeah possibly also masturbation of some kind no no no no it's like Financial masturbation I just I I didn't buy anyone else I just initialized my account you were sort of self-pleasuring through your your friendship with yourself yeah I don't really like these social apps I just wanted to see what it was like more for the onboarding experience because you know right now you know probably in the Venture world over the last five years plus there's a ton of you know Venture from the L's that are people making wallets for mobile wallets and crypto right like a lot of them just never took off never got users dot dot right and the premise of a wallet is it's like you can use every application in one thing right like you can do kind of T trading D5 bridging whatever you want right but the idea of having this like app specific mobile app you know like for this one application which has a wallet in it but that's like not the most important part I think that's kind of an interesting modality like I know a bunch of people during the bull market were trying this but I didn't don't remember any that got as much sort of virality at least you know whatever little virality this has had by crypto standards virality not by like normal World fire reality and I'm kind of more curious if like the L2 the kind of clunkiness of like the modular kind of ux of like I have to have athletes on the base chain then I have to bridge assets to the L2 and I have to like manage those transactions if these like app specific chains that handle that like kind of hide that from the user for a particular application and deal with that if that will be a new ux modality we see people use so to me that was the most interesting thing about that it wasn't the actual application itself it was like this this yeah change like but again like what I mean obviously the ux I think on Fresno Tech was very good but it did really copy a lot of the ideas from from diesel or from oh yeah yeah for sure no I I agree the interesting thing is like the cognizant he loved this app but the cognizantes hated disa they hated it so it's it's kind of it's kind of uh but but you know that that type of political stuff aside I I do think this app specific or you know wallet part like may actually I'm kind of curious if we see a lot more experiments with this form right like I think for for gaming people have like sort of thought about doing this but no one has actually gotten a ton of users using these app specific wallets and maybe that's actually like a way better onboarding experience for like non-trading use cases of crypto well I personally think that all ux is going to Trend in the direction of easier even if it's worse from like a security perspective or Worse from a decentralization perspective or Worse from like any other perspective like the people in general and I'm saying this very broadly are lazy and like convenience and this doesn't apply just to crypto this applies to literally everything in every industry and like every product and every design space and so I think the end state for wallets you know unless there's like intermediate Solutions is like just trending towards simpler and easier and like custom and like while it's integrated for specific applications or specific use cases or you know whatever like and you know you we talked about this I think on the last show a little bit with unibot you know where it's like that's a horrible architecture you know and it's winning in a sense because it's like so so broken I think this trend is going to continue and I think we're going to like more developers who are like oh I'll just like build a wallet experience it's my product like yeah I think we're seeing more and more of this Progressive security and Progressive ux which is okay when you first start we're going to let you kind of be foot gun mode and basically like we'll we'll take your we'll take your Google oauth and then we'll just put your private key into like a file in your Google Drive and we kind of won't tell you about it we won't tell you that's exactly what we're doing but that's what we're doing um and then it's like okay now we'll like add to it a pin code uh if you have a little bit more money and it's like really worth securing that much money and if it's worth more money than that then we'll be like hey now you have to start doing social recovery you have to like connect with friends and they have to help you recover and if you go find that then we start getting to okay you know get a [ __ ] Ledger or you know whatever I don't know uh you you start you start getting more and more demanding of the amount of security you demand from your customer if the amount of capital they have at risk increases I suspect that's what these mobile ux's and these sort of casual crypto ux's are going to start uh trending towards and they will probably be my guess would be one or two vendors who basically kind of manage this process for you and you can sort of twiddle like hey what's up someone has less than 500 bucks it's fine you can just store it you know on the device or you can store it in their oauth you know or in their Google Drive if they don't have uh you know on device Key Management uh but as the numbers get bigger and bigger you start demanding more and more from your users that's what I would assume happens um but it's still pretty early for that I think that's a very cogent approach I mean we are early stage investors so if you are working on something like that uh holler please 100. I I just think it's going to be interesting because like D5 was is so about composability as the first class primitive in some ways of like and it's such that the ux was always like for the average user the the non-sort of Technical and in the weeds user but I it really does feel like maybe not nfts but like things that are a little more consumery than nfts are might just Trend in this like they have their own app interface because it actually was the app had a bunch of problems bug wise like because I didn't think they expected that many users on day one or something but honestly it was a very interesting like like I I actually felt like I could tell someone who hates crypto that they could you know use this versus like you know I tell I I tell someone you know actually I I I I kind of there's this nice experiment you can do to see how how annoying crypto is to your non-crypto friends which is you give them two Wallets on two different chains maybe one in a cosmos Zone one and an eighth on each or an L2 and you say hey go buy an nft in the other place so you have to figure out how to to Route across whether you have enough gas tokens this might be why you didn't have any friends to connect with on the app that's what you're doing to people I'm just saying this is like a way of like of like seeing how bad the ux is versus like this I could actually give to ostensibly anyone I know who's non-crypted which is like I see maybe we maybe it will be I'm just making the speculation that like maybe we're going to see this like app specific like vertically integrated mobile thing right like in some ways people thought uniswap wallet or things like that would look like something in that direction but I think trading and D5 just doesn't really need to be completely verticalized like that but social and gaming things seem it seems like way more important to their success totally agreed evgeny what do you think yeah I don't know I am very skeptical of like Mass adoption using the existing bullet infrastructure and like being skeptical for for a long long time I think at this stage probably coinbase wallet has the best chance of actually capturing a lot of this gifa activity um when it comes to games here it has to be something as much removed from the user like even understanding this blockchain inside of it as possible like not even well forget private Keys it has to be like email password kind of sign with something in the background and then like obviously users face in a always like a risk that somebody will hack into the companies that stores all the stuff and I I don't think we'll be able to get anything better like I I really think it's a pipe dreams that we'll get all people using crypto in 10 20 years to be like self-costed and stuff like I don't think it's happening yeah I mean my favorite very out there form of how do you get people to not have to know they have a private key is you know World coin you know ignore the token but the actual orb isn't a tested sensor right like it takes some physical image generates the low dimensional representation and then that thing has a ckp of it if the proof itself could be your generate your public private key pair then you could basically do everything purely from a tested sensor like I talk into a microphone and with enough samples and plus maybe take an eye scan I generate Biometrics there's no way Biometrics are secure enough to be using them as key material well you can also multiple piece it can be part my point is like the the there are things sure it's like it's it's not just and you know you you already see that with the centralized providers who do NPC who make you do some Biometrics but I I actually think we'll get to a point where you can generate you can deal with the the key pair directly where you can do something such that hey with only my retina I can move a hundred dollars at most but with Retina plus XYZ I can now do more right like like and we're I think you're gonna have this like graded permissioning thing like it seems like that's the best use case and like I said to World coins credit ignore the token stuff but the actual sensor that that there is a lot of value in figuring out I don't know Matt generative AI is getting so good it seems very difficult to be confident that I couldn't replicate your eyeballs or like your irises your voice and your facial features for for ten thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars a million dollars I I agree it's a time with unlimited tries with unlimited tries yeah it's terrible did you see um Westworld season three I think it was where this is not a spoiler and if you're watching and you're really afraid to spoiler just stop watching um the evil robot steals the Billionaire's money by just taking his thumb and putting it on the iPad and it's like transaction completed all your money has been transferred to the evil robots and I was like the whole time I watched that I was like what a crazy scenario in which like a thumbprint is like the private key to like a Billionaire's entire stack of future for sure I I'm not I'm not saying that that like it's Biometrics Alone by any means I'm just more pointing out that the generating of the cryptographic material from the Biometrics is actually different than what we have right now right where it's Biometrics run that a centralized Authority stores say like fire blocks or Anchorage or something uh or coinbase for quantities custody and then they just validate that and when Once that's valid then they you know use keys that they have this is actually generating like ephemeral public private key pairs for your app as a function of yours so it's like the end of the random number or whatever and yeah exactly exactly exactly like there are ways of doing that in such that the user won't even know there's a Public Credit to keep here at all sure sure but then really it's coming down to a trusted third party that has the actual key that no it's verifying your Biometrics the idea is the proof the the the whether it's it might need fhe so like more strong cryptography so that part is not clear but the idea is that the proof generated serves us here as your ephemeral key you don't you don't need the third party like you do now with say like a centralized custodian okay I guess my my thought on this and we we have there's one more story I want to get to but like my thought on this is fundamentally I don't think Biometrics in the long run alone will ever be secure because they're not Secret like you don't go around hiding your irises from people or never speaking in public or never showing people what you look like so face ID even no matter how many things you you combine it with whether it's Iris scans and face ID and voice checks and all these things they work right now because you know I don't even know why they work right now to be honest because all this Tech is basically out there um like years ago we had the tech to be able to basically do uh you know one of the common ways I used to work in anti-fraud at Airbnb before I got into crypto and one of the one of the things that was at that time like 2015 just starting to be state of the art was being able to take like a photo of somebody from a passport and generate 3D video that would pass liveliness detection right so oftentimes you when you're doing kyc they want to prove you're the person the passport they'll say like hold your right arm arm up move it to the center then move it over here whatever this is called liveliness detection try to prove that you didn't just you know create a static image of this person in this in this passport or this driver's license um that is Trivial now like children can can basically generate um you know these uh real-time uh streaming videos that mask you as being somebody else and so all this stuff like the text to defeat all of this is all already here so I I I suspect that we are eventually going to have to fall back to just like old-fashioned Hardware security or some kind of uh you know a sort of chain of trust type thing I don't know or you just get a wallet with every single app and it's zero security and when you get paranoid you go to higher security yeah yeah I I think Biometrics for small dollar about like that for small dollars you have to have some you're gonna have some like system that like automatically figures out what is allowed in permission based on the type of interaction right right now that's so clunky that's actually where I think these app specific like the verticalized thing of like my dap has its own wallet just for this app gets gets it right right because they like they they basically hide a lot of that from you they don't like you don't have to like find half the time right so so the fictional company that we're all investing in that does this for all the apps of the future uh yeah which a Founder who's listening right now is going to create and let us know about biometric Something level two level one is like you know it just is the wallet level you don't even know it's there level two is like you know oh it's a photo of your face it's like this you know security yeah I can I I think as a as part of that ladder of security I think like Biometrics do fit in there as like okay you know you're you're the your mom isn't going to be able to you know just take your you know replicate your face ID um or some random person who steals your phone you know if you just get mugged in the street but um as you're talking about targeted attacks which more and more of what's happening in crypto is really defending against target attacks not man on the street not oh I lost my phone you know on the subway and then someone stole my money increasingly I think this stuff is getting automated it's at scale it's it's entirely software based and remote and that increasingly has to be what your trust model is I think when you're thinking about security okay here's a question for you maybe more of a bet in one year and five years how much do you think bank fraud rates go up because of like say the last year of AI advances right now I don't even know let's just say I'm just asking for relative to now relatives relative okay relative like a percentage increase okay what would you say yeah I mean I don't know like my banking experience was last year decreased so dramatically like it's just so horrible like you can get like blacklisted to get all kinds of questions verifications all the time and I don't know probably it will be worse but can it get any more words than it is now I don't know like it seems like it's already pretty bad on the front side I'll say 0.7 I think it gets a little better I think it goes down you think bank fraud goes down what what is your thesis for why bang fire goes down I think bankfront goes down because things are just becoming I.T companies and it's becoming a larger part of their mission in general and I think the tools that they have are improving so I so I I thought about this a lot back when I was at Airbnb and anti-fraud I was very very bearish on the ability of tech companies to continue fighting fraud because the tools that we fundamentally have like okay if you're a tech company and you're not sure if somebody's account has been stolen or if they're being impersonated or whatever basically the tools that you have are one you can email them and see like do you actually control your email right which increasingly if somebody somebody's owning you they also have your email um you might do a small charge of their credit card you might get them to scan their driver's license or their passport and then the best you might get somebody to call them uh and like have them in video verify that I'm this person here's the driver's license whatever that's what you've got those are the options okay now which of those options do you think is going to survive like the the coming increasingly the increasing automation with which people are going to scrape all your data from all the data dumps that exist of of basically everything about you that you've ever put online Second running this through some kind of AI agent that develops a game plan of how to impersonate you oh third developing the video developing the audio synthesizing a fake uh passport or driver's license and and doing all that like the only thing they really need is your email right but this is why non-specialists will get crushed random tech companies are going to get crushed by this right I think banks are best equipped to be the ones I don't know how well banks are equipped to do right I think they're just one of the affordances I think maybe in India they do I think there are certain places where they've installed in India's infrastructure India is a different India is like ironically like in the way that people in the US used to be like wow all the cell phones in Japan and Korea are like 100 times better India's Financial infrastructure is unreal like the government open sourcing all of the basically making their own blockchain and having Key Management standards and like all of the stuff that's interoperable that every fintech uses that is obviously like 10 years in the future for all the Western countries because they're basically digital systems that like don't have that much incentive to change but I would argue that I think I think you you'll see a significant increase maybe like 20 to 50 percent um relative to where it is now because I basically think all the generative AI stuff just made the barrier to entry to fraud lower right like way so much lower so much lower so much lower that like I how could it not like there's clearly going to be some Pope Bank in Podunk middle of nowhere who's outsourced the kyc to some company that like barely exists or got bought by a private Equity Firm and doesn't update any of their liveness checks and can be now a 15 year old can like um you know kind of take advantage of it there's a really good article in Bloomberg about a Sim swap recently a quite sophisticated Sim swap um and I I think the gender of AI stuff is only going to make that go up I think the reason Sim swapping is also getting easier is partially some of these types of voice transmutation stuff yeah it's scary time uh I hope that crypto at least plays some part in protecting us from well I think this hopefully is the reason people will be like oh actually that cryptocurrency stuff they thought about this [ __ ] before we did it's a good thing it's a good thing we're here it's a good thing we're here to save the world uh well okay we have to we have to end the show because we're up on time and we gotta run but uh thanks so much of Guinea for coming on and sharing your insights with us and for now signing off [Music]
