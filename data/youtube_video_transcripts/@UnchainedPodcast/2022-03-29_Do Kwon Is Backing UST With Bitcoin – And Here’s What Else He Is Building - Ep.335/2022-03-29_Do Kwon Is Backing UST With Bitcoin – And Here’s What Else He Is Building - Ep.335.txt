hi all in recent press interviews or at book signings and speaking engagements people have been asking what's next for me now that my book is out well i'm happy that i'm finally able to announce what i'll be working on today law and crime the leading live trial and true crime network and i announced that we will be collaborating on an investigative podcast series that explores the case of ilya lichtenstein and heather morgan the couple who have been accused of attempting to launder 4.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin the series will be a deep dive into the story to understand the married couple at the center of it how they allegedly attempted to launder the bitcoin stolen from bitfinex and then to look more closely at the clues that led to their arrest i'm thrilled to be partnering with law and crime to tell this tale about stolen bitcoin with the depth and level of detail it deserves it will be a fascinating journey not only into the lives of this couple that has already captivated the internet but into how blockchain sleuthing enabled the government to track them down we have a press release out about it today which you can read on law and crime so if you're interested in learning more check out the unchained daily newsletter today and tomorrow and or my twitter feed also as usual i have upcoming book events for my book tour so you can also find these at

heads up everyone that when i asked doe to come on the show he requested that we focus on new applications he's working on because he was tired of answering the same questions all the time and since i'm doing so many press interviews for my book and i'm also being asked the same questions all the time i actually agreed to that we did however that obviously we would need to cover some basics on tara and ust so that people wouldn't be lost and they would understand you know what his project's about is and and all that i just wanted to make it clear kind of like why this interview may not cover as much territory as i would typically cover in an interview however for those who want to hear more from dough he did appear on the chopping block last week so make sure to check out that episode okay so i'm just going to start with some exposition so we can you know make sure everybody's up to speed but also you know minimize the amount of time that you spend talking about this stuff so you can feel free to tweak anything that i say but as i mentioned before you're the co-founder of terraform labs and that has built the terra ecosystem and the terra ecosystem is probably best known for its algorithmic stable coins such as ust which is pegged to the us dollar but now you have other protocols also built on top such as mirror which offers synthetic assets on things like stocks including u.s stocks or there's anchor which is like a savings platform and it currently offers yield of almost 20 percent but don't we start the discussion about your main stable coin ust because you recently had big news about changes you were going to make about how it's being backed and it used to be that in order to mint say 10 ust you would have to burn 10 worth of luna which is the staking token of tara but obviously you changed how that works so why don't you explain what the new system is for people sure so as a refresher for people that um you know are not intimately familiar with how pair works is that the idea is that um in order to mint one tera usd which is a stable coin pegged to one us dollar you need to burn a dollar's worth of luna in order to do so and then on the other side of the trade if you're looking to redeem one tera usd you can trade it into the blockchain and get a dollar's worth of luna back in return so the idea is that luna as the staking asset expands and contracts the supply to absorb the demand volatility for tera stable points uh we've had some pretty good success with this so terra usb is currently the fourth largest naval plane in the world uh at roughly around 16 billion dollars in market cap and um by i think within a relatively recent future uh looking at his current growth trajectory i think it's going to be number three relatively soon so we recently made announcements uh whereby we're bootstrapping a large decentralized forex reserve in the form of bitcoin so we've initially seeded this reserve with about three billion dollars uh in assets and we're in the process of converting all those exogenous assets into bitcoin and then we have plans to grow this to some meaningful percentage of usd market cap within the next year and why did you decide to make that change well so a couple of things so the first is algorithmic stable coins so a system whereby luna absorbs demand volatility through ust is reasonably robust and as luna market cap grows is going to get more and more robust but it also has the downside that in sort of drastic changes in demand you could lead to that spiral situations where you know the price of luna is falling at the same time as the money supply usb contract in the beginning when tara was you know focusing on a limited number of use cases where you know the largest developer on the terra ecosystem was platform labs which was the company that i founded but now it's actually one of the largest ecosystems in the world so by tdl it's the second largest uh smart contract platform after ethereum by usership it's probably like around that rank and then the number of applications that are being built on terra ranges from let's say leveraged applications to options to forex to you know interest rate swaps to dog coins like dogecoin and so many different things that it becomes harder and harder to reason about the demand volatility for terra stable points there's also lots of pair stable phones that have been exported to different blockchains like uh for example ust is the largest used and the largest pdl and the most frequently used pool on curve finance on ethereum for instance the largest one of the largest on saber on solana one of the largest on trader joe and pangolin on avalanche so all combined sort of the size of the economy that is being built on paris cable coins is becoming larger and less predictable so it stands to reason that similar to how a lot of export-based economies uh in the real world provision forex reserves to sort of control the short-term demand fluctuations in its currency it became a natural choice for terah to provision its own forex reserve as well except you know in in line with what we're trying to do here it made sense to do this in a decentralized fashion by setting up smart contracts against which people can trade in bitcoin to mint more ust and vice versa redeem usd against bitcoin so we're going to explore that a little bit more but i also want to understand so since previously it was luna essentially that was backing ust now what will be the role for luna going forward well so you can think about this as a fractional forex reserve right so in the sense that before in order to mint ontario usd you were burning a dollar's worth of luna now it's going to be a little bit different whereby uh when you mint one tara usd some luna is going to get burned and some luna is going to be used to provision this decentralized forex reserve so you can think about like a portion of ust senior age going to provision a large uh reserve of exogenous assets like bitcoin so basically you know what i read was that when people i guess are kind of exiting tara that they can either redeem that for one dollars worth of usd they could redeem that for one dollars worth of luna or 99 cents dollars worth of btc but that you guys will try to oh well actually i don't know this part if you're trying to maintain the reserves at like roughly 60 luna and 40 btc or if it's just that because there's some ratio there around you know 60 of luna uh i guess what it is what is it you're burning 60 of luna and then using 40 of that to buy btc or something can you yeah so it's it's not a reserve ratio per se it's it's more that you know when usd is being minted some ratio which we don't know yet it could be 40 be higher or lower would be used to acquire bitcoin so it's as if like ustc rage is being used to build up btc reserves okay and so then that rate that ratio will be flexible based on whatever other factors and will it be the doubt right bitcoin volatility oh bitcoin volatility and will it be the dow that decides that ratio or oh okay oh interesting because oftentimes you know these proposals can take a while so how flexible and and quick do you think they'll be able to react to market volatility well so uh for example if we build up bitcoin reserves at around like 40 uh of senior inch here's what i think about it so first is i i think it'll take rare events for ust supply to contract about 40 in a short time time period so at a 40 reserve rate show i feel like we would be collateralizing more than we need to especially because the core stability mechanism is still luna but what the bitcoin reserves will play a part in doing is that it will prevent that spirals because it would drastically slow down the pace by which we knew luna is being minted to facilitate redemptions second i think in a long-term arc uh we plan to be one of the largest if not the largest um single wallet holder bitcoin the tara protocol itself and i think over the long arc the price of bitcoin is is going to do well so i think the reserve ratio that we end up with in in the long term is going to be a lot higher than the reserve uh ratio that we paid for at acquisition yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense but then within kind of a shorter time frame maybe like from year to year since obviously bitcoin can be quite volatile against usd and also since crypto assets overall tend to be correlated with each other um how would that affect the stability of ust yeah so i i would say from um if i were to put in my uh financial planner the worst case would be if we were buying bitcoin now and then a crash happened six months later and it's correlated with uh a massive fall in the demand for ust then we would have paid for bitcoin that we would allow redemptions for at a much cheaper price right so this sort of coincidence of three different events coming together is going to be negative but the expected value so i mean like applying probabilistic reasoning i think you know massive contractuals from ust it gets less and less in terms of the total outstanding market cap of usd over time and i think it's not something that's that happens so frequently as as well as you know like massive drop in bitcoin so i i'm sort of betting that the long-term scenario of bitcoin going up and the reserves being strong enough to withstand usp demand drops is more likely scenario huh okay that's really interesting and it it makes sense though so somebody on twitter when i asked what questions i should ask you tweeted why does he feel the need to buy bitcoin to back luna shouldn't luna be solid enough based on the services provided it shows a lack of faith in the product but it's more what you were saying that you can end up in these like downward spirals or yeah what's your response to that well so there's an economic argument why sort of diversifying the types of collateral that can protect uh ust is is the sound strategy but i think a second dimension that hasn't been actively discussed is the diplomatic argument and the reason is so terra's goal is to be the largest decentralized money in crypto period it is not to is its goal is not to be the largest stable coin in the terra blockchain so we're sort of expanding into let's say the sauna ecosystem avalanche uh ethereum polygon so we plan to be everywhere where there are developers and users now the thing is different from growing stablecoin demand in the terra ecosystem itself where trust in ust is extremely high uh when you go to and expand to these different ecosystems then faith in luna's collateral luna's you know fitness this collateral is a lot less than what it is like in the terry ecosystem but if you have bitcoin as collateral then nobody in crypto really questions it because it is the apex that said it has the sound this monetary policy it has the most lindy so it builds valuable bridges to be able to be a more neutral asset as we expand across chain yeah that makes a lot of sense but one thing is that so if the luna foundation guard or lfg is then using the bitcoin to keep the peg and it's a centralized entity then how does that affect the decentralization of ust yeah so that's a good question so uh lfc is a vehicle that we put together in order to facilitate the initial capital formation of this uh bitcoin reserve and to fund research such that we can have credible bridging options from bitcoin to terra right but ultimately how this reserve system is going to going to look like is that it's going to be a smart contract which houses bitcoin that's been bridged over to terra and then people can mint unst against it by depositing wrapped bitcoin at their bridge bitcoin and the vice versa they can redeem usd against it similar to how you would trade against enamel so it's it's similar to wrapped bitcoin on ethereum than where there is a centralized entity or did i misunderstand that no so we're you know evaluating trust minimize bridges in a way that you know wbtc have doesn't have those properties so because it's basically a multi-sig held by bitco whereas for this we're we're exploring mainly uh like client-based solutions oh okay okay right yeah but obviously at the moment i think bridges are just an area where there's sometimes security concerns yeah so what what are your thoughts on that how to keep that secure i i think the biggest problem with bridges now is because there is a competitive dynamic where you need to support as many layer ones as quickly as possible right so that leads to situations where a lot of the vision teams can't spend time on core infrastructure because it's a land grab right now right so the bridge that connects to as many ecosystems as possible and facilitates as much bridging transfers are going to win because it's incredibly difficult to remove under lock-in uh once a certain bridge has a lot of market share so which incentivizes a lot of these bridging teams to spend most of your time on integrations and business development rather than sort of making sure that the core infrastructure is secure i think that is the fundamental problem with bridges today but having said that that doesn't mean that there is an inherent problem with trying to build a secure bridge from bitcoin to a smart contract platform especially if you remove a lot of the needs from that competitive dynamic from the equation okay yeah i think we'll have to see how that develops so someone else was also saying that they felt that it would be disruptive to luna to buy so much bitcoin so how do you expect all of this to affect the price of luna yeah so uh one of the common criticisms that we heard is well if before you were burning a dollar's worth of luna for every dollar of usd that's milted and now we're burning 60 cents of luna for every dollars worth of usd that's minted then doesn't that mean that less value is accrued to luna and i think the answer is likely going to be no uh and that's because even though the total share of the collateralization effect from minting ust is lessened through this change i think overall we would be able to grow the pie of people that are willing to transact and hold ust across multiple different blockchains to a magnitude that wouldn't have been possible if usp only had one collateral counterparty right so by adding bitcoin i think we'd be able to win the hearts and minds of a lot more people in crypto and a lot more users than just just doing the solo so i think the overall pie is going to get larger even though uh the size that luna would capture could potentially go down and have you noticed that a lot of bitcoiners got very interested in in what you were doing and maybe you are interested in participating in the tarot ecosystem because of that so if you look at my twitter inbox now it looks like the bitcoin talks before and so what are people saying generally like it or not i think the bitcoin community is the largest across solar crypto it covers the widest possible audience uh it so like the bitcoin community might be less active on twitter because uh there are lots of people that use bitcoin love bitcoin might not you know work on it full time but i think one of the things that bitcoin has been needing is that there's a lot that has been said comparing bitcoin to ethereum and then thinking about what's going to be more valuable long-term and then the idea is that ethereum is more useful there's more things that you can do with it so eventually it's going to flip bitcoin so a lot of people think this way but i think precisely what gives bitcoin as value is the is the fact that it's calcified and it's very slow to change to innovation right similar to how well but like if you look at ethereum right it changes less quickly than some of the other smart contract platforms but it still changes all the time right and it's newer it doesn't really have the same founding myth it doesn't have you know the same lindy effect that bitcoin does so it's significantly a less credibly mutual asset right so i think from that perspective uh there's a large and huge bitcoin community that respects that value system understands you know the credible neutralness of the bitcoin as an asset class but what has been lacking is sort of a credible layer too if you think about it because bitcoin is still very difficult to use it's still very difficult to weave into smart contracts and in terra it gets that not only does bitcoin become a reserve currency for terra usd right but it also gets a layer two on which it can be bridged and used across a multitude of different applications spanning from you know let's say other dials that are building ontario to nfts to d5 and i think the possibilities of that are quite interesting because now bitcoin only needs to be really good at being one thing being an asset and in terms of all the expressivity the the transaction capabilities the throughput all those things can happen on there and is the main diff because i do feel like there were bitcoiners who weren't very happy about the amount of bitcoin that was being used in d5 on ethereum but is the difference there that that primarily was you know being held by this centralized custodian is that why they're kind of more open to this than they were to the other uh version happening on ethereum i think the primary thing that those bitcoiners didn't like about that was that it was being done on ethereum one oh and and two yeah i think the fact that it had a centralized custodian has something to do with it but i also think there's a you know healthy segment of bitcoin has thought that you know bringing wbtc into theorem was a positive change and out of curiosity this goes back to the security question but i realized so at the moment um you guys have already bought three billion dollars worth of bitcoin as far as i understand so how is that being secured so the luna foundation guard uh has a you know has a council of about seven people so it's secured in a multi-sig held by the council members oh oh i see okay and then you're gonna figure out kind of how to use it in a more trustless way as you go like at some point in the future correct okay and then how have you been purchasing the bitcoin in a way where that you know i'm sure you're trying to do it where you're not affecting the price it's a it's an ongoing program so i'm i'm gonna try to say less but let's just say that we try to purchase bitcoin whenever opportunity arises okay okay all right it makes sense to me that you don't want to reveal all your secrets there so and then actually just to go back to the bridging one other thing so do you have a timeline of when you think that you know whatever your plan is will be fully deployed yeah so uh we're actually going to put out a request for proposal uh today on agora which is terra's research form and uh we're going to look for proposals from projects that are already looking at bitcoin bridging solutions so there's a number uh that focuses on specifically this problem so there's axler and the cosmos equal system so they have bridges to different chains but um they first sort of you know came to market with this idea that you can bring bitcoin into cosmos um also there's no mcbtc uh which is working in a similar problem that we were reached out to from the folks at block stacks yeah as a community we'll evaluate some of these solutions and then i i think in the beginning we'll try to dip our toes in with um diversified distribution across several different version solutions and then but i think over time we'll see one or two that rests up so one thing was that i noticed in the announcement or or maybe in a blog post or somewhere that the reason given for purchasing bitcoin as collateral was that it was uncorrelated to tara and i think um you said that over time the reserve would be stocked with other uncorrelated assets so what other assets do you have in mind and how will you make those decisions about which ones to include well so like earlier i i noted that building exogenous forex reserves is driven as much by diplomatic arguments as by economic ones right so i think it makes sense that as we expand into different chains if we sort of build a system whereby some portion of usd is being used to acquire native staking assets of those chains the impact is i think we'll be able to buy a lot of goodwill and user comfort uh with that because well this is for obvious reasons oh so but you're thinking crypto assets then cryptocus yes oh okay it sounds like whatever chains you end up bridging to those would be kind of prime candidates yeah so i'm kind of thinking that the vast majority of the value would be in bitcoin but um i think there should be still small you know forex reserves on each of the smart contract platforms against which you can mint and redeem in native staking assets because the user experience of that is much more friendly right so for example if you're trying to mint on solana for instance like you don't want to have to bridge bitcoin over and then like luna over and then try to make something well like if you can just like burn solana and then mint ust then that's um that's a very friendly user experience yeah it's much easier so in terms of these assets in the luna foundation guard reserve you know obviously bitcoin and then whatever else you add what will you be doing with that will you be lending it at all or rehypothecating it in any way or you know what are your thoughts there no we wouldn't touch it until um the reserve system is ready to go ready to go no but i mean when it so when it is ready to go then it will only be i guess used um for like minting and redeeming or will you be doing anything additional with it so yeah it wouldn't be deployed it would just be put into like the easiest way of thinking about it is that once the bridging is ready uh and then we're working on a very special type of decks it's kind of like a virtual a m whereby you can deposit usp and then deposit bitcoin and people can trade against it so once that's done we will deposit and we will look to burn the keys once we feel like operating keys are no longer necessary wait i don't know if i fully understand you're saying that this is the bitcoin that's being put up as the reserve you're gonna essentially use it like as the liquidity pool on a dex so um how this system works is that we're going to set up a special smart contract into which it's going to accept two pools it's going to accept a pool of usd and it's going to accept a pool of bitcoin and then the orc was going to be streaming prices in terms of what the effective prices of bitcoin at that given moment in time so at any point people can mint usp so retrieve the ust from this pool by depositing bitcoin at an exchange rate uh of what the workforce is telling us at par value and on the redemption side you will be able to deposit usd back and then retrieve bitcoin at uh 99 of par so by enforcing some small spread on the redemption side you can make sure that the reserves only kick in when there's a depending event on usd oh oh i see now oh this is very fascinating and then just to go back actually when we were talking about additional assets who would decide which assets get added to the reserve would that be the dow or would it be just like deals you make with those chains or how would you be deciding that so actually after we launched lft these are very opinionated people and then um they they come from various different places and from the terrebook uh from the ecosystem but also people that are from like sit somewhere in between right so we've gotten a ton of proposals uh some people offering to negotiate you know some discount deal with um some other foundations or there's like a really good market opportunity for this asset because it seems cheap right now but uh we haven't been able to reach quorum on buying anything else besides bitcoin so far you mean in the dow or like among the multi-stakeholders or who who's in the quorum uh so among the multi-stakeholders okay um so let's talk about anchor currently it pays out interest of almost 20 and obviously we've seen in recent weeks there are a number of people including crypto investors such as polychain capital and arca that are concerned that this interest rate is not sustainable what do you think of that opinion and then what factors would have to be in place for you to think that it's time to lower that yield well so the definition of sustainability is the extent to which something can be sustained well so another way of putting this is that when we first launched anchor the really interesting story is that most people that we spoke to said that nineteen percent is too low they believe that because that was back during a time in early 2021 when you could still get like 100 200 apr on stablecoin tools so the idea was that no you guys are not going to get any markets here with 19 because this is too boring in d5 like you guys are still like thinking in the mindset of traditional finance companies like you can't be well fargo anymore like you everything needs to be in triple digits to catch attention and um so we heard that but we saw a future in which the yields could come down in the future where like you know when the demand for leverage collapses then that case uh during this sort of bearish market you know like yields would converge to something that you see in traditional finance plus some risk premium and that's what that's exactly what we have today and now people are saying the same people actually that said 20 is too low are now saying that 19 is unsustainable and it's not so much that 19 needs to be held in perpetuity that is definitely not the goal but if you're asking the question of whether anchor can be a valuable tool and sort of modulating this sort of volatility in uh leverage demand in crypto to offer something that is a a rate of growth right so 20 is definitely higher than what you would get in other stablecoin tools but at the same time it's something that we can you know responsibly bring down slowly over some period of time then i think the answer is yes and what kind of when like what would need to be happening for you to think that okay now is the time to lower it so actually uh recently there was a i think a governance proposal on anchor whereby the anchor rate is changing to a dynamically calibrated rate so the idea is that every month the protocol will take assessment of the change in this in the size of the yield reserve month over month and uh it would change the anchor rate by the change in that delta so for example if the yield reserve goes down by five percent then it would lower the anchor rate by five percent uh well five percent of the twenty so that would be like one percent right and vice versa if the yield reserve has been operating at a surplus then it would slightly increase the anchor rate to something that's more reasonable so that allows the protocol to calibrate itself to a state where it can reasonably operate at a surplus over some long period of time but at the same time the changes aren't so drastic because the the maximum rate of change that can happen over that month is a relatively small number okay okay that sounds interesting and so anchored now has uh also launched an avalanche have you decided to move to any additional chains and will you have the same yield on all the chains yeah so the the yield opportunity on the lending side is going to be consistent across all the chains so we just went live on avalanche we're going live on with um bonded adam and bonda solana i think over the next couple weeks and then we'll be following that up with uh polygon oh okay all right joe you made it through all the the questions that i have and now we can talk about app stuff but we will first get a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

wanted to talk about the new apps you're building in tara right now so i'm just gonna like give you your pick what new app would you like to talk about so i mean they're not apps uh so to speak but so i'm spending a lot of time i i mean so i i sort of think about myself as kind of a toy maker so i i find i find the most happiness when i'm thinking about like some new thing that can happen in crypto and still hasn't happened yet so that sort of zero to one stage is the the most fascinating to me and uh like tara is really interesting running tfl is less interesting so but it's like it's uh yeah yeah so well anyway so one of the things that i've been thinking about is um especially now that the rest of default has gotten really boring uh as you know leverage command has shot to almost zero um i'm starting to think about like what it's going to take to turn defy speculation and to route it to productive use cases potential answer here is sponsorable labor markets it has a couple of components but if you look at most styles right up until recently they were throwing hundreds of millions or billions of dollars away to incentivize liquidity but that's sort of a i think a secondary order initiative like ultimately what dallas wants is more people to build on their blockchains to build on their apps to build more front ends so essentially they want support developers but they're taking an indirect way of getting there by incentivizing liquidity instead of developer participation and vice versa from the perspective of open source developers they are massively incentivized to just fork existing projects and not add to the existing innovation because the economics of launching a new project and printing a coin is way higher than working with an existing project because there isn't like a scalable labor market that can work with their incentives right so what if you had fungible labor markets so what i mean is what if somebody can put up their productive hours for sale and it can trade on a deck like in a mn for instance um and then adal can go out and say hey look i'm going to buy a million hours of productive developer time and i'm going to give all the apps in the ecosystem the the right to redeem these time tokens so in that case like somebody could go to avalon for instance and say uh hey look i'm going to put my developer hours on sale diablo is going to buy a lot of it and then i can spend my time doing open source contribution to let's say trader joe's or pangolin or defrost finance and i could have a lot of fun doing it while at the same time being fairly compensated for the work that i'm doing that is efficiently priced by the market an interesting side product of this that i think is even more interesting is that now once you have fungible labor you can put this as collateral to borrow money against it so it would sort of be the first case whereby you can transition defy from from pure speculative money play into something that efficiently allocates capital to productive use cases and the most productive use case for crypto might add which is uh the labor output of open source developers huh okay i feel like i need to unpack this a little bit so tell me if i got this right basically a dow would like there would be an amm but it would be for developer hours and then a dao would kind of like purchase that but then you're saying that that would be used as collateral to make loans because so my my first reaction is like if something is going to happen in the future to put it up to obtain an asset right now when you don't even know if you have the other thing like that's a little bit first of all to my mind that's risky but second also i guess like my other thought is so if if a developer is going to just be working across these different chains you know there there is something to institutional memory like you know if you kind of specialize in ethereum or um terra or whatever then there's just like certain [Music] kind of idiosyncrasies i would imagine in the code for like the different protocols or whatever that the more you learn that the more you build on it then the bigger benefit that you get and also the more valuable you are to that protocol so those are kind of maybe two questions that i have about about what you're saying well to answer your first question i think this is quite similar through people being able to take out loans against their paychecks right so for example if you are a lawyer or like if you work for a fortune 500 company then it becomes much easier to take out a loan from a bank whereas for me i could go to a bank every bank in the country and i'll be turned down turned down by every single one because i'm not considered to have like an actual job right so i'm sure that's not true but anyway okay you probably have your net worth but anyway whatever not important well the idea is that if you are able to prove an on-chain track record of you know various different companies of a blockchain ecosystem that are willing to redeem uh your hourly tokens at some rate right then and all of that is recorded on chain then it stands to reason that a lending protocol like let's say like mars or compound or ave can take those time tokens as collateral to issue you alone right and how these zones could be liquidated is that well if you have a proven track record of being a successful developer and a lot of people are willing to bid for your time this lending protocol could now sell off your time tokens for cheap and you would essentially be working for less money than you used to before and then the lending protocol can successfully protect against their downside risk huh okay this is interesting now it makes more sense i mean i do think yeah that there's like two ones in that market of getting money early from your paycheck you know you're right like a lawyer doctor probably will be able to take out a big loan to buy a house or whatever but then for instance i know of some of those programs where essentially i'm pretty sure it's like lower salary workers who as they're working they can get their next paycheck so they don't have to wait every two you know for every two weeks or every month or whatever um and then it just sort of feels like a little risky like they're not managing their money very well that's why they need to do that they're like living a little too close to paycheck to paycheck but anyway okay so that's fascinating but so you're thinking about trying to create such a market yeah so uh it's one of the things that i'm spending a lot of time uh working on like you can also build things on top of this that are really interesting right so you can build on uh some notion of credit uh because uh what we didn't have in 2017 that we do have now is people spend a lot more time trying to curate their own chain behavior than they used to before and i think a large there's there's two contributing factors like number one we have better on-chain analytics so you don't want to do anything like sketch or weird that gets you like zack xbt on twitter or something like that and and second there's airdrops right so you have a bunch of air drops that are being used to distribute wealth of early protocols to as many users as possible the the only way that people are sort of doing curation now is trying out lots of different d5 protocols but what they actually should be doing and what protocol should be doing is that they should be curating their airdrops based on past behavior of of something that they want to accomplish so for example for an nft white list they might look at the how the wallet holders have interacted with previous nft white lists and have they dumped the nft right after are they willing to you know like hold it for a long period of time or for example for like protocols like maker dow or ave or compound they might sort of create a priority queue of liquidators based on their previous history of how long they were willing to hold on to the beta risk of the assets that they've acquired so for example for maker if they participate in a liquidation and then they got either at a cheaper price and they're willing to hold it instead of dumping it to the market right away then maybe this person gets uh gets a higher place in the priority queue so you can sort of see create a positive flywheel of effects whereby you incentivize people to exhibit good on-chain behavior because now you have this sort of wealth distribution through air drops and um some scarce resource in crypto like an fty list and liquidations starting to pref users that exhibit this good behavior and i think it's like a virtuous cycle that goes on and on i find that really interesting but then but how does that relate to the functional labor markets or is that just a separate idea oh so for example like you can apply this idea to like the functional labor markets as well so if you're taking a more shall we say like if if ethereum wins we all win type of outlook or if like luna wins we all win type of outlook in that case you can start to give out preferable long terms to people that exhibit this positive uh good citizen behavior on chain right like if you don't if you don't care about that then if if you don't believe that your ability to pay a loan has anything to do with you being a good citizen that's fine too but you can still look at on-chain behavior of how you are spending the capital that you borrow right so for example if you're taking out a loan to go gig along on luna then probably your value ratio should be lower right so if you're if you're borrowing money against your future time and your giga longing well luna is like one thing if you're you're giga longing on like ghost pawn then your ltv should definitely be lower than somebody that takes a loan and then uses it to you know like buy something interesting huh okay and i'm sure you've seen on twitter in recent days that there's just a lot of chatter about what dev salary should be especially for people working on the core protocol at these different layer ones what are your thoughts on that and how do you think this fungible labor market idea could affect that so i think traditionally if you look at the best detour practices why of course i'm not an expert here but um i the way that i think about it is the expected utility output of a very strong individual contributor for a very successful company protocol is generally the same or higher than somebody that takes on a lot of risks and jumps to building their own thing that's how you incentivize best talent to stay uh like in your protocol or in your dow or in your company as versus like striking out and doing their own thing right and the way that you do this doesn't mean necessarily that you need to pay more than somebody that raises like a series b for a start but it's the idea that from a risk-adjusted return perspective like you actually don't need money after some threshold right so you definitely don't want to underpay people but at the same time like if you pay them top dollar then it doesn't actually matter to them like whether to make a little bit more money after that right so i i think returns from an absolute basis should correspond to the amount of risk that people are taking but at the same time like you i think you need to be cognizant that if you're paying above market then usually people don't care right but then so you feel like this functional labor market would make things more efficient or like what do you how do you think that that would affect how much devs are being paid i think it would make pay more cyclical which means that during a time when there is a lot of demand to to build various things for dows i can see developer salaries going up to something ridiculous right so the types of things that you see in sort of traditional employment markets like wage stickiness that doesn't apply anymore because uh daos would just be on like like a buying spree for the very best top talent and there wouldn't be any sort of institutions or structures that prevents wage stickiness from from forming right so you would be able to see some people getting paid like five million dollars like 10 million dollars because they have what it takes so for example if you were trying to hire bonteg for instance from your finance and let's say that this market existed in 2021 or 2020 in that case i think his salary would have been like above that for sure you know but you would also be able to see you know demand for time tokens going down if in a specific sector there's more people that are willing to supply the same unit of labor right right but right now on crypto yeah definitely that's not the case i feel like there's a lot more demand we're definitely far off from from that day so i don't know is there any more that you wanted to add about these thoughts that you're having and and building the fungible like labor market like are you actively trying to build something like that right now or is this just something you've been kind of noodling on in your head i actually have the guy that's working on staying with me right now he's like behind this wall but it's yeah it's a project called chronos finance and um he's um he actually used to be like a founding member at tfl um and uh usually i had a research but like you know we put together a student fund recently and he's built a team out here and we're chipping at it pretty frequently interesting okay so maybe we'll start to see more freelance devs who are paid via some tokenized marketplace so i don't know if you have other apps that you want to talk about but i did actually want to ask you on thor about thor chain you know kind of where you saw that in the broader ecosystem and you know kind of why uh luna is integrating with that and like where you think that would go so i think the market that door chain is tapping into is absolutely massive and it's one of those things that really do need to exist in the crypto space and the reason for this is you know even today like if you wanted to trade bitcoin the only real way to do it is to go to go through centralized intermediaries right so if you're not comfortable with bitco custodianship of your bitcoin then there isn't really a way to trade any of this launching but the thing is if you have a decentralized exchange that are credibly crushing right bridges to all the major protocols and then you can trade bitcoin and all the other uh utxo assets in in a credible way with low slippage then it becomes massively exciting right then in that case it sort of takes uh the business model of most of the major centralized spot exchanges the issue i i feel like is it's very difficult to compete on a cost basis in terms of supervision trading fees on what centralized exchanges are willing to offer and number two i think the market is definitely very excited but it's a little bit cautious given some of the you know the security issues that have happened to torching uh last year so i think it's going to take a little bit of time to build that trust back but once they do i think door chain is going to be like one of the most major uh one one of the most important institutions um and so is that why lfg is not using thor chain now or would it might it in the future once the security issues are really kind of squared away or what are your thoughts on that well so i am personally very bullish on door chain and i think it's very important but the money that the council is managing for lfe we can't spend it based on personal sets of beliefs right so we need to be objective and look at things and i guess it's very hard to justify objectively parking you know billions of dollars in the door chain just quite yet right but i think over time as there's less security incidents and people build more faith and the ability for fortune to bridge over i think that's definitely in the auction space okay so in terms of apps on terra i mean it's like a burgeoning ecosystem you know i looked at something i think um someone in your community tweeted about all the applications being built so are there any other ones that you wanted to chat about well it's just that curiosity which ones did you take a look at well it was more i mean there were so many so all i did was just note i mean you have ones across lending derivatives dexes wallets obviously synthetics you know stable coins gambling social stuff gaming savings and payments tooling yield farming i mean there's so much asset management insurance so it's like it's just like a whole ecosystem right now so i don't know i mean within that there were literally probably i don't know a few hundred on that image that i saw i don't know if there are any other particular ones that you want to talk about yeah so there's a couple that you know that stood out to me is very interesting so uh prism protocol is is very interesting because um it's it's one of those primitives that allow d5 yields to become more responsible if you if you may so it's kind of a interest rate swap protocol so the idea is that if you put in any yield bearing asset into the prism smart contract it gives you two derivatives so one of them is called the p asset which gives you exposure to the principle and the second is called the y asset which gives you physical delivery of the yield of the yield bearing asset on a monthly basis so if you wanted to lever up and get exposure to only let's say the yield potential of luna or an lp token on astroport then you would you know put those lp tokens or luna into the prism smart contract get two tokens and then sell the p luna token and then buy more while luna tokens so that you get leveraged exposure to just for you if you don't care about the yield and you wanted leveraged exposure to luna's principal value accumulation over time then you mint them uh sell wai luna and then just buy more peeling and i'm sorry what was the name of that one prison protocol oh okay that's super fascinating yeah i feel like uh definitely it would appeal it's probably to both there's like two different types of people that it would appeal to so i like that so one other thing i wanted to ask you about was south korea which you know which which is where you're from just elected a new president who's pro crypto what impact do you see that having on terra and on crypto in general um as far as i understand i do think that you moved out of korea i'm not actually sure for what the reason is for that i think you're now based in singapore but obviously korea has been a huge market for crypto it's got major adoption in that country so it's just curious for your thoughts on what that signified what's been interesting in this presidential cycle was that both major candidates were like a third of their sometime was being spent on talking about crypto which is super fascinating but at the same time it's not surprising it's not surprising given that a third of the population in korea either hold or trade crypto so that's crazy so if you look at i i think like the mau for update it's like 10 million 10 million users or something at a population basis of about 45 million so which is crazy that's crazy like you had one of the major presidential candidates minting nfts right and i think they got somebody from hash to help help help them out with that or something and then airdrop them to people that showed up to rallies or you know sent in campaign donations or things like that and then the the president-elect uh one of his most important campaign promises was to delay uh introducing crypto taxes for another year so now uh there will be no crypto taxes for another two years this is exactly why i keep telling my publisher they need to do a korean edition of my book but anyway keep going yeah so korea is a really interesting market right so most koreans got into crypto i think around the bull market of 2017 and there's a lot of fresh entrants that enter the market since so they actually don't really understand the provenance of you know bitcoin or ethereum so they don't understand why these assets have more lindy effect especially because most of the literature and the discussions that have been made around bitcoin and ethereum are are in a foreign language so it's a little bit different from china which you know the core of that crypto base are miners right which got them very early so they understand why bitcoin is powerful why they're in this powerful why some other points are powerful but if you look at the top charts on update it's actually not like you know bitcoin or ethereum or even luna that's you know that that is the highest volume on any given day on a bit usually especially if the markets are bullish you would have like this green  coin that you've never heard of it could be actually like what okay this is hilarious so one of the korean projects was called seven ships or something like that and the the reason why it was called seven ships was that there was a famous korean general back in like the 1400s or something that defeated an armada of japanese invaders with just seven ships and the idea was that in this day and age where there's hundreds of foreign crypto projects that are uh outlining the front page of update we are gonna be like that you know like freedom fighter general that bought back all the foreign invaders and that thing pumped like there were billions of dollars i don't know uh in trading volume for seven ships at one point and if you look at what the project actually does is hilarious so they create these um cooling machines that look like the ships that the general used back in the day and then they plant this very special type of flower that only grows in cheshire island and the idea is that you would use uh the heat that is coming from bitcoin miners and use that to fuel this little like flower thing which can only grow in tropical climates right so that's like mind-blowingly stupid but that just did incredibly well oh my god oh no i hope a lot of people i'm sure a lot of i guess a lot of people probably lost money on that everybody lost money yes oh no oh boy i'm surprised that koreans are still so enthusiastic after something like that well so the the reason why crypto is so popular in korea is because the other investable asset classes are so heavily regulated for example if you look at real estate they've started to cut down on the ability for people to take out loans to purchase houses because they want to keep the price of housing low but what that also means is that it creates a massive entry barrier for people that want to buy houses because unless you have the ability to drop like a million dollars in a house so you can't buy anything right and then if you look at the stock market the only thing worth buying is samsung right and for all the other stuff it's like yeah i mean like you understand like stock market is just not as attractive in lots of other markets outside the united states so um you can invest in something but generally it doesn't go up like what the s p 500 goes up and if you are making a strong directional bet 33 of the stock market is basically samsung so you're betting all your eggs on just one company which is very risky so uh crypto being you know not having those you know like regulatory safeguards and you know people haven't stepped in yet to try to curb in this industry and in some sense it's like fundamentally very difficult to do like you can't try to regulate bitcoin for instance or try to make bitcoin less successful just from the perspective of one smaller nation state so which is why a lot of people got very excited about the asset class and started to a pin at scale and there's definitely some downsides of this so like the seven ship story and several different you know horse stories are just indicative of a speculative fervor that isn't really being shaped by you know genuine interest in the asset class it's more of you know lack of interesting alternatives to investing yeah or some kind of desire to get rich quick or like treat it more like gambling but then so to go back to the earlier question about the new korean president like obviously i mean people in the u.s where is you know most of my audience is based will know obviously you have had run-ins with regulators here in the us the sec but you know korea kind of has like gone back and forth in terms of how welcoming the regulation has been to crypto so kind of what's your sense of like how this new president might affect the market there so i think it's going to be a super positive development and because especially because the last administration which was a little bit more analogous to the democratic party in the u.s they were very strong-handed uh with crypto and that bought a lot of fire from as i said previously a significant chunk of the population so this incoming president ran on a platform to counter everything that the previous administration did and one of the ways in which we did that was to cater to a very crypto specific platform so that essentially boils down to you know three large promises number one to deregulate crypto exchanges this is going to be massive not all positive but it's going to be massive in the sense that lots of things that crypto exchanges weren't able to do before so for example like besides update it hasn't been able it hasn't been possible to sign up for a fiat on-ramp account on any of the other major exchanges for the last two years right which is why outfit is dominant and even for outfit they need to use this tiny savings bank that nobody used to use before up and used to integrate so the user experience of getting money into crypto is terrible now it's crazy that so many people are trading crypto despite of all of this right yeah so crypto exchange is going to be deregulated number two he said he's going to allow people to do icos i have mixed feelings about this but at the same time it's probably not bearish for things that are going on in crypto number three to delay crypto taxes for at least another year so it at least two years off from now yeah well so when will this new president be inaugurated uh it's it's just a couple months away so yeah he's actually like taken over a bunch of duties like for example like moving presidential offices okay so but you're not thinking of moving back for the reasons that you mentioned yeah i mean i still fly back quite often and i think i'll be in korea a lot of the time but i think my family i think i want to keep here all right well is there anything i didn't ask you about since you know you said that you kind of wanted to give your own thoughts on certain things is there anything i didn't ask you about that you wanted to mention for my listeners no no this was great um it was very fun thanks for putting this together oh yeah no i really enjoyed it too i'm really glad that we did the improv section of the interview that was super fun all right well thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you so much thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about dough tara and all of the
