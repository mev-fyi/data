etoro to launch crypto trading on the Bluebird app Twitter is partnering with etoro to bring crypto trading to the app this is shocking I had no idea that Twitter did not already allow crypto trading why is there so much spam etoro is a social trading platform for Mom and Pop Traders so if I had to guess I'd say the crypto Traders on the app are mostly on the pop side Twitter has also launched a hashtag feature where if you type a dollar sign before a stock symbol you'll get the stock price although I just tried this with Twitter's own stock and got an error which is probably a bug apparently the hashtag symbol has been used 420 million times which seems kind of suspicious 420 really why is Elon Musk a parody of himself Bitcoin is one of the most searched terms but I imagine we won't get the exact number until it hits 69 million this follows the news of PBS and NPR quitting Twitter over being labeled government-funded media which does seem harsh I once interned at NPR and I can assure you they're funded by basically no one must be somewhat relaxing to be in Elon shoes right now though like you can't make Twitter worse thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Jason
