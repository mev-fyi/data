there has been sort of a storm around that of um hey I get that you know maybe I can't um you know if I've recently used tornado maybe use your thing but if even if I'm one hop which is I think like 30 of all ethereum addresses or one hop from a tornado address or two option for tornado address um they can't use that yes yeah there's I think and if it's three hops is like 90 and I think four hops is like 95 or something like that someone had to add a chart so it's like you know it's just like like what are we doing here like like how how reasonable can you sort of expect um uh you know people to sort of comply and this is all voluntary as well right it's um no one is making them do these things they're just thinking about hey how can I sort of minimize my potential risk uh how can I sort of you know protect myself which I empathize with I think you know running a front end and is you know um you're still you know taking active service you're hosting this thing um but it does feel like you know when you're looking at three hops out from a tornado interaction it feels very far
