oh the sec's argument is that even though there's this 99.9 correlation between the prices and the spot market and in the Futures Market uh they're not convinced that fraud in the spot Market would show up the same way in the Futures Market they never really clarified what that meant but they you know they said that grayscale needed to provide more empirical evidence of how fraud in the spot Market might manifest in the Futures Market um and and the judges pushed back on that quite a bit and said you know why why do they have to share that why is it not enough that the prices are correlated so extensively and in addition to that what type of you know empirical evidence do they need to show and the SEC um you know didn't really give a satisfactory answer for that in my opinion
