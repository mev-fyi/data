and the economic response and today's episode will focus on bitcoin's monetary policy here to discuss are andreas m antonopoulos speaker educator and author of mastering bitcoin mastering ethereum and the internet of money volumes one two and three and dan held growth lead at kraken disclosure before we begin kraken is a previous sponsor of my shows welcome andreas and dan hello thanks for having me to start let's define what we're going to discuss today what is a monetary policy i guess i can go ahead so monetary policy is what a uh government or central bank would define uh more more eloquently a central bank would define as its issuance schedule of currency and or the inflation targets or other socioeconomic targets the recently the fed has described its monetary policy as to of accomplishing uh several other factors outside of just like an inflation rate for example i think they're focusing on solving inequality now as well so that's how i would define them on monetary policy uh in also note that this is distinctly distinctly different than a fiscal policy uh fiscal being more associated with the federal government or on a on a government level which uh would be you know around the um the spending on different programs for uh you know medicaid medicare or social security andreas do you have any thoughts yeah from from a mechanical perspective i think of this as um you have central banks that are quasi-independent and they have a bunch of dials and what they're trying to do with these dials is adjust the supply of money itself in order to um affect the velocity of money through the economy um and they use different dials some of them are um things like uh the balance sheet dial which is a relatively new one where the central bank goes in and buys um things on the market like treasuries um the most important dial the the traditional dial is the overnight interest rate for inter bank lending at the federal reserve window which is basically where banks park their cash overnight and by tweaking that dial they can control how much money is um effectively in circulation versus parked at the fed and through that they can then affect um uh other parameters i think one of the things that i find fascinating about monetary policy is that first of all it's extremely variable and subject to political pressure which is why central banks are quasi independent the other thing is that in many cases tweaking the dial has a delayed effect um and and this is tricky now this is a bit like you know you start changing the the rudder on a ship and it turns three miles later um because of this delayed effect um there's it's not always clear how much control the central bank actually has over the thing they're changing because they don't change that thing directly they tweak one of the other dials and then they have this delayed effect so for example inflation they don't control inflation directly they control interest rates on the overnight window and the secondary effect happens later would you agree with that then i would and there's a useful analogy that i came up with which is imagine you've got the fed and the fed is driving the car which is the economy the fed can't see into the future so you can't see out your front windshield but you can use your rear view mirror so they're looking at historical data and they're using that to influence which levers they press so they look historically they look at the road behind them and they go okay it's it's gone to the left we need to make it go back to the right and so they press the brakes but the problem is like you mentioned the brakes don't kick in for another mile so it's a little bit tricky and they're steering the steering wheel and pressing the gas but these are all very delayed reactions to historical information um you know really at the core root of this it's a very tricky information problem and a very tricky uh influence problem where they don't have you know a really tight latency you know there's not a really low latency there between their actions and their outcome i love that analogy because it immediately makes makes me think of how if if the central bank of the us dollar is a car driven by a rear view mirror um bitcoin is a train and it's on rails we know exactly where it's going yeah well i was just about to say that one of the most fascinating things about the way that this discussion started is how different it sounds from bitcoin's monetary policy which we're going to dive into deeply and i would say um at least to my mind probably the most prominent feature of bitcoin's monetary policy is the cap on its money supply since the software will stop minting new bitcoins once 21 million coins are reached why is the cap on the money supply such a core feature to bitcoin's monetary policy and how would you say that it differs from other previous forms of money dan do you want to go for that one sure um the disinflationary so it's not technically a deflationary monetary policy it's a disinflationary monetary policy it's a decreasing issuance rate or you could call it an inflation rate but there's a bit of a nuance to some people's definition of interest rate uh sorry influence inflation rate versus issuance rate but essentially bitcoin issues bitcoin uh the bitcoin protocol issues bitcoin at a decreasing rate over time and those those moments in which the newly minted coins decreases are called having events and the reason why the monetary policy with a hard cap is important is because satoshi was trying to solve for a couple different problems one was the impossibility of choosing a proper rate of inflation and so satoshi actually jokes about this a little bit where he goes you know if we could trust someone to take data outside of bitcoin's blockchain and bring it in accurately then might you know there might be a way to adjust the supply in reaction to demand uh but i think he's saying that a little bit in a jokingly manner you know you can't really trust anyone on the outside to pipe in that data in a totally trustless manner there's always some degree of trust that you'd have to have and what i think he fundamentally understood was that the inflation rate or the proper rate of inflation is impossible to determine so let's say after bitcoin's uh bitcoin has totally issued 21 million coins there is no proper way to choose the right inflation rate there's an information problem in which for us to choose the proper rate of inflation we would have to digest trillions of data points a second every single consumer's purchasing behavior all across the world we'd have to ingest that parse it and analyze it instantaneously and there's just no k there's no way we can do that and so what satoshi decided to do instead was set the rate at zero long term so as soon as all the bitcoin are issued the inflation rate is zero percent um that also reduces a political attack factor when the rate of inflation is constantly and subjectively up to discussion then that will be used as a lever for certain powerful groups to influence the inflation rate for their benefit um and you know we commonly refer to this in the space of the cantillian effect i'm not sure how many people outside of crypto have ever heard of that before but it's essentially those closest to the money printing benefit from it so those closest to the monetary policy and influencing it will likely benefit from it i think it's also a battle between savers and debtors in that inflation can be used to shift uh gains from those who save to those who have debt by making that cheaper and removing uh the burden of paying back the debt by making it payable in less and less and less valuable money that's one of the arguments against the current u.s dollar monetary policy is that the government is effectively destroying savings making it impossible for people to save because the interest rate you get from your bank or any form of savings is minuscule to zero um and but the benefit that has for the government is that that makes the 23 trillion dollars worth of debt or however many we have now um those are denominated in dollars so the more inflation you have the less value that has so essentially the that gets smaller in in purchasing value um over time because of inflation and that's another thing that um that that is very subject to political manipulation if you can shift power between debtors and savers you can you can very much manipulate the economy yeah and one other thing i would add is that um i read in seventeen amazu's book the bitcoin standard and it's so obvious and yet just this simple statement um struck me he wrote until the invention of bitcoin scarcity was always relative never absolute and it is true even if you think about other scarce forms of money such as gold you know it's not something where there's a finite amount so um you know the fact that that can be known in advance about bitcoin is pretty remarkable and um well actually so let's actually maybe dive into a little bit more the the comparison of bitcoin to gold because it is often called digital gold and i did just point out one difference between them and yet they are often compared so how how would you say they're similar and how would you say they're different it's all about the predictability of the monetary policy i think that at the core root of of what we're all talking about here with bitcoin gold fiat is the predictability of it and with the supply we for sure under we concretely 100 know that it will only be 21 million with gold we know that it was scarce scarce on earth but if we zoom out and we look at the solar system and we look at these asteroids circling around the earth and other in other parts of the solar system they contain large large amounts of gold so we know certainly that gold is only finite on earth we don't exactly know how finite it is and then we know that it is not finite outside of earth so gold was only used as a mechanism for money because that was what we had at the time but with bitcoin with digital gold we can concretely understand that there are only 21 million and that assurance that confidence that absolute confidence in that number means that trust can flow into bitcoin which brings in deeper liquidity which brings in more and more folks believing in bitcoin and understanding it and placing their money which money is a representation of time energy and trust you know placing that into the bitcoin protocol i i would add to that that there are a number of properties that are um unique and fundamentally different in bitcoin as compared to gold that actually make it much more powerful than traditional gold as someone who has investments in in gold and bitcoin you know it's always been a very difficult problem which is owning gold is not easy and using gold as a store of value isn't easy even for its main purpose which is for value let alone secondary purposes like medium of exchange um the the bottom line is that i do not have the technical capability to verify that physical gold that i hold is actually gold um it's it's not easy to do and to do it consistently and to do it safely it's difficult to store um securely and it's difficult to it's extremely difficult to transport securely um or even at all because it's damn heavy if you've ever held cold you know that um it's um so so it has a number of problematic properties that uh physical gold has a number of problematic properties uh it's it's much easier to confiscate uh seize freeze or um put such conditions on its um storage that it's very very difficult for many people around the world to actually hold it so all of these properties especially the forgiability aspect um are results in bitcoin bitcoin is infinitely transportable um with with great ease it has zero weight um and it can be subdivided very very finely and um it is also absolutely unforgivable and easily verifiable as genuine and real bitcoin so all of these properties make it a much better store value and then you add on top of that that bitcoin also has a number of very strong properties as a medium of exchange not yet perhaps for the smaller payments that you might think of the buying of a cup of coffee example that we always think of but certainly um for me as a business person um getting paid and paying uh payroll and getting paid for jobs which are slightly larger payments um but but often across borders it's a fantastic medium of exchange and for that purpose it's very very suitable and i could never use gold like that so bitcoin is digital gold if digital gold put on a cape and became a super gold yeah and one other aspect of the cap that i think has been crucial um to the success of bitcoin was in helping it get off the ground so why why would you say that is um you know what and and specifically how did that play out with you know miners and and um people wanting to buy it and stuff like that well it's an interesting uh idea and first of all to define fomo i said jokingly formal fear of missing out but but i think that's true that's very true yeah and so i i think there's two aspects to this and and often there's a discussion in bitcoin about the the the utility um versus scarcity aspect of bitcoin as a chicken and egg problem you know one of the things we celebrate in bitcoin i even have a mug with with a symbol for it is pizza day right uh pizza today represents the utility moment the moments when bitcoin was used to buy something that somebody wanted um and before that its value um wasn't really yet defined interestingly enough though you could make an argument that scarcity had not yet really become noticeable so that's another reason why its value wasn't defined so in in the genesis of bitcoin one of the big discussions and debates i think is um did bitcoin need to become useful before it became valuable or did the scarcity uh make it valuable even before it was really useful um and there's differing arguments on these i think they both work hand in hand but this scarcity is becoming more and more and more noticeable over time um with each having it gets felt in the markets very acutely um because of course miners do sell a big proportion of their uh newly minted bitcoin in order to pay electricity that's a specific amount of bitcoin every day that has to that has to be picked up by someone buying just for the price to remain stable um and as long as there are more people buying than that then that pushes the price up so the scarcity is being felt in the market especially after each halving um and that is of course generating fear of missing out um arithmetically a lot of people say well you know if you think about it 21 million bitcoin is is far less than the i don't know 40 50 million millionaires that exist on the planet so that means that not even every millionaire on the planet can have one bitcoin when you grasp these little nuances it becomes very clear that the scarcity is getting more and more real over time and there's a couple really fun things to to kind of break out here and talk about so one is the decimal where satoshi put the decimal at 21 million versus 21 billion or 210 billion i thought that was a really interesting you know decision to dig into in terms of how satoshi felt that 21 million bitcoin felt maybe would feel more scarce than 21 billion i think satoshi you know this was the first cryptocurrency that actually worked there had been other failed attempts before and i'm not sure if he was super confident that it was going to work you know i think we all forget that bitcoin didn't have a price for a year and a half that's a long time oh satoshi nakamoto was definitely the first bitcoin skeptic he didn't think he was going to work necessarily it was an experiment to him yeah and i think largely in his language echoes that with the other developers of him encouraging them to experiment with going hey you should go try this out for xyz sort of utility or application um and he wasn't sure as well that he hypothesized that scarcity alone could be the driving factor behind price appreciation but he wasn't sure and he encouraged other people to go you know use bitcoin for different types of applications you know with the hypothesis that that might drive demand there's a lovely little myth that actually the 21 million was a mistake and in the calculation of havings um satoshi was actually aiming for 42 million yeah um exactly double which is of course the answer to the eternal question of what is the meaning of life the universe and everything blend it everywhere but then also and that's from uh douglas adams's book which i'm just like hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy right um but then also if if that were the case which there's something about that that seems plausible which is the fact that then the block reward would have started at 100 bitcoins per um per block rather than 50 which is where the software started so i also thought that was a very interesting theory um but one other a comment that i wanted to make so i'm asking these questions but then i also sort of want to jump in which is that um you know i feel like having that specific number and you're right dan it almost doesn't matter what the number is it's just the fact that you can know what the number is and that allows you to make calculations right so like with a minor they could calculate okay that like they have actual numbers that they can plug into an equation and be like will i be profitable and they can figure out the answer to that right so if they um for instance know okay there's gonna be 21 million bitcoins ever um you know at these different points in time this will be the supply um you know then they can calculate that against known money supplies you know i've seen comparisons of uh the the you know trillions of dollars that are in gold currently or the m0 money supply or the m1 money supply or whatever and so they can make projections um but then also they can um once the price of bitcoin became known or once there was a price on bitcoin then they could also use that to then plug in whether or not their mining operation would be profitable so um so i feel like all those things were were helpful to people who you know heard about this new thing didn't know whether it was going to take off and yet could do math to kind of figure out okay is this worth my time and effort um sorry girl finish up oh well just the the last thing also is that i feel like in a way the cap um creates this sort of like space of digital real estate you know like a like a future manhattan if you have this idea that okay there's going to be some kind of you know future monetary version of manhattan that will exist in the digital sphere sort of bitcoin was like that and you know obviously manhattan nowadays it's very expensive real estate um so you know knowing like oh if i get a piece of that like that's gonna grow in value like i feel like the cap is what does that you know it creates this like manhattan-sized island money serves a very very important and i love your thoughts here and this is uh i got really excited once you brought this up because this brings me to an analogy that i find really really useful that money is the measuring stick of capitalist uh experiments which are entrepreneurial efforts money is that measuring stick to help us evaluate is the allocation of capital towards a service or good building that or creating that is that a productive utility for society so if i hypothesize that hot dogs are needed on my street corner and i buy a little stand and i buy the hot dogs and it turns out that no one wanted hot dogs and i fail money is the ultimate measuring stick of me allocating capital effectively in the economy to solve problems for humans and so bitcoin being a 21 million hard cap is a finite exact measuring stick before we've got this variable measuring stick which we're not even sure exactly how many dollars are out in the market you know there could be some numbers that are either fudged or you know it's hard for us to validate the entire supply of dollars or euros or yen and with bitcoin we can now concretely measure it and this is a problem that we see in the sciences if you don't have a precise measurement of a kilogram or a meter then how would you go evaluate different experiments for different endeavors to measure and try out new things and so with bitcoin it is the first time we have a concrete measuring stick for all business outcomes what one of the interesting conclusions you get from that is that in the end it doesn't really matter how big a meter is as long as everyone has the same idea so the actual units doesn't matter 21 million um there are some aspects of human cognition where a certain round numbers are more appealing easier to understand et cetera et cetera we we don't really um work very well with things after the decimal point um so there's an argument to be made that that was a good choice for the for the primary unit um but but ultimately the the size of the measuring stick doesn't matter and that comes to a second very important aspect of this which is ultimately it's not the money that has the value it's the things you do with the money that have the value the the measuring stick itself um isn't its length uh and that's important to to realize it's not money that has value it's the things you get for it that have um value and um in order for the measuring stick to work you have to have that stability um or you have to have very very massive utility it's interesting because in all of this discussion we talk about the us dollar as a currency that doesn't have these characteristics yet the us dollar is an incredibly successful currency it is still the world reserve currency and is likely to remain the world's reserve currency for a very long time so then the question is why how can you have a world reserve currency that doesn't have sound monetary properties and solid store value and fixed units of measurements i i think that's a really interesting question to explore well do you want to make a theory because i'm curious to know your thoughts on that i i think it's it's momentum from utility the us dollar has enormous utility and as long as most other substitutes are inferior in more than one ways either politically inferior the yuan for example um inferior in terms of breadth of trade uh vis-a-vis other economies and things like that and in fear for geopolitical reasons such as control of oil producing um economies uh it that utility can carry it forward with momentum much longer than than you would expect on paper in theory um and of course that's that's exactly the thing that is being challenged by bitcoin bitcoin offers a a viable alternative on certain dimensions there is no in my opinion there is no perfect system and i i think it's important to recognize that um bitcoin has its own weaknesses uh and so for from a broader perspective it's really a matter of which dimensions are important for the thing you're trying to do and that's why the dollar isn't just going to disappear overnight yeah so i actually i want to ask two questions um based on these comments um one was i was going to ask you guys if you thought that um bitcoin would or or any digital currency would be successful or whether it's monetary policy would still be superior to existing fiat currencies even without a cap so for instance if there was some kind of perpetual inflation which i know other cryptocurrencies um use um but then the other thing that i was going to ask which was um as we know austrian economists have been really enamored with bitcoin uh but there is like one theory from austrian economics that doesn't quite explain why bitcoin's been so successful which is something called the mises regression theory which is that the value of a currency comes from the likelihood it will continue to be valuable which means that you know in reverse it the current value is based on the previous value and yet bitcoin got value out of thin air so i i'm interested in in but on your thoughts on both of these things yeah so to the second one i think that a lot of austrian economics like economists they looked at previous commodity monies and hypothesized that as these monies became into existence they came out into existence because they previously had utility as a commodity so we saw different types you know some people also look at gold and they claim that gold has some alternative utility for industrial use and or jewelry but what's funny is that the industrial use for gold is a very new invention like um like 200 years ago gold did not have a utility in an industrial use case and then if we look at it still had enormous store value use it's regards it's uses as a store of value um you know versus like a lot of these economists go oh well these commodity monies that have previous like real real world functional utility as for something other than money but that's the whole point is this function is money that's its utility and with gold people often say that oh well it's also used for jewelry well no jewelry is the same objective it's a display of your store value it's not an alternative use is not an industrial use there are plenty of shiny metals out there that are less scarce and easier to work with than gold um and go so gold's you know main value is its utility is its utility and money right and you know the the interesting thing is that a lot of these economic analyses of bitcoin like like many of the uh analysis we see in the financial space are based on um 18th and 19th century um economic doctrines so the problem with with all of those is that um we're attempting to analyze something that is truly novel uh it's truly novel in that it doesn't neatly fit into any of the categories that pre-existed on which all of the analytical tools that we're using are currently based so all of the economic theory that comes from austrian economics or from chicago school economics or for many economics or mba type of university training is based on certain assumptions about the structure of an industrial primarily in industrial economy and certain assumptions um based on the historical perspective from the 18th 19th and early 20th century these are not new schools of thought bitcoin confounds a lot of these analytical tools because it doesn't neatly fit into any of the categories that pre-existed and it exists in a realm the internet which doesn't neatly fit into any of the macroeconomic or even microeconomic analysis of the past uh you know the idea that that the internet is an economy of its own um was completely controversial less than 15 years ago and the idea that you could have an entirely intangible economy that transcends borders completely controversial 15 years ago the idea that bitcoin isn't uh just a currency um or a stock or bond or um an investment or a commodity um you know and a lot of people say well what do you think bitcoin is is it a bond is it a stock is it a currency is it a commodity i'll i'll tell you the answer is really simple bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and so we don't yet have that category and the analytical tools that come with it we are now building the analytical tools to be able to rationally speak about how cryptocurrencies behave over longer term uh and larger economies until now we didn't have any uh and this is this has happened before uh 20 years ago there were no financial tools for speaking about derivatives simply did not exist in their modern form they had to develop these um we have entire institutions like the commodities and futures um organization and regulator here in the united states that that is half of its regulatory mandate is on something that didn't exist 25 years ago we need to have new tools in order to speak intelligently about new things that do not simply fit the behavior or the tools we have in the past yeah this is why i love covering this space because a different analyst will come up with new ways of modeling out the value of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and it's you know they're just they're just making it up and you know which is not i'm i'm not dismissing what they're doing but i'm just trying to explain everything that we're doing is new like it's all we're just creating it on our own and it just requires our creativity and our smarts and um yeah just new ways of looking at the world and trying to figure out what it is that is being built and i think spencer bogart um wrote this great post saying that um bitcoin is sort of like this platypus because you know it's this animal that has all these different features from other animals and yet it's all in one and that's why the us government has had a hard time classifying things like bitcoin you know the irs calls it property and the cftc calls it a commodity and you know et cetera so but this is this is cognitive dissonance playing out in in very tangible and real worlds in real ways in our industry this cognitive dissonance as to expecting bitcoin to behave as something that pre-existed and then trying very hard to squeeze it into that category and and either um being surprised or even more so being righteously outraged that it doesn't conform to those things it's a bit like the new automotive industry being emerging into a world of of horses and horse carriages and the analysts are still trying to figure out how it works by estimating annual consumption of hay and the regulators insisting that it is common sense to have a veterinary um doctor on staff uh in any transportation company and it is um both unreasonable and dangerous um for public health not to have one uh and this is the this is exactly the kind of framework that is being hosted around uh bitcoin to kind of wrap up here and i think it'll go back to your first question which i don't think we answered yeah about the inflationary yeah whether there could be perpetual inflation let's see if i can tie this together okay okay all right so wild bitcoin is this new species of money i mean it is a wild new exotic species right like this isn't anything of what like we see we've seen before it's very different from these commodity bunnies from fiat from gold it for this new money to permeate into the into ex to permeate the consciousness of like what is money what why is bitcoin better or different than previous monies and for that to happen that takes a long time to do i mean and so when it comes to bitcoin is fundamentally different from a technological perspective and from a species of money perspective but it is somewhat the same in terms of the problems that it's solving and ultimately it's all about trust that makes it work and this was satoshi's first after the white paper this was satoshi's first post and in the second paragraph he goes trust is required to make it all work we have to trust in the central banks we have to trust in our banks and bitcoin essentially is solving the problem of trust so while it's a new technology it solves a very fundamental i would say a problem that has always existed in humankind it solves the problem of trust now tying this back to the monetary policy and an inflation monetary policy would say a perpetual inflation rate versus one that has no inflation rate post 21 million issuance or post total issuance the monetary policy is a really tricky thing in the issuing schedule and the security models are all intertwined that's what makes this really really you know the more i i've been in this space for a long time not not as long as andreas or others but i've you know when you first get in you go oh it's digital gold gold 2.0 and then you're like you go down the rabbit hole of proof of work and you're like wow this is pretty fascinating and then you get into functions of like the security model and you're like this is incredible the intricacies of how this is all tied together and so let me play out a couple here on the issuance schedule so every four years the rate of newly limited bitcoin just drops in half and that occurs every four years or every two hundred and ten thousand blocks more accurately until 21 million bitcoin are created um well 21 million i've never created 20 million 999 1999 bitcoin points nine nine nine nine nine nine seven specifically if you work out the the the correct and i'm gonna be pedantic about this but the correct one is 21 will never be reached it's an asymptotic that never touches 21 million yeah that's why we have andreas on the call he understands the nuance of it and can also explain it simply yeah so with this issuance schedule why did satoshi choose every four years and what happens during those halving cycles you know satoshi hypothesized that you know satoshi before bitcoin had value hypothesized that due to the scarcity of it that fomo would the be a core critical element in terms of user adoption because as the price increases more people become aware of it we then buy in anticipation of the price increasing further he's essentially describing fomo in a very volatile market cycle the market cycles are bitcoin's main user acquisition method we all became aware of it probably in 2013 or 2017. i think andreas was earlier but you know for a lot of us in terms of like the big adoption waves 13 and 17 were huge because the price appreciated and bitcoin's monetary policy since there is no increase in supply when demand increases that that creates very volatile moments where the price skyrockets up and similarly when demand decreases the the price drops and so that is one a user acquisition method but what's also interesting is that as bitcoin issues coins over you know this next hundred years or so um and that eventually becomes asymptotic with 21 million there there's something called the block reward and the block reward is what miners receive which is the block subsidy the newly minted coins plus transaction fees and this is bitcoin's long-term security model or it's been bitcoin security model but when we project and look into the future for its long-term security prospects bitcoin's security model is dependent on you know the subsidy the newly limited coins keep dropping in each block reward that has to be compensated by a rise in transaction fees and those transaction fees come about through these market cycles where all of a sudden there was a million bitcoin users and now there's 10 million so there's many more transacting on on chain which means there's many more transaction fees which means it replaces the subsidy so when you look into the intricacies of how the monetary policy the issuance schedule and the security model are all intertwined it's pretty fascinatingly complex and so there's some proto there's some uh protocols out there that look at that long-term security model and they hypothesize what if we had a perpetual rate of inflation because we're not sure if the transaction fees will replace the newly missed coins or the subsidy in these block rewards and you know that i admire their their want to go look at that very very long-term security model and look at improving it but they're also going back and destroying the fundamental thing this is in my opinion destroying the fundamental thing that makes bitcoin and blockchain technology great is that it removes trust if we have to trust that you won't change your monetary policy again after you've chosen a perpetual rate of inflation which is impossible to choose then you've now inserted trust back into the mechanism that we use to remove trust or remove trust with humans so i definitely want to dive more into this because i have a lot of questions on a lot of what you just said but this is the latest i've ever done in ad break you guys were having such a good discussion i couldn't break it up so we're gonna talk about um all these issues uh you know involving the cap and changing the issuance and etc but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in fees are you paying for

was so curious this was something that i was you know kind of looking into before the show so you know as you mentioned at a certain point when the block reward stops there will be a transition where miners will be compensated in transaction fees not in the block reward and the current um amount that they earn is from fees is about nine percent of the block reward and so we'd have to see transaction fees 11x by roughly 2140 which is when the uh new bitcoins will stopping minted but i just wondered you know if we don't see um like an increase in the amount of transactions that can happen at layer one then can transaction fees 11x in that time or or will that require people to pay a lot more per transaction that's a great question and when i'm not sure how many people who are listening to listening to this work in tech but in tech we have something called a kpi a key performance indicator and we use it as a calibration method to coordinate our efforts at a company and use that metric to define success for example that might be user signups or number of users trading at kraken et cetera the kpi for this met for what we're looking at right now which the the question we're trying to answer is are transaction fees replacing the blocked subsidy in the block reward so are newly minted coins are they as those decrease is that value being replaced by the subsidy and so we can we can calculate that that would be our primary kpi so you could look at transaction fees over the subsidy transaction fees in a block divided by the subsidy and you brought up the that's at nine percent if we look at that historically and we make it like a rolling 60 day to smooth it out a little bit and we look at this over time on a log curve it's very much trending in the right direction where 11x sounds like a lot but bitcoin moves in really intense cycles where we've all seen it go from a thousand to ten thousand or twenty thousand when that happens that means there's not an equivalent but a directional rise in transactions and transaction fees and so we have seen the transit we have seen transaction fees replace the subsidy over time and so very much is trending in the right direction to where over the next couple halving cycles we should see it start to predominantly be the value that is compensated to the miners in the block reward now you know we we certainly can't predict the future there we do not know if there will be future speculative bubbles or what bitcoin's future adoption rate should be um but if bitcoin doesn't become adopted if it is remains a more niche sort of a service for humankind where only you know let's say 20 million people use it well then it's long-term security will be weak and i think that's what's really interesting and it really you know people people worry about like oh well if bitcoin is the world reserve currency that doesn't have a strong security model like there's not a lot of monetary compensation in the block reward due to transaction fees well will that be a bad scenario it's an impossible scenario because if it is the world reserve currency there will be very very many layer one transaction fees right but what i'm asking is because the number of layer one transactions is limited um and right now i feel like a lot of the scaling is focusing on layer two so i just wonder will layer one be big enough to handle you know with the amount of transactions that will need to be on layer one in order for the miners to get enough fees to you know a different perspective here that blends um the two topics of monetary policy and the technical implementation maybe then um you can you can uh jump on that topic as well but from my perspective the monetary policy creates um a very specific uh microeconomic environment um if you think about um if you think about the the commodity of money that is that is bitcoin uh their supply and demand supply um because of bitcoin's monetary policy is fixed and diminishing um uh tapering off asymptomatically and ultimately capped and demand is variable uh and the equilibrium between the two is is the bitcoin price now if you think about that market one of its characteristics uh its strongest characteristic what gives it to all of this fomo is is the concept of inelastic market response the supply cannot adapt to a change in price if you take something else potatoes and suddenly potatoes are worth a thousand dollars a spot well um my garden right on front here is getting plowed up and i'm planting potatoes um so the the price causes an immediate response in the market where production of that good um increases proportionately to the demand um and the price acts as a mechanism a signaling mechanism uh to encourage production of that good now think about uh bitcoin supply so price goes up same amount of bitcoin in fact less after four years is going to be produced there is no elasticity there will not be a response in production so that's the monetary policy the same game plays out in transaction fees and most people don't really see this but if you think about block capacity the space for transactions that exist in a block that is also fairly inelastic perhaps not as inelastic as the bitcoin supply and it's not diminishing over time but it is still inelastic in that there is a limit um and that limit does not respond to surges in demand so when demand goes up for block capacity that is a market it's microeconomics markets determined by the supply of block space by miners which is fixed and the demand for transaction capacity which could varies based on price signal and also varies based on some optimizations and how transactions are stored but not that much so when you have these spikes the dam was describing what that does is it pushes off the transaction fee as everybody's trying to cram into this one tiny block uh all of the transactions because of fomo and so the price responds accordingly because you have this inelastic block supply our question is are these two inelastic supplies the same and they're not the block space is actually fixed but it's not diminishing there are some aspects of this that create some concerns for the future one of them is the fact that miners um can collude in some very creative ways they can first of all collude to restrict supply further and for the capacity of the block instead of mining blocks that have a megabyte of or two megs weight of transactions in them um they can mine blocks that have fewer transactions all the way to the extreme of mining empty blocks now they can do this like an opec of miners where they collude uh to reduce the space uh that they occupy in the block thereby driving up transaction fees and this can be profitable just like opec is profitable for the oil producing countries and it's very difficult to break out of that collusion the other thing miners can do which is very interesting is they can occupy some of that space um by basically rigging the auction if you think about it the block space is auctioned off to people who bid with their transaction fee and hope to get in that type of auction has an obvious problem which is that um you can have what i call ringers in the auction a miner can put a transaction up for confirmation with a very high fee um driving all of the other transaction bidders to increase their bids to compete against that and then if um that transaction is included in the block and that miner has enough hash rate they have a pretty good chance of paying themselves which means this is a low cost that depends on how much hash rate they have but again this is a tremendous opportunity for collusion because if most miners do that they're either getting paid when they win the block from their own transactions that they use to break the auction or um they're getting paid by the other miners someone's getting paid so then it's a very low cost way to create essentially a cartel for the block capacity these are real problems and and there are a number of proposed solutions including uh advocating for a block size increase which has other undesirable side effects but i think it's important to know that these things are not finished it is quite possible that over time the block size may be increased if there's enough demand for that the consensus and that can change but the consensus on the 21 million coins in my opinion cannot change because to me that's a defining characteristic of what bitcoin is if you create a coin that has 22 million coins um issuance you can do that using the bitcoin code base no one will call it bitcoin and there will still be a number of people who will remain on the one that has a 21 million cap and everyone will call that bitcoin so in the end the only way you can change that number is by forking off another coin that's less valuable um not a winning solution however in the block market the inelastic supply can be dealt with with broad consensus so over time people may agree and say you know what at this point the technology has caught up and we can't afford to do formic blocks i don't know it's a very controversial topic um but i think it's important to recognize the similarities of the inelastic supply between these two markets but also the differences in how critical these are in terms of principled aspects of consensus and how unchanging they might be okay yeah so it sounds like you think it is possible people might consider that because or rather it's possible that the um the amount and transaction fees um will maybe not be enough on layer one to replace the block reward when the time comes okay well two things first of all i think this is by the way this is the number one question i get for the past eight years all i've been doing is ask answering questions about bitcoin the most common question i get is what happens in 140 years when block subsidy stops and the answer the most important part of this answer is it doesn't happen in 140 years it happens today and tomorrow and the day after every single day miners are making the profitability calculation and they are taking into consideration the ratio of fees to subsidy and the current price of bitcoin to decide if they're profitable and adjust their hash rate there is no cliff moment where this happens this happened in 2017 it's happening today it will continue to happen every day and so this balance this equilibrium is dynamically moving uh through bitcoin with a heartbeat of 10 minutes every single day um the question is are fees enough today to maintain the current level of security we need today inverse in ratio to block subsidy and given the hash rate today the answer the miners have given us is yes resoundingly yes so then tomorrow and so over time though this may lead to moments where you have very very expensive um transactions uh and and that tests the market it tests the market because it puts the use of bitcoin as a transactional medium of exchange um uh against the use of bitcoin as the fomo engine of of um store value in those moments it becomes a less useful transactional medium of exchange precisely because it has suddenly become such an incredibly powerful formal mechanism for stored value so it's not one or the other it's a shift okay we've got a great thought to append to andreas's uh direction here so uh nick carter wrote a really good article a few weeks ago about this with ethereum and bitcoin has the you know they both have this fixed parcel of land this block space and we are all bidding to get into that block space so all of the bidders whether whatever store you know if your store value medium of exchange or crypto kitties use case you are bidding for that fixed parcel of real estate and so you're bidding to get you know a spot on that piece of real estate now when we look at bitcoin bitcoin has two primary use cases which are store value gold 2.0 and there is the transactional use case if you want to send large amounts of money across across borders um what's interesting is that for both ethereum and bitcoin as transaction fees rise which i think everyone's very acutely aware of um over the last few months on ethereum it's they've risen to all-time highs bitcoin is similarly high relative to historical fees as those rise the the use cases that move the largest amounts of money which are likely likely to be more store value or maybe like very large smart contract use cases those will outbid every other use case so it's a really interesting thing to think about because for bitcoin as andreas brought up the store value more fomo or gold 2.0 folks if that rises and becomes very very popular again and it all it's always been popular but as that crowds out that fixed real estate it'll push out the medium of exchange use cases because they'll be able to pay more on transaction fees for example if i'm wanting to send a million dollars i'm fine with paying 100 transaction fee but if i'm trying to pay for my netflix using bitcoin 100 transaction fee is super onerous so i'm not going to do that right but is this kind of against the original vision of bitcoin then because you know i i think a lot of people like the idea of bitcoin because they think of it as democratizing access to finance and there is a fly by the way for the people who are watching the video there is a fly in my room it is attacking my face i don't know what's going on um but you know is it is it possible to fulfill that vision of democratizing finance for everyday people if it's only reduced to um people who want to send a million dollars worth of bitcoin being able to do so yeah i mean i wrote a comprehensive threat on like satoshi's intentions when he launched bitcoin i mean i don't think any of us can go back and weigh those intentions and then weigh those perfectly and and spit out like this was 100 satoshi's intention i mean satoshi the first message that the only message he ever put in the bitcoin blockchain is uk chancellor on the verge of second bailout for banks not visa on the verge of raising processing fees there's also like he references that bitcoin is digital gold four or five times or he calls it a precious metal sorry um and there's also some functional aspects like the monetary policy has no supply response which makes it very poor as a medium of exchange because it's not a stable unit of account it's hard for people to mentally reconcile like oh i i have to like re-measure certain items that i'm purchasing like i have to re-measure the purchasing power of my coin constantly it's a deeply nuanced topic but yep i have a slightly different perspective on this um if i may interrupt um these two these two visions are not only not um a direct uh trade-off but in fact they're highly synergistic here's the thing democratizing access to money um makes sense if that money cannot be subjected to prior restraint confiscation freezing and shutdown the ability to make a transaction um at will through the democratization of money has to assume an environment in which there is an adversarial relationship again with those who do not want you to democratize um the access to money and if you ignore that adversary relationship then you can assume this is a simple trade-off which is uh listen it's okay what we do is we just increase the capacity um make transactions um cheaper and and then we democratize access to money the problem is that what you've done in that trade-off is you've required the the money to become more permissioned um less resistant to prior restraint um and less resistance to various types of censorship attacks what ends up happening is exactly what has already happened most recently in zimbabwe you have these incredibly versatile micro transaction platforms for mobile digital pay and then when those threaten the stability of the financial system of zimbabwe's kleptocracy they remove permission and those things are shut down now these people also don't have democratic access to money and they don't have democratic access money even though they have a platform for very low fee transactions you can't separate the two the the reason that trade-off is important is because um unless you have a system that cannot be shut down having a system that's cheap is worth nothing um the the cheap system that can be shut down will be shut down at precisely the moment when you need it not to be shut down um and i think people don't appreciate the fact that we are operating in a currency environment that is becoming even more so adversarial than it already is uh this is not simply a matter of playing nice um when uh you're dealing with considerations that go far beyond the transaction fee uh having a low transaction fee without a network to run it on isn't a useful property of money well so i did want to ask a little bit more about this um uh me what's it called medium of exchange use of bitcoin um is the monetary policy of bitcoin conducive to it being a medium of exchange because i'm sure you guys are aware a lot of people will say oh i don't want to use bitcoin to buy coffee because then a year or two from now i'll realize that i just i had bought myself a hundred dollar cup of coffee so i wondered do you think that we'll see it being used more and more as a store of value and and not really see the medium of exchange use um gain adoption yeah maraud a really famous trader in the space he developed a graph that shows it's a very rough graph and it's it's more for visualization purposes but it shows the evolution of bitcoin through time you know just like a tree or just like a person goes through stages of development from a young child of becoming a teenager and an adult in a tree growing up and becoming stronger and stronger and bigger bitcoin go over time has different characteristics so due to bitcoin's lack of supply response to increases in demand that makes the price very volatile that volatility and price makes it very very hard to be a unit of account the unit of account is great with bitcoin in terms of its you know our precise measurement of how many coins are out there no there's 21 million that gives us a very precise you know ruler or measuring stick however the purchasing power fluctuates constantly so you know bitcoin acting as a dollar or substitute or a replacement for a world reserve currency in that unit of account aspect from a stable purchasing power perspective is very far away you know i think that is many many decades um bitcoin's use as a speculative store of value it's had that use case since day one it's very very good at that the increase in speculative uh you know the increase in speculation increases awareness and adoption which then drives to andreas's point then drives medium of exchange uh the more and more people who hold bitcoin means that the price goes higher and higher which means that the market you know the market cap is higher the liquidity is deeper eventually volatility should start to decrease over many decades which makes the purchasing power more predictable and easier to understand and use in a day-to-day basis so i see it as like a multi-decade evolution of a store value store value plus medium exchange media exchange store value plus unit of account many decades later so i see it as like there isn't a clear cut like oh it's only useful for this at this moment it's more of a gradient over time of of which one becomes more or less useful um but as we see with transact transaction fees to me it seems very clear that bitcoin over the next decade or so and until layer 2 technology becomes more prevalent and very widespread and easy to use that bitcoin's primary use case will be store value in the next bull run as transaction fees largely probably go you know past 50 or 100 per transaction that crowds out pretty much everything else other than store value i i i disagree slightly in that i i think there is a function of media exchange today and it does exist but it depends on your context and perspective so there's two aspects to this context the assumption can i or should i use it to buy a cup of coffee it comes with a with a with a set of assumptions around it that are very very specific and it is probably the worst example to use and i am totally guilty as the number one example in my book um and and it was absolutely the moment i wrote it um we we need to stop thinking about buying coffee is the primary activity of a medium of exchange system you know buying a ticket out of syria may be a much more interesting uh use in that context at that point as a medium of exchange it is all-powerful i i i think um there there's two uh presumptions or pre-assumptions that come to this context the first one is at the moment bitcoin for most of its users acts as an intermediary economy uh where you pass things through bitcoin on the way to somewhere else so you start with fiat you own earn and live in the fiat world you take the fiat you transmute it into um bitcoin and then you either hold it or you convert it into something else usually by converting it back into fiat after it's traveled somewhere so this is the bitcoin as rails um perspective when you look at it from that perspective the the economics really make it very challenging to use the medium of exchange if you're coming from fiat and ending up in fiat if bitcoin is simply a highway that has on-ramps and off-ramps but most of your life has lived in the neighborhoods that's a whole different ball game i can tell you from experience as someone who lives in the bitcoin economy and treats it as a circular economy the the the hoarding instinct and volatility and remorse of buying uh a cup of coffee um reverse themselves very very quickly and here's why um i don't buy bitcoin i earn it i earn it through my labor um and through my entrepreneurial activities so when i earn bitcoin directly not as fiat um the price volatility works both ways it cuts both ways when i pay payroll at the end of the month for my employees and contractors suppliers etc if the price has gone up that that really um works nicely for me because i give out less of my bitcoin in order to fulfill my liabilities uh but at the same time if i'm getting paid next month and the price of bitcoin goes up i receive less bitcoin for the thing i charge because my unit of account is still fair so if i'm in that circular economy um the the the volatility in purchasing power works for me on liabilities and against me on my receivables on my um on my income and if you take it over a long period of time it's a wash um i have used bitcoin in a circular economy like that since it was less than ten dollars per bitcoin up until last week when i did my um my payables for the um for the mid-month payables um and and so from that perspective all of that goes away i don't have remorse because yes i paid a thousand dollars for a cup of coffee but i also got paid ten thousand dollars an hour that month you know so uh it balances out and so so the perspective of i'm an affluent american who has access to alternative mechanisms of payment and i mostly live in the us dollar economy um visiting bitcoin as a tourist is very different from the perspective of living in a circular economy and even more importantly for all of those people who do not have the comparables the alternative um mechanisms of payment um it's easy to say i'm not buying a cup of coffee with bitcoin i'm going to use x when x exists when x doesn't exist or when x is zimbabwe dollars um then that equation may change rather dramatically um and i i've heard this from a number of people who don't live in the in the in the environment where they have 20 other things to choose from that are actually pretty damn good as medium of exchange yeah i certainly live in a privileged environment and country i live in san francisco which out of all the cities in the world were very very affluent so totally understand that i come from a different perspective um i was there with you when we worked at blockchain.com in 2014. and blockchain.com paid everyone in bitcoin i was there while i saw thousands of bitcoin businesses struggle you know as demand decreased after the 2013 bull run and the price decrease so the price is a function of price as it increases increases demand it's a bitcoin operates in a really interesting way is that price becomes that that signal to the market like hey come pay attention to this but it also signals to the businesses like hey be prepared as the price goes down be prepared for a drop in your customers and it's really really hard when bitcoin businesses when they had you know let's say you have um you're getting paid in bitcoin like this circular economy idea where like everyone gets paid in bitcoin you receive your income like your revenue in bitcoin becomes very very tricky when the price is so volatile to plan out a business operation so let's say i want to deploy a million dollars to go build a building and the price of bitcoin is at a thousand dollars well if it drops to 500 now i may not be able to finance that operation and maybe i can't make that decision within one day because i need to talk to many different stakeholders internally get legal to sign off get the permitting in place so bitcoin for a business purpose is really really tough yeah i experienced it at my own startup zero block which we sold the blockchain.com i saw it at blockchain you know when that's why we have that more unit of account currency like the dollar used for business is because it makes it easy for business planning purposes it is predictably decreasing in value over time um yeah and any sensible business will not operate in one currency nor will it keep its treasury assets in one currency diversification applies on a business level just as much as it applies on a personal level and i don't keep all of my business treasury assets in uh bitcoin or at the same time i don't keep it all in dollars um and being able to diversify and take different levels of risk accordingly actually gives me um some some great has given me at least some great results over time but it does take a longer term approach and it is very very difficult to do planning with a volatile asset i agree with that so i was curious um you guys you know we've been talking about bitcoin being used as a medium of exchange or store value unit of account i was so curious because you know the idea that bitcoin works as a store of value is probably one of the predominant narratives around bitcoin but then obviously we saw with black thursday earlier this year in march when bitcoin was actually surprisingly correlated with the broader markets and um it did experience a precipitous drop on march 12th why do you think that uh investors actually did not turn to bitcoin at that time but instead sold it and how does that affect that theory about bitcoin being a store of value it's a great question a lot of people bring this up which is hey bitcoin sold off while the risk on assets like equity is also sold off like doesn't that you know conflict with the idea that bitcoin's a good store of value but when we see a liquidity crunch which is what you know that black back in march what we saw there with a huge decrease in equities and bitcoin price that was a liquidity crunch and we saw gold sell off tremendously and gold is a 4 000 year old store of value i mean it is the oldest story or one of the oldest stores of value is still in existence that humankind uses so um gold also sold off it so i don't think that you know because gold sold off does that make all the poor store value no i think in a liquidity crunch everyone is selling everything they can get their hands on to meet their margin calls there's a series of cascading margin calls that were essentially crunched and crunched the market to where people are entering this liquidity crunch and they're they're selling everything they have to meet those margin calls now what we've seen in 2008 and now is that after that moment months and years later then the store value assets like gold start to perform as people start to price in inflation concerns and pricing concerns over the monetary policy of their government then those store value assets start to rise and so i don't think we're going to see that impact on bitcoin's price materially until you know six to 12 months from now i think another factor that's playing in this is that um what we've seen over the past um 10 years at least is an unprecedented injection of liquidity in in pretty much all of the global economy but especially in the united states what that has done is it distorts uh markets by creating an environment in which more and more and more assets become correlated not to just to each other but effectively they become correlated to one and only one action which is the degree of stimulus that is being anticipated at the next fed meeting um and and you it creates these weird phenomena like good news is bad news because it will lead to less stimulus and bad news is good news because it will lead to more stimulus and um essentially more and more of the assets become correlated to that one aspect of stimulus investors who have undergone this um this battle to find yields and you know keep looking in um dustier and dustier corners of their portfolio to find healed because they can't generate yield because money is free and everyone's chasing healed and there's too much money out there um they will use bitcoin and um and other um crypto assets of various types to chase yield and and and that does correlate bitcoin closer to all of the other assets because it's responding to the same incentives you know the majority of people who are invested in bitcoin in every bubble are not there because they understand the principles of austrian economics and sound money and the technological robustness of bitcoin they're there because you know to the moon coin went up um number go up yay fomo and but that kind of speculative behavior is both incredibly useful and very valid but what it means is that um those investors who chase yield will chase yields into crypto just as much as the other places crypto is experiencing um asset inflation as a result of too much money sloshing around in an investor community especially in the united states and when there is a supply crunch um when there is a liquidity crunch is than described um everything goes on the table and bitcoin has one of the riskier more volatile assets um and because of its inelastic behavior will drop harder and faster than all of the other assets in the short term that is normal behavior and in fact if you if you looked at most of the people who were talking about this they had predicted that the the disaster glee that you see in some bitcoin circles where it's like i hope the economy crashes because then i'm gonna bitcoins going to the moon and i'll have bags um that's that's disaster romanticism um is is both uh creepy as well as uh irrational because in the short term exactly the opposite happens in the short term bitcoin does get sold off just as hard as the other assets and probably harder because it has this extreme volatility um uh there are no mechanisms to stop it from dropping just as hard so i think this is predictive behavior bitcoin is currently much more correlated to other assets than it's ever been before i think um and in the short term it is going to bounce around um with the rest of the economy because scared investors are going to pull out pull their money out of everything um but short term and long term two different things i also want to talk about something else that um in a similar vein is just a question around kind of how things will go against a pretty popular theory so i'm sure you guys both know of this stock to flow model which um really made the rounds and people really glomped onto and it's basically you know saying that the amount of new bitcoin the ratio of um existing bitcoin to new bitcoin being created um will affect the price and so as um that ratio uh i guess it would be that it increases uh because the the number of new bitcoins will be decreasing that um we should see the price go up at the same time however so after this came out i don't know if you guys saw there was um a column by nico cordero the chief investment officer and fund manager at strix leviathan and he published an article um kind of saying that the premise of this stock to flow model which is based on start to flow in gold and um how historically that has correlated to the price of gold he said well actually you know the author cherry picked the points and when you look at historical data and he said quote gold's market capitalization held valuations between 60 billion and 9 trillion all of the same stock to flow value of 60 and he said a range of 8 trillion is not very indicative of explanatory power and lends itself to the obvious conclusion that other factors drive gold's u.s dollar evaluation so do you guys think that the stock to flow model works for bitcoin or um you know what's your take on on this theory um i i find it interesting as a descriptive mechanism to understand the concept of hardness of money um but i don't pay particularly attention as a predictive theory um to help uh explain or predict um future price movements um i think hardness of money is an important a very very important um characteristic of money but it's not the only characteristic of money and um it it money operates in an environment of irrational human beings i i think the whole rational market act or a hypothesis which is is clearly debunked could support a theory like stock to flow but but the problem is that people respond to to money and other markets uh things in irrational ways and they they evaluate risk in irrational ways they um they far bias um gain uh sorry they far by us uh avoiding loss over gaining a reward and so we we know that these irrational behaviors result in um weird effects in in markets so yeah great i mean stock to flow explains why hard money is hard and it also gives us a way to understand this the hardness of bitcoin vis-a-vis other forms um of money i i wouldn't take that to be a gospel as to how the price is going to play out at all no one can predict the future i don't think any model can out there it certainly might give us some insight into you know trajectory wise what bitcoin might look like but i certainly don't prescribe or you know really weight any sort of model whether it be stock to flow or any other one as having like superior or very high level of predictability um i personally find it very interesting because it models out scarcity and it models out the hardness of money and attempts to look at that looking at precious metals and i think that's pretty fascinating that we go through that sort of analysis and that's what makes the bitcoin community really cool is i love the in-depth economic research done by a wide variety of different individuals where they go explore these different topics so you know i haven't dug super deep into the nuances of like how predictable it is i know there's some controversy as to some folks don't like the methodology or there's some holes or flaws in it i personally haven't dug in super super deep i i would say it does relate to the point i was making earlier which is that new things require new analytical tools this is a useful analytical framework that gives us some insights into the hardness of bitcoin in terms that we can understand in in something like bitcoin that is entirely novel in every other characteristic the reason it's not predictive um in my opinion this is is because there are so many other things to take into account and and so many things that remain unanswered um we don't know how the fee market is going to play out we don't know how bitcoin's privacy characteristics which are rather weak are going to play out and most importantly we don't know how the geopolitical environment of uh currency wars is going to play out in the broader 150 trillion dollar market that is the planet and and and bitcoin isn't exist in a vacuum it exists in that soup of competing forces um and how it plays out will depend on a lot of other factors of which bitcoins um inherent characteristics or design um trade-offs are only a small small uh part uh no one can account for um unforeseen events you know um how does bitcoin respond to a pandemic that's not a question we were asking eight months ago how does the dollar respond to a pandemic um you know what is china going to do next we don't know the answers to any of these questions and and the the space the geopolitical battle of currencies has been heating up for a decade but it has now reached a point that we've never seen before so um you know that's why i think these these models interesting as they are um are are basically operating only a very very small part of the broader picture well i think they there is a tendency in our industry to to to look for um easy comforting answers and take things as gospel i think that's a very dangerous tendency this is still an experiment um and i it's gone better than i anticipated and is astonishingly intricate and um operates very well but that doesn't mean that it it it will always go like that and it doesn't mean that it can't stumble yeah so this is actually where i wanted to take the conversation next is to ask about these different geopolitical um forces right now because obviously with the coronavirus and this unprecedented unprecedented quantitative easing um and now this recent announcement by the fed that they're gonna target an average two percent inflation rate and if that means letting inflation run higher than that for a little while then that's what they'll do to achieve that so given all these factors or any other macro forces that you see that could intersect with bitcoin in an interesting way how do you think these things will affect bitcoin's adoption and price over the next one or two years i mean bitcoin is now such a large like from when we were in it way back when it was worth ten dollars like the evolution of bitcoin or bitcoin getting to this level of adoption liquidity awareness we've got a bunch of macro folks like raul powell and others really digging in and talking about dan pirro these guys really dig in talk about bitcoin from a classical like macro perspective bitcoin is becoming intertwined with everything as bitcoin grows larger and larger it becomes it becomes part of every geopolitical conversation that becomes part of every currency conversation et cetera so i think that when we look towards bitcoin's future it will be intertwined with many different actions in the economy i remember back in 2013 i think i think it was 13 where cyprus was the big narrative in bitcoin about how bitcoin could help the cyprus uh population for them to get access to basic fundamental you know economic uh rights of like storing value and being yeah the valids that were happening at the time they got a haircut on their bank accounts and that was a big narrative driver for bitcoin back in 2013 and so i think like as bitcoin grows larger we're seeing bitcoin hit the bloomberg headlines on a weekly basis which is incredible i mean i remember i remember in 2014 we went to bloomberg and we're like wow this is gonna be one of the first times we talk about bitcoin at bloomberg and you know to see it evolve this far to where it's part of like i mean trump even the president of the united states talked about it you also had yeah i feel like andreas no i mean i i i i'm thinking back when you said 2014 i'm like in 2014 bloomberg invited me as a financial analyst i mean imagine how how how how empty the barrel was well andre you're actually a really great speaker for bitcoin so i wouldn't i wouldn't be so self-deprecating but actually i think when you covered your face i thought that was in response to dan's comment about trump tweeting well no no not but but i mean eat that too yeah that too yeah and we have jerome powell the chairman of the federal reserve say that bitcoin is a speculative store of value i mean that's incredible like we've gone from it's a very nerdy very niche group of people on bitcoin talk forums to the to the highest degree of awareness in terms of like the big stakeholders in the mainstream economy so bitcoin will be intimately involved in many major geopolitical conversations in the future is the tldr yeah you guys mentioned you mentioned the fed um targeting average inflation rate of two percent and um i found that fascinating because the word average um is very misleading because most people have an intuitive understanding of what the word average means and that intuitive understanding is almost always completely incorrect um let me give you an example um the average person has a greater than average number of arms why because there are a lot of people with one or no arms and there aren't that many people with three which means that two arms is a greater than average number of arms not the average the average is 1.8 or something like that if you do the math um and this uh fact relates to the fed in a sideways manner as follows in order to get an average of two percent given the fact that over the past 10 years we've been dragging along at somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5 that means that they have to go way above 2 in order for the average to calibrate it too um and so when people hear the fed is targeting an average of two percent they think okay so they're going to set the the rate at two and just and that will be the average no they're gonna have to set it much higher in order to drag it out in an environment where there are very very strong deflationary pressures at the moment um deflationary not because of um value appreciation of the dollar but because of a catastrophic collapse in demand which is the same kind of deflationary thing you saw in the last decades of japan that the bad kind of deflationary pressure so in the in the face of catastrophic collapse in demand because apparently people who don't have money can't buy  um the the end result is that the fed has to pull much higher than two percent to reach an average of two percent this is going to have really significant consequences um because when when you apply these types of percentage numbers to an economy the size of the united states and you have the momentum of that economy dragging it into the future when you realize you have overshot that target that's because you're on the other end of the elbow of the exponential curve and it's way too late so this is very dangerous territory um and and it's unprecedented i think the word unprecedented during pandemic has been overused but in monetary terms we are going through a monetary pandemic um that is indeed unprecedented and nobody knows how that's gonna play out so when i used to start my speeches about bitcoin i used to say let me tell you about the world's most radical and unprecedented monetary experiments and it's not bitcoin it's fiat we have never done this before this is a system that has only existed for 70 80 90 years um and we don't know how it works under the current conditions anymore that we know how our climate works so 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide we've never been here before it might work great but it's very dangerous when you're talking about 150 trillion dollar economy when the answer is we don't know and one other thing that i wanted to ask about the future and where things are going and this really intersects with our conversations about things with the economy going kind of in a more deflationary uh direction such as what happened in japan versus inflationary so we're seeing these new innovations come online next year such as kraken financial which is the arm of kraken that will be opening as the first crypto bank and as such it will not conduct fractional reserve banking and it will not lend which obviously is not how normal commercial banks operate so let's say over the next 10 years or even five years that uh you know there's there's an increase in the number of crypto banks that exist and they do not engage in fractional reserve banking and that becomes a big trend how do you think that would change the economy would it dampen entrepreneurship or you know i just wonder um you know we've been saying that uh bitcoin can have a deflationary aspect to it or disinflationary um as dan mentioned and we've been talking about the downsides of that with you know what happened in japan and yet at the same time we also know the downfalls of influen inflationary economies so when you throw this into the mix what do you think will happen while kraken may be full reserve there will be other banks that decide to be fractional reserve and they'll compensate the risk that their depositors are taking to giving them an increased yield right but those won't be crypto banks because to to qualify for the charter that kraken financial got they have to keep full reserves but so you're talking about like a normal bank yeah i'm talking about how in a if we're competing for customers uh you're going to have full reserve banks you're gonna have fractional reserve banks and there are different advantageous you know setups with each one and with the fractional reserve banks they're going to have certain uh where they lend out there you deposit your money at a bank they take those deposits deposits and they lend them out and they give you a return now it's likely that those banks will be able to offer you a higher rate of return than see a full fractional reserve bank that does not lend out any money so there are advantages and disadvantages trades of both a fractional reserve and full reserve bank with kraken we see this as an opportunity to layer on many other new types of functions for our customers we are now much more tied into the banking system we can get around certain sort of choke points in the regulatory models where before we would have to rely on someone else so now we can be more have a more direct relationship with the mainstream economy that way we can offer more services to our customers there's a wide variety of things that we're exploring there i can't really dig it and dig in or give any sort of concrete details as to what that feature or what that function might be just know that this is a giant leap forward in terms of a much more intimate deeper stronger tie to the mainstream economy that enables us to offer more crypto services i i want to add to that which is the the the fractional reserve banking is tied very very closely to the monetary policy um if you take something that has the monetary policy of bitcoin lending it out is an extremely risky business very very very risky not just for the lender but also for the borrower um taking out a loan in bitcoin that has to be repaid in bitcoin given both the volatility the opportunity of a fomo bubble event uh appreciation storm um the overall deflationary characteristics this is not a monetary system designed for lending i think one of the challenges we have in this space is that people take a um a monopolistic money system that they understand which is the fiat system 194 countries 194 flags 194 colorful currencies and monetary policies and they think of that in terms of a zero-sum game or a winner-take-all system and from that perspective you would arrive at the conclusion that okay so when bitcoin replaces all money then x happens um and i don't think that's ever the case uh i think in fact that what bitcoin did was that it created a mechanism by which um various types of monies can be created with various types of monetary policies bitcoin has an extremely opinionated point of view on monetary policy which is very suitable for certain things but i don't think that becomes the monopoly dominant system i don't see any reason why it would um it can become the dominant system for saving um but that doesn't mean that there aren't other monies uh both national fiat and um other monies that exist in other cryptocurrencies and those may have very different monetary policies and may offer opportunities for lending and things like that now that will mean that they're not a sound money um so i'm not really worried about the scenario of what happens if all money is bitcoin and therefore lending an entrepreneurial activity stops not even what happens if bitcoin is the dominant form of money we are so very far from that and don't really have the tools to analyze it i think we're past the era a limited number of monies in our planet um we are now in an era of many different systems and again this is very controversial and i keep getting flack for this that doesn't mean that's what i want that doesn't mean that's what i hoped for i'm simply recognizing what is actually happening which is humans and their irrational stupidity are going out and creating monies with stupid names that they're giving to their friends and other people and then they're pursuing these things even though they most likely have very very poor value characteristics i am recognizing that this is happening and i'm recognizing that this is part of human behavior and will likely continue to happen um and and we just have to accept that that doesn't mean that bitcoin is any less in exactly the same way that the the zimbabwe dollar doing stupid stuff with their economy doesn't change the us economy just because there's other money out there that is doing other things doesn't change the value proposition of of the money that has a different monetary policy there can be other cryptocurrencies doing um very very crazy monetary policies that doesn't remove the value of of bitcoin but it also doesn't mean that the others are going to go away they're not because of human nature yeah i do think the experimentation allows us to explore in like a black scholes model-esque way of like what monetary policies don't work explain flexibles the black shoals models are like simply a random walk like how we go through pricing options it's how we look at modeling out future steps so we go okay well what if we took every single random variation from this current moment of a price and model that out and so with these different you know the different cryptocurrencies that have existed over the last eight years that i've been in this space i mean i've seen i've seen about like 10 000 cryptocurrencies come and go so we've certainly seen like that is never going to stop there will always be new cryptocurrencies created from a more bitcoinery perspective i mean i i've tried out things like i've owned ethereum i've mined prime coin i thought prime coin andreas probably remembers that it's it's a coin from back in the 14 era a long long time ago but it's um has something to do with prime numbers yes using proof of work to find prime numbers i thought it was more useful back when i didn't understand these were all experiments and and there's so many of them that's why i call it more of like a black shoals because there's so many random variations of monetary policy block size proof of work proof of stake hybrids hybrid proof of work proof of stake were really popular back in 14. and so we've seen what doesn't work and i think that definitely reinforces my belief in my personal opinion that bitcoin is the largest innovation in the space for me it it continually reinforces that bitcoin's design decisions were made properly as we see it continue to thrive and grow and we don't know what that means in the future if it'll continue to thrive and grow but it's certainly done very well up until this moment um and will bitcoin be the only currency in the future no but my personal belief is that it will be the predominant one if if it accumulates the largest amount of value stored in it then it seems to be indicative that that will also be used in the medium of exchange function where if i know that andreas and laura both have bitcoin it's likely that they will accept bitcoin from me versus uh you know this very very bifurcated world in the future where let's say there's ten thousand uh currencies that we're basically back to barter if we have like a thousand different types of currencies or ten thousand i'm not sure if that's really reflective of like a a new money which has superior characteristics to all previous forms of money if that would be the case yeah i think one of the things that changes dramatically is when the switching costs between different forms of money dropped to near zero um and then the the the major cost is the time value of money for the time that you hold a specific money which may be rather weak um versus the medium of exchange opportunities that gives you may actually change this equation of there may be more types of money um but if that becomes a routing decision that your wallet makes automatically um then um we may see a completely different conception of money although i do agree with you what's fascinating to me is that bitcoin in its current conception um which appears uh to have perfectly chosen all of the parameters or most of the parameters uh very neatly in this cohesive um way it is in itself an example of survivor bias meaning that the reason we talk about bitcoin and its parameters is because we don't talk about the 30 um currencies private cryptography based currencies that came before bitcoin that all failed because one of those parameters wasn't set up correctly uh we talk about bitcoin because it's still around um and therefore has proven through persistence um that those parameters sustain it and the longer that narrative continues the stronger it gets its surviving is one of its measurable characteristics that strengthens his possibility of surviving in the future and the narrative that a newbie hears but they hear bitcoin's dead again and then they find out that's not actually true and that causes a moment of cognitive dissonance what do you mean it's not that i thought it was that when the japanese ceo was arrested et cetera et cetera um that con moment of cognitive dissonance is a very strong point of narrative that reinforces the idea that bitcoin is perfectly tuned at least in the current context we live in all right so i honestly we could just go forever i honestly really did have quite a number of other questions that i didn't get to but i think through the uh you know various comments we've made we managed to touch on all the topics this is i think the longest episode i've ever done the conversation just was super fascinating and kept going however um we should give the listeners more to look up if they're interested in learning more about this so where can people learn more about each of you and where do you think they should look if they're interested in to learning more about bitcoin's monetary policy i guess i'll go first you can find me at danheld.com or find me on twitter at dan held and i wrote an article about bitcoin's monetary policy um that dives into the more metaphysical kind of a little bit more abstract idea of that bitcoin is you know bitcoin is the best application of information theory of money so i've got a couple articles on my blog if you want to read those to give you a more informed deeper dive into monetary policy security models so i wrote an extensive piece on bitcoin security model um and other aspects of bitcoin and then on twitter if you want more sound bitey very kind of more quippy quick hits on bitcoin that's that's where you're going to find that sort of content um you can find me as a antonop a-a-n-t-o-n-o-p on twitter and on youtube where i have 500 some videos on various topics around bitcoin honestly monetary policy isn't a topic that i talk about a lot most of my focus is on the technology and its social and political implications on on the future so if that's interesting to you um then you can find that all uh on my youtube channel great well thank you both so much for
