Chris thank you Laura it's great to be with you and where are you yeah I'm up at Skidmore College where I'm here for a short research and writing sabbatical and they kindly made available to me the Grossman recording studio at Skidmore Zen koan Music Center for me to speak to you this afternoon and it's it's terrific to be on your program I'm a big fan and at long last year I am with you so I'm delighted great and your sound is great so thank you to the center let's start with your background tell us how you became CFTC commissioner and generally what you did before you became a crypto dad yeah well thanks you know I probably have a pretty unique experience lifetime experience to be a CFTC commissioner and then chairman I spent 16 years practicing law in New York and London with technology companies especially at the intersection of technology and markets but then in 2000 I teamed up with some entrepreneurs and created the world's first electronic trading systems for over-the-counter derivatives and we raise private equity in 2005 we took that company GFI group public first onto the Nasdaq and then a year later in a secondary offering onto the New York Stock Exchange we had a we built a great company and great some some great technology and really melded humans and machines for really sophisticated trading trading platforms but in 2008 we found ourselves right at the center of the 2008 financial crisis we were the platform where credit default swaps against the major bank names were trading so we got to see in real time the panic that was hitting the marketplace about the potential for major money center banks to fail and not meet their financial obligations and I remember back then a call from a senior regulator at the Federal Reserve asking what we were seeing in the marketplace and I and this was about two days before the weekend when Lehman Brothers fell and explained that the credit spreads meaning the the cost of providing protection against the failure of these firms in their in their debt was growing by the hour and it struck me that financial regulators had no better way of really assessing the panic in the marketplace other than to call around two platforms such as mine to get a sense of what was happening in real time and I became an advocate for structural reforms of the over-the-counter derivatives markets that eventually made their way into Title 7 of the dodd-frank act which are the derivative provisions and in 2010 when when the dodd-frank Act passed I put out a statement commending President Obama and Congress for passage and and pledging to work with regulators to implement them in the over-the-counter derivative markets in which my company was one of the leading operators in 2013 I got a call from the Obama White House and they asked me if I wish to serve as a commissioner at the CFTC and I agreed to do so so I was appointed by President Obama and took my my position in July and June of 2014 and I was unanimously confirmed by the Senate and then in 2017 President Trump asked me to serve as chairman and I was once again unanimously confirmed by the Senate and I don't know how that happened either I either people didn't know what the CFTC was doing which is probably the case or I hadn't annoyed enough politicians in my first two and a half years but somehow I'll end up being denounced Lee confirmed a second time and served my full five years which ended in April this year and I stayed on until my successor completed the process and took oath of office in July so for the last hundred days or so I've been Footloose and fancy-free and enjoying life as a as a retired federal officer and as I say I'm up here at Skidmore College doing a little bit of research and writing there's many areas that interest me in the area of Technology and markets and public policy and as I'm sure we'll talk about as we go ahead this this next hour so during this time period that you mentioned you must have first started hearing about Bitcoin so how did you first hear about it and what were your initial thoughts well it's interesting right at the same time that the world was in a financial panic that the traditional financial intermediaries banks and other participants the the the marketplace for for mortgage securities the world's second largest market we're going through this enormous crisis this this failure of confidence this failure of trust what emerges from that but Bitcoin it's an interesting juxtaposition and I became aware of Bitcoin I think in the in the in the years that followed and and not just the the crypto asset element of it but also the core technology innovation of blockchain and in 2005 at the end of 2005 I did a fair amount of research in this in the area of blockchain in 2006 in 2015 yes sorry 2015 in 2016 and spoken boy the years go by fast don't they in 2016 did an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal and in and spoke at the cato institute and also at dtc sees blockchain summit saying that this is something that regulators really need to find a way to embrace and and the reason why it struck me so formatively was because of that experience back in 2008 as Lehman Brothers was falling at at that time the two days before when I got the call from the Fed asking about credit spreads the the general estimation was that there was about 400 billion of credit default swaps protection written against the failure of Lehman Brothers with Lehman Brothers as a reference entity and that was because the measurement was notional outstanding amount of credit default protection written against the failure of a given name and regulators estimated if there was 400 billion written on Lehman Brothers there was easily twice or three times that written on Citigroup and and and JP Morgan and and and chase etc and the worry was that a failure of that magnitude would bring down the entire global economy well Laura we now know that the net exposure of credit default protection written against Lehman Brothers was not 400 billion it was less than nine billion and nine billion is a much more manageable number and if we knew the net exposure of the various financial institutions the the the policy response of the federal government of the Federal Reserve could have been a much different one and perhaps a much more tailored one and perhaps a much more modest one than what eventually emerged in the tarp program how would we have known that back then well the technology didn't yet exist but that technology is blockchain if the derivative exposure of a financial institution were and I believe it will be someday recorded on a blockchain we could have gone from gross notional amount to net a notional amount fairly instantaneously so what blockchain offers and this is what I wrote about back in 2016 blockchain has the potential to bring a degree of instantaneous precision and and an almost cartographic precision to mapping interrelationships in the financial in the financial ecosystem to bear to in order to expedite policy response to given market conditions and so I think it's it's it's an enormous potential and I think will be realized breakthrough in the way policymakers and regulators oversee markets and of great benefit to our societies as a result and so I I'm a big advocate and proponent as you mentioned you wrote about that you know I guess about three years ago now and what do you feel in terms of progress what do you feel you know the banking sector I guess has done to to achieve that vision you know do you feel like people are using distributed ledger technology in any significant way and I'm sure you know that there are a lot of people who say oh using a private blockchain is basically just the same thing as a database so look there's this is no doubt hype always you know moves faster than reality and I there's certainly been some disappointment along the way but nevertheless it's still happening and we're seeing it in in the commodity distribution markets we're seeing it in many cases and I think that like all technological innovations it happens in fits and starts but the progress forward I think is it is X or ball I mean it is moving forward in those steps and when we look back I think it was Bill Gates who said when you look forward into technology it always seems like it takes longer than you want but when you look backwards it's amazing how far it's come and I think that's where we'll be ten years from now I think blockchain I'm confident blockchain is truly transformational it's just it takes time to get there are there any particular projects right now that you're kind of keeping an eye on or most interested in in that regard yeah what's so many I mean by again as a former market regulator and and as someone who's spent a lifetime at the junction between markets and technology it's it's really in that area that that I'm most enthusiastic the ability to bring precise understanding of of market its relationships you know the front office in our financial markets has been digitized for some time now and yet it's still the middle and back office that are going through that transformation but it's happening it is happening all right well we started actually talking about Bitcoin so I was curious like at the CFTC because you know this kind of became Bitcoin really became the first way that you guys had a deal with this pace so what were the early conversations at the CFTC like about Bitcoin step one for I think for any regulatory body is learning and understanding and my predecessor Tim acid had I and his team at the Commission had identified Bitcoin as meeting the statutory definition of a commodity and therefore under CFTC jurisdiction in 2015 when I took over in 2017 that that position of the Commission was fairly well established but we therefore were to better understand its its activity in the marketplace now the CFTC has a interesting jurisdiction its jurisdiction is over derivative markets for commodities not over the cash market except to the extent of fraud and manipulation but does not oversee cash exchanges for commodities we were approached in the summer of 2017 by two large exchange operators to go through a process of self certifying Bitcoin futures the United States and the CFTC are fairly unique amongst global regulators in that the Commission itself does not approve new derivative products what it does is it allows licensed exchanges to self certify that products they wish to offer derivatives they wish to offer meet the core principles set out by the by us by the CFTC as a regulator and based upon that self certification the product goes forward now why is that important in the last since since that became the statutory basis for the CFTC's operation in the year 2000 from that from 2000 to 2017 over 12,000 new products close to 250 products a year are self certified through the CFTC and it just to give you a sense of comparison a colleague of mine at CFTC who used to be an official at the Indian Stock Exchange told me that during the same period of time less than several dozen new products had been self-certified had had been confirmed in India and the reason is is because India requires the commissioners to vouch that the product is safe for the market you think about politically appointed officials having to vouch that a product is safe they'll never do so because of the risk reputational risk right well Congress wisely took that away from the CFTC commissioners and said don't bring political judgment to bear allow the exchanges to self-service or to find new products so when we were approached in the summer of 2017 we instructed the staff to go ahead and treat this like any other new product and and and verify the self certification but we were also you're talking about from CMA and SIBO when they wanted to offer the Bitcoin futures contracts exactly Laura that's exactly right but at the same time we had our office of chief economist look at where with pricing of Bitcoin was taking place and what we saw is from its origins in 2008 2009 all the way through winter early 2017 early first quarter 2017 Bitcoin the cash Bitcoin had traded in a fairly consistent correlation to its fundamentals which would be the cost of production and and you can trace back over those years and see a fairly close correlation but in the in the late first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter of 2017 that correlation broke and Bitcoin was headed straight upward and by the time by the time we received the self-certification applications we recognized that Bitcoin had broken from its correlation and was now increasing in value very very rapidly and there was a concern that they were bubble conditions arising most markets trade in correlation to fundamentals a classic bubble is when fundamentals are broken and you have a market without without an underpinning and while the staff was advising to go forward with the self certification we were also conscious that the presence of a derivative as exists in virtually every other asset class that exists and include and in fact we were aware that over-the-counter derivatives were beginning in Bitcoin and so the we we had the expectation that the launch of the derivative would have the effect of of regaining some equilibrium in the market and that's what happened from a high point of close to 20,000 dollars per Bitcoin over the next six months a Bitcoin returned to a rough Coral with its cost of production still with some a great deal of volatility but volatility and in many of the markets overseen by the CFTC is not unique the VIX futures for example are very volatile and other asset classes are volatile as well so volatility is not unique to Bitcoin but but a return to its correlation with its cost of production was was one of the results of the self-certification of Bitcoin futures by two leading operators and it's interesting you bring this up because I you know I was gonna ask you about these comments that you had made which basically referenced this you said at the Pantera summit quote one of the untold stories that the past few years is that the CFTC the Treasury the SEC and the National Economic Council director at the time Gary Cohn believed that the launch of Bitcoin futures would have the impact of popping the Bitcoin bubble and it worked so I'm just curious to hear also in general what were the conversations like between all those agencies and how concerned were you about that bubble so so the the agencies that you mentioned have regular phone calls to keep each other abreast of activities in the market that that the various agencies in the various heads oversee and I kept my colleagues at the other agencies abreast of the process of the self-certification of Bitcoin futures and also advised them of the estimation of the CFTC's office of chief economists as to what we thought the impact of the Bitcoin future would be on the Bitcoin we what we were then perceiving to be a bubble and what would be the impact of it and it played out as as the economists and others would have seen and but the other thing Laura that's critically important to remember is that Bitcoin futures bought a degree of transparency to the market that it was vitally important that the spot exchanges are not regulated by any any federal regulator the the data that's made available is not subject to any type of regulatory minimum standards the the presence of two regulated operators CME and and and C bought into the space and and the the the transparency that a listed market brings as opposed to the over-the-counter derivatives trading that was already beginning to take place brought a degree of transparency that's vitally important to the market the first Bitcoin futures were cash settled and that means they payout and US dollar value in the US dollar value of the contract but more recently firms have been launching physically delivered Bitcoin futures which payout on the Bitcoin value of the contract do you think physically settled Bitcoin futures will affect the market differently from how the cash settled ones did you know I hear I don't have the benefit of the office of chief economist to give me a kata metric analysis of that I I think it but I do believe that generally in maturing asset classes the combination of both a cash settled and a physically settled derivative is just another step forward in the in the development and the establishment of that asset class as a viable global tradable marketplace and we've been talking about bitcoin but obviously a lot of people are curious about ether as well were there conversations between the CFTC and the SEC or other agencies over whether either should be classified as a security or commodity and if so what were those conversations like and how is it ultimately decided that in its current form either is not a security yeah so so one of one of the things that the Chairman Jake Layton to the SEC and I at the CFTC did in 2017 is created a informal ad hoc crypto currency working group between the two agencies and the working group did a number of things one is it made sure that on the identification of new crypto asset classes that our analysis that each agency's analysis were done in a coordinated fashion and that we would consult with each other to tell each of our firms each of our agencies how we were seeing that asset class against our statutory authority and and and and in a sense making sure that that asset class is that the SEC might have seen as a security we agreed with that and we didn't we didn't have a contradictory view that it was a commodity under CFTC jurisdiction and chair Clayton and I were very determined both to have certainty on our end but also to provide certainty to the degree we could to the public the other thing the ad hoc working group did was to make sure that when it came to matters of enforcement that our activities were coordinated and not at odds with each other in the case of Bitcoin we shared our analysis with them that we the CFTC viewed it as a commodity and in the case of ether we had numerous conversations sharing our analysis and in the lab CFTC primer on virtual currencies that that ask questions about ether and and discussed crypto currencies in general we we drew on some SEC input there and it was part of the ongoing consultation between the two agencies and I believe that consultation continues to this day following my departure from the CFTC one of the questions the cryptic community has been asking a lot is how and when something such as ether goes from being a security to a commodity do you have an answer to that yet or what is your thinking on that you know I could give you a complex legal answer but the simple answer is there is no simple answer and why is that and how unsatisfactory is that I mean it's tremendously unsatisfactory but one has to remember that the statutory basis for the SCC's jurisdiction and the statutory basis for the CFTC's jurisdictions are over 80 years old they go back to the 1930s they were written in a in an analogue world a world of paper documentation of truly analog sales activities and market activities and the world has changed so dramatically and the digitization of trading and the digitization of sales and offerings of securities today results in a world that looks nothing like the world that existed when these when these statutes were written and that's why I for one have encouraged and continue to encourage policymakers on Capitol Hill to look at these statutes and refresh them for a new digital error but until they do we are a nation of laws and and and and both the SEC and the CFTC must as best as they can work with a an old statutory framework and try to find a way to repurpose it for a vastly different digital marketplace a digital securities marketplace a digital commodities marketplace now one in that in that challenging environment the CFTC has one advantage and that is it is a principles-based regulator and it has a long tradition of looking at its statutory framework and discerning from it what are the principles on which those provisions were written and applying them to new environments in a based upon core principles the SEC is very much of a rules-based regulator and it's very challenging to repurpose rules that have been applied in very very specific fashion for decades in an analog world and to try to apply them in a different way for a digital environment and for new digital asset classes and so I do not want to underestimate the challenge this this poses to the SEC to do that but but we ultimately and there's some very good projects and thought underway about what a new what a new digital base tools could be available to regulators but but we really are reaching the point and I think that the digital asset classes are really forcing the point that it's time for a refresh and many of our core statutory frameworks and yeah can you get more specific on that because you also were quoted and this is from July 2015 you said quote in the 1990s a Democrat White House in a Republican Congress worked together around this thing called the Internet and took a first do no harm approach regulation came slowly and let the technology evolve I think we need to stay close to it we need to be careful but and I got there was like a little break in the article so I think you're talking about you know blockchain technology I think we need to stay close to it we need to be careful but I think we can let it develop a little bit before we run in with regulation so since this was July 2015 are you saying that now is the point where we do need that refresh or would you continue to kind of let things develop further I think it I think we are approaching the point in which we do need that refresh and I think that one of the challenges I think for the CFTC and the SEC is to analyze the changing nature of the markets that the two agencies oversee to identify public policy issues in those changes to identify shortcomings and limitations in their existing statutory frameworks and to go to Congress with recommendations for updating the statutory frameworks to enable the two agencies to continue to serve the public in making sure that securities offerings are done with adequate disclosure with accurate financial and and other information and that the CFTC can make sure that markets in which Americans and people all over the world engage in for commodity derivatives and maybe crypto acid derivatives are well regulated our transparent or our free of fraud and manipulation are and are safe for engagement by Americans from retail and institutional I think we are we are clearly reaching that point you know what I'm just realizing that last quote actually was from July 2018 I there must be a typo here I don't know why I wrote 2015 anyway so in the same interview in the summer of 2018 you said you felt that the CFTC was getting behind in regulating blockchain related issues and you were saying that the amp the agency was hamstrung in different ways for instance you said the CFTC can't operate a note on a banking consortiums blockchain even if it had been invited by those institutions because the information and data that they would share with you would be considered a gift another example you gave would be that the CFTC could not purchase or rent the ability to run a node because it would require an appropriations bill from Congress and you do a contrast with how the Bank of England has already had four years of tests under its belt so is the safety C still hamstrung in this way or has the agency been able to remove these obstacles so this is part of the CFTC's authorization by Congress there during my tenure and continuing today there are limitations in the CFTC's ability to participate in a proof of concepts and other innovation developments and and beta tests and and innovation frameworks because to do so would be considered a gift to the federal government by the other commercial entities involved in those projects and during my time as chairman I advocated forcefully that our authorizing committees should draft legislation allowing the CFTC in the name of good public policy to participate in those technology innovations in order to both learn from them but also to adopt those innovations in the agency's own operations and I pointed out that the FCA the financial conduct authority in the UK has that very power and was active in areas that the CFTC had to remain inactive and that we were losing ground as a result of that and I I'm pleased and why is it that we haven't been able to change that situation it's simply congressional rule writing it's not within the power of the CFTC to change its own statute it needs to be changed by Congress now I understand that there is legislation potentially to be introduced that will change that and give the CFTC the authority to participate in these programs and I and I you know I mean I have statutory requirements for one year after I leave the agency not to be advocating for particular legislation so I don't want to say more I just do hope that Congress finds a way to address this issue so that CFTC can can engage in a lot of these very important developments that are going on around it great so in a moment we'll be discussing some of the other big developments in this face such as Libra the Chinese digital yuan and also what Kris plans to do next but first a quick word from the sponsors who

announced its plans on Libra what is your take on Libra well I think it's faster just just putting aside my public policy point of view I just think it's it's a fascinating development to me it speaks of a fundamental generational change so when I was entering my public life one of the most important relationships that I had was with a banking institution the banking institution to provide financing for a car and ultimately a house a banking institution to cash my paycheck etc etc but the current generation coming into public life has much more foundational relationships with online merchants with with social networks far more important than their relationship with their banks and so it's no surprise to me that as they think about mediums of exchanges they think about payment mechanisms that more primary relationship with whether it be online chintz or or social media is is an area they may look to provide them with payment rails then then so I think there's a generational change going on and I think that in some ways whether it's Facebook or uber are recognizing the importance of the relationships they have with members of society and I think banking is late to the table I mean if you walk into most bank branches today they look like the bank branches that that I grew up in and not not that this generation feels comfortable in and and I think banking relationships are way behind the curve of human relationships and I think that in some ways Libra is a reflection of that so so that's that's aside from my public policy at that's just as a as an individual I'm fascinated by it I think that however the outrage over the last few years of the mismanagement of personal data and the handling of that has raised a lot of public policy concerns and I think that perhaps Libra has suffered from from that in it in its launch in recent times so meaning you feel like if it were an entity other than Facebook making the same proposal that it would have had a better reception I think that that's quite likely certainly from policy makers so before Facebook announced its plans with Libra it was reported that you did speak with them what what did you say to them at that point or what were they you know what did they come to you for yeah so so Laurie I think as a as a chairman I made it this dorsa same policy as my predecessors this Chairman is not to share those conversations and I think I'll maintain that since but but Libra came to the agency to disclose their plans as they did with most of the other financial regulators and gave regulators the chance to ask questions and understand their operations now is a derivatives regulator the CFTC would have been more likely not on the front line but on the second or third line in the rollout of Libra so it was good to have a chance to hear their presentation was good a chance they haven't chance ask questions I think that's broadly what was discussed and now that you have seen the full plans for Libra in terms of the structure of it etc there's been a lot of discussion around you know which agencies you need to regulate it etc who do you think needs to regulate it well certainly they'll be regulation in the form of anti money laundering AML regulation in terms of what level of traditional market participants are engaged whether it be bank institutions or traditionally regulated entities in the space I think there is some challenge with the evolution of the proposal itself to identify which and how which agency and how it would be engaged as as a from a frontline regulatory basis but do you have any thoughts on which one that would be you know since I'm not a regulated or right now I don't want to make call for a regulatory response what what I broadly believe is that there is room for a lot of experimentation and development broadly in the in the payment rail process I believe as you know because I've written about this recently in a digital Central Bank currency and and certainly a digital dollar but I don't believe in it at the exclusion of other offerings and I think that there is I think competition is good for virtually most things in the marketplace and I think competition for payment mechanisms is a good thing I I'm following the launch of ubers direct payment mechanism I think I think that is is helpful I believe that the backed offering is also a positive development and the Starbucks yes yeah okay and that's the back to being offered by ice and I really want to see how Libra develops now I believe that the issue of of customer data is a critically important feature and I think that is something that that needs to be satisfactorily addressed in oil offerings not specific to Libra okay yeah so I was gonna ask you a question just directly you know do you think or or if you if you were in the position would you allow Libra to go forward and it sounds like you're saying yes that you feel like all kinds of different options should be allowed to go forward you know I I tend to look at development from a market regulator point of view you know markets are our healthiest when they have a great deal of diversity where they have both diversity of offerings but also diversity of market participants and markets will establish the value better than virtually anything else of an offering and of a new asset class and so I think there are public policy concerns outside of markets there are public policy concerns about access to participant data there are public policy concerns about the right oversight and regulation I believe all of those can be addressed over time ultimately though I think that in a free market system if the rules are clear if the regulation is clear in a market participants play by those rules and play by those regulations the market is enhanced by more offerings than it is where offerings might be suppressed for vague notions of what's in the best interest of market participants I think markets themselves can often work out what's in their own best interests best okay well a related note let's talk about China's digital currency plans what is your take on the digital yuan well it's it's it's fascinating I think as in many things China's very good at setting a forward direction and and and even if all of the details aren't worked out heading in that direction I think the the launch of a digital yuan is a an important step you know I I recently as for another project I'm working on it been looking at a little bit of the history of of currencies and international commerce and at many times in human history many currencies had vied for utilization in in cross-border trade in the 17 and 1800's the dominant coinage and international trade was the Spanish dollar and it was superior it was perceived to be superior to other currencies for a number of technical reasons one is that its silver content was more consistent and more pure and therefore the currency was more stable these are the competing currencies in that way you might consider the dollar today to have some of that same perception but the other reason why the Spanish dollar was considered a superior currency in international commerce was because it had a technological superiority it was both lighter than other coinage but it could be broken into eight separate pieces known as Pieces of Eight and that allowed a fractionalization of it and that's a really interesting technological enhancement if you analogize that to the fractional ability of of cryptocurrency and it strikes me that when we think about a global competing market which the dollar is everyday the dollar is competing for the patronage of the world's population against other currencies you think about it traditionally providing stability and a lack of inflationary pressure but also its convenience factor is vitally important and for the same reason that I said a little while ago that I thought there's a societal change going on today with young people having close connections with their social media providers and there merchants they're also living in a digital world and they want to be able to have electronic transfers directly from their mobile device and and so if the dollar is going to maintain its its global predominance which which I argued in a Wall Street Journal piece two weeks ago isn't I believe in the best interest of the United States then the dollar needs to also focus on its convenience factor not just its it's perhaps stability and and and and soundness but also its convenience factor and creating a digital component to the dollar in in an increasingly digital transactional globe globe I think is is a vitally important step that I that I strongly advocate the Federal Reserve to consider so we're gonna talk a little bit more about your proposal for the digital dollar in a moment but I actually just wanted to ask one more question about the yuan which are the digital you want which is do you view that as a threat to the US dollar well again i that Chinese is being very clever there's no doubt in my mind that and I think many people's mind that that China would like to have the yuan have the advantages that the dollar has and being an important global reserve currency they're taking steps to develop commodity markets priced in yuan they're they're taking a number of steps to make the U on a global benchmark and a global reserve currency and I think they have recognized that part of the the the attributes of a truly digital currency is convenience and I think moving to a digital you want is a smart move and I think that we in the United States cannot sit on our laurels and assume that the dollars predominance today will be the dollars predominance tomorrow or 10 or 20 years from now the dollar has enormous strengths and those aren't going to dissipate overnight but week again we can't sit on our laurels and I think developing a digital component to the dollar is a smart move to preserve the dollars predominance as a global reserve currency yeah so why don't you now describe the proposal for listeners there were certain features of it that kind of piqued my interest but but why don't you just sort of generally describe what it is that you envision sure so it's actually quite simple and I believe it's quite non revolutionary we are not proposing that other forms of other crypto assets that could be used as currencies be suppressed or prohibited so our proposal would be compatible with a with a development of Libra would be compatible with Bitcoin would we it's not calling for and any type of doing away with any other asset classes secondly it would be compatible with existing market infrastructure players so the traditional banks other financial institutions but also non-bank institutions like social media platforms like online merchants would be able to utilize it as well what we're proposing is very simply a standard protocol that would be made available to anyone who wish to use it that that has accounts with with individuals or institutions that that are dollar-based accounts could transfer fiat based accounts into digital accounts and make them available to market participants and others in the marketplace so it is it is not exclusionary it would rely upon existing infrastructure it would be available to it existing infrastructure providers we are proposing though that the protocols and the and the and the algorithms be developed in the private sector and that's simply from experience to know that if it's going to be done and going to be done any time soon it really needs the private sector determination to be able to get it done you know a federal government that unfortunately couldn't a healthcare website and eventually had to go to the private sector to get it built I don't think is capable of building us itself but there's no reason why the federal government shouldn't have governance over this protocol builder shouldn't have a stake in it shouldn't have oversight over it it you know it should be done properly with proper oversight but but with with the determination and a fastness of of the private sector yeah and it's just in your description of it you said that it should be created and maintained by an independent non-governmental group so it seemed to me what you were saying was that you're not proposing a central bank digital currency and and it seems even from your description here it's my right okay exactly so if you if you're if you're if you're if you bank with a major Main Street Bank you would probably electronically and instruct your bank if you've got a thousand dollars in the bank you may say load 500 digital dollars onto my mobile phone through my bank app and I can go buy my Starbucks in the morning using that and the transaction goes through your traditional Bank relationship if you've got a an account with Amazon you may be able to or PayPal you could utilize digital dollars through that so it's not the Federal Reserve is not going to get into the retail banking business this would all be done through traditional dollar based account relationships that everybody has in one form over another it would be combination of Zelda meets JPMorgan coin that's a great description and one other thing I did notice in your Wall Street Journal up at was you said that the Federal Reserve actually should hold the dollars that back the digital dollar like in escrow accounts so basically that is the role that you would delegate to the Fed well the the key though is that what we're proposing would be monetary policy neutral it's not meant to put more currency into the system or or be deflationary either it's meant to be money supply neutral so for every digital dollar made available a a traditional dollar would be put on reserve so that it is monetary policy neutral I should say money supply neutral okay and for the independent non-governmental group who would you suggest for the members of that I I would you know as we did with this with the space program back in the in the nineteen fifties and sixties I would say let's get the best minds available let's get the best development teams available and let's build this with the sense of what's in the national interest and and there's there's there's a lot of good technology out there from you know crypto secure digital wallets to a lot of standard blockchain construction components being made by very forward-thinking firms so III would say let's get the best and the brightest and the most advanced and and put it to work in a way that when it would establish this digital dollar sooner rather than later Oh interesting own AI understand so basically like private companies yeah okay okay and private companies that may also be contributing to the Liebherr project or other projects as they say our proposal is not to the exclusion of them but it's too hence enhanced dollar now some of those offerings may change as a result of a digital dollar but I still think there's room for many in this environment just as historically there's been room for many different mediums of exchange and so okay so I was gonna ask you about Libre you know if you felt that their initial plans to make it a global staple coin that isn't tied to any particular fiat currency you know if you feel that that was the way to go or if they should go the other route that is being suggested where they have many stable coins tie to fiat currencies but it sounds like you feel like maybe both have their place or something like that I do and and and the other thing Laura is is I don't I don't want to position myself as a critic of one offering or another offering I I think that the marketplace will establish what are the right features as it should and I think that the various offerings will will find their way to the right value proposition or not that should be for the marketplace to determine ah I'm I put my hand up really in a very singular and simple fashion is to say that amidst all that's going on it's in the best interest I believe of the United States to create a digital dollar for the maintenance of the dollars privacy as a reserve currency in the market and and I view that as something that's doable I think it's doable in a fashion that would be inclusive of many different innovators in the space and I think it'd be a way that would not be exclusive to curtail all the competition and innovation and healthy give-and-take in the marketplace that's taking place amongst other crypto assets and crypto currencies so um in terms of talking about the private sector and and competition I did also want to ask about an incident that happened in the last couple months where Leger ex CEO Paul Chu wrote a series of tweets claiming that the reason that ledger X would not be the first to have physically settled Bitcoin futures is because of personal animus that you had toward ledger X over a blog post he wrote I guess he or his firm had submitted an amendment request to add futures in November 2018 and normally there's like a 180 day window that the Commission has from the filing of the application to either approve or deny and there was not a response there were other pieces of information that came out where you know they I guess had written letters saying that you had called one of lesser X's board members and said you were going to make sure that their their D Co order was revoked and not their things like that what is your response to their allegations well Laura you know as chairman the agency it's a long-standing practice going back to the founding agency for chairs not to talk about individual applicants and their applications and it's inappropriate for a chairman having left the agency to suddenly start talking about applicants in their app so I really I'm not gonna respond to that and that's the way it is I think that people that know my enthusiasm for innovation development the space will form their own judgment as to what those allegations with the statements by that chair that CEO is and after leaving the cftc you joined the chamber of digital commerce as an adviser and obviously you made your proposal about the digital dollar what are your own plants and the crypto and blockchain space going forward well it's it's an exciting time for me I can now focus on developments in in the area that have long fascinated me I've for most of my professional career 35 years or more I've operated in sort of the intersection of markets technology and law public policy and there's so much going on in that in that triangle right now and it's a time when I can engage on those issues of interest and not strictly in in the area of CFTC jurisdiction but more broadly and so I intend to do this I'll be serving on a number of boards I'll be doing some advisory work and really focusing on topics and areas of interest and there's so much going on the space it's kind of a fun time to be a former chairman of an agency and an agency with a well deserved reputation for being on the cutting edge of markets and being ahead of the curve and so it's an exciting time I've having a lot of fun you're famous for telling Congress in February 2018 about how your kids were interested in Bitcoin and how your niece is a hotel or how do your kids and knees feel about Bitcoin now when the price is a little bit different from where it wasn't for a 20-18 well my my niece to her great credit got in very early so she's still in a good position but she's still a holder and has been buying other asset classes as well and and and likes to tell me about the different features she's she's actually in the the world of software development is very technologically proficient herself and so she's a great resource to me I come from a family that is long been active in in in technology my father was engaged in medical technology developing some of it my brother Charlie Giancarlo is a very successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur and CEO of an online storage company and was chief technology officer at Cisco Systems for many years and it were a family that that that really is fascinated by the ability of technology to to change to bring societal change to bring convenience to bring to improve our lives and in my world of financial markets had a very successful time at GFI group building some of the first electronic trading systems for over-the-counter derivatives and I saw the way technology can improve markets and so this is a time where as a private citizen I can I can engage in different areas of technology innovation and have some fun doing it so I'm having a ball great so I guess that means that you will try to retain your title of crypto dad well you know it was a it was a it was if I could just actually take a moment tell you that was a very exciting moment who would have thought that one would get the title crypto dad and and and you know tens of thousands of Twitter followers from a Senate hearing but they do you know so so as it boasts ended hearings you're required to give a long written testimony and the night before I was flipping through the 80 or so pages and hundreds of footnotes of the written testimony I had submitted to Congress in advance of that hearing and I had to prepare a five-minute oral statement and I thought there's no way I'm gonna summarize these 80 pages and so I said you know tomorrow I'm just gonna go in and talk to them just person to person and I went in the next morning it was my time to speak and the lights on the dashboard went green and and the and the and the and the studio lights lit me up and all those senators were sitting up there on the dais I took my glasses off and I said senators if you don't mind for one minute at least I'm not gonna speak to you as the chairman of a regulatory agency but I'd like to speak to you as a dad and say I've just been banned from our annual family ski trip with with my kids and my nieces and nephews and every night at dinner all everybody was talking about was Bitcoin and this is a generation that at least my kids I had tried to interest in the stock market when they're growing up and had opened small brokerage accounts for them and had gotten no interest but suddenly they were just fascinated by Bitcoin and as I was saying this I could look up on the dais and I saw all the Senators heads nodding or at least some of them up and down and I said you know what I think perhaps some of you have witnessed the same thing in your own dinner tables and so senators and I I knew I had their attention at that point I said you know I think we owe it to them to give a really not to be dismissive about this but to give it the respect it deserves and to treat it with seriousness and and and to build a regulatory structure that that is that is that is sensible and in which you can that there's there's gonna be some rationality and thoughtfulness to it and if nothing else let's protect them from people that would try to take their enthusiasm and scam them but it best actually builds something that's better than we have today and and just as I finished saying that my Twitter account just exploded and I went from something like 1,100 Twitter followers to you know 40,000 or so in in the next you know 24 hours you're right and strange things happen in crypto land I love that story and in your family do they tease you about it Oh teach me about it all the time teach me about all the time but you know but it that's the way I feel today I mean that's that's I still feel that way I still feel that that in since my generation has a responsibility to the next one not to leave them with a mess of ray of eighty-year-old regulatory provisions that really don't make sense in a in a century after they were written but to kind of enhance them and make them work or at least write new rules that make them work for a new error so that my kids can build what that tomorrow looks like on a basis of a sound regulatory footing and I think that's the challenge that exists right now in this new environment is to take the enthusiasm the energy the the innovativeness and give it a sound regulatory footing built upon age-old principles of of transparency of openness of fair dealing of sound regulatory practices when people put you know much any any asset into an account that they have knowledge of where it is and it's there when they want to go take it out that that there's sound practices that there's sound cyber penetration practice that there's proper disclosure of the financial underpinnings of the venture all the ones that are there but they're there for an analogue world we need to make them apply to a digital world so I think it's a big challenge but I think it's one really to embrace and I'm really enthusiastic about embracing it great well thank you
