I have a lot of like theories You could argue some of them are conspiracy theories in some way so though there's two there's two trains of thought here right either either BlackRock knows something and since there's an Avenue here and they they know and they they found a little narrow way to get through and they think Gensler is going to waver a bit on what's going on or they just think they have a narrow way and they're filing for the chance anyway so we'll start with that second one first even if the odds I've said this on multiple occasions but even if the odds of of uh spot Bitcoin ETF approval for eye shares being first are like 10 right even if they view the odds it's like pretty low of them getting approval based on the fact that the SEC has a lot of experience denying spot Bitcoin ETFs the the chance that maybe we think we can get through and be the first is critical I mean it's it's significant money we saw bito the Bitcoin Futures ETF the first one to launch that thing took in a billion and a half dollars in two days so that and you're charging fees on that obviously that's significant money even for somebody like brackrock it's not enough
