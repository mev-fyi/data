bankrupt crypto under Celsius not to be confused with the energy during Celsius which unlike the crypto lender will at least temporarily boost your mood I only 1419 page Court filing on Tuesday stating that eligible users will soon be allowed to withdraw about 94 of their assets that's like the length of two Lord of the Rings books said way too many of Celsius as creditors you guys know they they make books for adults now this should be good news I mean 94 also sounds like a lot unless of course it's your assets for what it's worth I think it's possible that we share like 94 of our DNA with the toaster oven there are just a couple of tiny catches transfers need to be less than 7575 when they were first made I also need enough money on the platform to cover your gas and transaction fees you need to update your customer information and you need to be at least five eight oh wait sorry sorry I'm thinking in my hand because users will find out whether or not they're ready to start the withdrawal process on February 15th that's right some single Celsius users are about to have two very dark days in a row
