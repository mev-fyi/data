[Music] hi everyone welcome to Unchained the podcast where we hear from innovators pioneers and thought leaders in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency I'm your host Lauren an independent journalist covering all things crypto as he heard on the podcast last week I was at South by Southwest Y moderated panels and spoke with people at several crypto events I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who came out and also to those of you who came up to say hello I love meeting listeners and it really means a lot to hear from you especially since when I started this podcast I never ever ever would have dreamed that it would grow to become this popular and actually ever be something other people cared about since I'm looking back to when I first started and when this podcast had a tiny audience I also want to take this moment to thank my first sponsor on-ramp and to thank Matt Rose ak who introduced me to them I also want to thank Chris curtain at fractal recording who is such a pleasure to work with because he is so chill and to Elaine's LV who is a master of all things podcast related most of all thank you to all you listeners who have tuned in to the show even though for most of us how I've done this podcast I've had pretty much no idea what I'm doing I'll be at more conferences in April and May and so if you see me in person please don't be shy about saying hi Unchained is sponsored by ppreciate founded by Ed Stevens appreciate is building the most valuable relationships on Earth today preciate is recognizing someone for a big achievement in the crypto space who will be recognized today for their achievements stay tuned to find out this episode is brought to you by start engine leaders and innovators in the crypto world are

unchained is brought to you by bitwise asset management last year bitwise created the world's first cryptocurrency index fund the bitwise hold 10 which holds the top 10 cryptocurrencies and rebalances monthly the fund has several hundred LPS and is currently accepting accredited investors to learn more and invest in the bitwise cryptocurrency index fund visit WWE's investments comm slash Unchained today's guest is Mike Bell she founder and CEO of crypto security company bit Co welcome Mike hello Laura how are you Oh doing great thanks for joining the show thanks for having me we're gonna get into a whole bunch of topics around security including the physical dangers people who hold crypto right now are facing we're gonna talk about the challenges Institute's institutions faced with custody but I wanted to dive into your background first because they think yours is sort of the classic case of someone needing something and then just deciding to build it yourself and you actually were on the podcast before to discuss segue to X which for those of you the listeners who don't know what that is there was an attempt at a hard fork that didn't quite manage to succeed and maybe a good episode for you to check out if you're not familiar with that would be the one with New York Times reporter nathaniel popper where we discussed the aftermath but Mike so let's fill in your personal history can you tell us about your pre Bitcoin career how you got into the space and how you came to found bit go sure well I've been a technologist for I guess 25 years now doing mostly startups in Silicon Valley been a number of good ones actually my first startup I guess where I got the taste for it was a netscape back before that was a public company back in the mid 90s and I have always enjoyed you know kind of the early phase of building product ever since then so so that's kind of what I've what I've done more recently I've been at Microsoft when they they purchased a company I had which was a email search company before email search was a was a thing and then I landed at Google for a while where I was one of the first guys on the chrome team and and invented a protocol called speedy which later became HTTP 2.0 so if you're using your web browser right now you're probably using that vertical so that's kind of before I got in the Bitcoin somewhere thereafter I started hearing about Bitcoin I wish like many I had been a little bit faster to jump jump in the first time I heard about Bitcoin I think I thought it was a scam the second time I heard about it I thought it would never work and not know maybe somewhere around the fourth or fifth time I started reading and then I realized holy cow this is interesting stuff so I helped I bought some I help my friends buy some and kind of being that the technologist of the crew I was using cutting-edge state-of-the-art cold storage you know which was on my laptop which I securely stored and underneath my couch at the time I printed out the backup copies which were securely stored in the laundry room separate from the laptop but that was a different time and the value on that laptop just continued to grow and I worried that's you know something would happened to that laptop from my from a history at Chrome you know we had had we had we had seen the stats of malware growing on the internet and just the rate at which attackers were were coming out there and so I was afraid that someday I would go to plug that thing in and I would get malware on it I would lose the money or whatever so I started investigating for a better way and I found a little corner of Bitcoin that was relatively unused almost almost completely unused at the time called p2 Sh and that's paid to script hash and that's really the underpinnings of multi-sig technology for Bitcoin it had been introduced into into the Bitcoin network at least a year prior to my having stumbled upon it then but that looks like a good answer to me because we can start to separate the keys that were used to secure these wallets and and build a better better system so that was how I got into into Bitcoin that go evolve straight of that and so for listeners let's just define multi-sig which as I think may be what a lot of people when they hear the name pick oh they think of that as sort of like a signature service that you guys offer how does that work sure well when you get into security really what it's mostly about is continually breaking down any single point of failure so a single point of failure a simple example is wallets at the time we're just a single private key right so you had an address which is the hash is a public key and the the private key protected it but if you lose that private key if you encrypt it and forget the password if your heart just crashes if you get malware on your machine that's able to compromise it that's a single key that can be lost so to secure it tighter you can split that into multiple keys so the simplest example is you split it into two keys and now an attacker would have to get two keys and you can then take those two keys you can put them on two machines you can take those two machines you can give them to two people you can take those two people you can put them in different organizations you can take those organizations put them in different countries put them in different jurisdictions to your graph geographies etcetera so you just keep splitting it apart then you can go from two to three to four so each one of these can add additional security and there's other techniques that we use also with multi-sig related to helping with kind of backups the sad the sad truth of public key infrastructure is that humans can and will lose key material and so if you have a a wallet which is dependent upon to two keys and one of those keys is lost or compromised in any way you know you can be out your money so we use backup keys and this is where we use an MLM model so we use two of three mostly at that bit go so additionally you can create kind of a backup key where instead of just having two out of two signatures or three out of three you can do it so there's two out of three or two out of four and you keep a couple of backup keys in case people didn't lose their key so all in all that's what we do at the lowest level with multi signature and it's the underpinnings for a number of other security mechanisms that we prior to provide on top of that well it's the one thing that I was wondering about what you were describing here is I feel like there's attention rightly if I have money if I work sorry if I have some sort of crypto then I totally get the security of splitting up the keys between different people and across different geographies and jurisdictions but there's you know if it's my personal money then I need to suddenly let these other people who who hold part of my private keys know what I'm sort of doing with my money at any given time right so how how does that part of it work that's right I mean it's always trade-offs so at the simplest level of just you know having two or three technology is fantastic we can bury this behind technology in ways that you don't even see it so it really looks just like any other single signature wallet and we can do some automated co-signing where some of those keys are running automated rules that are set up in advance you can do others that are with close friends so that they're actually approving or you could do remote friends or other companies and obviously the the more parties involved and the farther away they are geographically especially if there's time zone differences you know that can cause delays but you know at some level for the the deepest security you do want more that I think increasingly this year we're gonna see multi-tiered wallets coming out we're at the the coldest level they're using a number of people that are hard to pull together and do take time to get together and then at the shallowest level the more hot wallets it's almost you know completely automated so you can use a blend of this and it allows you to to mix the needs of fast access with the needs of deep cold storage okay so no matter what essentially I do have to give up some privacy to do the multi-sig like there's no there's no way around that well there I was referring to time to access your funds more than privacy sees another issue but I think for the most part folks that are looking for this type of security of course they're looking for for privacy of their overall balances but that's been less of an issue I mean keeping it safe is first and foremost what they need and the privacy that you give up here is I think minimal but yeah that's weak answer okay and then when you talked about time is that some sort of like built-in delay for transactions over a certain threshold certainly can be so that's one of the policies that we do offer is just the ability to say hey look if you have a transaction that's more than you know ten million dollars I want to have a 24-hour delay on it and we want to be notifying you know these ten people regularly during that 24-hour period you can do that okay is that from emmagan Sears idea cuz he was on the podcast and talked about something like that I actually forgot the name of it um well there's spent time locked transactions there's a number of Technology mechanisms for implementing this he had a vault proposal that he had put together which was sound and I forget the specific details but it probably had something like this I think he was trying to push these rules all the way down to the chain which I believe is a good idea by the way you know bit Co sits on top of the chain in many ways we use multi-sig at the chain level and we provide a couple of layers of security on top of that but the safest way to store your coins is to actually move these rules into the blockchain directly so that hasn't happened in Bitcoin it could be that someday we see a secure coin that that's a that actually does push these all the way down to the chain yeah I feel like I actually might have even seen on Twitter that he said something like oh there's this new token that is incorporating this idea but I don't remember which one it was that um okay so we've been kind of getting into the weeds but I actually want to step back and just ask you what do you feel are the main problems around security in crypto overall well I think we've continued to see breaches um I guess in my view you know the digital world is inheriting a problem that our banks never solved which is they never solved security and they've been digitally moving money in traditional banking systems for quite some time but they guard it and mask it with human labor and slow policies and you know layers and layers of insurance basically you know with your Visa MasterCard of course we're all familiar with paying three to five percent between the purchaser and the seller back to Visa MasterCard and that covers the fraud right why is there fraud well because they never fully solve security at the banking level we have the same issues we have wire transfers that go at the the low level say West a hundred thousand dollars less than fifty thousand dollars fraudulently you know thousands of times per day it's a major problem this is because identity is not fully solved for for banks so as we come into the digital world where the escape is so easy once you manage to get your hands on the digital money you're you're out in the irreversible way the consequences of not having these security layers or security Combes solved is far more severe and that's very prominent we're seeing that so exchanges keep getting hacked other businesses keep getting hacked I think primarily it's that you know people are trying to move fast it's a competitive world they're trying to build products and while we all say that we want to put security first it's actually very hard in practice for companies to do that so oftentimes they learn the hard way and consumers go with it so we do know how to secure these digital assets it's hard it's not always the fastest thing to do somewhat ironically it does mean going back to some of the policies that traditional finance uses in terms of making sure that human guards are in place but yeah it's a complicated problem hopefully in the future we wouldn't need human guards and we could solve it with software or somehow but let's now into the exact products and services that bikal offers and how those have evolved over time we've sort of touched on this a little bit but I just want you to give you know the overview of all your main products and like which ones you started with and when and then why you edit on these new services okay sure well that's great we started out as a noncustodial wallet and we use some multi saying as a mechanism to do it so although securing digital currencies is difficult we very much believe in the ethnos of what you get from Bitcoin you know which is the ability to kind of hold your own asset and stay secure so we've been trying to make that work I think fairly successfully for the last several years just for people who like you know some of this is a little bit jargony when he says non-custodial wallet that means Vicco isn't holding the funds you know and like offline servers or anything like that like you still be in control remain in control of your funds that's right what we mean by non-custodial is that you know you're not trusting a third party like big go to keep everything safe literally with our non-custodial product Vicco can disappear off the face of the earth suddenly and you still have all of your money and that's a key critical elements of the first phase of what what we've done that solution has been deployed to hundreds of exchanges and broker dealers and payment processors even some hedge funds out there all around the world and they like it a lot because they don't want to trust somebody else to keep everything safe you hear a lot in the in the Bitcoin ecosystem about you know trusted third parties and if you talk to security experts they'll tell you trusted third parties are very difficult to manage over the long term they often become the problem and one of the great things about Bitcoin is that it's created a mechanism where you can control your own assets and can't have control yourself however Bitcoin hasn't fully solved the problem from a usability perspective which is that frankly none of us are security experts and securing your own keys when it's $200 or $1,000 so maybe $10,000 is okay but I can't tell you how many people have spoken to that are absolutely terrified that they've got $150,000 or 15 million dollars or 50 million dollars that is completely at their own security level like they're responsible for everything so the backups did you put them in banks properly or he's protected from if your house burns down do you have malware on any of your computers is someone trying to attack you is there spearfishing going on I mean all of these threats are real and we usually don't think about them I just to give an example we had a we had a customer sign up with us I think it was mid last year as etherium was really going gangbusters and they were excited they love the bit go multi-sig wallet that they were getting with ether and we signed him up and they started using the product a problem about four weeks later they called me up they'd been hacked now they hadn't lost a dime through bit go there Big Joe is safe and in fact there's still a customer today but they had lost on the same day 1.5 million on Kraken and a half a million on Quinn base and what had happened is that they just didn't realize how important the security elements which they needed to walk through are and they've seen metaphors with their traditional clients like you're Wells Fargo account which led them to think they were safe specifically they wanted to be able to trade on the exchanges they created a shared account with shared email address so that you know a couple of guys at their firm could trade and they thought well T we're not going to use two-factor off I'm eeen we don't need it for our Wells Fargo account we'll probably be fine and if we turn it on then he can use the account but I can't use the account right so net results is they didn't use two-factor off long story short their email had been compromised before they ever even owned a Bitcoin the hackers were already in their email servers so the hackers saw that the signups coming from coinbase and Kraken waited for the money to get deposited and took it all out so it's an example of they had the onus was on them to secure their coin they didn't really understand how to do it they didn't understand how important the metaphors that they have from traditional finance did not lead them to success and as soon as they got out of a system which requires you know independent usernames passwords shared wallets pakodas all of these things that go requires two-factor off you can't get out of it that's why they're Vicco is not compromised but the other accounts were so anyway securing assets is something that we're just not familiar with so when for something like that do you have any products or services that would help someone keep their coins on an exchange secure yes so in terms of the Beco product lines first we have the non-custodial wallet which is what they've been using so they have two keys themselves and we walk them through a more complicated provisioning process for setting up the wallet and and in those wallets were kept secure additionally just recently Vicco has entered into an agreement to purchase kingdom trusts which is a state chartered trust company which is limited purposes bank out of South Dakota and the purpose of us acquiring that company which is pending regulatory approval at this time is to start to offer custodial services so as much as it it's powerful and important to make sure that we are not trusting third parties to keep us secure all the time there's a number of cases where people really do need it so if you have a business and of course there's multiple parties at the business maybe you're running a hedge fund you very much want to to have a security system in place that protects against insider theft coercion of course all of the basic losses password password loss hard disk crash malware etc and it's really difficult to do this inside of your office so a hedge fund for instance has never taken direct custody of assets for any other asset class the idea that they would do it for digital assets is scary to them and the types of money that they're talking about which is hundreds of billions of dollars makes it really important so they do have oftentimes fiduciary responsibilities to their customers to find the best way to secure their assets and they've traditionally use banks trusts and others that are really experts in securing whatever the asset is so for these folks we're building a custodial solution this is one where you actually do get the keys to a trusted third party I think we will continue to evolve those solutions over time so that the trust is not the same as the trust was with a traditional bank like you know you may have put your money with or a particular hedge fund advisor maybe you put your money with Bernie Madoff and trusted that he had the assets what he didn't we can make it thanks to blockchain technology we can make it far more transparent so that customers still get benefits of knowing other assets are there being able to monitor them while also getting benefits of the security that comes with hiring professionals to take care of the keys so how does that work in just so let's say that I'm a hedge fund and I want to use what will eventually be your new custody solution if if this goes through it like so I know I've talked to some of the crypto hedge funds in the space and I know for instance they are you know buying Hardware wallets like a ledger treasurer or whatever and putting coins on there and then they have this elaborate method for ensuring that nobody can't pretend that I don't know if people have heard Ari Paul talk about this but he says that they they wrapped theirs in bubble wrap and then they create a pattern on the bubble wrap in glitter nail polish and the reason that they do that is because then they I suppose photograph the pattern that it creates and then when they go to open it they can see whether or not the the glitter nail polish it has a different pattern or not but obviously you this is something that he's doing in person so he needs to be able to physically access those devices I don't know is your solution something different because I don't imagine you're just gonna put a whole bunch of different physical locations all across the world you know for people to access so how will that work well it's I think it's a great example you know so in that case he's taking responsibility for physical security of those small personal devices that means he has to protect it from fire so he's gotta have a backup somehow that means he has to protect it from tampering that's what he's doing with the bubble wrap he needs to protect it from just being hacked it's only got a small pin code if somebody knows your pin code that's a problem he needs to protect it from insider theft what if the people that are legitimately at the firm that do know how to access it decide that it's time to take the 100 million dollars and go it's difficult to securely protect things um we we don't have anything else fund managers have never taken physical security of assets on anything else so he's trying to solve a difficult problem another you know often forgotten problem that could emerge just like okay let's say he does that and then heaven forbid you know he should become incapacitated or pass away or whatever unexpectedly how does the firm recover the fund steady putting sufficient backups with instructions to others such that they could recover the funds and if he did how did he do that so that he didn't expose his customers to other forms of insider theft where now there's 2 or 3 or 10 people at the firm that would have ability to access the funds now all these things are manageable and solvable you can come up with mechanisms for backups and you print them and you you know you've got their USB storage and you can protect it from different types of attacks you can put that into bank vaults and you then can have one in New York and one in San Diego but you know most people have not had to secure assets where they they think about all of these edge cases so as a custodian we can think about all these edge cases we do take care of backups that are stored across geographies we do take care of making sure that no single person has access to enough key material we are able to do key ceremonies to make sure that the keys are securely generated we're able to do all of these processes and procedures to keep your money safe so that's nice the kingdom trust deal goes through how is that going to look is that going to be like let's say that I'm a crypto hedge fund and I decide that I want to do business with you then is it a similar thing where my coins are gonna be held on physical devices that are in somehow in your control or I don't know how this how this works because a presumably things need to be kept offline right yes yeah so um first off the products available today so big go and kingdom of working together for a couple of years now and evolving this product so one of the reasons the the merger the two companies made a lot of sense is because we have a history of working together we've been providing both individual accounts individual retirement accounts security as well as for funds for some time the way we do it is multiple offline vaults so yeah everything is air-gap nothing is online we know the procedures and processes for using the software offline everything Lee is a system of checks and balances actually for a fund where you know it starts out with fund requesting a transaction to be made that's verified both electronically and out-of-band not electronically then a second request is made from from Kingdom Trust over to a secondary vault which is in a remote location there it has to be again out-of-band verified that this really is you know Kingdom trust I think is verified all the way back to the customer again so you've kind of got this checks and balances system where all of the parties involved are checking all of the other parties and we think it's very secure and it's all offline and it uses best practices in stay dr so then in terms of protecting against insider fraud or theft then is it that this is split between for instance let's say the hedge fund itself as well as bit go and then but do you know what i'm saying like is that huh okay um so in the case of where who holds the keys no we usually don't give the the hedge fund a key actually because even if you give one key they tend to lose then forget passwords etc and that creates a big problem for everybody including the hedge fund but we do separate all the keys across different groups no single group of people has access to multiple keys and in fact even myself I cannot I cannot actually go and get people to put together enough key material one of the things you've been reading in the press lately is about physical threats where people kidnap you and force you to do stuff until you get a transaction side so we of course are very concerned about the safety of our employees and we have built a system where we believe that that is just not possible banks have been doing this actually for some time you know like the bank vaults at your traditional finance bank they only open during certain hours and you simply cannot open those vaults they won't open the middle of night you can't kidnap the CEO of a bank take him down to the vault to make him open it by using multiple unknown locations for where the keys are and using many of those keys across separate teams and then by not disclosing to any one person who all of those teams are we can actually take out this threat so but all of those teams are within Vicco technically yes but nobody knows who they all are huh okay I do know that that almost sounds like a single point of failure almost okay no no no I mean you're correct like when you're trusting a third party you're trusting a third party but the problem is is that when you have a fiduciary responsibility for a hundred million dollars or a billion dollars you know who's gonna be able to deal with that are you gonna take it to a bank or are you gonna take it and try to build all the security mechanisms in your hedge fund of course the hedge fund can't do it so I think over time we'll build these systems you know better and better and you'll you'll have control over your fonts and yet we'll also be able to solve these these security mitigations we're going to discuss best security practices violent crimes against people in crypto and more but first I'd like to take a quick break to hear from our fabulous sponsors by Ed Stevens appreciate is building the most valuable relationships on earth in each episode of Unchained appreciate sponsors the recognition of an individual or group in crypto for an achievement this week we are recognizing jinglun Wang executive director of the blockchain education at work

to attend this incredible summit I was speaking with Mike belshi the CEO of BIC oh we've talked about the kingdom trust deal but haven't explored it fully what is the significance of that deal sure well you know for the last several years people have gotten very excited about Bitcoin digital currencies mostly in the retail space and the institutional markets have been unable to participate so we don't have funds really we don't have a lot of the traditional market participants and we're still figuring these things out but when you do start to look at what a hedge fund and asset manager or any traditional finance company would need in order to participate in digital currencies they're looking for custodians and you know we've had this thing called the 1940 investment act around since 1940 it defines a notion of a qualified custodian and you know the the markets that we have and the structure that we have for stocks bonds pretty much any asset other than crypto is very different than what we see in the crypto world now you could love it you could hate it but part of its design is around safety of money which I think everyone actually appreciates so we're all familiar with Bernie Madoff he was a guy that said he was holding on to a bunch of assets on behalf of his investors and he was not and so you know the SEC made updates to this just a few years ago and declared that hey if you have a if you have a fund SEC regulated fund with more than hundred fifty million dollars of assets in it you are required to use a qualified custodian so in order for those types of folks to participate in digital currencies we simply have to have custodians they play a real role which keeps first and businesses alike safe and we think that this this this big go+ kingdom approach is the first of its kind and it's going to be enabling a whole new set of financial products and a whole new set of institutions to participate in digital and what are some examples of those new products and new institutions that you think can participate in this ecosystem well we've been hearing about them for the last several years I'm I'm not sure how many folks have tried to put together ETS and the SEC has come down every time and said no no no but just in January you know the SEC issued a new letter and they they outlined a set so they set a fairly high bar frankly for what's needed in order for an ETF to be approved by the SEC but you know number two on their list is custody and they called out this exact issue which I just described which is all right if you're gonna have an ETF that's going to hold these digital assets who is the qualified custodian this is standard par for the course for how the SEC would look at any ETF non-digital they're just looking for a similar analog in the digital world and can you define qualified custodian for me well the qualified custodian defined by the 1940 Investment Act is a custodian that adheres to you know that legislation and regulation but you know kingdom trust is a qualified custodian for instance what custodians do it it sounds like it's complex but it's actually fairly simple at the bottom of it is safekeeping of it obviously you need to keep everything secure in the digital world that's primarily technology and security above that you have a bit of compliance it happens it's about you know make sure you've got a new I see the customers making sure that's the daily prices are kind of markets to us doesn't the value of the asset is marked in a regular way back to US dollar in a bowl and verifiable way that's pretty much what a custodian does and who are some other people that can benefit from a qualified custodian sure so right now it goes primarily focused on the the institutions that are moving more aggressively and that is a number of funds there's been index funds you know maybe in the not-too-distant future it'll be ETFs but actually pretty much any financial institution that's holding Bitcoin for any reason probably wants to rely on a custodian so if you think about how you hold bitcoins when it's yourself that's one thing you can hold a key you trust yourself etc but it's very hard to have that within a business organization where you aren't opening yourself up to insider theft so generally anybody that's holding on behalf of others is going to want to use that another place though where custodianship becomes interesting is even for just large net worth individuals so ironically although digital is great because you hold your own keys you can keep it yourself it's very difficult to do that and unlike any other asset whether it's real estate or whether it's your bank accounts your stocks your bonds there's nobody you can go to if you lose the keys so you know if you lose the deed to your house you go down to the city and get them to give you a new copy of it if you lose your driver's license and all your ID and a fire or whatever you can go down to the DMV the banks you can get things but with your digital assets you can so once an individual gets to a large amount of digital asset they render this problem like wait a minute how do I store it and how do I store it in a way that I can pass these millions of dollars on to my heirs so think about the problem of like alright I want to pass this on to my heirs but if I leave instructions with my lawyer describing how to access the private key how do I ensure that my my lawyer isn't gonna run away with the money right now now he's lawyer maybe you trust him maybe you don't maybe split into little parts it's relatively easy to shard a key it's a little harder to shard a lawyer mm-hmm so how does that work if you use this qualified custodian is that what you're saying custodians certainly are a very good answer right now I mean with a custodian of course you have to choose your custodian wisely but you can set up beneficiaries you know right when you create your account and then should you pass on there's a very known process for how your trust or your heirs can access those assets and something else I was wondering about is additional custody different from other kinds of custody part yes in part no you know we talked about you know safekeeping and kind of compliance verification record keeping the rules which applied to being a custodian of a digital asset are the same as what you for any other asset and from a regulatory perspective or a legislative perspective I think that's the way it should be however when we think about custodianship we think about banking you know we start to think about the existing models that we have in our industry about how banks and custodians work and some of that we like when they keep our assets safe and some of that we don't like when they lose it with digital assets we have an opportunity to modify custodianship so that we can still have the benefits of the digital world for instance seeing your funds transparently on the blockchain anytime even though it's with a custodian you can actually verify this still there the second thing we can do is we can use multi signature in very interesting ways so that you always are participant in transactions that are related to you so you can still have someone else have custody but you can participate in it and that's a mathematical verifiable thing so that no one can say that you authorize something that you didn't actually authorize okay that's all that all sounds very interesting so what do you think are the best things for you sir for everyone from users to businesses to do to manage their crypto like what would you if let's say that I'm just starting out and I meet you you know at a bar or something and I'm telling you oh I just bought some Bitcoin what would you recommend to me to do to keep it secure well first I need more information so for everybody it depends on how much value you're secured the amount of time and money that you spend securing an asset is proportional to the value of the asset so if you bought your first 10,000 dollars with a Bitcoin I would tell you to go put it into an online bit go while it and not worry about it you could also use a hardware device if you like that the ledger devices are very good they're designed for individuals and consumers so that they work great if you're an individual and you are storing millions of dollars then you have some more issues so a you would need to to use the more advanced security features which take some time you can use a lot of them directly from from bit go specifically you'd want to have some amount of redundancy in case you know something should happen to you so that you can pass your assets on to your heirs and there's some mechanisms for doing that you may actually if if you want to just avoid the technology you may just want to be able to give it to a bank you know so a kingdom style individual account could be could be useful for a small multiple million dollar type of account where you need a beneficiary and whatnot now if you're a business it's a different story so businesses come of all forms some are looking to just buy and hold others are transacting and depending on the situation there you may need multiple wallets you may need you may need just one wallet and then how you secure it is can depend on how much money's in it what the institution typically will help the institution identify key players that will be active participants on the wallet will make sure that the backups off set up right and we'll leave it went lead them into cold storage okay and earlier when you were talking about how if one of the key players died or something then they would still need to let people know how to get in how do you manage something like that so bigger provides that today that's something we've been doing for several years now so it with vicko you can have multiple people on on a wallet let's share that wallet in a secure way one of the challenges of Bitcoin and digital currencies is that the blockchain just knows about keys right and so you can create a wallet with many keys but so the blockchain all of those keys are equal it doesn't know that one of those keys is held by the CFO one of those keys is a controller and one of those keys is you know some some lower linking ranking employee Vicco allows you to have a layer on top of the blockchain which defines all this so you can give particular rights to the CFO which are differentiated from the folks that are spending money which is differentiate it from a secondary team which is for backup purposes you can then route approvals between these teams as appropriate for your business what we find is that each of the businesses that comes to us has slightly different needs in terms of how they run their back-office and how they want to manage their compliance in their risk hopefully that make sense and I wanted to also go back to this question about exchanges obviously last year or two years ago now there wasn't she wear BitFenix was hacked and vicko was involved in helping to secure the funds on Biffen ik so what exactly happened there well um you know BitFenix has never fully released the details and of what happened well tell you a few things I mean BitFenix was breached they were hacked they were pretty significantly breached for a long period of time and eventually the hacker was able to steal the money but what service were you providing because presumably it was a service where that shouldn't have been able to happen correct well in the non-custodial model remember the customer still has two keys and is a critical part of security in this case the customer did not keep all of their authorizations separate on separate machines independent from everybody and it did lead to a breach so I would I would love it if it Phenix would publish the full report so that everyone could know exactly what happened obviously for confidentiality you know of our customers we can't can't release it ourselves but they did admit fault within just 24 hours or so publicly that it was on them so this is the kind of thing where for the service you were offering there was a way to do it that would keep things secure and they didn't follow that protocol is that what you're saying that's absolutely right so I mean after after that that event of course there were a number of audits both internal and external done on the bit Co service and the biggest service itself did not have any flaw was not was not breached in any way obviously if you don't keep your keys and your credentials safe and secure and you let attackers to get them then then things can happen and we've made a couple of changes we no longer trust our customers to keep their policies protected over we know that no longer trust that they will keep their policies protected and we lock them down more but there was nothing wrong with the the model that they were using it's also a good example of why custody actually is necessary in a lot of cases you know at the end of the day but BitFenix you know they have a lot of things to do they want to run an exchange they probably never actually wanted to hold the asset directly if you look at other types of exchanges for other asset classes the exchange never holds the asset this is a pattern which is unique to digital currencies and you know so their job is to go make a great trading application yet they are saddled with security and what they really want to do is to be able to have their cold storage just be super secure I don't think that they are ever going to be the best at doing that and hiring that out to somebody else could be a beneficial thing for everyone involved I know Wayne said there was something I didn't quite follow there you're saying that most exchanges actually don't handle their cold storage I didn't say that no um I you know the way digital currency exchanges have evolved initially that you know there was no bank that you go to there was no custodial solution so they had no choice except to take custody directly and in fact even today there's basically none there's there's no independent custodian that will hold digital currencies for you now Kingdom and vicko are the first one here in the United States so now these solutions are emerging anyway these guys grew up these exchanges grew up without having the option of giving someone else to custody they didn't have any reputable vendors but this is emerging it's the foundation of the ecosystem gets stronger by the way are you familiar with did you see the sec letter they came out mid-january about what it would take to have ETFs be successful um I don't think so no why well it's a great letter the the sec set a very high bar in terms of what needs to happen in order for ETFs to be approved and they they they they raised a number of questions about you know market manipulation and other things but a huge part of that was custody the SEC said how are can we have an ETF and so we have a good reliable 1940s Investment Act compliant custodial solution available for digital currencies and I think that very much is relevant here so the exchanges that exist today they're they're like financial institutions but they haven't had anyone that they could go to as an independent qualified custodian past and that's changing well so if that's actually something I was gonna ask you about because earlier when you said that Kingdom you're the service that you'll offer with Kingdom Trust is the only one like that so obviously we've had this announcement about coinbase custody and then ledger is offering I'm just blanking on the name is it ledger Enterprise I think is the name and which is you know their own custody solution and then there's also another project that I know about that hasn't been announced yet so how does your service offer differ from those other ones well the main thing is its shipping today and probably the largest cold storage installations in the world but so coinbase did announce that they're going to have a product and I'm sure they will have a good product they they do a lot of good stuff but you know coinbase is a consumer company their main job is signing up a hundred thousand new consumers every day and I think they do that reasonably well obviously they've had a lot of site outages at peak periods but I think that's gonna be their main focus whereas we're an institutional product so I think coinbase getting into the institutional space is going to be a different challenge for them ledger is a great solution they've been building Hardware wallets you can use actually a ledger device as part of a Victo solution if you want we do support that it's like one key of many in the bit co-products they're a little bit more of a roll it yourself so they provide underlying technology and then if you want to go and open up satellite offices and multiple geographies so that you can do multi-sig around the world you can do that but they don't provide the service around it so actually I'm not 100% familiar with all of what they're offering on their enterprise products but when I last spoke with them and they made it pretty clear that they wanted to support just kind of the the underpinning hardware and technology so it's more of a roll at yourself type of solution and so but what you were saying about coinbase earlier about how they mainly are more retail focused I actually think I mean with G Dax as far as I understand there's that you know the clients there are institutional players or tend to be a little bit more so I don't know if this is like exactly completely new for them because I mean who who do you think are the customers for these kinds of products well I mean I think you could ask coinbase better if you want to know who their customers are but I mean generally like including fur for what you're doing with Kingdom Trust well so I mean a tremendous number of folks have come out of coinbase to Vicco actually in the last six months I think the first thing that really highlighted it for hedge funds was when we had the Bitcoin cash for back last August at that time a number of these folks had literally hundred million dollar balances that they had just stored a corn base and these were long long hold players and suddenly they realized wait I've got millions of dollars a Bitcoin cash and I can't get it how do I get it and that was when they realized that there's a big danger and not having having access to the keys themselves now coin mace they finally did release the Bitcoin cash but it opened people's eyes to this issue of how do I make sure that I've got a custodian that's gonna keep me safe through for some things like that so let's also talk about what you're seeing in terms of the clients that are coming to you what do you believe is the average crypto hedge fund managers understanding of security best practices well the early ones that came in are actually relatively good on their understanding but they don't have technology solutions combined with policies and procedures that they want and I think they actually are aware of their own their own shortcomings in terms of the average hedge fund I would say it's actually really low I think these guys primarily have been dealing with different types of assets in the past and their job is around building that fund and that's their expertise they're certainly not security experts so pretty much all of the funds have been clamoring to find a solution and a lot of them have been coming to Vic oh and do you see any kind of misconceptions or sort of outrageous I guess ideas around how to keep things secure where you feel like well well you know if you're gonna be in charge of other people's money maybe you need to get this part straight well I think when they're coming to us I I feel pretty good and we're trying to provide that for them they shouldn't have to worry about all of these details so they're looking for Vicco to help help solve those problems one of the challenges that I have had to answer a few times but people get it sometimes they'll say hey you know we want to be able to make withdrawal and have the money two minutes later well you know that's okay for small amounts of money but this is just not okay for large amounts of money it's it's just a fact that when you want to deeply secure large amounts I'm talking about hundreds of millions of dollars here it's not gonna be at your fingertips every minute so there's been a little bit of expectation sitting there where they kind of want real-time access but they also want it super secure and this is a trade-off that of course they have to choose between and you know once they hear the reasons why they get it and then you combine that by using a married hot wallet less cold wallet solution and this is one of the you know and the beauties of what bit go is doing with first is non-custodial hot wallets that we can now combine with the custodial solutions that we'll have you can actually do both and still have real-time access and the vast majority of your fonts or the security and this thing about using a time delay for security do you think that that's something that will ever be that we you know won't need some day like do you think that the technology could evolve to a certain level where they can store hundreds of millions of dollars but then also have access within two minutes and keep it secure um maybe I think it's a far away away and I don't think it's the right thing to be worried about I think the first thing we need to be thinking about right now is security the assets and the fact is is that when somebody comes to you and says that they're lower Shin you don't know the deceleration right now I do not know that I'm talking to Laura Shin I'm pretty sure I met you in person I recognize your voice but if I had a staff of customer support people and you're calling in to them and saying you're lower chin how do I know your lordship so I obviously we can use technology we have private keys we have many private keys but how do we know that Lauren wasn't hacked on her private key how do we know that she wasn't fished on her two factor authentication all of these things matter um the only way that you can do this today this is just you know the way it is is to take things slow for the large amounts money in the future maybe we'll get there um but right now we've got big problems like if we want this industry to grow up and get serious we need to solve the security problem you can't have the underlying asset disappear it's just not acceptable so the first thing we need to do is lock it down even if that does mean it's a little bit slow to access and then secondarily we can start to figure out how to make that faster so in 2017 we saw a number of physical crimes against people who owned crypto in different countries around the world this is something you alluded to earlier and we've even seen these crimes here in the US there was a Japanese woman who was actually murdered over what was a relatively small amount of Bitcoin I think it was I did the exchange I did the conversion on it it was like a hundred thousand and most of the other crimes are around you know like a millions of dollars at least but there were some other people who were kidnapped for ransom in places like Ukraine and Turkey and then others were held at gun and forced to transfer money from their private address to or from there you know crypto address to the trust of the mugger so are there security measures that people can take to keep them from being the victim of such a crime yes you know we have a love-hate relationship with banks we forget the part that we love but you know these types of physical threats don't happen kind of on the US dollar side of things today and yet now they're happening on the digital side and why is it it's because as individuals we if we have direct access we can cough up the money to the attacker but when it's at your bank it's a lot harder to get away with it so the banks are providing a service in terms of keeping safety of asset and that's that's what they're designed to do now what we don't like about the banks is they're slow and cumbersome in the process and cost a lot of money wire transfers are expensive etc so can we get to a world that is a better blend of that I believe we can I think you do it with a combination of personal and institutionalized storage so if you've got if we really got to a world where a large percentage your net worth is in crypto you really probably shouldn't hold it yourself if the attackers know that it's at your house with the attackers know that they can get you you are vulnerable and this is a unique problem to digital so what you can do is you can take that you give it to a qualified custodian which is a regulated trust company type of thing for the vast majority of funds and you blend that with a hot wallet so the hot wallet is a small amount of money you know it's kind of like you know the cash in your wallet you're not as worried about you don't want to get mugged but you know when you get mugged you usually don't get held at gunpoint murdered and things like that there's always some amount of risk that we carry with the cash that we have on person but we can do the same thing in the crypto world where large amounts of money they're stored with professionals far away from you make sure that the attackers know this right so make sure people don't think you have tons of Bitcoin on you if they think that you've got Bitcoin it's already too late once they've they've kidnapped you you'll be you'll be in trouble so I hope this problem gets better fast but it looks like it's probably gonna get a little worse before it gets better why do you say that because I think right now there are a lack of solutions that are institutional holding of money the people that do have large amounts of Bitcoin are prominence and known and I think unless you're storing with a mechanism which is immune to this and making that publicly known you know there's gonna be a few more of these so something that was a little bit funny is that your employee Jameson love replied to a tweet that I made about nathaneal poppers story on this topic he wrote about you know the different kidnappings and muggings that were happening in this space and I tweeted that you know part of the reason it's happening is that there haven't been good custody solutions yet and Jameson replied that he thought good custody solution was an oxymoron and it was a regression to legacy trust models however in the New York Times story he's also featured as one of the people who protects his crypto by by letting it be known that he has a gun so you know that rich person isn't gonna take these kinds of measures so I just kind of wanted to get your take on Jameson's opinion here and so it sounds like you think that reverting to the legacy trust model is sort of the way that this is going to go is that correct no let me give you three answers - okay first off I love Jameson's he's fantastic for a number of reasons but frankly he's a little bit off the deep end in terms of how to secure your Bitcoin in that article you see a video of him firing a semi-automatic ar-15s the rest of the world wants to ban so yes you're right if you want to have a small army that is one way to protect your Bitcoin he's also publicly made it clear that he is going to take extreme measures and move to a remote undisclosed location and you know kind of walled himself off from the rest of the world so you're right if you like that lifestyle of having your own gun your ar-15 s in the house and you know isolating yourself from the world maybe you don't need a custodian now the challenge is how do we get to a world where you're not having to just trust all custodians and I think we're gonna see where you see the pendulum swing a little bit both ways so today you're responsible for your own keys your own custody and then that creates a set of problems the custodial options aren't there yet there are not a lot of good brands available that will hold it that you can trust from a technology perspective that you can trust from a regulatory perspective that you can trust from a just risk perspective pinkos trying to build that with our solution now moving to that you're right like could look like you know the legacy model but now can we do something that blends the two and I think we can and actually I think the underpinning that we need for it is multi SE and it is a blend of allowing you to have some of the keys but not all of the keys and also to have a set of policies and rules around that wallet which are defined by you and the way you like it so when you use these things together it's a combination of hot and cold wallets it's a combination of keys across different parties we are not going to revert back to the legacy model so you can see your money on the chain which is totally different from anything we have a banks today so anyway I agree with Jameson in part if we were to revert back to the legacy models that would be very bad but I disagree that all custodianship is just carte blanche oh that's just the legacy model yeah it sounds like you are painting a future where there's it's a little bit like Goldilocks you know there's the one extreme and then the other and then this sounds like some sort of blend that you guys are working on so um maybe we will get there all right well it's been great having you as a guest where can people get in touch with you or see your work we're easy to
