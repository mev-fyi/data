hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the show that reveals how the marquee names and crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon i'm your host laura shin this week's show is a fireside chat i recorded at the stacks conference which was celebrating block stack's main net launch the topic was bitcoin layer twos and the guests were milton demirs chief strategy officer at coin shares and nick carter general partner at castle island ventures we explained why layer twos exist how they work what people are building and how moving bitcoin to layer two affects the value of the asset it was a super fun conversation and i hope you enjoy it now here's the show crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto earn up to 8.5 per year on your bitcoin download the krypto.com app now hi everyone and welcome to our panel layer twos on bitcoin with melton damires chief strategy officer at coin shares and nick carter general partner at castle island ventures welcome milton minnick hi hi laura uh so exciting to be here and i have to uh give a thanks to nick in advance i roped him into this i texted him i was like nick you're doing this i want to have a conversation with you thanks nick no i'm very glad to be here and that was a really great remix of uh of uh massive attack just before this so i was really enjoying that yes so was i all right so let's start our discussion by just defining what layer one and layer two are for people who don't know just to make sure we're all on the same page and also why multiple layers are necessary at all sure do you want to kick it off nick i can start i can start so in virtually every payment system there they they function in layers so um when we talk about layers in bitcoin or cryptocurrency it's actually completely in line with how things work in you know the traditional payment space so you know it's possible to send a wire as a consumer you know we have access to fed wire if we want but you know for the most part when you use dollars you're you know transacting uh with credit systems or peer-to-peer payments like venmo paypal etc those would be considered second or even third layers on top of you know more fundamental clearing infrastructure where you have batch payments which happen less frequently and they're larger in size and those payments at the bottom of the stack have higher assurances so and they kind of settle immediately as opposed to the higher layered payments which settle on a deferred basis you know so credit card payments are not final immediately so if you extend that analogy to cryptocurrency just to sort of contextualize it a little bit bitcoin payments would be considered fast settling high assurance payments so those are in my mind kind of utility scale transactions you can move huge amounts of value you can have confidence they're going to settle immediately layer 2 in my view is more about deferring settlement getting more scalability through trading off against those settlement assurances uh getting faster finality um by trading off again against the assurances so basically opening up the design space and mirroring those you know that layered model that we have in payments itself and you know i think that's really how payment systems scale as far as we understand them i think it's unlikely that unite everybody on the bottom layer you know that would be like if all we ever used for transactions was sending wires to each other so that's kind of my view of it multum i don't know if you have a different diagnosis yeah no i think um the way you articulated nick is a a great starting point um you know the analogy we use often is the bitcoin blockchain is more akin to to fed wire and what we've seen you know a lot of other protocols have moved more quickly to adopt layer twos i think ethereum in particular is one that from the very early days had a mindset to sort of start moving towards layer two and one of the interesting observations is over the last six months six months pardon really as we've seen the explosion of d5 and new financial primitives being implemented on top of ethereum obviously it's resulted in a lot of challenges in in network availability network throughput and rising price in in sending transactions across the network deploying smart contracts now obviously bitcoin doesn't function in the same way but what i think is important to note is um you know there is an important function here whereas bitcoin's usage grows and the adoption of bitcoin grows the number of use cases that people are utilizing for bitcoin grows we're going to need different layers that have these features that are optimized for the specificity of the use case and that's something that's talked about maybe a bit more in other protocols that are newer and i've had an opportunity to learn from watching what's happened in bitcoin but i think it's been interesting to observe you know um in many people's minds we really don't ever think about the amount of bandwidth we're consuming or the cost of connectivity to the core protocol with which we're interacting and in many ways the way i think about bitcoin uh for the first time in human history we have a way to price compute and connectivity there's a very real price that you have to pay to prioritize transactions in the mempool and so um in my view it's actually really like an internet interesting crossover pardon between some of the concepts around compute and connectivity and how routing topologies work with money right you're basically implementing a routing topology using transaction fees and money effectively that allow you to sort of create specificity in terms of what layer of the stack you want to operate um without compromising the security guarantees of of bitcoin and again as nick described there are inevitably going to be trade-offs but what we've observed so far as we look at the proliferation of bitcoin as an asset across other chains whether that's in the form of wrapped bitcoin or other assets is people really do want to have the security guarantees of bitcoin as an asset but they want to have the ability to adapt some of the parameters around how they're utilizing the network and some of the security guarantees of the their transactions particularly lower fee transactions or perhaps being able to deploy smart contracts or a more complex sort of logic that maybe isn't as easy to deploy in bitcoin script so i think that's very important the other piece i'll just quickly add that i think's really important since this conference is about developers developers developers uh tavara line from steve ballmer if you remember his famous developers developers developers speech is um you know electric capital puts out this great report um and it just came out it's their state of the developer ecosystem report and one of the interesting observations they have is there a lot more developers in other protocols than there are in bitcoin because bitcoin is notoriously hard to develop with and building a robust grasp of bitcoin core protocol takes much longer than perhaps some of these other protocols which are scripted in more familiar languages and have different types of logic that's more intuitive to say like javascript developers or other developer communities that are much larger so what i think's also been interesting to observe and we have this in the legacy financial system the entire legacy financial system is built on something called cobalt right which is like this arcane programming language um like most people who know kobo really really well are probably over the age of 60 because they were designing core banking systems in the 70s so there's actually this really interesting um technological risk that exists in our core financial system and our core financial applications in that the group of people who know and really understand and are experts in cobol are all going to be retiring in the next 10 years right so it's created this tremendous amount of pressure on the banking sector to replace some of these core banking systems that were built 50 60 years ago because there is a real risk of technological obsolescence and not having enough talented people to step into those roles and i sort of see the same thing happening in in crypto right there aren't necessarily tens of thousands of bitcoin developers out there who can build really robust highly secure layers on top of bitcoin and so um it's been really interesting to see what's been happening in the sax ecosystem and i'm really excited about the launch of staxx mainnet because i think one of the really important um design space constraints that we have to get through is the fact that the bitcoin developer community is just inherently much smaller than other developer communities because the level of knowledge required is very specific the amount of time it takes to become really proficient in bitcoin and to understand all of the nuances of why bitcoin core looks the way it does prior bips the history of this why certain things are good ideas or bad ideas takes a long time like i'm seven years in and i still know nothing nick i don't know how you feel about that but that's where i think layer twos can be helpful in improving extensibility because you don't necessarily require a bunch of people to become incredibly proficient in bitcoin core through layer twos you can now introduce other programming language that really broaden the developer ecosystem and allow people from other ecosystems to be able to build on top of bitcoin without necessarily needing to go through that learning curve um that you otherwise would but again it's just interesting to me that that's also married in legacy finance where like banks are  themselves because all their best cobol people are leaving and they don't have anyone to replace them so it's sort of an interesting parallel um at least it you know for me i think it's it's been an observation i've recently become much more aware of leave it to melt him to swear in her first answer i love it i'm so sorry no don't be sorry um i think one of my favorite episodes is when you came on my show and you talked about the coin waterfall but anyway um okay so i did want to just get a few kind of like facts about the different layers out of the way also because um you know when you were talking about like the different types of uh or the the uh the rate of transactions that we can have on the different layers so the current throughput on bitcoin is what it's i think it's seven transactions a second and then what would what what would a layer two enable and then same why don't we just maybe for comparison talk about ethereum as well yeah i mean uh i think i don't know about the exact tps but bitcoin does what 350 000 transactions a day and ethereum does north of a million right um if you compare the base layer to second layers honestly it's sort of unbounded at the second layer like if we have a lightning channel open between us we can send an arbitrary amount of transfers because we're just sort of keeping track of those between us that information doesn't need to be registered to the chain itself and then you would eventually periodically have a settlement that goes back down to the base layer so you in some cases in my view you want a completely arbitrary amount of scalability but you are paying for that by changing the security model and the insurance is the transaction so right and i think in in the in the numbers you're using nick right um yes there's an arbitrary amount of transactions that can push through the lightning network really the only constraint at this stage on lightning is a channel capacity right so there is a liquidity constraint in terms of how many channels are open how much liquidity is in those channels but as like with anything else the market is going to design solutions that make it profitable for people to open channels and maintain channels and we're seeing those liquidity solutions coming to market but again um the court the reconciliation back to the core bitcoin blockchain still happens once every 10 minutes so that is the natural constraint at the end of the day this is true of every layer two protocol right whether it's in bitcoin or another blockchain at the end of the day the security guarantee is only as good as the last block that was mined and the data that was hashed into that block um and the way you know elizabeth stark um lightning labs uses this great analogy using bitcoin it is like using email and having to download every email that's ever been sent in order to use your email that's not how email works okay for nick and i to exchange messages with one another we don't need to download the entire history of email ever that's impractical so lightning is basically an abstraction that allows you to avoid having to do that but you are making certain trade-offs and again there is still an inherent limitation just as there is in our banking sector inherent limit an inherent limitation on the capacity of fedwire and how often reconciliation happens there right it's it's not like you can achieve infinite scalability just because you're doing things higher up in the stack ultimately you are dependent on that based protocol and you are bound to the security guarantees of that base protocol so if your protocol is not immutable like good luck like no amount of layer two or three or whatever you build on top of that is gonna have security guarantees that are more robust than your base layer which is why i think layer two on bitcoin to me is so interesting because if we look at where value is occurring in the ecosystem today if we look at the asset people want to own really like bitcoin exists in a universe of its own and then it's not a judgment it's an observation that's supported by evidence yeah the one thing i would add to that briefly would just be you know people are willing to accept inferior security models for uh second layer payments which is why you know i happily accept the risk of a reversal if i'm a merchant and i'm accepting a credit card payment that's actually more convenient you don't always want strong finality bitcoin at the base layer offers you very specific flavor of risk and a very specific flavor of settlement assurance which is not necessarily appropriate for every transaction so you don't really compromise anything by building alternative you know trade-offs in that kind of design space at higher layers uh you're just expanding sort of the nature of the asset whether that means transacting on ethereum or in a lightning channel or on liquid or on a you know on a merged mine system crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place

metal card which pays you up to eight percent cashback instantly reserve yours now in the crypto.com app and so you guys um both mentioned the lightning network and milton briefly described this but just for people who aren't familiar so that's a type of payment channel system and you did talk about how there needs to be money that's put up front can you explain how that works and then also you know one thing i actually feel like i've never either understood or or it's just that it's not well built at the moment to me the incentives for um like locking up your capital in a lightning channel in order to enable those payments and then the amount that you'll earn in fees from it it doesn't like economically make sense to me so you know i don't know how incentivized people would be to do that so can you talk about first how that works but then also how the incentive system works meltdown you want to go yeah i can kick it off yeah so again the way i would describe lightning channels and lightning network is um basically what we're doing is when i set up a lightning channel with someone so let's say for example that i want to set up a lightning channel with nick and nick has a lightning channel with you and laura now because i'm connected to nick and nick's connected to you i'm connected to you right so what lightning network basically does is by opening these channels between multiple actors on the network you can start to route together the fastest most optimal way to go from point a to point b and what we're doing when we're creating a channel between me and nick or nick and you is we're collateralizing the channel basically what we're testing too is the fact that we have a certain amount of collateral or capital that we're willing to post to open and maintain liquidity in that channel and whenever i utilize um it's basically creating a money tube right and saying okay this much money can go through this too so hopefully that's a helpful analogy i always think of like the little money tubes that you use to go to the drive-through bank and you put your money in and get up and it's so that's what i'm doing but i'm doing it in cyberspace so there's now money too between me and nick and let's say for example i collateralized that channel um to have a throughput of up to one bitcoin basically what that means is every um 10 minute or roughly every bitcoin block i can send up to that capacity and it has to reconcile and that money tube has to sort of be re-collateralized or cleared in order for it to reach full capacity again so basically it kind of creates the limit as to how much transaction volume can go through that money tube based on the security guarantees and the collateral pledge that you're making and so again with lightning network you know if there's a lot of one-way activity for example if someone built a new product and um you know they've they've only set up a small number of lightning channels to start with there's going to be capacity constraints because those money tubes get full and so it takes some time for those to clear in for more transactions to be able to flow through the network but as there are more and more nodes in the network say that everyone who's at this conference joins lightning network and we're all connected to one another all of a sudden we're able to leverage that uh network capacity and send much more throughput through the network so it's sort of an interesting recursive challenge in a payment channel type of structure where you need a lot of money tubes filled with a lot of capacity in order to be able to facilitate money to flow from point a to point b in the most efficient way possible um so that's the way that lightning works and in my mind it's like a very juvenile description but i think it's a helpful way to understand it the other thing i'll add is currently um there are certain limitations on lightning that were placed there because lightning is an experimental technology and as many people know i think the ethos of development in bitcoin in many ways you know some people call it slow and some people call it boring but inherently um bitcoins much more risk averse than maybe some other protocols that don't have such a large market capitalization or maybe don't have you know such a strong commitment to add immutability and security um so there are some natural constraints that are baked into lightning while it is still in sort of its infancy that also limit capacity and those constraints over time as the um as the network's more battle tested and more channels are established will hopefully be lifted a bit to facilitate more transactions but it's sort of like the limit you have on venmo i think on venmo you can send what like two thousand dollars a week there's some sort of limit that's applied because it is to next point a lower security platform you can't send billions of dollars of money through venmo or even as an individual user you know you have a natural limit on how much you can send um likewise right now on lightning there are some capacity constraints that have been applied just in order to preserve security and to ensure if things do go wrong um the amount of capital and the amount of bitcoin collateral that's that's lost is minimized and then but can you answer also about the incentives because when i i you know i looked into this quite a while ago but i remember somebody wrote about their experience holding uh or um having a note on on lightning and when i realized the math i was like whoa they earned so little money for all the capital they locked up and it was something like they wouldn't you know break even for like a really really long time and i was kind of like hmm okay well then will people be incentivized to do this economically yeah look i think the transaction fee story and sort of the economics of lightning something that's been discussed at great length i think in order for the economics of um maintaining liquidity and lightning channels to to be there uh usage of the network has to to grow ultimately the idea for lightning the use case i think of is not really human to human payments but machine to machine payments so the idea is you know if my phone was communicating with your phone laura um you know we were constantly sending transactions back and forth there would be a lot more transaction fees that are accrue so if you're earning one satoshi per second every second of the day that could very quickly become a lucrative activity especially if the value of bitcoin you know it's much more lucrative when the value of bitcoins at forty five thousand dollars as opposed to you know the ten thousand dollars it was at a year ago when everyone was trying to run lightning nodes so i think it's sort of a function of um the network and the amount of throughput going through the lightning network as well okay yeah i don't want to get too hung up on this but it was something i had wondered about before um so one other thing that i wanted to ask about you know so obviously we've been talking about bitcoin layer twos um but then also as you mentioned we are seeing a lot of bitcoin being moved over to other chains in particular ethereum um so when that happens uh you know what do you think well first of all what are people why are people doing that what are they doing over there and well let's just cover that and then i'll ask this follow-up i'd i'd be curious to hear malcolm's answer because i've sort of wondered this myself i participate in the dubai ecosystem um i dabble as you know so i'm happy to chat about this a bit so um look when when it comes to capital markets in particular crypto capital markets if we look at market microstructure so the underlying sort of nature of the market who the key players are what the key venues are the thing that's really fascinating is the majority of volume in the market is bitcoin to usdt volume or bitcoin to tether volume and bitcoin to usd volume um so the asset that people really want to trade and the market that's the most liquid is the bitcoin market and bitcoin effectively is a liquidity sink in this ecosystem in the sense that um whenever you know there's a market rally typically it happens in bitcoin first and then it bleeds over into other chains and other assets and whenever there's a drop it typically happens in bitcoin first and then bleeds over into other assets and that's really nature of the structure of this market in the sense that the majority of the liquidity is still fairly isolated in in bitcoin when i look at bitcoin moving to other chains or migrating to other chains there's two functions that i think we can ascribe this to one is um this boom in in d5 or building new capital markets and new market microstructure using ethereum and so what we see is people wanting to continue to trade bitcoin but wanting a way to do it natively on ethereum in a way that's compatible with what they call these these d5 money legos so that's trend one but trend two the reason that's happening is when we talk about what people want as an asset people want to be allocated to bitcoin bitcoin still has 70 percent uh market dominance when it comes to measuring my market cap and i think that's a function of the fact that when people look at the universe of cryptocurrencies bitcoin really stands in a domain of its own which is why i think with stocks main net launch and being able to earn bitcoin through emerge mining you know that's something that will be really attractive i think to people who are running infrastructure with the objective of earning yields like the prospect of earning bitcoin versus earning you know another coins much more attractive and so to me the representation of bitcoin across other chains is something that will only continue to proliferate and i wouldn't be surprised you know if other assets start to take that approach um this is really how cosmos i think started you know they started with a bitcoin hub before anything else why because bitcoin has majority of the trading volume market structures built around bitcoin and what people want to trade what people want to hold is is bitcoin that's my view uh nick i'd be curious to hear what you think if you agree or disagree yeah no i think it's very plausible we see that the most liquid and actively traded uh defy assets one of them is typically wrapped bitcoin um along with ether and stable coins i've also heard that people wanted to use draft bitcoin for yield farming purposes so that they could retain exposure to bitcoin while engaging in yield farming um but you know it's interesting to look at the bitcoin migration to ethereum it really is very material we're talking 150 000 units of bitcoin are present on ethereum about 5.8 billion dollars i think at current prices however there's many different types of wrapped bitcoin the largest one is wbtc which is kind of custodial which is a very different kind of trust model uh from you know owning bitcoin on on the native chain um if you go down that list you find the more decentralized models like tbdc issued by keep that one is more decentralized but there's only i believe a couple thousand btc in that particular uh you know kind of cross-chain model so and the reason for that is nick that more decentralized model requires more collateral to be posted and staked to guarantee the security of the collateral right if you don't have a central counterparty who's going to custody the bitcoin that you wrap and provide certain security guarantees the only way you can provide those security guarantees is to over collateralize and to require people to post an amount of collateral equivalent to the bitcoin position they're creating and to potentially even over collateralize by a high margin just given how volatile bitcoin has been historically and how rapidly um prices of bitcoin can fluctuate yeah and so you you're right you have a trade-off between decentralization and sort of capital efficiency there's also another popular way to create bitcoin flavored risk although that's not with bitcoin would be through something like synthetics uh where you can use you can over collateralize another asset and create something that resembles bitcoin in terms of its financial risk again that bit more decentralized bit less capital efficient uh but it is fascinating to see the demand for bitcoin on third-party chains um i think it's so exciting i'm like how to the yes it's great because you're teasing apart the asset itself and then the protocol for conveying value and bitcoin refers to both things but they can be totally distinguished and that's what we're seeing now yeah well so i was going to ask you so do you think that so do you think that using bitcoin on layer two has a different effect on the asset itself like in terms of the price than using bitcoin on a different chain or are they both accretive to the value i think the key question there is how um that bitcoin is sort of stored and managed when bitcoin is represented on other chains um that bitcoin is effectively locked up and taken out of circulations in most modern circulation and most models pardon unless it's synthetic exposure like nick was mentioning with synthetics but in most instances we see today with like wtv uh btc tbtc run btc you're actually collateralizing uh the underlying you're securitizing i should say the underlying bitcoin and making it useful on other chains so in that instance you're taking bitcoin out of the market which inherently has uh you know an impact on the market and that you know as demand increases there's less supply in the market and you know everyone's done the econ 101 graph where you have your line for supply if you're lined for demand if supply is fixed and demand goes up then obviously there will be price increase um so that's the effect that i think uh collateralized bitcoin on other chains has when it comes to bitcoin on l2 i think um bitcoin moving into the lightning ecosystem depending on how much of it is uses used pardon to see liquidity on lightning channels there could be some effect but at the end of the day moving the coin between lightning and a bitcoin like layer base layer network is is quite easy i do it all the time using a blue wallet which is a great app that has hd bitcoin wallet and a lightning bitcoin wallet it's quite easy to do so you can add liquidity remove liquidity from channels fairly easily and so i think in that instance it doesn't necessarily have the same effect because you're still talking about bitcoin being in circulation and people being able to move assets on the the same chain um and so i think the effect of bitcoin moving to other chains right is certainly far more uh value creative to the underlying value story around bitcoin i think the other piece is also a narrative thing right i think one thing that would be amazing to see you know if the price of bitcoin goes to 200 000 we could effectively see a higher volume of bitcoin trading activity on d5 than any other asset which would be sort of like a crazy thing to conceptualize but it's not inconceivable and i think from a narrative perspective that really starts to prove out the point that nick mentioned where the story here really is around the value of um bitcoin the asset being separated from the value of the infrastructure that it's used to trade on it's like you know cme and ice and all these venues that people to trade have different types of functionality and are used in different ways but the value of ice isn't the value of the total market cap of all the assets that are traded on ice that's preposterous there's one other thing to mention which is if you're removing bitcoin entirely from the bitcoin protocol and circulating on eth i think there's a potential cannibalization effect on the fees that would otherwise be paid to minors to circulate that bitcoin because now those are fees being paid to ethereum miners right so from a soundness of the protocol perspective i would say you are actually reducing the fee uh revenue that's accreting to miners on bitcoin whereas if you're doing uh l2 which is sort of nearer to bitcoin like liquid or lightning or i would say block stack actually has the potential to accrete fees back to bitcoin miners you know that is potentially better for the long term security of the protocol from a security spend perspective so i think i might have a slight preference for the bitcoin adjacent l2 as opposed to porting the asset to third-party chains entirely so we only have another minute or two before we have to go but i did want to i mean we've only really talked about lightning as a bitcoin layer two and um i just wanted you to throw out some other of your favorite bitcoin layer twos for people to check out yeah so i can start um there are a lot of different ways that people are trying to build bitcoin layer two so um lightning obviously is focused on payment channels and creating a new type of channel driven topology to facilitate efficient routing from one node to another um there's merge mining protocols so one example is root stock um stacks is going to be merge mined as well which is super cool so there are a number of instantiations um like that there are um side chains as well so liquid is an example of a side chain we're a participant in coin shares in the the liquid network and that's really side chain that's focused on facilitating clearing and settlement and we're working on a bunch of really interesting new atomic swap settlement protocols um built on top of liquid that allow you to sort of um settle funds at the same time as opposed to having the problem of who goes first which is still an interesting problem in the otc space since bitcoin settles with finality but cash doesn't uh necessarily so those are some of the ones i've been looking at um i've also been looking at sovereign which is a project that's focused on bringing d5 and defy yields to the bitcoin space um they're sort of decentralizing a lot of the centralized bitcoin lending platforms and their functionality so i'll i can pass it to you nick i don't know if i've named all of your favorites as well though i've left you with nothing this is kind of a referendum on the state of bitcoin l2 is that you just basically named all the major ones um but i i like that approach i think merge mining is very elegant very cool um and so i'm super excited to see what block stack does and honestly i know liquid gets a lot of flack but i think it's totally fine to have alternative security models there's no deception there um and if as long as you're transparent with the security model um you know and you have big scalability wins by creating federation uh that's fine so yeah those those are the key ones and i'm obviously monitoring all of them closely too all right great well this has been a super fun discussion thank you both so much for coming on the this fireside chat i started to see on my podcast um anyway you're just some podcast mode like you've done it for a while oh i know i could do it in my sleep anyway all right well everybody enjoy the rest of the stacks conference thanks for joining us [Music] hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline bitcoin liquidations trigger sell-off but the bull run isn't over after bitcoin saw all-time highs near 42 000 last week the price fell below 31 000 on monday when a series of future liquidations sparked declines elsewhere in the market on-chain analyst willie wu noted that once spot markets began their sell-off coinbase began failing to register buys that caused the bitcoin price on coinbase to go 350 lower than on other exchanges that in turn pulled down index prices that future exchanges futures exchanges use to calculate leverage funding synthetics founder kane warrick took to twitter to offer his theory on how over leveraged longs had caused these corrections he said that in an early bull market long-time holders will take profits around a previous all-time high after that however he said they will ride the price up to multiples of the previous all-time high for example he wrote quote

extended its comment period for a proposed rule that would require crypto exchanges to store name and address information for customers sending more than three thousand dollars in crypto per day to self-hosted crypto wallets it would also mandate that exchanges file currency transaction reports for customers whose transactions exceed ten thousand dollars a day on thursday fincen said it would reopen the proposed rulemaking period for an additional 15 days from january 15th the extension means that current treasury secretary steve mnuchin largely seen as the sole driving force behind the
