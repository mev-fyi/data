one of the biggest questions is what will happen to the price of eth after chappella I think there's not going to be a big impact on price um I think the piece that I mentioned about um you know the impact of of Shanghai on each price goes into this a little deeper but based on the amount of trading volume there is behind each on a daily weekly basis if you just assume that 30 to 50 percent of rewards will be immediately sold after Shanghai like in the days following Shanghai it doesn't have a huge impact on the market one theory is that a successful Network upgrade will actually get more people to deposit because there are investors who are simply waiting on validation of technical success before depositing their ether if that's true obviously it will reduce the amount of circulating ether at a time when The Ether Supply is already shrinking due to uh Burns um
