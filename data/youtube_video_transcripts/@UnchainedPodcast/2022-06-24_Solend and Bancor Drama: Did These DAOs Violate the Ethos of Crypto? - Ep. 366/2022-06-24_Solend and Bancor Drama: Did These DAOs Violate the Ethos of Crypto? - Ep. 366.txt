description today's guest is derek shu co-founder at reverie welcome derek thanks laura it's a pleasure to be on this week there were two major incidents involving daos that had a lot of people in crypto casting judgment on these supposedly decentralized organizations the first one involved solend which is a lending and borrowing protocol in solana tell us what situation prompted this first controversial proposal from them yeah so to to give some context on soland it's a lending and borrowing platform built on solana users can deposit any form of collateral and borrow other assets in this particular case a very large whale had about a hundred million i think the exact number is 108 million that in solano tokens that he deposited into soland and he used that as collateral to borrow stable coins like usdc and tether and over the past two three weeks the obviously the crypto markets have been volatile solana token has gone down in price and the loan was getting pretty close to the liquidation price yeah actually just a correction they had deposited 170 million dollars worth of soul but you're right they borrowed 108 million worth of usdc and usdt yeah the loan price was getting pretty close to liquidation and like if that actually happened there would have been a few cascading negative effects which which we can go into the solent team tried to contact the whale and and alert him because there was no updating the the account there was no additional collateral being deposited and yeah that that's really the the context and i think yeah the governance stuff and and the proposals that that that happened were sort of all based off of this one dangerous loan that had the potential to become quite toxic both to soland and to solata itself yeah and it was also 25 percent of tvl on soland which obviously uh is pretty significant so how did soland propose to handle this situation yeah so the first proposal that they released was to really take unilateral control of the wales account doing this would allow them to execute the liquidation in a much more streamlined and organized manner so normally the liquidations are done uh 20 of the collateral is just basically markets sold and this would have negative effects on both the price impact right like execution price for that larger chunk is never easy and it would also just negatively affect the solano network a lot of liquidators would have been like bidding bidding up fees and potentially yeah it was fear that the network could have gone down so taking control of the wheels account was really justified or at least the proposal to take control was justified through they could execute the sale through otc desks do it in a more organized and less dangerous manner the the reasoning was that this was better both for the solen protocol its users and for just the slanted ecosystem broadly yeah and i think i saw somewhere they said that they felt that handling at otc would be would cause maybe only three percent slippage compared to something like 46 if it was handled on the decks clearly had a financial motivation to do this but obviously this proposal sparked an outcry from the wider crypto community why was that yeah it's it's a good point and i think like any time a protocol especially a one in the defy space which is supposed to be all about being permissionless and and self-custody and and sort of user autonomy whenever that philosophy is his uh like whenever a protocol is to go against that philosophy there's going to be outcries and there's going to be controversy and in this case it was such a large amount of funding and it wasn't like a stop-gap solution it was honestly kind of a nuclear option like literally taking control of someone else's funds and having unilateral control over it like that is the the nuclear option i think there was just a huge amount of outcry because like crypto and d fights all about again having your own property rights and strong assurances and if protocols can can set precedent to to go against that it just it it's dangerous um so i think the there was a lot of headlines about it there was a lot of controversy and for for good reason one thing that interested me was earlier when you talked about how you know solana has this history of going down quite frequently i did see that when they were debating this first proposal the solent twitter account tweeted solana has a history of downtime caused by on-chain liquidations like this but 100 x bigger this time it's extremely risky for everyone involved in the future on-chain otc auction should be implemented as the preferred method for liquidating large positions and i just wondered you know do you feel that a similar situation on a different chain one that didn't have this history of so much or such frequent downtime do you feel that that protocol might have been spurred to take a similar action or do you feel that it really was kind of particular to the issues that solana has um it's a good question i think it's i think it'd be unfair to say that this this situation could only happen in solana like i think even on other chains with different consensus mechanisms different like whether they're proof of work or proof of stake like these situations are still possible if there's large liquidations and and gas price goes up like that could still be bad for the network i do think solana is a little unique in that yeah like it's it's one of the few trains the major chains that in the last six months does have this sort of repeated history and at this point a bit of a negative connotation of of going down so i think like soul end and the community and just other solana holders were sort of more more aware of that so i think it's unfair to say again that this is something that could only happen to solana but i think it's like empirically it's happened more and it's been a been a larger risk here so so the price of seoul dropped as low as 26.43 on monday june 13th which was a week before the proposal and then on saturday it was also around 27 and 64 cents now it's in the 30s so it actually hasn't moved close to the liquidation price which was 22 dollars and 30 cents but one day after passing the first governance proposal the dow reversed course what happened there yeah things moved pretty quickly there and basically this second proposal like it reversed the first proposal and it it canceled the proposed action of of taking over the wales account and yeah this was done i think as you said a day after the first proposal and it definitely brings up some questions about like who created these timelines like why did they decide to do it in reverse action so quickly obviously like a lot of the pushback i think was a big part of that and just there's a huge amount of of anger and confusion about this proposal so i think again it was the right move but it's clear that this was seen as as quite an existential event so proposition one was really the solon team like reacting to to being backed into a corner prop 2 was only possible because solana price i think went up a little bit so the the protocol was actually kind of kind of fortunate in terms of timing because again if if prop 2 happened and price was going down then you wouldn't have avoided the original concern so definitely yeah yeah they are in conversation now with this whale because now they've been tweeting that they're talking to them so i think that position is kind of slowly um being decreased and then actually just one quick question earlier when you said that it was the right move did you mean the first proposal or the second one given the the facts and and the fact that the price moved i think proposition two like personally i think that was the right move to to not take unilateral control i think that would have been a very dangerous precedent to set for the protocol i think it would have opened up a huge can of forms to be fair like that conversation has already begun i think once people have know that this is possible know that this is a step the protocol can take in the future like it's already kind of too late but yeah i think it would have been again the nuclear option to literally take control of the wills account and and economically manage their actions so i think it's again good for solon that they didn't end up having to do that so yeah i find it pretty crazy that the first proposal was their first governance proposal ever um and then somebody made a diagram on twitter of the votes and said that it was one person who accounted for 88 of the yes votes so you know it's it's uh it raises a lot of questions kind of about just how decentralized all this was but in a moment we're going to talk about a similar controversy involving bancor but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 million people using crypto.com the easiest place to buy earn and spend over 150

learn more [Music] back to my conversation with derek so this week bancor also put up a controversial proposal actually it wasn't even a proposal it was a unilateral action and it caused a stir in the crypto community but before we get into the details on it let's just explain a key concept which is in bancor there's uh something that the protocol offers which is protection against impermanent loss what does that mean to set the context bank core is an on-chain amm and just like other amms this concept of impermanent loss occurs for lps when the price of tokens in a in a pool change very drastically especially compared to one another so if you have a bank or east pool and the bancorp price decreases or increases like a lot compared to eve lps will suffer from impermanent loss which means that the amount of funds they actually hold is less than what they actually put in so so so that's the basics of aisle you want to avoid it and the key here is that it's exacerbated in volatile market conditions when assets change price drastically in a very short period of time and bancor offered protection against impermanent loss so how was the protocol doing that yeah so again this was a it's a pretty big not problem but it's just a big like trade-off of amm lping so bancor wanted to attract liquidity and attract lps by offering them permanent loss protection yeah and just for people in case they're not familiar lp in this context stands for liquidity provider bancor tried to address this by using bancor's own protocol owned liquidity as well as using a proportion of protocol fees uh 15 of of trading fees are are used to sort of ensure that it when users withdraw if they're suffering from impermanent laws that they are made whole so that they again are able to know that they won't lose money even in volatile market conditions so on monday monday again seems to be um the day when a lot of these kinds of things happened bancorp made their controversial announcement what did they say yeah so bancor again like they noticed that similar to solon there was a few in this case there was a few large whales um that were had huge amounts of capital deposited in bancor and were withdrawing pretty pretty rapidly and because of the volatility in crypto prices they suffered huge amounts of il and the protocol was having to use huge amounts of token reserves both in the both in the native bancor token and in other revenue that the protocol would accrued to issue and literally distribute to these lps and i was looking at some of some of the dune charts i think yeah like the the amount of uh total total aisle protection the protocol issued in the past like two days was i think almost equivalent to what they had done in the past six months so this was done in a very short time frame and one of the key points here is that a big part of this protection and distribution of assets to make lp's whole like happened in the bancorp token so it wasn't necessarily like issuing completely new bank or from from from scratch but it was using protocol assets which are much of which is bank or and sort of increasing the float increasing the supply going from there so the banker team said that their motivation for doing this was what they called hostile market conditions so you talked about how it appears that some entity was selling a lot of this bnt um what more do we know about what was actually happening yeah i i think in the town hall they talked about how this entity was celsius and obviously linked to like what was going on with celsius and three arrows they also talked about how there was a potential short seller that was taking position against the bancor token and betting against it and that this was somehow affecting the the the aisle situation as well yeah i mean i i think again that's right it's the bancore protocol teams like part of the design of this isle of protection is is to account for these kinds of situations is to account for these kinds of of black swan events i don't even know if they're you could call them blacksmithing they're just volatile markets so so it's a tough situation but it's the kind of thing that every it's just a good reminder that every protocol design choice every incentive program you run it it has trade-offs yeah and just to kind of give people context on what was happening to the price of the bancore token bnt about two weeks ago it was trading at around 1.30 and then by saturday it fell to a low of 44 cents as of recording time it's at about 55 cents so still trading quite a bit lower but you know in in their blog post i think the speculation was that you know these entities were driving down the price of bnt by selling huge amounts of it and had also taken a short position on exchange to profit from the fallen price so that's that's at least their theory i i'm not sure if this is confirmed as far as i could tell this decision was not made via a governance vote so how was it made yeah so this decision was it appears it was made pretty pretty unilaterally by the bancor team they they talked about it via a blog post which contained the details and hosted a town hall about it they specifically cited a previous bip uh bancor improvement proposal earlier this spring which and for any listeners this is bip 21 which is basically talks about how there is a a multi-sig that and the signers have the ability to basically protect protect bancor in in in black swan events um via the ability to disable swaps and pause deposits and yeah basically have have control not over user assets but the actual operating of the amm so overall what takeaways do you have from these two incidents involving dows this week and you know in general how it is that these so-called decentralized protocols should handle aberrant or unexpected events yeah that's a good question i think like it's difficult to look at these two situations and not feel like like dow governance is is really just a word and that that that's been used here and that there isn't really any decentralized governance process and it's it's really just a few people making decisions and almost retroactively like using governance as a sign of approval i think that's honestly a fair assessment of of what's happened i think there's been some takes on twitter and by some commentators that this is like sort of it's reflective of the entire dow governance space which i don't necessarily think is true i think the the key here is really if you're going to have a token and if you're going to give users rights to vote on and think about certain things those should be laid out clearly ahead of time and you need to think about in in black swan events and in risky situations what the actual process is um i think the problem the the mistake that the the sole end team and and arguably the banker team as well was wasn't necessarily the decision they made at the time it was the design and governance or decisions or the lack thereof um they made in the in the previous six months like this would have this might not have happened if the solon team had earlier on implemented stronger risk protections account limits more stringent risk analytics so i think what we're seeing is really the the effect of uh just again not fully appreciating the trade-offs of different protocol designs um and in terms of dow governance yeah i think it also reflects poorly but nothing that i think is is emblematic of the space as a whole all right well certainly an interesting week in daos it's been such a pleasure having you on unchained thanks for explaining all of this thanks laura really great really great being on don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short

hash rate has decreased significantly and incomes are below the yearly average with this extensive financial pressure on miners outflow volumes from their treasuries reached rates of between 5000 to 8000 bitcoins per month this is now comparable with the 2018 to 2019 bear market capitulation event glasnote commented in its report arcane research also stated in an analysis that the deteriorating profitability of mining has forced the public miners to start liquidating their bitcoin holdings this week bitcoin miner bit farms announced the sale of 3 000 bitcoin to pay down part of a 100 million dollar loan with galaxy in consideration of extreme volatility in the markets we have continued to take action to enhance liquidity and to de-leverage and strengthen our balance sheet said cfo jeff lucas in a sign of how the depressed price has challenged miners the block reported that bitcoin mining difficulty has decreased by 2.35 percent since june 8 which accounted for the second largest single fall this year in the same period of time the hash rate has also dropped 2.6 however it was not all bad news for the crypto mining industry this week miner bitdigital reported eight million dollars in revenue in the first quarter of the year in addition black hill announced that it will start to power bitcoin mining in wyoming with celsius's solvency still in question ftx rescues blackfy

margin levels proshares is the largest provider of bitcoin linked etfs in the united states in october 2021 it was the first company to list a bitcoin futures etf at that point btc was going through a bull market and was trading at around sixty thousand dollars the fact that the launch of that etf was done so close to the end of the bull market caused some people on twitter to joke that the launch of this new etf could mark the end of this bear market however not everyone took the news so lightly will clemente a bitcoin analyst tweeted so there's now a short bitcoin etf a futures etf a closed
