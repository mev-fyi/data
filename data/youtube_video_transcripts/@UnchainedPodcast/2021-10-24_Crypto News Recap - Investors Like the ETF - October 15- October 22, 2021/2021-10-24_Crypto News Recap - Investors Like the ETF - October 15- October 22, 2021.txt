[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap proshare's bitcoin futures etf goes wild on tuesday the proshares bitcoin strategy etf went live becoming the first bitcoin futures etf to launch in the us trading under the ticker bito on the new york stock exchange the listing of bito marked a significant milestone for the crypto industry which has been attempting to get a bitcoin link to etf approved by the u.s securities and exchange commission since 2013. the fund tracks chicago merchantile exchange or cme bitcoin futures allowing investors to gain exposure to btc by speculating on the future price rather than purchasing the underlying crypto asset itself for now a spot bitcoin etf which would give direct exposure to bitcoin the asset has yet to be approved by the sec based on bito's performance over the first few days of trading investors seemed fine with purchasing the bitcoin adjacent investment fund bito saw nearly 1 billion dollars of trading volume on tuesday enough to make it the second largest first day of trading for a usatf according to bloomberg's eric balchunus even more impressively after closing on wednesday afternoon bito assets totaled 1.1 billion dollars making it the fastest etf ever to reach a billion dollars in what baltranas described as quote a poetically apropos movement the ito broke gld's 18 year old record of hitting one billion dollars in assets in three days the ito is trading so well however that bloomberg reports it is likely to breach the limit on the number of futures contracts cme will permit it to hold quote after two

york stock exchange on monday october 25th valkyrie also gained approval and will list on nasdaq as soon as the 23rd which is when this podcast goes live amusingly valkyrie initially filed under the

james time for fun bits jack dorsey almost called bitcoin's all-time high on tuesday twitter and square ceo jack dorsey tweeted 705 742 no context no punctuation just the string of six digits the tweet sparked a variety of speculation with many and non-crypto accounts lurking in the comments trying to ascertain the meaning of the seemingly random digits luckily a follow-up tweet by dorsey cleared up the confusion off by 117 he wrote most likely in reference to how many blocks he was away from predicting bitcoin's all-time high by decrypts math this put dorsey nearly 20 hours off on his prediction as bitcoin did not hit its new all-time high above sixty seven thousand dollars according to coin gecko until wednesday morning you can't make this stuff up the sam bankman freed led
