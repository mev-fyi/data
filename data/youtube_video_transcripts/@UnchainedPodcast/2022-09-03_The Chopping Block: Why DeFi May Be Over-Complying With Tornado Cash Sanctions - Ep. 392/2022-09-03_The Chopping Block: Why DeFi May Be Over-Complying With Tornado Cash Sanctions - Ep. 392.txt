not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 protocol is part of the antidote to this problem all right hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the uh usually four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspectives on the crypto topics of the day so uh we're we're broadcasting this one live here from Palo Alto we're all in town for the Stanford blockchain conference so quick intros first of all we've got Tom the defy Maven and master of memes after touring connected today so Jill is our is our sand in tarun so she is the Empress of espresso uh thanks for joining us Jill and uh then we've got myself and Steve I'm the head hype man at dragonfly so uh we are early stage investors in crypto but I just want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so Jill it's it's great to see you it's been a long time since we've seen you in person I think since the pandemic we haven't seen you yeah how's how's pandemic life been it's been pretty good yeah I mean San Francisco itself which is where I've been based it's felt like I've been like the last woman standing in the Bay Area at times but SPC this week has been so refreshing to have all of the old crowd kind of back in town be able to see the likes of you guys in person so that's been great I think in a bear Market you need an event like this that is not about hype for because almost every conference you go to it's like consensus permissionless they're all about like oh my God this crazy thing is going to happen Stanford blockchain conference is great because it's it's um it's slightly sleepy yeah you know it's like the people who are there they're like there to give talk mostly researchers and academics there's all this gravitas around exactly exactly so you just you you go up and you're like meeting all these like Stanford dropouts we're like I'm starting an oracle project and blah blah and you're just okay yeah this is like there's they're still here people are still doing stuff yeah there's real stuff happening it's also just been nice reminder that like you see people in person and generally people are a little toned down from their like Twitter personalities Reddit Discord personalities whatever and you're just like ah yes there is sanity in this industry and like you know it you can relate to these people it's not just like you know all of the Tomato throwing that that you get on social media yeah it's it's also it's weird being around a lot of Stanford kids because there's a lot of Stanford kids oh yeah SPC um so many of them are dropouts and it's like I guess it's like I mean you were telling me about this because Tom is also a Stanford kid or was once upon a time back in his kid uh yeah I like that it seems like if you drop out of Stanford they're just like oh yeah of course like why wouldn't you drop that yeah yeah they're supposed to drop out of Stanford yeah what's like what's like the the culture around startups yeah that's like that's like top tier top tier is like oh you dropped out you know you're too good and then you know middle tiers maybe you know graduating three years that's like yeah yeah yeah and then it's like oh you're kind of paying startup or a fan company or something like that okay that's like that's like CT yeah I I thought I was kind of just hard to learn recently so I did computer science um and it was very popular as I was starting to be there um I was talking to some recent CS grads and they said like 20 of all the Cs guys now are going into product management and I'm like I think that's that's cool but I would like to see more you know Engineers coming out of the Cs department or you know something like that what was it in your day probably like sub five percent sub five percent yeah wow you did not drop out I did not drop out I'm a loser I'll have an undergraduate degree so it's such a nerd I can't believe me too and mine's not even from Stanford so uh yeah well yeah I I uh it does feel like product manager at a Fang startup is like the new management consulting yes that's like if you're if you're just like kind of clean-cut respectable smart and but you don't want to be doing some boring nerdy stuff totally product manager is like the elite job especially especially West Coast yeah yeah although you know I don't know now that now that we're in this broader bear Market I mean it's not just it's not just crypto obviously Tech is also feeling it you know we just saw yesterday I think we saw a snap like lay off 20 of their of their uh their Workforce yeah which is crazy so it's uh it's it's pretty dreary all around yeah in uh in in Tech land so so maybe maybe things will be coming back around maybe finance will get hot again yeah although are you guys feeling bullish or bearish uh on a macro level because you ask this if everyone who comes on the show we do and that is the one question we're known for is asking yeah um what do I feel about macro um dude I don't know like how I the thing is I think I had a view on macro that I felt like it was interesting to articulate six months ago now everybody knows everything there is to know right like everybody's watching these inflation numbers everybody understands that okay will the FED pivot will not fed not pivot so I think I have zero Alpha in predicting where macro is going to go uh what do you think I don't know it is just kind of wild that we've come full circle from sort of the quantitative easing days where everyone was watching the FED then obviously to you know see you know how big the the BuyBacks or whatever were going to be that month and now here we are watching the FED try to drain all of that liquidity out of the market and I feel kind of the same way I mean in general I think that I skew bearish just because it feels like there has been such a pump into the money supply and whatever over the last several years that is only just starting to get mopped up and again maybe it's partly living in the Bay Area but like I don't know my coffee gets more expensive every day still I'm I've yet to I've yet to feel like that liquidity is being mopped up out of the market but as you say it's a very unoriginal take at this point it's just sort of I'm trying to read the FED tea leaves I was um I was bearish on the market back in December or January I remember telling a lot of rlps that like I think the I think I think the Market's going to turn and things are going to get rough and at that time I was like very proud of myself about prognosticating about macro when it was relatively quiet yeah now it's just like I mean every single one of our LPS is thinking about macro you know nobody nobody every at this point everybody is kind of a macro armchair analyst you know I will say watching the macro environment especially like everyone paying so close attention like fed speak and all of that it does kind of renew my Hope and Faith in these new models that we're creating in crypto because it's very easy sometimes to look at like I don't know you go on like the maker governance forum and you're just like what the hell is going on here like this is a total [ __ ] show this is going to be no way to like create the future of money and then you realize like we're all hanging on the every word of these suits you know hanging out in Jackson Hole and like that is driving literally the undulations the entire global economy and you're like all right you know what I'll I'll take the maker for him actually like this is this is maybe an improvement I could see that I mean it is it is definitely weird that like okay the the intonation that uh the intonation you hear in speech ends up moving markets it's uh you know at the same time all such word cell energy and I say that as a word cell but like I don't know I feel like monetary policy it feels so not based in actual data like where is that analysis and I mean I guess it comes down to the fact that this data is actually very hard to get let alone like clean up and actually um you know analyze and and form policy off of but yeah I don't know that's my take well it's funny because this very much mirrors one of the big stories of the week which we might as well jump into so uh Avalanche ended up going down 20 a single day because of a new story that came out yeah which is you know again not about data not about numbers but about a story so the story I'll give I'll give the tldr because it's it's kind of a long and kind of winding uh narrative but basically what happened was that uh there's this class action lawyer named uh Kyle Roche I think his name uh he basically he's kind of one of these like chasing after big class action a lot of spurious lawsuits against I think there's one against binance there's one against Solana um and so apparently uh this guy was caught drunk talking to somebody who videoed him just kind of drunkenly uh rambling who was apparently an associate of Dominican exactly apparently he was employed in the employee of Dominic Williams who's like a bitter enemy of Evan gunsar who's the founder of avalanche um and so it looks like there's some kind of oppositional research uh because there's some kind of lawsuit that is going on with ICP that Kyle Roche is participating it's very vague there's all these like weird innuendos and conspiracies around this stuff but tldr um so he was caught on film and he basically claimed that he was the attack dog of avalanche that he owns a bunch of avalanche and that he's intentionally suing other people in order to deflect attention away from Avalanche by regulators and so soon after this uh basically the the Avalanche came out and said this is not true you know this guy he was he was an early we use them as an early Law Firm he owns some Equity because we paid inequity in the very early days back in our seed round but we have like 12 law firms he's just one of them he's not our primary guy uh and we definitely don't approve of any of the class action [ __ ] he's doing and in fact we actually you know the Solana lawsuit that that uh was announced not too long ago um the Avalanche actually published a a blog post against the lawsuit saying that this was a spiritual lawsuit and this is bad for the industry um and then Kyle Roche also went out and said this was opposition research by the ICP guys the website that leaked this called cryptoleaks.info is apparently funded by ICP in some way and it's very blatant like if you if three little releases and they're all going after people who are going after ICP and it's like if you want to have sort of like a you know a outlet like that that is you know just trying to publish a pro news stories if you like to be little bit less blatant well did you notice though on this latest one the headline was not about ICP it was about Solana like oh like this guy's going after Solana but then you read through it and he's like yeah and it like yeah I I thought that that was kind of a hilarious like such a weak attempt to mask the sort of like the ICP leaning of this crypto leaks website by just putting Solana in the headline it did it so it it's all very stupid I mean what I initially saw is I was like this is such a weird did you watch the video I did I did watch it it's so painful it's so painful it's I I don't know I felt like oh my god I've had so many of these types of conversations with just these like I don't know people in the industry who want to feel super important and like okay maybe they are in the middle of things to some degree but like you know the ego is what's coming first they want to like Flex on you about like how much of like some token Supply they have and you know how their work is like driving you know the way that the industry is going you're just like oh my God out of this dinner right now like that was how I felt people in crypto love to take credit for things totally and magnify their own importance totally but look by and large so we're we were early investors into Avalanche were really investors into ICP we own both this whole thing just seems incredibly stupid to me and it's it's it's grown to such a crazy Firestorm I think Avalanche price recovered a little bit once the denial started coming out and the market kind of gathered a bit of steam but I don't know it feels like we're at a pretty slow news week yeah like the main thing that people are excited about yeah no totally totally but to me like I don't know I read through the whole thing and I was like okay I don't think based on reading it that Avalanche like was telling Kyle Roche to like go do these things like there didn't seem to be any sort of evidence that even in the videos but it would be totally believable to me that like okay this guy has some outside stake of some L1 like yes it is in his personal best interest whether he's even processing that on like a cognitive level or whether it's just subconsciously to go out and like cause a bunch of storms around other competitive projects like yes this is how incentives work right like for an industry that is entirely founded on Game Theory and incentives it is bizarre to me that there's like I don't know all of this nay saying that like someone may be acting in line with their own incentives like this this should not be surprising look I I understand the hatred toward Kyle Roche because like for sure all you have to do is watch these videos yeah I mean look he's clearly a douche and he's class action lawyers in general like they're I don't know they're like they're like one step removed from like injury lawyers or something yeah because they're just like you can tell when you watch the videos in this guy he's extremely predatory and kind of just braggadocio and it's just like okay whatever like this is your jam this is what you do you like sue you you find like weird plaintiffs and you know you you kind of magnify cases and try to get people in trouble which is fine okay you gotta earn your bread I get it yeah but um I agree with you like okay class action lawyer is an [ __ ] and he owns some avax like that's the story and okay that that doesn't seem like much of a story to me but um I think there's a high likelihood that after all this this guy might get disbarred or might get some kind of disciplinary action just like as a lawyer yeah saying public I think that one of the big pieces that I think um most of the press and most of the users don't care about the users like this conspiracy that avax is pulling the strings and causing all these but the thing that of course communities love a conspiracy they do they do they do now courts don't necessarily care right because like where you get your funding from doesn't matter but what does matter is that one of the claims he made was that he was using information he got in Discovery from uh filing some of these lawsuits with other l1s and using that you know feeding that back to other people and that's like extremely illegal like that's like super not cool yeah so if he was doing that he will get a lot of trouble for that but that didn't seem to be the thing that uh crypto Twitter cared about yeah that's being highlighted here exactly exactly so whether or not that's true I don't know to me this feels like probably something that we will nobody will be talking about in two weeks the fact the price moved what was it that is massive Bonkers that is insane sometimes it's like just very you know pure retail reflectivity of everyone's like oh this is bad and therefore other people think it's bad other people will sell and it's like you know you see this around just random miscellaneous news items around different coins as well and it's like it's created a full Theory yeah exactly exactly yeah totally bizarre anyway okay I I'm gonna make exact decision to move on because I I feel like I've already lost too many brain cells talking about this um so I feel like the other big news has been the continued Fallout from tornado cash so yeah quick reminder tornado cash privacy protocol they were sanctioned by ofak the office of foreign asset control um so there have been many differing responses to what the how people deal with the tornado cash sanctions so we mentioned I think in our last episode that right out of the gate one of the first things that happened was that a circle blocked on the addresses uh that were in tornado cash there was infuria and um what was the other one Alchemy Alchemy also blocked um uh API requests to tornado cash but the damage has started to grow so to become more and more people who are increasingly convinced they need to do something to prevent uh retail users from getting access to fatal cash one of the things that we've seen is that so the natural thinking the natural thought you might have is that okay if inferior is blocking uh trade of cash and alchemy's blocking tornado cash right those are two big RPC endpoints people use to interact with the blockchain uh then maybe we need some decentralized RPC endpoints right that can give you decentralized API access to the blockchain enter in Pocket Network which is a decentralized RPC Network that's the idea the decentralized in Fiora pocket Network decided to also block Toyota which is like wait what what what why are you there then what are you doing that's different then the centralized ones so when I saw that I would just mark my my brain just broke and I was like why do you exist yeah you were also blocking tornado cash um and so pocket network is blocked tornado cash uh and then we also saw a bunch of drama in flashbots land to flashbots um tldr flashbots is an auction for minor extract maximal extractable value such minor extractable value also known as Mev basically it's it's a very integral part of the ethereum uh kind of mempool these days uh happens on flashbots and flashbots uh the company flashbots they run the largest relay for these kinds of off-chain auctions and their relay now uh now integrates ofac restrictions now apparently it had been integrating oil fact restrictions for a long time um but they uh you know I I can't remember what exactly what the precipitating event was maybe there's notice this at the time of the uh tornado sanctions so they must have updated the olfac as a sanctions list to you know used to be there was just a bunch of individual addresses that were sanctioned by ofak uh that were like tied to terrorists or whatever uh and now they've added 300 cash contracts so now you cannot send tornado cash uh interactions through the flashbots relay um and the last thing along this thread was ethermine ethermine also started one of the big mining pools they also started blocking tornado cash transactions from their own blocks so we've seen a lot of different varying responses here's to get your guys thoughts tornado cash sanctions widening yeah I mean I think um the big complication you're right is it's it's much simpler to in the past an individual address gets sanctioned right okay this person this entity can no longer interact with my application now it's saying anybody cannot interact with this sanctioned smart contract which is sort of the precedent set and now it's like fortunate for you know flashbots for example they have to inspect the bundle and say hey are you actually doing anything in this transaction that interacts with the smart contract so it's like a very different precedent I think the other thing that has been happening over the past few weeks has been um different dapps that also run their own front end so someone like Ave for example they build the smart contract they also run avi.com um they integrate with services like trm for example um which maintains sort of you know compliance tooling for crypto basically blocking on the front end um people who interact with tornado or people who are one hot from interacting with tornado and there's been sort of a shitstorm around that of um hey I get that you know maybe I can't um you know if I've recently used tornado maybe use your thing but if even if I'm one hop which is I think like 30 of all ethereum addresses are one hop from a tornado address or two hops for a tornado address um they can't use that yes yeah there's anything and if it's three hops is like 90 and I think four hops is like 95 or something like that someone had to add a chart so it's like you know it's just like like what are we doing here like like how how reasonable can you sort of expect um uh you know people to sort of comply and this is all voluntary as well right it's um no one is making them do these things they're just thinking about hey how can I sort of minimize my potential risk uh how can I sort of you know protect myself which I empathize with I think you know running a front end and is you know um you're still you're taking active service you're hosting this thing um but it does feel like you know when you're looking at three hops out from a tornado interaction it feels very far I think it's worth mentioning though there are players at least one major player that comes to mind who is not going the route of risk aversion over compliance and that of course is her good friends over at tether I love that you can just always count on tether to just be like shooting from the hip like keeping it Wild West crypto even though you know they've also come out and made statements in the past of like yes like we work within U.S regulatory Frameworks and like we are you know fully U.S regulatory in their defense in their defense they claim that they were in contact with ofac with treasury oh yeah treasury told them like hey do we need to do we need to sanction and they were like yeah and I think that look I'm not a lawyer like I don't understand all of the ins and outs of this but something that I have come to have a greater appreciation of is that oftentimes like ofac is using sanctions as almost like a negotiating chip or like you know a bargaining tool to try to influence the behavior of the party right that's that's being sanctioned and so they don't necessarily even want over compliance right they don't want you know third parties in this case like these on and off ramps or front ends or whatever to be taking steps that they have not been asked to make right because that then starts to influence like okay well we as ofac then no longer have this lever to pull because all of these you know whatever individuals companies have already pulled that lever for us that makes sense so again I'm not a lawyer I don't I'm not one of these Washington DC monkey mucks but based on my understanding like tether's position may not be totally unreasonable and and I again I just kind of love that they're willing to stand there as sort of the Mavericks to be like no like you know when when we get orders to take certain steps like we will take those but until then you know we're not freezing tether that your usdt that has that has touched the contract well it's not just that right the tether that's in tornado cash is really tiny it's like it's like in the first thousands of dollars so relative to I mean the overwhelming amount of uh assets that were internet of cash were ether and then die right and then there's a limited uscc um the tether was like almost nothing yeah very small amount um one of the things that I think what what this whole episode has really demonstrated is that of course like the day that the sanctions were announced everyone was scrambling right nobody knew what to do and nobody ever seen this before yeah right clearly was like what the hell does it mean that you're sanctioning a tornado cash right and a smart and a set of smart contracts um people and I think what really happened is that there was probably a snowball in that the first person who decided okay we're going to we're going to block reads and writes to the contract the next person to act looks at that is like oh wait was that what we're supposed to do are we supposed to block reads and rights to the contract oh sure because if we don't do this people look at us and be like wait they did it why didn't you do it and it's a little bit of an outrun you don't have to outrun the bear you just have to outrun you know the last person running from the bearer mentality exactly exactly now in the case of tether look I mean I I tend to I tend to think that tether got this one right which is that the way that you deal with sanctioned addresses is that you don't the way you deal with illegal activity generally is that you don't let them cash out so Who cashes people out the answer is exchanges cash people out and of course the stable coin issuers themselves cash people out right but you don't Cash Out by just transferring tokens right there are a lot of tokens that don't ever get cashed out because they're like look you can't pass kyc or like you've done some really shady looking stuff I'm not going to you know I'm not going to turn your tether back into dollars for you um but stopping tether in circulation like in some way that's kind of forcing every single layer of the financial stat to enforce sanctions which we don't do yeah we don't do that in the normal system right in the normal system that's right Swift is not enforced sanctions yeah your bank enforces sanctions right we don't tell this we don't tell the Swift Network which is an international it's supposed to be you know kind of a political system yeah we don't tell Swift to enforce sanctions we also don't tell your your browser to enforce sanctions right so when your browser can tell oh you're you're sending stuff to a sanctioned entity your browser doesn't try to figure that out and you know nobody tries to go Sue Google Chrome because oh you let the sanctioned person interact with the browser to do banking stuff right like that it we realize that it's stupid and counterproductive to try to enforce sanctions at all these layers you pick one that is the right layer in which to enforce sanctions and you leave everything else alone so I agree with all that but at the same time I can also totally empathize with people who are running companies who have fiduciary duties to their investors sure to make sure that the company can still keep running and doing business and maybe its largest market in the United States and also who on a personal level are like [ __ ] or fact like 30 years in prison like really you know as much as I believe in the space like really focus is not going to put an RPC endpoint into prison for 30 years that's such a ridiculous like I I push back on this right that's [ __ ] ofac might might find you like you know five thousand ten thousand dollars because like oh you should have done that we don't know we didn't we don't know either skin ether scan okay etherscan still lets you read the tornado cash contract okay if you're a won't let you read it and fear won't even let you look at it you want to ask what is the state attorney cash contract if Vera says we can talk about like the layers of over compliance here because I agree I think that there are layers of overview like if that's true for if you're a wise analysis true for etherscan etherscan lets you read it also lets you write you can go connect your web3 endpoint and etherscan and interact with the contract differing Comfort levels with the risk that you're taking again that's not just about facing potentially 30 years of prison time although let's be honest I mean Jeremy O'Leary the CEO of circle like called that out directly in his tweet Thread about this right like that is a real consideration I think if you're German but it is also a very different story than if you're an RPC sure but it is also about like your business model and your considerations to your board to your investors all of these things and I don't know much about the business around etherscan itself but like knowing what I do know about etherscan doesn't surprise me that there would be very different considerations and very different line drawn about the Comfort level versus uh is inferior us domicile company yeah that you know has a very real substantial business model around them that I know has sort of like Insurance you just can also does business in the US of course because of course and a lot of customers here but I mean look if you the difference between the primary I mean obviously one difference might be whether domicile another big difference is that one has a front and the other doesn't yeah right one is API based I mean obviously this can also has an API but mostly we think of it as a as a front-end web application um to me this is like a a distinction without a difference like at the end of the day both of them let you read and write to Smart contracts right if you tell etherscan hey why are you guys allowing people to see the front of tornado cash when all these other people have complied right all these other people understand the precedent that we've all set as an industry which is that you pretend tornado cache doesn't exist somebody sends you something about trainer cash you drop it doesn't even matter you're you are complicit because of the fact that you facilitated the transaction by forwarding it along to the mempool or just reporting even the state yeah of the share cash contract yeah right like to me that's a crazy interpretation of all this stuff and so this brings also to Eric Wall so Eric Wall um brought up the idea which is you know the either The Ether mine thing so ether mine has started to block you know ofax restricted uh things and there was there's funny a long time ago there was a a Bitcoin mining um company what was the company Marathon I think it was Marathon that proudly announced that they were starting to do ofac compliant blocks gosh I'd forgotten that that's right that's right so there's a president and then they backed off for me because they were like wow that was stupid never mind We're not gonna do that so it's not a cool marketing move yeah exactly nobody nobody's nobody's excited about us now in fact now um so so ethermine was the first to start uh either by they're European right uh I don't know yeah I believe they're European I believe they're European money for um or mining pool so uh ether mine was the first to start blocking internet cash addresses in their in their in their pools and um you know as we're moving into the transition to proof of stake which is coming up very soon the questions are to get asked okay are there going to be now ofac compliant validators that the validators will themselves start blocking transactions from people interacting with ofac sanctioned addresses slash uh Slash contracts now we've we've not seen that before right that's a totally New Concept that you would start enforcing the natural idea behind blockchains is that they're censorship assistant meaning that even if there is one minor out there somewhere that's willing to include your transactions that you will eventually get into a block yeah okay you might not get into the first block because maybe the the next person who Minds is ofac compliant but uh you know the the fifth sixth seventh person who Minds The Block they're in Tanzania or something and they'll mind the book so in in proof of Stake Land what we've seen is that there's a huge amount of concentration of the stake in a small number of players right so Lido obviously which is a Consortium so there are a bunch of underlying miners there or validators there of course coinbase is going to be huge Finance can be huge Kraken is going to be huge and there's maybe good reason to believe that these validators will think like look I I I definitely cannot be violating ofac the question is is including a transaction into a block violating am I facilitating the you know violation of sanctions by including things into a block so Brian Armstrong came out and said look we're not going to do this if if our lawyers told us that there was no way to run a validator without violating ofac restrictions we'd have to censor we would either not run a validator at all yeah or we would find some others we'd find some other solution right so he's kind of vague about what that might mean but okay maybe there's some maybe there's some way to Outsource or something um it seems like so so Eric Wall brought up this notion that I think people hadn't been talking about so much about um okay well how do you actually enforce this Norm right how do you enforce the norm of the idea that hey businesses by default are going to be risk-averse because they have a lot to lose right they're scared of jail time they're scared of you know fines whatever uh and so for them it's like look it's not like it's not like I really care whether or not I include tornado test transactions like there's not a lot of money in that so I I would much rather take 99 of the reward and take zero percent of the risk and just be off at compliant that is the game theoretic equilibrium is to just say okay well of course you just don't tell everyone becomes effect compliant yeah and the question is how do you stop that as a community as a as a as a culture and Eric Wall's answer to that is like well we have this concept that we haven't touched in a very long time of what's called social which is basically the idea is that we decide hard Fork the network and delete this person's stake because they were doing something that is not in line with ethereum principles and this kind of started up this conversation about hey maybe this is the only tool that the community really has to change the dynamic such that the default doesn't become ethereum is of fat compliant by default what do you guys think about this idea I I think that this is okay firstly I think that the idea of social sloshing itself is problematic because okay well then how do you get to consensus on who the bad guys are here like the thing that gets missed and I think that this goes to your point around pocket Network and you know all of these other sort of like decentralized systems that like oh now you're censoring stuff like a decentralized system doesn't mean like nobody controls it and now it's just running out there and like you know it it cannot be censored and uh and all of these things that we want to believe it means all it means is that there's a network of nodes coming to consensus about what reality and and the source of Truth is and you wind up at the same Quagmire if you Institute something like social slashing because you again have to come to consensus about okay well then who's getting slashed how do we Fork this and so on and so forth so I think that it's problematic on that level I also just think that this is just classic case of like technologists wanting to technologize he's like how do we actually approach this as an industry how do we actually solve this problem well we go in and we make sure that lawmakers and uh you know folks in Congress staffers on the hill we make sure that Treasury Department all of these folks are educated about what is Tech stack and what is sort of you know equivalent of like a swift-like system here just running processing a payments Network versus what has I think the word is like specific intent behind it to enable you know things like money laundering and like we're gonna have to figure out as an industry sort of where exactly that line gets drawn but I think that it's pretty clear that things like running nodes should be in the category of like this is Tech stack this should not be touched by Financial regulation and enforcement and there are all kinds of other areas like the on and off ramps at the front ends and so I I guess that's where kind of my sort of in the background my like eye rolls over here right so like we're already there now like we could we could have argued about this are we I mean we're already there in the sense that okay ether mine is is leaving transactions out of their blocks but yeah once coinbase is like the single biggest minor or validator on ethereum yeah what do you think is going to happen I I mean maybe I'm naive but I back maybe not Brian himself but you know the legal team around him to do that engagement and to you know find they have kind of things right the merges in two weeks no it tells me that treasury is not going to give them an answer within two weeks for sure and do you think so is your position that in two weeks time they're gonna be leaving tornado cash transactions out very high likelihood because like see I was just the other side of that I just give you the the calculus right like why you're a public company yeah you know they're not they're not just they're not but we also just had this whole conversation about over compliance and yeah they weren't always yeah in the very early days they're the only public company in crypto of course they are going to you know they're going to respect ovac restrictions when they're mining blocks right because like they're literally I mean when you're validating a block that means you're literally get getting paid by the person who's violating sanctions right they are sending you fees so if there's anything that you could argue this thing is you know would that be your position on it I'm really surprised again my position is that this should all be I would say this is Tech stack this is neutral I agree with that I agree with that but what do you think like that is what I guarantee you their lawyers will be telling them we are accepting payments from people who are violating sanctions that's what their lawyers will be telling them you cannot do that we'll see I'll take the other side of that I want to follow up into okay come back on the show I think of it a little bit sort of like like an analogs like I think about you know sort of copying it to tour right and it's like if you run a tour exit node um you know you might get rated by the police at some point because someone's accessing some illegal content or ever off of your your node um but you're not liable for that right um and and why is that the case it's because you literally cannot inspect the content that you're relaying and the request that you're relaying it's completely private and so you know speaking of like technologists I think like that might be a more constructive use of like people's energy and time is like well speaking to miss espresso here I think it's like um looking for you know better scalable solutions for private transactions I think yeah privacy here again you know privacy just have this like really long difficult journey in crypto of yeah I mean if they go through through the entire history but it's always had this difficult part where people don't want to pay for privacy um and um you know it's it's like um your party's privacy from whom generally in the past it's been you know other people looking at your your transactions on chain maybe the story here is hey um if the compliance burden for you know these validators starts to get so high you the Privacy is almost like a requirement in order to get your transaction mine period um right it's not that um some transactions need to some transactions don't but it's just like yeah if you're coming from a particular IP if you're trying to interact with a particular address like I I can see sort of this this bargaining to get higher for um what is a valid transaction and what's not and maybe the only solution now is just like completely remove that that even censorship ability by by making the validators not able to think about you know what is a valid transaction thank you for bringing us back to constructive territory there because we're about to get into um yeah fisticuffs over what's what's maybe going to happen with coinbase in two weeks yeah I do have a tendency to sort of go off on like these are all human problems but I do think that you're right that there are constructive ways to think about technological solutions to some of this I don't think it's going to solve you know what's happening here specifically with ethereum with the merge in a couple of weeks time but I do think longer term I mean something that has just become super obvious to me over the course of the last few weeks uh with all of this Fallout is the importance of not only transactional privacy um but also the importance of application layer privacy and this is something that you know we've been talking about espresso now for like a year and a half it's something that the folks at Elio have really spearheaded as well like we're not the only ones working on this the concept is called decentralized private computation Howard Wu and Company um out of out of Berkeley primarily and again working on ilio now kind of spearheaded this with their work on Sexy and we've built off of that as espresso what it does is it enables you to achieve again not only transaction level privacy which you could achieve obviously on ethereum with something like tornado cash where you know nodes and validators in the general public wouldn't be able to go and see who you're sending to whom but it would also mean that actually what applications are being called what smart contracts are being called will also be obfuscated and obfuscated even from validators and look I think that what you're painting is kind of a worst case scenario here of ethereum is just [ __ ] because coinbase decides to go with what are people calling it USA chain instead of you know youth main chain and we wind up with this crazy Fork of realities but in a way it's also ironically perhaps the future that we are kind of building for or at least a possibility that that we're kind of building for with espresso and with again DPC or decentralized private computation the ability to mask what applications are being called and I think that that's what the next generation of blockchains are going to look like I think that you know ethereum is going to have to find these types of solutions at some point down the line because I agree Tom like plausible deniability is I think the best defense in all of these cases now do I also hope and think that we will be able to fight the good fight and keep nodes and validators on the tech stack side of things at least for the foreseeable future yes for sure but I think it's important that that we also have that yeah that more constructive and I think real estate conversation outside of social slashing about the technology it seems like the the tornado of fact restrictions they've definitely struck fear in the hearts of a lot of privacy builders that I've been chatting with oh for sure where people are just like okay well what is a tornado is illegal even though it's fully not to mentioned the guy who got arrested in the Netherlands that's right that's right by the way exactly no charges they extended his holding period for another 90 days which is insane yeah um so it's scary a lot of privacy folks I know are scared because they're just like what what are the rules are you saying privacy is illegal if you're not what are you saying so you see actually FTX um so Aztec which is uh yeah the Privacy layer too walking out that started blocking Aztec which Aztec I mean basically it's it's not a mixer by any meaningful sense it's just like a private pool the same way that Z cash might be that also allows the internet with D5 so how are you guys thinking about that given the stance that ofac has taken against at least nominally against against the notion of privacy as being something that you're allowed to engage in yeah no totally so we have we have one product that's in Market only on ethereum's test net and so in a way we are in a privileged position that at least you know sort of Waller development time is you know getting us towards mainnet we can start to work out some of this and some of where we again as a company with shareholders and all these considerations and I as someone who's living in the United States and what have you you know where we're going to be comfortable Drawing the Line um I don't I I don't uh Envy the companies that have these live products that are now facing this storm in real time with my senses pretty limited Communications from these really important like King makers and Gatekeepers you know these exchanges is and whatnot that are just sort of it seems like arbitrarily blocking them but the way that we're thinking about it and the way that we've been approaching privacy from the outset is to say all right we want to deliver to developers and to deliver to end users the tools to be able to choose what stays private to whom and under what circumstances and so I think the best kind of example to explain this that I often turn to is let's say you're a stable coin provider right and let's say you're one of these risk-averse stablecoin providers you're not tether who's happy again to kind of um play a little fast and loose and I think the industry needs that too but you're a relatively risk-averse stable coin provider you want to start enabling you know Merchant payments and B2B payroll and supply chain payments and all of these types of things and in order to do that in order to just meet basic user needs you need to implement some level of privacy for them right now those types of player others are obviously not by and large looking for sort of government level privacy right they're totally comfortable with whether it's Circle or another stable coin provider or paxos whatever still having insight into their transactions they just don't want all of their competitors to know about all of this stuff um and so you as the stablecoin provider can then build that into either a wrapper for your existing year C20 token or a brand new uh token contract and say okay you know we can see everything that's going on with these payments no one else can see anything that's going on you can get more granular than that you can say Okay above three thousand dollars which I think is the travel rule threshold which is this guidance around like you know at what point you have to start reporting kyc information stuff above three thousand dollars we can see everything that's going on for like more to Minimus payments nobody can see anything blah blah blah and get into having all of these kind of granular fine-tuned controls now my personal kind of philosophy around all of this and like a lot of people hear that to be clear and they're like you're building back doors you're a freaking narc like you know why are you doing this well that's still much better privacy than you can get on the ethereum main chain today right like that's still a huge Improvement yeah if you do care about privacy again my personal philosophy on this is that we should be building more privacy Tools in general is that commercialization is a big part of the fight for keeping privacy as something that you know we can all have as a protected right that being able to demonstrate like look there are legit uses going on here of this technology in general and of privacy approaches to it I think all of that helps and I think it helps move the Overton window away from where we are today which is that everything needs to be transparent everyone all the time but being in the trenches of like how to actually roll that out and implement it in these circumstances where everything is so uncertain is a very scary thing and you know I mean we our code base is open source like you know I've had uh Engineers on the team ping me mostly thankfully ping our general counsel not me asking like I have no control over you know this is zero knowledge privacy Tech like I have no control over whether someone copies and pastes some of this and goes and implements it in a way that like you're totally not comfortable with it and you know how is that gonna come back on me so yeah it is it is a very scary time it's very uncertain um but I think that again I think that in a way we are in a more comfortable position not only because we're only on testnet right now although Maine net coming soon but also because we are taking this more kind of I think nuanced approach to privacy as opposed to having positioned ourselves and kind of backed ourselves into this corner of like we believe in all private all the time and then having to walk back from that I think that's a really hard place to be right now it is and it's where a lot of the kind of gen 1 privacy coins and like the kind of the more Cypher Punk original ethos was in crypto so you look like the moneros and the Z cash they're like no screw you guys come and take it kind of energy and it does feel like that's not going to age well in the era of of fat restrictions yeah the idea that okay well tornado sanctioned by default if you interact with it you're you're you're a bad bad dude yeah totally and the the interesting thing now you mentioned about the secondary um which I didn't know the front ends that start blocking you if you're one hop removed or two hops removed from tornado it's great is that going back in history by the way like is that it's like a post-sanction post sanction okay I'm like uh do I yeah totally but of course like it opens I mean it's such an obviously broken concept because it opens up the ability to grief anybody because anybody can just go put 0.1 Ethan maybe cash send it to anyone yeah and now that person can't use anything yeah because the whole point of stranger is that you can't tell who sent it right like it breaks the link so somebody who's using tradocaster launder money looks identical to somebody who's getting griefed by getting set point it is funny how it brings out all of these like potentially fundamental flaws like we have not really given any thought I feel like on a product front as an industry the fact that you can just send and there's no sort of notion of like right was it grin that had the the whole thing where like after you had to actively receive it that's true that's true because you have to be online totally yeah no it was a terrible U.S but it is interesting model makes it cleaner because then it's like okay this one this is the money I got said for Terry cash I will leave that over there I'm not gonna use it yeah um in ethereum right it's all just one big pile of ether that looks like the same you know so it's it's we also don't have a standardized way like let's say you do get griefed someone does send you 0.1 each how do you be like no no no that's not mine I'm deleting like do you burn point one eth and then does like does trm pick that up does three analysis pick that up yeah do you send it to a different address does trm understand that like you know it's like we don't know what you're supposed to do there's no Playbook totally so treasure you just jumped all this stuff on us probably had no idea how the industry was going to react and now we're all setting these stupid precedents that everyone else is copying because they're like oh well if if inferior did that they probably better lawyers than I do so I'll just do whatever inferior did yeah and as a result we end up in this this moronic equilibrium yeah and and now we have to talk about social slashing which is why to be clear okay bring it back to social slashing I I tend to agree with Eric I tend to agree with Eric that I think wow I think at some point you need like a sort of Revolt of the public so that people know ethereum is not run by corporations it feels like it is it certainly seems like it is it seems like etherscan infuria and coinbase have the real say over what happens right and like I feel like ethereum has not really had that segwit moment when you realize like wait no I thought that was a very apt comparison that he drew to the subway moment yeah users matter and the users are very clear and unanimous in what they believe which is that ethereum should not censor are they I genuinely don't know like I certainly the loudest voices on Twitter are very I mean who do you think Auditorium is pro oh fact restrictions in ethereum itself I think that there are a lot of people who use this stuff as speculative asset as like a fun cool new way to like [ __ ] around on the internet and like you know using playing around with nfts the same way that I played around with Neopets when whatever sure yeah in the 90s like I think that there are all of these sort of like emergent ecosystems of end users who don't give a sh about it okay libertarian censorship resistant most people don't care but the question is do they want the restrictions is there anybody who wants I think that there are a lot of folks both within the ethereum user base right now and also who could be within the ethereum user base but are not because they're uncomfortable with some of these Dynamics around like there's a even people who are like very sophisticated and spend all day on this stuff many have the the under the misunderstanding rather that like if I deposit funds into tornado cash I might be withdrawing like North Korean funds like I'm uncomfortable with that or like I'm contributing to the Privacy with North Korea totally like nothing in crypto defense that's not even true with tornado cash like that if I deposit entrepreneur I can only pull out my own deposit this feels to me like something you solved with education not with enforcing sanctions at the network level yeah like to me this is important segwit as well right segwit most people didn't care most people didn't even know what it's like what means yeah right Segway was just like a big rallying cries for people to fight on Twitter right most people have no clue I remember spending hours trying to educate myself segregated Witnesses in Bitcoin and whether the block size will do this or that and like you know look in retrospect it was it was a philosophical and political and religious battle yeah that was ultimately being waged in Bitcoin and we have not had that end ethereum no since the death work no which was a long time ago yeah and this feels to me like as close as you can get to the spirit of what blockchains are about which is that is there a monopoly by one country's interest which look I'm an American I love America I think America's awesome I think I think I think the the oh fact restrictions on on tornado are stupid but I think the restrictions on the other things that we've sanctioned make total sense that you probably should sanctions the difference being that they sanctions about why it's a bad idea even if you think that look if you sanction tornado cash it may be reasonable for exchanges and kind of the off ramps and so things like that to prevent people from cashing out the trail test other side should the network basically be ingratiated to treasury into effect I think the answer is no the network should be there should be distinct from that the same way that the internet does not enforce us sanctions which is why we need to go and educate policy makers I agree with that I agree with that but this is happening now it's happening two weeks from now there's not enough time to educate people like at some point ethereum if you're in Canada just don't over comply folks I I agree with it but no one's listening to me no assistant people have already overcompleted how do you stop social or complying the answer is that there needs to be a stick there's only carrot for over over compliance right which is that there's no risk nothing bad happens and I don't lose any Revenue there is a stick you need to make it what's this thing I mean Brian Armstrong acknowledged it I think even that said something on Twitter what does that mean I mean let's see what happens in two weeks you got this wry smile going on no I I agree I think um ultimately it's like the market will speak you know this there's nothing stopping anyone from making fed chain today or a year ago or anything like that um but there's not that pressure I just like you know it and also comment running a little bit of what the each proof of work Fork it's like yeah I guess you could do that will anyone use it will the market respond to it maybe I don't know I think um you know it's sort of all happened with the Dow back yes yes yes yeah and so I think it's like sure you maybe you could you employ social slashing but it's sort of on you to convince the people who matter in the market that like this is the way to go forward yeah but look I think even the conversation scares people right because they feel like look if there's a 20 chance that our youth gets flat we have a lot of eat that coinbase yeah that is a much bigger risk to our business than that we don't run staking and make a little bit of yield or whatever we Outsource it to some other party right or we just put in D5 and get some other yield so just the conversation alone is enough to do a lot of the work to scare people because the concept of social slashing obviously is a coherent one and if people realize look the community the core community believes this right it won in Bitcoin it's not too late to say the same thing can win an ethereum now it's certainly true that it's not true that two forks will be viable if you have a minority fork in ethereum that Minority Fork will die on arrival the same way that the 8th power will die on arrival but if there's enough of a movement internally that starts generating you know pressure these guys will roll over very quickly if they think that there's real energy there because they can't risk it they can't risk getting slashed with that amount of money relative to you know the relatively small awards that they're most of the stinking words they pay out to their customers they don't keep it for themselves right they take a small spread so to me that's why I think you can't let this stuff you can't just say like well okay let's let's blind the blockchain association until I go talk to lawmakers in the meantime you know ethereum will just do it I think it's got to be all of the above right I think yeah I think it's important I agree with that to come back and be like conciliatory here but very genuinely too I do think that it's got to be all of the above and I think that I think that the conversations that are playing out are important and healthy I am myself deeply skeptical of like how a social sloshing would actually be implemented and I'm very skeptical of the fact that you just would wind up back at the same the same problem of like well who's creating social consensus around the social sashing then right um but you know I'm not against I'm not against the debate happening yeah the debate I think alone does a lot of work yeah and yeah yeah you need some somehow these Norms need to be in place because they can't just be like it's kind of like you know when Trump came into office and started doing all this crazy stuff that nobody had ever you kind of expected like okay well every president before has like released their tax returns and he was like I'm not going to do it he was like wait wait how do we stop you from doing that how do we social slack yeah how do we social slash the president and the answer is like there's no social slashing for the president yeah well it's like okay well we know what happens is which is that the the the the the Overton window just expands slowly push by push until at certain point we're just like oh wait wait we're like in this tiny little enclosure now and ethereum is just like compliance itself into becoming this totally different thing than what it started out I I just come back to like you need to be waging this war on all fronts like you need you need folks like tether to be comfortable taking risks and like coinbase in this situation too you need coinbase to be comfortable taking on a little bit more risk than they might otherwise be comfortable with because there's pressure from the community and all of this you need to be engaging in Washington and Brussels and you know wherever else and I think you know to the point around even developing the idea of social slashing to the point of developing things like decentralized private computation sexy like you do need to be fighting on the technological front but all of these things as you say like they have these very different time frames like DPC is not coming in the next two weeks you know two months even um you know we're not going to solve the legal thing in the next two weeks either and so yeah I think you need to keep some faith that some some of these actors anyway will be down to go risk on I hope so I guess so too I hope so it's um it's hard to be it's rare that I'm The Optimist in the room I know I I'm proud I'm impressed this is a weird place to be I am usually like defending the man yeah defending the man which is good it's a good place it's a good place to be a big diplomatic tone for a private is that is that why you separated yeah yeah we've got the crypto people and we've got the man over here yeah yeah that's gonna be my intro next time I come on that's right yeah the man okay well I think we're up on time uh Jill thanks so much for coming on and sharing with us your totally wrong views about the privacy and compliance um it's been another interesting week in crypto land thank you to all of you for tuning in and uh we'll see you in a couple weeks like everybody
