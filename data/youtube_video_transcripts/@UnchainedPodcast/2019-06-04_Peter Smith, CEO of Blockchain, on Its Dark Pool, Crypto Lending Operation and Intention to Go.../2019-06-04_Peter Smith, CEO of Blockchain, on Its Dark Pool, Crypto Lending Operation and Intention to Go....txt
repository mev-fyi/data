crypto economy Kraken is the best exchange in the world for buying and selling digital assets it has the tightest security deep liquidity and a great fee structure with no minimum or hidden fees whether you're looking for a simple Fiat on ramp or leveraged options trading Kraken is the place for you my guest today is peter smith co-founder and CEO of blockchain comm welcome Peter hey how are you good good enjoying London so how did blockchain calm get started we got started in 2011 so in crypto terms ancient ancient history with the simple goal of making it a little easier to use Bitcoin so we built the first block Explorer which made it possible to dynamically search for transactions and data related to do the Bitcoin blockchain and then shortly after that we really just an API which made it a lot easier for people to build on top of Bitcoin and then shortly after that we released the first hybrid wallet that enabled people to use Bitcoin you know from a mobile phone like iOS Android back then even Windows Phone or web without giving up control of their Bitcoin while still having their private keys and you know today we're probably most known for the wallet and the black Explorer and today's wallet supports you know a range of assets across different crypto networks as does the Explorer and millions and millions of people around the world use our products every day so as far as I understand I think one of your co-founder has been Reeves worked with Bryan Armstrong for a short period on the product that eventually became coinbase and this wired article it's kind of old indicates that they had philosophical differences that were like custodial versus non-custodial approaches and in general I've noticed just you know from browsing your website and stuff that blocking com seems to like really always talk about its philosophy that users should own their own private keys why is this such an important tenet for the company yeah so it's definitely their story and they've told that but I think it's it's important to note there that the relationship was more about using the initial traction blockchain had to apply to Y Combinator and so Ben never worked on coinbase I guess in a way Bryan worked on blockchain and the difference in philosophy as you rightly point out a hundred percent comes down to how you feel people should use crypto so in our view you know crypto is more than just an investment or a fad or a quick way to make money it's a way to take control of your own financial future to be a self sovereign financial individual and a noncustodial solution destroying your crypto is the very center piece to that and that's been an our belief as a company since 2012 since long before that belief was possible or really even a good idea and it's funny how things in crypto come full circle you know if you went back to late 2013 when people started raising venture capital the idea that millions of people would use a noncustodial wallet was like almost a joke you know and so you had every and your give back and like a blog posts and Twitter accounts you know you had every sort of analyst in the market saying that the non-custodial solutions didn't stand a chance up against the custody stuff and coinbase was of course a big big one in that category but so was circle and Zappo which were experienced he owes bringing products to market and what was interesting about the time was it was really a philosophical debate like will most bitcoins be stored in you know you all it solutions where the company has controlled the money or will this noncustodial thing really happened at the time the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions were generated actually by custody products by products where the user didn't have control their funds partly this is due to how many Bitcoin transactions were being generated by mal Cox right partly this had to do with you know the fact that five six years ago using a noncustodial solution was a much bigger sacrifice from a usability standpoint than it is today and one things that happened over the course of the last year's I think very few people would have predicted is that it's actually shifted dramatically to non-custodial so fewer bitcoins are held in custody products today as a percentage at any point in crypto history and more transactions in both Bitcoin and aetherium are generated by non-custodial products than by custodial products which is a fascinating way that the market is turned out and the extent to which this is true is you know really deep even down to a market structure and strategy perspective where you have folks that have long been associated with custody products you know where with full custody products who are now building non-custodial products and the reason has to do with the future of crypto in our view which is that you know outside of you know a simple speculation product almost everything interesting that you can build with crypto in crypto assets in the crypto financial system relies on your customer having a private key that they control so when people talk about def I I or just your did identities or you know on G and lending or all this stuff that you know the magical financial future that we're all trying to build none of it works unless you have users that have their own private key well you just said so many interesting things I want to follow up on but one was the stats that you mentioned about how there's more bitcoins now or I don't remember how you phrased it but there's more bitcoins now I think that our noncustodial then then ever in bitcoins history how do you know that so we have a large team of data scientists and probably the deepest proprietary data set about the Bitcoin network in the industry and so we're able to look at where you know the bitcoins in circulation or bitcoins in storage are on an hourly mark-to-market basis so we can tell you what venues are have more reserves what venues have less on an hour-by-hour mark and we can tell for example like that exchanges have less bitcoins in custody today than they did X you know time interval ago etc and when did you see that trend starting and like do you think there were any particular drivers of it yeah you know the high point for custody products was in late 2014 early 2015 I believe when I'd have to I'd have to look to be exactly sure but that was the high point for custody products as a class that's interesting sort of like almost a year after GOx and then ever since then it's been going down correct yeah because you remember there's a big mountain ox hack right but then shortly thereafter there was also the BitFenix hack and BitFenix had a huge amount of funds under under custody when that happened and there was a major capital flight and the behavior changed from I'm gonna open up you know an account on an exchange and buy a Bitcoin and let it sit there too I'm gonna pull that back and we were going to the largest beneficiaries of that we had a major major inflow into our platform in that time period people also generally the idea that like you're going to buy your crypto and then pull it off is kind of like a generally accepted principle now rather than you know if you go back to 2014 2013 and you're like oh what you do with your crypto once you buy it here bless it there all right put it on a hard drive that you later accidentally throw out and no though tinta average behavior was wire money about GOx orbit Phenix our bits dam but mostly mal Cox and Biff Enix buy the crypto let's oh I see I mean let it sit on the exchange yeah so and now that sort of acknowledge is like probably a bad idea all right so you know even coin base which is a huge in the market of Custody products today hasn't really seen the amount a bitcoin to have under management meaningfully go up despite the fact that they're serving far more customers yeah well I'm sure both ahead of the Bitcoin cash hard fork we know that you know the reserves got depleted by about half so that was a big yeah massive depletion there yeah did you guys benefit from that massively because one of the other things about every user having their own private key is that it means every user can split their funds right and so it's much easier for us to split users funds and get them access to things on another chain than it is for a custody product right well yeah this is already getting super interesting and I haven't even gotten to ask you a very important question which is so you were not one you were not present like in the very beginning of blockchain so how did you get involved in this company and what did you guys do and what did you do before I guess one of the things is interesting about about startups is that there's always like some pressure after the startup goes somewhere to invent a really clean Genesis story like this really beautiful moment where there's this insight in this co-working space and then we all apply to Y Combinator together and then raise capital from SV angel or something and that's never what happened here watching for years was more of a collective of people who cared about Bitcoin and cared about building cool stuff than it was a company and there were lots of people that had lots of roles throughout that in fact there wasn't formally a company that held the intellectual property of blockchain until shortly before we raised our first venture round and so it's really hard to tell like where where did the company start when did they company start the thing that we know and is important to the people internally that were there is that at some point when we decided that we were gonna go from being a collective to being a company we sat down and identified who were the cofounders of the company you know how we're going to be related to each other in the future and who was gonna drive the company forward and you know that that was a that was a very deliberate decision that we took one because it was clear that the company needed to scale pretty quickly at that time and needed outside caliber to do so the second being that some folks inside the company you know inside that group of four people were much more excited about being sort of at the at the front of that drive which has been tough like being a founder of a cryptocurrency company is a stressful and personally high-risk endeavor not just for me like normal startup stress perspective but also from a personal security and safety perspective and it was becoming clear that that was a sacrifice people were gonna have to make so you know and and this is sort of like a question of a fascination for journalists like what you know we're never watching come from because everyone's heard the charming stories of York and like the apartment in the North that we all worked in and the reality is like you know even even most of us that were there don't really know and this sort of only salient point of like when did we all get involved in the company is when we all sat down and decided to incorporate the thing which was only maybe six months before we raise the lights be around now you've expanded well beyond the wallet you've got your institutional vertical called markets which also has a research unit you've got lock box which is your Hardware wallet you've obviously done the data service or the block explores for quite a while so how do all these pieces work together like what is the overarching vision for the but yeah so you know we got start with a pretty simple mission which was like make Bitcoin a little easier to use and we had a big change up to that mission which is basically make crypto away easier to use so just brought in the number of assets when when more interesting Kryptos came around the block which was a controversial decision at the time but not every crypto company from the era were from has decided to do that and wait and just so I know when did you decide to add more well two and half years ago no okay and the challenge is that when we first started every crypto user had basically the same needs and you know keeping in mind that it's our core belief they are not really using crypto unless you have your own private key so like ever everybody had the same set of needs we're like how can we make it possible for Laura to use crypto and have her own private key but Laura and Mickey Malka both had basically the same requirement set back then and I don't know a lot about your personal financial situation but let's just say it's not like Mickey Mouse right you could use a Visa a trivet capital by the way for people who don't know and it was one of our very early users and once terrified us with the balance of his account and or another person that's spoken a lot about using our product in in a very heavy way Jim Robinson Atari right so let's think about but yeah it's something that's interesting is it's funny that you mentioned milky Mickey because he invested in point base yeah yeah for sure but anyway so keep going I think kept using our products we don't we never we never met with ribbit because of the conflict was app oh oh I see yeah that's all not very interesting but any case the needs diverged a lot so like your needs and and Jim Robinsons needs are very divergent we can't serve you both with the same prod the needs of some of our institutional partners that we work with to provide liquidity on specific assets and to provide liquidity inside our wallet are very different from you know my needs or your needs or the next person's needs and so we've you know I've had to deepen our product offering to basically serve specific client needs they had to remember we have a lot of clients who date back to 2012 2011 they now have huge amounts of notional value in crypto right right and our you know consumer brokerage trading product swap doesn't work for them like we do ten thousand twenty thousand dollar trades in there we all do forty million dollar trades and we have twenty twelve customers that do forty million dollar trades with us so you need the markets team right because you're not doing a 40 million dollar trade inside the wallet okay we'd love to figure out how to do it compliance would kill us you know you have folks who are about twenty thirty percent of our customers are active traders and they mostly use other exchange products and then sweep their funds back to blockchain we can see them doing that constantly so like how do we better serve their needs how do we make it easier to enable that use case you know even down to like the institutions that we work with that do a lot of liquidity so quantitative trading funds they have a need to borrow crypto both to hedge positions as well as to provide inventory at venues that they trade on and so we now run a you know pretty deep lending operation yeah well loan like mid nine digits of crypto this quarter which I guess probably makes us like a top five lender in the crypto market and so generally speaking like we're very product development focused company when there's a customer need we're gonna do our best to to provide that to our customers and as it broadens the number of you know I think it nation-states will be encrypted at some point what kind of products are we gonna have to build nation states I don't know but I'm pretty excited to find out you know when I circle back to that but so just a question so if you're non-custodial but you're lending nine figures worth of or a US dollar dollar value I guess so where does that word of those bitcoins come from magic um know one of the great assets of the company is our relationships with you know crypto holders whether that's consumers you know business is crypto projects and so we're generally able to borrow a lot of inventory so you know we borrow from a long-term holder we then lend out short-term loans that's how the TEL lending desks work generally and we just happen to have very deep relationships to the supply side in the market we do though in this is good for you to bring one out we do also run a custody and vault product now and so there are clients that you know being entirely non-custodial doesn't make sense you know a good example of that is uh all those clients are so secretive so it's like really hard to talk about them but like what you example yeah like it uh XY is that crypto project yeah they hold a self custody a ton of their assets but they don't want to be single threaded right they don't want to be totally exposed to one system right and so they've parked a significant amount of their reserve capital in our custody system now that's a very different use case from like the average person but does that crypto project have their own private keys absolutely does every single client that we deal with have their own private keys absolutely but there are some use cases where we need to have custody of their funds to enable a product or use case and in that scenario we have we have a custody and vault system that we run in its you know one of these like crazy you know multi geography multi system personnel redundant like in the side of a mountain with armed guards kind of kind of situation it's like a mini zoppo it's heavier it's heavier duty than Zappo and the reason is that topo system is you know half a decade old at this point ours is not at all believed maybe year old oh well so will the current version that we're on is about a year old and so it's it's a bit more of a modern system but it's a what the country is like geographically politically system and Technology redundant we don't really lead like a go-to-market proposition with the custody product and the reason and it's super sexy to talk about custody products over the last year in the crypto space and the reason is it's not a very good business because almost everybody custody provider will custody assets for free like will store your assets for free if you're qualified client so like you know how much marketing and sales effort do you want to put behind something that like if will provide it for free other people will provide it for all if you get into staking then you can make money from that and we do stake oh really yeah but your client target your clients expect you to give them most of station fees what's so but you I mean you can't make money from it very small amounts of money and it's you know it's like at this point in the game the staking ecosystem is very small but so I'm confused because you offer Bitcoin Bitcoin cash like no ether and xlm so yeah we also offer a stable coin in the wallet so but where does thinking come in we don't stake in the wallet our custody system stakes oh so you you allow a storage of other assets yeah our custody system holds like 47 different assets oh okay okay so it was gonna ask in our markets operation we'll trade anything almost anything Wow okay yeah so well we talk about like your OC o TC yeah we trade heavy volume in all kinds of assets that are not in the wallet alright so I actually was gonna ask you kind of a set of questions about your typical customer but it sort of sounds like you kind of don't have a typical customer because you're you're serving people like me as well as like the Mickey malkos and the Jim Robinsons I can break it down for you okay so it's basically like crypto G's some people Bank crypto a long time right then there's like people like you well maybe Ricardo is she I don't know yeah but there's like your average retail consumer right and they're like you know 22 237 years old and you know they're they have yeah they usually bought a couple thousand dollars of crypto right and okay if they did that in 2013 then I have a lot of crypto if they did that in 2017 then I was much crypto like you know so on and so forth okay and those customers are served in the wallet for the most part then there is a group of you know high-net-worth sort of individuals and those folks we serve out of our marques business so OTC II trading as well as investing into our fund products so we have asset we have actively managed products as well right like your you have a venture fund we do yeah we do yeah when did that launch I didn't very quietly about nine months ago okay yeah I just saw that website I was like come on I don't remember hearing that very quietly we've been investing out of it and it has both internal capital and external capital okay that's an unusual unusual and I like an are you investing for equity or yeah okay equity tokens oh whatever Oh interesting names podcasts really no not not like I'm looking for any we have not yet invested in a podcast well people always talk about like tokenizing like an individual yeah and like you'd be such a cool test case of tokenizing an invis I know but it would be like a securities offering Switzerland [Laughter] Switzerland once know it's like this place is super sterile I did I'm going back again very soon so we'll see what I think that's all wrong maybe I like it so anyway we've got those clients okay and then we've got you know what I would call like entities and these are you know quantitative trading funds crypto hedge funds crypto venture funds multi-asset market makers and then crypto projects select protocol projects we do business across that whole vertical Wow okay so once you decided to go the multi token University really went for it alright so we're gonna talk a little bit more about blockchains main business lines in a moment but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors today's episode is brought to you by Kraken Kraken is the best exchange in the world for buying and selling digital assets with all

your crypto business safe and trusted learn more at siphysicians.org have you noticed behaviors amongst that set changing over time like you know how do they transact what for and also like since I don't think you collect a ton of information on you use it like how would you figure that stuff out there were a few questions in there yes we're playing this game way more questions than I can ask and you are taking wait longer to answer every single question so I'm trying to pack them in so consumer behavior it's basically we have different buckets of consumers and it's easy to cut them in two ways one is developed world vers non developed world the other is crisis economies there's non-crisis economies and then the last way to cut it is active traders vers not active traders okay and all of those cuts will give you very different sort of outcomes about user behavior and they're in there mostly like stuff very logical for you to gas people in crisis countries they keep doing what they're doing regardless of what the price of Bitcoin is doing because whatever the price of Bitcoin is doing is not worse than what's going on in their country right selecting Venezuela is unimpacted what you know our Venezuelan metrics are not driven by the price of Bitcoin they're driven by the disaster in Venezuela right same cause it's true for Ukraine right etc then active traders are very specific you know they log in all the time it's very correlated to price you know they're gonna log in and make trades or log in and move money to venues that's what they do and so you literally watch it coins from those wallets go to exchanges and then come back or something or in the aggregate so all of our customer level analysis is done aggregated and in autumn eyes so I don't know what you did with your wallet but I know what everyone did what their wallets yesterday okay then the last segment is sort of America in Europe first everywhere else American custom race is the hardest customer base to keep interested oh really but the fastest velocity customer base when the market starts moving Hello America is like the supreme speculators in the crypto market and so you know the we joked that the American user base is like a blessing in a curse because when the markets ripping you'll do a lot of revenue off of it but it's impossible to get them interested when the markets quiet on top of that there's a noisiest customers so they filed the most support tickets oh yeah then the noisiest on social media and all the way down the line the other thing that's really interesting fact about watching is that we do provide a fair number of regulated services regulated products and for all of those products we have to comply with relevant FCA you know US Treasury ESA all the acronyms compliance laws right and so one of the things that is not widely known about blockchain is that we have probably you know put more people through compliance processes in the last year than maybe any other FinTech country FinTech company out there so currently today we do about you know anywhere from twenty to thirty thousand identity verifications a day which because of the way you have to buy capacity at the vendors you kind of know whose mind capacity where and really puts us in a league of our own on how many i dvds are buying I do yes I don't know someone that might be because you only started doing that recently as well right we've been doing it for two and a half years okay so but still I mean like coinbase was doing it long before so spread out because I think maybe you guys have like roughly the same I don't know it's hard to know exactly but just to go back I want to know what is the theory around like why Americans are so difficult to interest in a down market and like the the quickest jump when it's in a market they're just there to speculate oh okay yeah but also I think probably maybe this is like an obvious thing to say but just because they have like a well-functioning financial system so they sort of don't need Bitcoin for any other reason right yeah if you're born in America you won the lottery like yeah I mean even the EU is okay but not nearly as good as America like you know you have the dollar you have access to $1.00 to live in the UK I still nice to the dollar Laura that's true that's true alright we're gonna stop about you because this is about blockchain so something that I'm so curious about is why did it take until January 2018 to enable buying and selling on blockchain so if you remember early in our conversation we're talking about our mission being to make it easy for people their own funds and it took us a long time to get the product at a parody of convenience with centralized wallets and so you know we had to rewrite entire encryption libraries we had to improve buffering we had to like create I mean this is a huge computer science investment to get to the point where like you know if you pull out your iPhone your Android and your web you know your laptop you can log into your wallet on all three simultaneously and stay in sync like that is something that seems like a small thing but is actually incredibly difficult to pull off as it turns out it's much easier to build a centralized solution to the problem of holding customer funds we know that because we have a centralized solution nowadays but building the decentralized one in a way that like is easy for Laura to use and is easy for my little brother she is not an engineer is really challenging and it took us years and it was a huge investment to do that to invest in the data products and invest in the stuff that it powers our acquisition funnel so we just didn't get to it and our view is like do we want to be at the center of the crypto financial system or do we want to be running the toll booths at the edge of the system and we wanted to always bias towards you know even if it was painful in the short term making sure that we maneuver ourselves in such a way that we had a shot at being at the center of the crypto financial system and not operating a toll booth on the edge right so but one other thing just to go back to the buying and selling is it actually possible for us presidents to purchase on blocking comm because actually I could not figure this out easily and because I'm a New York president that with like hurdles not possible for New York presidents okay but what about other states most states in the u.s. it is the number of states is sort of consistently expanding and by the end of this year we'll be more or less complete okay yeah it's at 22 states now and when you say they can purchase do you mean all the assets you have are Bitcoin that going cash aetherium correct okay okay and then I also wanted to ask work you know we work with we directly work with a wide variety of banking and card payment processors to do that okay so what we're much heavier on the fiat side of life in europe than we are in the United States oh oh so you do surf more it was an on-ramp here yeah okay um so I wanted to ask also now about the higher end of your customers what kind of volume are you doing on your OTC desk OTC volume is incredibly cyclical and spiky so like you'll have a really big month and you're gonna have like a month or like crickets we have gradually over the last year moved away from trading with a lot of humans and more and more towards trading programmatically so you know the API that powers all the liquidity our wallets is is very robust and is capable of pricing risk in size and so we've started piping that into other platforms and providing liquidity programmatically rather than you know via humans so you're talking about sort of like a dark pool direct our internal trading system very much looks like a dark pool and then so we've been and not trading systems probably interesting to talk about okay he's a huge investment it's a machine trading platform it plugs into other venues like exchanges but it also plugs into the largest market makers directly and so most of time we're not even going to venues anymore we're either hedging risk out at a derivative or we're hedging it out at like quantitative market maker level but almost the vast majority of our flow like on a typical day eighty percent plus is being cross-matched internally within our internalized matching engine and so it's very very much looks like a dark pool and so you'll even see like big OTC odor is taken down against the retail flow and stuff like that just super fascinating oh that is interesting and no wait and then when you said eighty percent what is the other toilet do you is the other twenty just the wallet no no that's Oh eighty percent is internally so I trade you trade Sara trades and we crossed net all that together inside the matching engine of course it's just three of us traded it wouldn't be possible but if thousands in this trade is and so from a scale perspective it's interesting that we're at a point now where most of its internalized the other 20% is when like the book gets out of balance right and like suddenly we're like huh people are selling a lot of bitcoins and no one's buying them so we got to take that risk off we go sell some bitcoins to somebody and that's when it will ping one of those market makers or you know look at pricing on another venue but basically it combines the aggregated prices and order books from all of the places plugged into the smart trading platform which is located right now I think it's 17 venues it looks for the best price and then sprays it around okay and you did that dirt pool basically because it's more efficient yep it's much more efficient it also like you know most of the consumer crypto platforms has struggled with a lack of liquidity and I think when you start offering liquidity you have to be bulletproof like you have to always be able to offer a customer trade and at a great price and so it was really important that we built the machine trading infrastructure and all the associated data science that goes with it to be able to ensure that like rock-solid bulletproof liquidity so something that I noticed when I was doing the research is back in 2018 you announced through fortune that you were building it in exchange so what happened with that I don't think we've ever announced that we were building in exchange oh there was an interview with you and fortune where it said that you made this hire I'm trying to remember from where from Goldman or somewhere and the plan was to build an exchange with that hire it was in january Orphan Utley hired no talent from Goldman there's our head of markets charlie Megara is a former goldman partner and ran their global metals trading business but he very much is in the as in that markets team that runs the dark pole and all that stuff okay it's too bad that I don't have internet here because I have the link but well I'll link to it in this I mean it's often so but I can do I can talk about it okay it's often been guessed that we would build an exchange and so there's been articles and I'm not sure about this one that has speculated that we'll build one you know we have a lot of clients who are active traders we have a lot of liquidity and we run in an internal order book and so that those facts are widely known and people would guess like why don't you build your own exchange rally is that and really want to build an exchange and my hope and hope remains that there will be a really solid exchange developed that will serve as the spot price leader for crypto you know fortunately you don't think it was a contender yet I think and I you know if you asked me like what I thought would happen five years ago that I was right about and what I was wrong about this would be the biggest shock in the market to me hmm which is that no one's really built that product in the sense that you know we're very active on all these videos I've been trading for a long time I've been tricked crypto for a long time the venues are really haven't evolved much since like four or five years ago and you know for a long time BitFenix was the leader in spot price discovery right they've lost banking you know their banking is really for the app for a client like us their banking doesn't work anymore right but they're matching engine always worked right they're matching engine was reliable it always worked but even both Enix hasn't really evolved into like a institutional sub 100 microsecond exchange you look at the other products out there you know their order books are very illiquid and toxic and or their matching engines just don't work what is it a little bit courage for a matching engine to be toxic so markets toxic when the liquidity is like very thin at the top of the book and it the spread between is wide but toxicity is like a mathematical concept inside an order book and is super interesting to to research but the bigger problem is like the matching engines just don't work when there's a ton of velocity this is partly because it's tech companies building matching engines rather than people who build matching engines building magic what about finance finances matching engine is totally distributed inside of Amazon Web Services so it's not like a Colo it's like a to 300 microsecond at best matching engine you know which in any normal market would be like 1990 speed it's it's you know it's not geared towards you know being a spot price discovery leader it's geared towards sort of being like a Amazon of crypto appstats or walmart like we have everything you know it's it's about breadth not speed and they don't have a banking so you can't write you can't trade when I say spot market it's probably important for me to clarify that I mean like a place I can trade dollars in euros and pounds for digital assets okay right which I can't do it finance right although they've I think they're starting to turn on some of the Fiat exchanges those so far have always been outside of the core by nan sort of look they're sort of like little franchise isn't very liquid oh that's right yeah you can destroy the whole Malta order book with one Bitcoin so it's not really the solution yeah so it looks like there's this opportunity for you that's like just right yeah yeah and then we'd be running an exchange look you know I wouldn't I wouldn't rule it out in the future but I think I think that historically we've been a neutral participant in the and the sort of exchange ecosystem but you know one of the things that I think is challenging is that does hold the whole space back like you know this week which I know I've been told not to say this week but recently there was a crash if I tell the listener is all about how we do things here at dungeon but anyway no there was a crash of bitstamp right someone put a really big order which should have been stopped by a caller oh I thought Devi want we have this and so a caller is like a risk on it which is basically designed to like not rip your whole tour book up right bitstamp doesn't have collars because the the matching engine they used is the one they built six years ago and there's no collar and then it's slow so it took minutes to grind to disorder which meant that the entire reference rate on all the driven exchanges was impacted right like that max like the max terabit etc and the whole like the global crypto order book ripped off of one order for several thousand bitcoins which like in a properly functioning venue with a fast matching engine that order should have been ground through in seconds and when that order was gone through in seconds it never hits the reference right right and so when you have these kind of problems like you know it just increases volatility it destroys trust and it seems like a problem that just is going nowhere which is frankly shocking to me after half a decade yeah yeah I saw her tweeting about that and how essentially they profited from that with some kind of trade on bit max because they knew that was what was gonna happen so Duffy by the way is like I don't know her at all but she is one of the most fascinating people to follow on Twitter and super insightful and also I know she's I saw her hilariously tweet I forgot what it was some news about the finnex or something and then like Mike Duda said the block was like damn it like we're gonna do the story but then like she you know whatever you've adopted segue the upgrade for Bitcoin which enables more transactions with each block on some of your products but not on others including your main products to the blockchain wallet why not yeah so I think one important thing is to step back and understand I brought our context of cygwin say what is a change to other way signatures are handled in Bitcoin that improves efficiency and generally speaking when the Bitcoin community decided to focus on technology that would increase the efficiency of transactions rather than the throughput of transactions it moved a lot of work from the protocol to clients to people using you know sort of to the end users of the protocol and software providers one of the things it's important to understand about the way that our software works is that all of our software is generating transactions on the client-side which means that we have to handle that signing module across you know every model of iPhone every model of Android you know tons of web browsers window devices so it's it's not even just when we change something in an encryption library changing it on three apps it's changing it to support hundreds of devices past that and it's the riskiest kind of change we can make because if something goes wrong you know our clients funds will be a risk when their transactions aren't signed properly pass that we also have to move clients funds to a new output type which means that we have to do this across all our platforms simultaneously and some of our platforms like iOS are behind other projects like web so if we only needed to roll it out on one platform we would have already rolled it out on some of our products some of our wallets so we've already rolled it out on web for example but it has to be a simultaneous release and to get it really really right we probably have to dedicate a whole cycle you know by the time it was rolled out fees had already spiked and then come back down and so you know saving an extra 30 percent on fees hasn't really been at the top of our product roadmap customers you know when they when we surveyed them about what they want what kind of features they need it's usually about broader access to assets ways to store their crypto and liquidity to trade between their crypto it's very rarely you know help me save 30 percent on Bitcoin transaction fees and so while there's a huge amount of interest on Twitter from about 15 or 20 Twitter accounts for us to adopts a gwit there's not a lot of demand for it across our customer base relevant of to other product priorities now that said you know we felt like it was important to support Sigrid on our block Explorer otherwise you know the number one place people look up transactions wouldn't show sacred transactions that would be terrible and so we had that to go ready from day one on our custody systems it's there on our clearing and settlement systems it's there so we actually do thousands of Sabre transactions des this will not make any of the folks that want us to do say quit and happy hearing this because you know quite fairly we generate twenty to thirty percent of all Bitcoin transactions and so folks really want to see us adopt because for the last year adoption of cygwin has basically stalled and what at say to those folks is you know we are going to get there I won't promise you exactly when it'll depend a lot on what happens tomorrow and what gets prioritized in the dev roadmap and you know is there another unplanned fork that we have to deal with it's just kind of constant but we will get there and we'll get there when we can do it in a safe way across all of our platforms for all of our clients you know I got started in this to help make Bitcoin useful and easy for people and I'm still super passionate about Bitcoin it's kind of like your first love and want to see a be as successful as possible but today Bitcoin is really as a community committed to that digital gold thesis and narrative and if you believe bitcoin is digital gold you don't need cheap fees so every time someone on Twitter says like Bitcoin doesn't need to you please I say absolutely and that's a lot of the reason why I say what hasn't been prioritized all right yeah but previously you were in the camp that didn't want it to be digital gold and that's why you signed this equity works thing right I thought and still believed that Bitcoin could be more than one thing I thought it could be digital gold and it could be cached for the internet the community didn't agree with me and there was a lot of us that felt like Bitcoin could be more than one thing and you know turns out we were in the minority maybe Bitcoin will be more than one thing in the future today is digital gold and supporting that use case means liquidity it means fiat on-ramps it means you know storage types like adding hardware or wallets but it doesn't mean optimizing for cheap fees so I wanted to ask you also you know we've been talking about like all the different jurisdictions and stuff what has it been like trying to manage all these regulatory issues cross you know multiple jurisdictions and like and just out of curiosity also how would you compare the different jurisdictions I don't think it would be wise for me as the CEO of the firm to comment on which jurisdictions are my favorite oh please they're all my favorite oh really of course absolutely and jokes aside though it's been tough it's been really tough you know one of the first meetings I did external meetings on behalf of the company was I went in and met with the head of fencing at the time like seven years ago and was like here's what we're doing what had the roles she was like this is a strange meeting because I had no lawyers with me you know no legal advice it just came in I was like tell me what the rules are and so I think you know most of time regulators are pretty reasonable they're like usually reasonable people that want to achieve a certain outcome I think understanding that's important I think also understanding like what are your bright lines like what are the things you're not willing to do like in our case we're not willing to give up on the dream of everyone having their own private key right so that model doesn't work with existing regulation like the idea of like everyone being their own bank isn't something that regulation thought about 15 years ago was written or 30 years ago whatever and so we've had to engage any a global campaign to advocate on behalf of the non-custodial model and as the largest company running non-custodial front and center you know the burden of doing that work has largely fallen on us and so we've engaged in public advocacy work on behalf of that idea you know in countries all over the world often very expensive campaigns and we've been fortunate to you know to be able to reach a place with a regulator in most most jurisdictions where they agree with us and that's been tough and it's been a huge drain of time and resources but like because that's something that we believe in so deeply it's worth it Fattah like Ashley recently wrote this blog post where he was saying that some of these regulations coming out around data privacy and then like there infants and guidance on crypto that all those things are positive for peer-to-peer transactions and you may not know the things something either but down very I'm very familiar with the fencin thing yeah because it basically was like a boon I would think for your kind of company we spent many years working with ving Tsun okay yeah yeah so I mean enjoy yeah so I think it's you know and if you believe that the future like as Vitalik does the future of crypto is in people having their own keys and is in software powering this whole financial system that guidance from fencing was incredibly positive yeah for you in particular for plugging in particular or I mean but then more broadly for peer-to-peer transacting yeah I think you know you're right it wasn't it it was most likely incredibly positive for blocking I think when we think about the mission of blocking which is like is what is important to at least me and the reason that I'm still here every day for god knows how long it was broadly so broadly positive for the whole class of products that I was I was really happy to see it at the same time though you know this is like a thing that requires constant vigilance and constant effort because it's not a concept like crypto people understand it you know whenever we talked about you know say I sit down with like a metallic and I'm like talking well Vitalik actually gets this stuff but I sit down with the average crypto and Sherin like oh you have to like explain this to regulators all over the world are like why it's so obvious I'm like whoa not obvious to the regulator and so we require you know constant have a casino explanation and and you know we haven't been alone in that I think coin Center has been a powerful ally and advocate on this run as well but I think generally when you look at like what is positive in the crypto world the fact that like you know there was sort of like the first phase of the advocacy work around this was like the regulator bailing huh what and the next being like maybe and now it's kind of being accepted formally and I think that's super positive for the entire crypto ecosystem yeah yeah what the exception of that one Congress person wants to ban Bitcoin but anyway I think you know threatening to ban Bitcoin is a great way to the TVs and social media to pay attention to you for a day so I don't think it's all that serious yeah it was kind of like mmm all right are you gonna turn off the internet or what because all right something else I want to ask about is to do the stellar airdrop you've been requiring that people verify their identities and that sort of in some sense seems like a departure from Bach's genes ethos you know not exactly you know they're still maintaining control their private keys but but like directionally so we facing pressure from regulators to get more info on your users we so it's interesting the core belief here is never been in anonymity you know we've always like used your IP address to make sure that people don't log into your wallet that aren't you we've taken your phone number we've taken your email like we you know since day one we've collected enough information about customers that it was not a very anonymous service hmm the core value here is user control their funds right so why do we require you to verify your identity to receive the airdrop the answer is very simple we're sending you money and anytime that we're sending someone money we need to know their identity thanks to you a variety of regulators around the world you know the alphabet soup of three three-letter regulators you can still log onto our website today open up a wallet which is your email we're not gonna be able to send you free money we're not gonna be able to power your trading but you can still use our service and we're deeply committed to that you know one of the side of other reasons that we verify people's identity with airdrop is to combat synthetic fraud because anytime you do an airdrop people try to get more than their airdrop try to get their attacker drops right or a hundred thousand um and there's a whole cottage industry dedicated to referral fraud payments fraud and increasingly airdrop fraud and so you know we triangulate a wide variety of data points to prevent fraud in airdrops because we do airdrops not just a seller airdrop and the challenge is collecting enough statistically significant data points to build your fraud model and so a lot of the identity verification stuff feeds into our fraud models right right that makes sense and that also explains why it's been taking someone to do the stellar it's really hard it's a incredibly difficult computer science problem to give away free money at scale you know and look airdrops usually have fraud rate you know loss rate of around 40 to 60 percent so Oh meaning that you're sending money to these accounts that are like well that for air drops normally yeah so if you look at air drops historically yeah forty to sixty percent of the air drop is lost to fraudsters we you know internally had a target of under ten percent when we told people that they're like you're insane and when the air drop first started we were definitely not under ten percent today we're in the single-digit percentage well it has been a huge like multi-million dollar investment into the fraud and data science side to make that possible okay yeah cuz I could see some users complaining about why it was taking so long and stuff but it look there's a huge wait list right now we have on the air drop there's probably 50 60 thousand people in the backlog but generally to onboard a blockchain right now there's probably a wait list that's I think 450,000 people deep wait for the wallet yeah and why is that because we will let you sign up it's very low friction you do it in 30 seconds but if you want to go through more onboarding to be able to trade to have access to Fiat maybe access to air drops there's a further verification process you need to go through and depending on your jurisdiction it can be identity verification it can be you know all kinds of stuff it really depends on your jurisdiction but we can only process so many applications a day and today we process you know thirty forty thousand a day but even with that level which is a lot we still have a backlog of about four hundred and fifty thousand people waiting to be processed so it takes what a couple weeks or something to get on board it really varies by country oh okay so I actually want to circle back to something that you mentioned at the beginning which is government world governments participating in digital currency in some fashion whether it might be like releasing their own central bank digital currency in August 2017 you said at the time that we were two years out from a top 30 government in the world releasing a central bank digital currency that's just in a couple months so where do you stand on that prediction now and maybe he wanted I didn't know what you were gonna say earlier when you brought that up if you wanted to add on that yeah so I think we're closer on a Western government like a g7 government than people think and by August maybe and Venezuela already released theirs which is not a top 30 and not a real Venezuela oh oh you know that's a good question I don't know well if you look at my place you look at a 10 year snapshot Venezuela is a top 10 top 30 country if you look at a one-year strap shot thanks to their cut economy falling off the list it's not so is this close to being right Laura I can't give you that one but anyway but anyways like this is a pretty bold prediction I you know I almost got there didn't quite and I think that you know the other countries that are close to it that have made a lot of progress in the background Russia which their project is very advanced the Canadians got quite close and then didn't do it and I was counting on the Canadians or that or the Danish people and you know the Canadians didn't quite get there but like we'll see I'm very happy to be right about the two years if I'm if something happens in the next year or two I almost well what we'll see the Canadians definitely have been front and center with the other thing that government is going to do is start holding crypto as part of their foreign reserves so really want to put a deadline on that prediction we can always reference it later my podcast sure but government's already hold crypto hmm which ones and in which kryptos Slovakia holds a lot of Bitcoin big office for what purpose oh but they made the right choice not to sell it huh right and there's that's public there's other governments that are haven't publicly disclosed that are holding Bitcoin that they confiscated I'm not yet aware of a government that's bought a large position of Bitcoin or aetherium or anything else but they're certainly government said of that ever holding large positions and there are sovereign wealth funds that are holding positions all right if you count the sovereign wealth fund as the government then it's already happened okay so I'm happy to make that projection okay yeah I think that was already public you've also said that blockchain plans to go public in the next few years why and do you see any challenge in doing that because as we know the crypto markets are very volatile and sometimes there are these long winters but you know when your public shareholders are looking at quarterly earnings yeah so the first thing is like when we go public we'll be able to look at a broad array of ways to go public which will be super interesting so like you know well it'd be annex and we'll non crypto companies be going public by issuing tokens at that point like major ones that'll be interesting well we go public on nicey you know who knows okay I think you've identified the problem for every major crypt every major venture-backed crypto company though inches volatility yes and we've been very very principled about how we have thought about revenue and trying to only generate revenue when we thought we could do it in a sustainable predictable way and so our financials are much less volatile looking than probably any other major crypto company we're probably the most capital efficient by an order of magnitude so we've spent by far the least money of any major crypto company we've also probably have the most stable set of financials and this is largely because one we are very long-term and being long-term a lot is about the predictable and managing a risk too we knew that we wanted to go public someday and to do that like we need to be predictable and stable and just to be clear for people because I did skip a whole bunch of questions because you were talking a bit long but basically the way you guys generate revenue is charging transaction fees on transactions I imagine it's it's the same whether or not the same fee but but you do that both at the high end low end of your customer base so we don't charge for transactions trades Oh trades all right because you have to remember that we do a hundred thousand ish transactions on crypto a day not all of those are trades and those transactions like when you pull out your wallet and you send me back coin there is a transaction fee but we just charge you our pass-through cost of that transaction we don't charge you anything on top of that when you trade we do take a margin on every trade okay and is that your main source of revenue that and advertising and then asset management which our lending business is inside of okay so something that was curious about is also there's been a number of Wall Street executives hired at crypto companies here I'm watching but also competitors for instance you hire Jamie Selway who came from a broker-dealer and trading technology from an investment Technology Group but many of these people whether here a blockchain or at other companies but including Jamie did leave within a short time period why do you think that is yeah so last year we went through the you know tough transition of building a real executive team so we tired eight execs last year promoted others internally it's a hard thing to pull off probably one of the harder things that I've ever worked on here at blockchain yeah not all that made it you know we hired people from not just Jamie but we hired people from Twitter TD Ameritrade Goldman we heard a public company CFO all the way down the line right and people worked out and are essentially running the firm today so you know i talked about the goldman partner the former goldman partner Charlie that runs markets now phenomenal leader inside the business our CFO who came from fortress in one main you know it took a company public and you know has the super resume right Macrina incredible and effective leader both of these people are from finance you know I have another executive in our product team from TD Ameritrade like it's from equities right our general manager of our wallet is a long time executive here named Zen who came from UBS ran a training team at UBS so the point that I'm making is is that it's not so much about people coming from finance a lot of those people have worked out it's that not everyone's gonna make it inside the context of our crypto firm right and I think what separates people out here is that you have to like the work we do is really hard like really hard and probably even harder than the average repair company because of the non-custodial thing and you have to really believe in that vision and we're not able to you know baptize everyone into the cult and so you know when you're building out these exact teams you expect a certain you know a certain loss rate or rejection rate it's almost like the body you know rejecting an implant now at the same time it's been true that the wave of people of big name execs into crypto companies in the wave out you know we had our Jamie Selway coinbase had their docking Kellner it has been you know pretty consistent and you know I think I think that's probably the same story right which is just it's it's hard to mainstream these people over I think equity people in general have been really hard even when we look at you know lower levels across the org partially this is because equities people are used to a very defined market structure of custodians clearers and all this stuff and you kind of get equities people in the critical market and they're like okay so how's this all work and you're like well we have to build the custody the clearing the custodian the lending that routing that they're like holy really this is gonna be impossible and you're like yep yeah it's basically impossible but like we might as well get on with it you know versus like you know folks that you hire out of like commodities has you know been very different commodities private equity those are folks who are used to these kinds of exotic strange rapidly evolving global markets and the other thing you know I talk about global is like equities folks are very like if you hire someone in equities in the US they have really only done America ever because equity markets are national nice whereas if you hire people from commodities commodities people do it all world and so it's very tough to make the jump from equities to corrupt jail and we've seen that play out here and and almost every other crypto firm it's an interesting thesis if it makes sense so where can people learn more about you and blocking no one needs to learn more about me okay I'm on Twitter at one more Peter and then the company is at blockchain calm and you can go to blockchain khamseh less about if you want to learn more about the firm yeah by the way can I just say it is no fun it's like a total exercise in frustration googling Peter Smith blockchain I think this is like even like blockchain calm it really does not help very much you know like some founders want a profile they want credit whatever I don't this company was built by hundreds of people they don't know but it's like the Smith part and then the blockchain partner well I think do you guys regret using that name absolutely not it's an amazing name yeah it is except like I mean it's just very hard to find things about watching the company if it's the CEO like but anyway I think you know when you're we are company you you mostly think about acquisition you know acquiring new customers and we probably have the premiere property for that yes from your SEO property and so I finally I don't think we've regretted it much I know I should get like I don't know blockchain podcast.com or something I mean we could put your watching calm Podcast then you'd really do well I don't think anybody's gonna type that I joined our comm slash podcast do people types something yeah people type in boxing calm such wallet all the time they directly type in watching calm such markets okay you tell me if there's a search if like there are searches on your because because wouldn't can't your engineers figure out if people aren't having that in know of course ok so then maybe we'll talk all right thanks so much for coming on the show Peter it's been great having you you're welcome thanks so much for joining us today to learn
