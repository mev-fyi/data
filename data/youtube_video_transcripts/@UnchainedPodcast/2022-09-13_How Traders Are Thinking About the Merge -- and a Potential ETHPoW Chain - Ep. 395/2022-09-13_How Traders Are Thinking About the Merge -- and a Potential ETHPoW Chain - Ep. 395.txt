hey everyone the merge is upon us after this show is published ethereum's merge which will transition the blockchain to proof of stake will likely happen within about two days earlier this summer kevin zoe of galwa capital raised the ire of many people in ethereum when he talked about the likelihood that an ethereum proof of work chain would come out of the fork and in recent weeks it does look like there's a movement behind this so-called ethereum proof of work or eth pow fork though how successful or how smooth it will be is anyone's guess in this episode kevin and evgeny gaivoy of wintermute a large market maker in crypto discussed different ways the merge could play out honestly they said so many things that surprised me and we got to cover everything from the potential eth pow chain to bitcoin teeth itself to defy we talked about nfts and more litecoin dogecoin and shib even got a mention i hope you find this episode as thought-provoking as i did and also that you have

trading the merge here to discuss are kevin soh co-founder of galwa capital and evgeny gaivoy founder and ceo of wintermute welcome kevin and evgeny um yeah thanks for having us yep really nice to meet you so as we just mentioned ethereum's long-awaited merge will arrive very soon most likely a day or two after this podcast comes out probably the only other ethereum heart fork that was as closely watched as this one was the dao hard fork back in 2016. kevin your views on the merger is somewhat known but let's have you give a short recap of what you think will happen at a high level for people who either missed your earlier interview with me or haven't seen your tweets what do you think will happen at the time of the merge yeah happy to you know talk about that a little bit so you know i think just overall really sort of the contention that i have right now is that it could be a lot messier than i think a lot of people expect and you know i just kind of wanted to surface that with the community and i think for the most part a lot of these kinds of scenarios have already kind of been playing out in the market you know when when the futures curve backwardated a lot less now than before and uh you know i think that there's a lot of risks that are surrounding possible technical failures on the merge other kinds of you know weird griefing attacks by you know maybe certain actors within the space whether that be like maybe some kind of third fork or exchanges behaving badly now i think for any single one of these things the probability i think is very low but i think when you add all of it together at least at the time it seemed like that there was you know that i think that that wasn't really being priced in properly and i think i think since then you know the markets kind of played out you know st and heath widened that spread wide and you know the futures went backwardated and then since then it's actually come in a bit the other direction so you know it's interesting to see the market dynamics there but i think i think overall you know not everybody i think is so sure now i think that the merge is going to do what it's supposed to do and i think at least having a little bit of that uncertainty in the air i think is healthy uh for this space evgeny as a crypto market maker how are you looking at the merge what do you think will happen at that time yeah so for us as a as a market maker it's a pretty interesting event obviously and it's even more interesting given how deeply i define in general not just on ethereum but you know all kinds of filters and yeah all kinds of scotty bills scalability solutions like whatever you call it and so for us it's like three three problems we have to solve so first we needed to make sure that we don't miss something it wasn't a lot of money which is probably the main like that is the main thing for any like trading shock in the space and it has to do with i know replay attacks it has to do this in general like when we store our erc20 assets and how we store them and like what can potentially happen you know upgrading our gnosis saves for example like all those like small and big things second is basically any kinds of opportunities and that's primarily i would say on proof of work chain part like well the ones that supposedly will go like fork effectively uh however you call it and uh like the more in the most basic senses basically once the merge happens so one once a once a fork happens actually try to sell all the assets which we think will be worth zero primarily stable coins into the pcr and proof of work and basically trying to get like a lot of free just three of this news here and the third bit is it has to do without defy operations so it's actually understanding how maybe space like how block building space will change post merge and that's also well that's actually also a really interesting topic and that's what that's what we are primarily looking at now because like a lot of those issues that we initially identified over the last couple of months they kind of subsided like some of them are still there but like we don't we don't really see that many as many issues that can lose us money namely like man i would say um opportunities wise i don't really think it's gonna be an amazing opportunity in general like i think a lot of it just like kevin said a lot of it played out in the futures market over the last couple of months already instead these um so it's all about yeah like if you can be the fastest during the first couple of blocks when they're gonna be like a lot of mess potentially and also how do you manage your inventory on all kinds of centralized exchanges which will close down or shut down all the deposits in these drawers for quite some time i can imagine so but that's kind of like normal stuff for us that's our bread and butter okay so yeah let's uh dive more into this proof of work fork because i see so much chatter about this obviously it's funny because i do think the longer term impact really will be around eth but at this moment in time you know this is what a lot of people seem focused on interestingly or maybe not surprisingly actually i see a number of developers that are deriding this potential eth proof of work chain in particular they're sort of making fun of the team for not having yet uh for instance switch the chain id or leaving it missing or um basically telling them that they're trying to change it the wrong way like that like they're saying they're implying that these developers don't even know how to change it as evgeny alluded to some people are saying the chain probably won't even be ready until sometime after the merge so it'll basically be a fork of the fork which is fascinating or i'm not sure exactly how this works but obviously then on the other hand we have traders like yourselves or other community members who are writing up whole newsletters and blog posts and tweet threads on how to trade this eth proof of work fork so you know again i flash back to what happened at the dow where it basically seems like the developers see things one way they see you know back then they saw that ethereum classic chain is not being useful the traders were like hey that's free money so i was just curious for your take given all these technical issues that the eth proof of work team seems to be having do you expect that chain to emerge right at the time of the merge or afterward and you know how how do you expect these any technical difficulties to affect how it plays out yes you know for us uh you know i think we've heard all sorts of different opinions about this uh whether it'll be on time or not you know we're trying to prepare for any situation you know certainly if the fork is on time there's probably going to be a lot more training opportunities and i think it's also because of you know these kinds of revelations about the chain id you know or about you know whether or not it's going to be ready on time which is why kind of the futures basis closed in and maybe this is also why a lot of people are right now dumping their eth pow ahead of time so i think you know generally there's been a couple of things that i think the eat pow community did that i think was not strategically advantageous to them so i think things like for example beyond just the repeal of 1559 this idea of creating a multi-sig to fund development i think it's a bit double-edged i personally think that it's not the best idea it's sort of like you know you're introducing this kind of layer of centralization uh on that chain and there's like a small group that's in charge of some kind of dev treasury i think it would have been better for them to play more along the lines of you know ideological purity especially given the tornado cash revelations but at the same time i understand why they're doing that and it's because you know they don't really have an ethereum foundation on their side to go back development and you know bring bring new apps to to to the chain that sort of thing so i i think it's you know it's a really tough situation for them i don't i don't think it was a good idea uh to introduce any whiff of corruption or that it being a money grab i mean everybody already thinks that it's a money grab so like to introduce more of that where you know people can point fingers and people can can accuse them of of doing that even more um i think that you know that that's not the pr that they need but you know i think all those things you know taken into consideration i think the market's already reflecting these kinds of new expectations you know i think polo yesterday traded down to like 1.8 uh from like roughly it was hovering around like three three and a half percent you're you're talking about the eth proof of work ious on okay yeah so yeah so i think that you know that's already come in quite a bit so you know we'll see where the market places things you know certainly the the the size that's being traded on you know bitfinex's chain split tokens and on polo you know with their split tokens is very shallow so there's not there's not that much price discovery and you know there could still be really large players you know obviously ethereum foundation a lot of large whales that haven't dumped yet but who do want to dump but the size is just too big so you know i think we really need to see all of that kind of play out and wash out i think within the first week or two maybe even quicker than that and then afterwards then we can come to some kind of equilibrium price at least in the short term for eth pow and then what happens in the long term really depends i think the pos guys think that it bleeds out to zero you know that's prob that's probably very likely also there's also possibilities of it's just randomly pumping for other reasons you know they do some kind of deal with some group or you know pos completely fails uh for release reasons unrelated to pow um so you know there's all sorts of you know it can go anywhere from there and i think it's really uh we're just trying to figure out what should we do before the merge what should we do during the merge and immediately right after in the next few blocks and then what should we do maybe about a week or two out and then from there we don't really care too much you know because i think for these longer time frames it's just not as interesting as sort of like the mechanics of trading these kinds of uh special sits and one-off situations okay one one thing i want to clarify is just when you talked about repealing 1559 it's because that drastically reduced what the miners were earning so by repealing it then they would sort of boost how much they're earning because that was uh burning part of the the fees but then i wanted to ask you so explain how this works for the evpow tokens that are available on some of these exchanges so for people that are trading these does this mean that the exchange will just give them some you know whatever the same number of actual if power tokens are that are available after this new chain survives or how does that work i imagine that's the case you know i don't have any special insight there i imagine that there must be some exchange out there maybe one of the smaller ones that just completely messes it up and continues to accept like deposits of eth pow as if it were um ethpos i mean there's all sorts of like weird edge cases and i wouldn't put it past somebody to mess up somewhere but you know that if you know according to plan though it would be that you know each token becomes two tokens exchanges would give it to our customers based on right before the snapshot what the ownership split looked like okay so and evgeny are you how are you thinking about like obviously kevin just mentioned that there's potential for it to be uh live later than the actual merge um what are you sort of either betting on or how are you thinking about this uncertainty yeah i guess like what they communicate so far is it will be almost exactly as emerge which will make things quite fun for a lot of people and quite difficult for people as well i think ultimately that's most likely that will happen actually because they're just looking at the way like you did mention like a few developers like having problems with them uh on like esports side and i've seen uh like coinbase has been very happy with them as well i think today but not pushing through the chain eddy uh or something which obviously is a prerequisite for replay attacks being potentially possible so like they still they have like less well they're like a week and they still need to yeah deliver on a lot of things so i think the right play for them would be actually to to maybe delay it and get it done properly i didn't argue like to me the whole to me the most uh curious saying is why wouldn't they just launch a new chain all together without inheritance or there is hearing mass like well and by mass i mean like all the smart contracts all that well this is the holy syrian state that's that to me is the most the scene i just don't understand like why not just spin off another syrian classic give give yourself some tokens and go with it just like so many chains that we launched over the last couple of years all right so out of curiosity what would you both expect the value to be of these pow tokens afterward is it going to be less than two percent of the current value of eth as the ious or on these exchanges seem to be indicating you know i think in my opinion right now i'm gonna go with the market and i think that let's say after the first period of like pandemonium and dumping i think it maybe just equilibrates to about maybe two percent uh that would be my guess but um for myself personally i'm not that interested in buying at fair value i think or at least short term fair value you know i think i might be lightly bid at like one to one and a half percent and then much stronger bid i think between like half a percent and one percent and that's not to forecast anything about you know the super long-term future but that's kind of you know levels that i would be interested in maybe taking a swing at it wait and when you say that you mean before the fork i meant like after the park um so like after this initial period of like d5 pandemonium mostly on the pow side but maybe a tiny bit on the pos side and then once that period ends and then everybody who wants to have dumped pow has dumped it then i think some kind of natural short-term you know equilibrium price maybe around two percent seems pretty fair you know obviously it could just be wrong could just be way higher than that could be like way lower than that uh i don't know but you know that's kind of what my expectations are you know just as comparables with like etc and like you know things that had happened before other types of forks that have off of other tokens there's not too much to go off of but that would be sort of finger in the air kind of guesswork there so this is fascinating to me because from the way you're talking and maybe i'm wrong it sounds like you're not interested in buying those pow tokens before the merge until after people begin to dump them once the once the chain goes live is that what you're implying there uh that's generally my thought but i think if it dumped ahead of time to a low enough level i would still be interested in buying it um it's just that i don't want to get in front of other people's um selling you know even if i wanted to buy it i'd rather buy it at a cheaper price rather than a more expensive price so you know i'm fine to wait for everybody else to go first on oh i wonder i you know i'm not a trader but given everything that you've said earlier that i that i find that surprising i would have thought that you were looking to you know dump in the first few blocks but while we're talking about that for both of you what do you think will happen in the first few blocks like you know i saw dan robinson a paradigm appears to be figuring this out as well he's asked on twitter if the eth pow fork happens what will be what will the first few blocks be like give uh give me your opinion uh for both of you maybe we can ask if you any first but i just wanted to clarify one thing which is that what i was saying about these sort of price levels i'd be willing to buy it's it's not related to stuff that we're going to be doing like on chain and you know maybe like doing some mev to like race for certain blocks and to you know dump certain types of eth pow erc 20s for other eth power erc 20s or 8th power itself you know that's like a different set of strategies i meant more for like in in the midterm where i saw fair value that's sort of what i meant all right so first few blocks on the eve pow fork what do you guys think if if it happens like it happens so far and basically they don't freeze up all mms for example like they wanted to do um i think it's quite possible that a few people will rush and try to sell all well value less assets let's let's call it like this i think it will take a few more blocks than just first couple of blocks because i think like those first three blocks will be very like busy and i think we will see a lot of competition this competition will be even more interesting because we will we wouldn't see normal players like flashballs for example helping out we wouldn't see like well we wouldn't see a lot of this infras that will suddenly just stop working on proof of work so people will have to go back to the old ways figuring out like how to actually submit it how to pay miners properly to to do all this stuff and i don't think a lot of companies can actually figure it out properly like it's it's quite possible proof-of-work devs will not do something properly as well and that actually will be delayed so i think that is like demonia and will continue for way more than two blocks actually also like important part is you can only like let's say you have usdc on proof of work you can only sell your usdc so if you have let's say 100 million usdc and you want to dump it into proof of work ethereum okay that's all you can do and but you cannot sell somebody else's usdc and they can still do it a bit later for example for like really big uh their memphis which still might have opportunity like this uh later on yeah i i definitely agree and you know maybe to add on to that you know i think that you know you're already starting to see some of this being reflected well you know on the sort of like barn lending pools uh where you know ave compound uh euler they're all coming out with different statements about what they're going to do they're all going to treat things a little bit differently now some of it is just that people want the fork token that's why they're borrowing heath and you know borrow rates are going high but i think also some of it is that people want to pre-collateralize their d5 debt in a lot of these stable coins which cannot be duplicated across two chains right so like a lot of people already kind of setting up for this kind of stuff um i would also say that there are some relative value trades so like let's say that there's like the first period where everybody just like dumps everything for eth powell on the chain but then like maybe later once everything has already kind of been dumped to all these erc20s have been dumped to nearly zero now like maybe there's some kind of interesting place that you can do between the drc 20s right like for example if i asked you do you think that crv one or uni one uh or like let's say crv pal or uni pow has more value at some point like both are dumped so low that both are kind of like you know free options right or very very cheap options but even then between them you know you can make certain arguments about why one uh i won't say what what i think there but why one might be worth more than the other right so like once all like the eighth pow has been taken out of the system people are just kind of waiting for the exchanges to open up deposits to go and sell it you know and then i guess some people would hold on to it just to be fair then you know what's left to do on chain maybe there's like a second period after the initial pandemonium which is like a reshuffling of the relative values of all of these coins i think i did a poll and most people thought that as a ratio of the pal version to the pos version they thought that shib would would would be worth the most right compared to some of these other coins uh you know i have some difference of opinion there uh but you know it's possible i mean i mean at least with shib it's just you know not a very fancy token there's not a lot of knock-on effects with with defy um so it's possible maybe they're right about that right but at least you know it gives us some things uh to play around with while you know after the initial wave of of pow uh everything being traded into the east powell on the on the on the uh on the pouching this is interesting because i'm just realizing that i had never thought about what kind of token ship was but i'm just realizing it's an erc20 um so we've been referring to this throughout but let's just dive into this a little bit further what have you been seeing uh people do or are doing in advance to you know either obtain this airdrop or trade it in some ways you know some of the things we've been talking about have been the rc20s i've seen people talking about you know moving money from layer twos moving them from centralized exchanges you know you were talking about the futures and how that those are treated what are some of the kind of bigger signals that you've seen in terms of like how the market is thinking about this fork so i think maybe just answer it in two different ways the first thing is about whether or not the people uh preparing for this stuff have a lot of risk appetite or not right so if you don't have much risk appetite probably the safest thing to do just to dodge as much chaos as possible is to you know pull all of your assets from the l2s pull all of your assets out of d5 whether that's in an amm or in a lending pool and kind of like not have to deal with it right that would be the safest thing to do um now uh i i do imagine that that will happen at least to some degree and that on-chain liquidity will get a bit more shallow and if that does happen then there's also all sorts of knock-on effects right it means that you know as as liquidity gets thinner then liquidations become more likely and as long as there is enough fall uh just naturally induced by the merge right so it doesn't even have to do with eth pal forking but just from you know ethereum itself uh you know on the on the proof of stake side if the merge is successful or it's a failure there could still be a lot of all right because even on success some people say oh this is a sell the news event some people say oh you know now more money is going to pile in right so there's going to be a lot of disagreement in the market and i think ball itself will be a bit on the higher side and this can just cause you know normal day-to-day evolve you know maybe won't cause that much in liquidations you know because it's it's less and liquidity is bigger and thicker there but now with liquidity shallowing out and vault uh increasing you know we can see all sorts of things we can see all sorts of assets trade really far away from kind of short-term fair value that's i think something to to keep in mind yeah and the curious thing is you also have the whole macro on top of it which is still a pretty big scene in crypto so to me the most challenging bit was like it's close to impossible to separate the price of ethereum as it moves on the match news from well all the micro stuff that's happening outside and so i mean ethereum can go up 50 or can go down 50 for all kinds of reasons post-merge and so from that perspective i think people will get liquidated anyway it's it's kind of like yeah it's already their destiny because yes the volatility will be really massive either way and maybe it will all cancel out and it will stay still like this maybe it will go up maybe it will go down i don't know but it's it's going to be very volatile in general yeah and maybe just also add to that too you know some of the other things that i've heard people doing in preparation for the merge and i don't i don't want to say exactly what we're doing but some of the things that i've heard um you know it's like uh some people think that it makes a lot of sense to borrow up as much as possible and you know collateralize it with stable coins just for kind of like this fork value um but other people are saying well maybe doing the opposite is better where i'm just lending each because you know the borrower rates are so high i'm getting compensated a lot uh just by lending people who want to make this play uh my teeth right and then then it goes into like how our compound and how we gonna handle it obvious saying that um you know they're just maybe gonna pause our lending compound is saying why don't we make the maximum interest rate maybe i got him confused but but you know one of them was saying maybe make the maximum interest rate you know a thousand percent uh annualize uh you know instead of capping at like 100 for example right and then euler finance is saying uh maybe the best course of action is just to do nothing and let things play out really really hard to say you know at least now it does seem like the youth pow team is saying that they are not going to freeze um things on on the defy side on their train which i actually actually think that's actually a pretty good idea because even though they have to go through all of this like crazy pandemonium and a lot of like liquidations like it's better to kind of like rip the band-aid off right because like you still have the same problem even if you freeze things because like what are you going to do you're just going to put into withdrawal only mode like forever or at some point you're going to like reactivate it i mean you're just kind of postponing the problem i think it's better just to like flush everything out as quickly as possible and if they they do think that there is some hope that uh it works out in the long run they might as well just you know get beyond this chapter first all right and the miners have to take maybe some losses early on uh just to mine it uh but you know at least you can kind of like get over the hump um beforehand i mean they wouldn't take any losses right because well it's actually in their favor to allow this because then people will actually do stuff on proof of work chain like if you freeze everything like what are people going to do anyway where is it going to make their fees but now they suddenly have people like competing for those for those executions paying a lot of like that's that's how they can actually make a lot of ease proof of work for themselves and well this war chest for later on so to me makes perfect sense yeah sure yeah i think that's definitely possible um yeah i think what i meant by taking losses is that i imagine that maybe some of them were also maybe financing the development of if pow uh you know maybe they're they're like taking losses in the sense that they actually do believe that their chain will be worth maybe not that much but like more than what the market is showing at two percent right now right so for them it's like they would maybe mine at a loss given the current price and then try and hold it to like maybe four percent or six percent or something like that right but i agree i mean i think in some ways it is more beneficial to them in that there's a lot of activity i think it's a bit compounded i don't think it's obvious whether or not they have to they have to do a little bit of like lost leading um or whether it's still just like over on that positive because like even if they freeze it eventually when they unfreeze it they still get that activity later right so it's like probably it's worth more now than than later but it also depends on their own expectations of of how they're gonna do right and how are you seeing d5 users trying to play this like i don't know if you've been watching any of those movements but do you see that there's certain movements in d5 where it looks like those people are trying to get the the tokens or jump them or whatever on the uh eve pouching when that emerges well i mean i think until it until the fork it's hard to say what people will do because they can't really do it right now the only thing that they can do right now is split their eat and pre-sell um eve pow but for all the on-chain stuff and all the tokens you know we just kind of have to wait and see i figure okay but you're not seeing any movements like for instance liquidity pulls drying up or just yeah a lot more being created or anything like that that would indicate there are certain ways people are trying to play that what i would say is um we've noticed some things i don't want to say exactly we're so close to the merge and maybe we can i'm happy to always come back on later after that to talk about things yeah okay okay well you know this actually leads me to another question that i had for you which was that as we mentioned earlier for the dao hard fork it was just totally different like the community was totally blindsided by the ethereum classic chain and the fact that now you have been so open about this like you even mentioned that you feel that now the community seems very well prepared for this but i was just wondering why were you so open about it because didn't that sort of cut into any potential profit you might have made from doing these trades in a more kind of like stealth way yeah so i want to say that there are a lot of trades that i've never talked about that we did make one involving litecoin actually using that as a hedge uh but that's a separate thing but and there's also i think a lot of more sort of mechanical plays um that i didn't really talk about um the reason i that i did talk about a couple plays right so like two are kind of the same which is like the st basis uh widening the spread widening and then the the backwardated um futures basis that was because like i think overall i thought that the the risks of the merge were greater than zero meaning that like initially when i was first talking about it it seemed like nobody even believed that there would be an eighth power right and then now i think more the consensus has shifted to there will be eventually worth zero but there will be at least um some youth power and at least it'll have some uh short-term value right so i think you know part of it is just um doing a little bit of sort of like raising the alarm that it's a bit alarming that nobody is even talking about this uh and the second thing is that i don't think that we as a firm could take up all of the value there on that trade right there's a lot smaller trades where it's sort of like i need to be a little bit more careful about because there's not that much money to be made anyway right so it's not really great to share i think for this one i don't think we could have absorbed everything ourselves so it wasn't very costly for us to to talk about it so that's like the first class and then the second one was about just shorting eth against bitcoin uh and basically we shorted it for about two weeks or so and that was just because you know you know we thought that eth really just kind of were they were you know over their skis a little bit in terms of just how bullish they were about about eth i later thought that maybe doge would have been a better hedge than bitcoin because i also have some concerns about you know the gox coins being released i mean it really is just a bad time for for bitcoin right like on one hand the government wants to regulate uh you know from in an esg way um you know this uh the mining stuff and then like ethan's going through this uh merge narrative and then you know on top of that the cox coins are getting released right so like idiosyncratically like normally we like using bitcoin as a beta hedge through crypto space but i think this time around like you know maybe like would have been better or dogecoin would have been better you know even though there's all sorts of like idiosyncratic behavior there too so you know for that trade um we also closed it out after two weeks and i also thought that that was something that we you know we couldn't take all of the alpha ourselves um and i thought you know it's relevant to also uh say that it's it's not just about um it's not just about keith powell right like the fact that heath powell will exist i thought was not being properly priced in by the market people should know but also i think the fact that everybody's super bullish into the merge i thought was also a little bit scary and i think it's a lot healthier now which is why i actually closed out the position it's because at least people are talking about that it is possible that the merge is not ultra bullish for either right and i think really i just wanted that kind of concession right it could still be but i think like if all of the chatter on twitter and the entire narrative is like 99 of people are talking about how this is just going to be up only that is very dangerous and it's a little bit reminiscent in flavor to the narrative surrounding luna and i don't want to make it sound like ethan is anything close to luna i mean luna is like infinitely worse right but at least this kind of like group think and consensus like this like monoculture of up only feels very very dangerous and you know and then obviously this less reflexive and less bad than luna overall but still it's just it had a similar flavor and i thought that was dangerous oh yeah a lot of insight there um which you know i agree and that's why i run the kind of show that isn't just pro any particular coin in the space but anyway okay so there's a lot still that i feel like i was trying to ask you guys that we didn't get to unpack we're gonna unpack that also talk about things like replay protection or replay attacks and then go into

these things a few times now but i just want to um make sure we explain this to people so kevin you mentioned the steep price widening i guess you know in relation to youth can you just talk about what you saw there and why that what what that indicates about how people are thinking about the merge um yeah so i think i think that spreads actually come in a little bit uh we still do have that position on but the original idea on why it would widen is that like what's the difference between st eth and heath right like one is that st gets some kind of like staking yield two it's more illiquid and then three it's um not going to get the proof of work fork right so those are like the three main differences right now on the proof of work side that's just whatever the value of the proof of work chain is right which is the market is saying like one point eight percent of what you know whatever it is today i haven't looked and then on the sort of yield versus the liquidity side you know i was pricing that roughly at like two percent so i think like st should be like the sum of two percent and whatever the heath fork eth pow fork is worth right and that was kind of my baseline like mental model of what the fair value of std is evgeny do you want to talk about what you were seeing with the futures market and what that indicated about how people were thinking about trading the merge i mean ultimately just just like kevin said it's it's all very the markets are pretty efficient like state ease discount reflected the futures markets and what we see is like interest on other it's also kind of correlated with that we've even seen people smashing the functional perpetuals even though it doesn't make as much sense because like it obviously can change significantly more uh and will uh much closer to the marriage so like it's it's just stuff that happens in a trading world that must happen so it's not uh esoteric by any means it just it just must happen like i think we staked ethereum like there was a bit of effect on top of it that like there are other stake products and there is often like a relative value play buying some of them so another of them like coinbase just released their state product as well so there are quite a lot of plays that can be done with it and i think also one thing that i wanted to touch upon is like this idea i find like really interesting this idea is that okay let's say it's two percent let's say let's say proof of work is here it was two percent um i don't think it's such a big deal to the degree primarily because i don't think there is a bit in all this like okay there is a bit of a bit uh maybe kevin will be like 0.5 percent the intermediate will beat like 0.25 because why not like some other people will do it as well but ultimately all of us are doing it for like really short time like and at some point it will like if it goes to 10 percent that's that's where you will see cerium foundation selling that's where you will see a lot of exchanges selling that's where you will see a lot of market makers selling so currently there is a massive and visible offer which will not disappear primarily because it does just doesn't make sense for most people to sell two percent it's like it's it's just not worth it it's it's almost a free option you get your kids it cost you two percent but the upside is there so it just makes sense to wait it out and it's especially true from frozen like crv one or uni one tokens which are also like i know kevin asked me as they like yeah can i show him an offer like it doesn't really make sense for us to sell them at 10 basis points or five business points because okay if they can't go to one percent of uni for because some people saying they have value for whatever reason that's the money we can potentially make and so it really doesn't make sense to sell your so yeah sell your assets like basis point on the dollar it just makes sense to wait but it also creates this fake illusion of sums and having value which it actually doesn't yeah so um you know i i think i mostly agree with what if guinea said but i would have a different opinion about what constitutes something having value you know as we've seen just in the past two days luna classic pumped like crazy i would certainly say that this chain has virtually no value you know overnight it kind of just pumped like a hundred percent and now luna uh too basically luna itself is pumping that also doesn't have too much right so and then you know just in in the history of crypto how much value is there in a lot of these coins right um i think a lot of it is just kind of like belief in a thing like a in a gamestop kind of way right and i think a lot of it is also pulling very speculative future worlds to the present right like it's sort of like let's say almost all the value of eth pow is now maybe contingent on ethpos completely and utterly failing and then them having a really strong narrative uh or maybe not even that strong but much stronger than now kind of narrative right like if the chance of ethpos completely failing is like let's say and i'm talking about like catastrophic problems not like minor bugs and they'll probably have minor bugs and all be fine right but like really just like it just doesn't work they have to roll back the chain or there's like really critical consensus failures or some kind of double spin or the network itself completely forks and requires meat space coordination uh to resolve properly maybe that's like around like let's say three to five percent and then like if that happens then let's say the narrative for each pow improves like let's say 5x right so like that's a road for them to get to some kind of meaningful percent at least in the medium term because you know when all is said and done and after eath pow has been completely hollowed out it's basically like how ethan is today right and i think that they can make that as a much more convincing argument if the narrative all of some shifts to that the ethereum foundation for eight years have been building this thing and in the end when they delivered it didn't work right like if the narrative really and because like when people get pissed on twitter they get really pissed and when the when the mob gets awoken they break out the torches so you know we we've seen former sort of like leaders of projects have their entire community turn on them and kind of get uh burn at the stake and crucified i would not put it past that to happen in eth if something really really bad happened right not not some kind of minor uh problems so i do see that uh first that this is kind of a massive call option and possibly something like that happening and then the second is that if we actually look at what it is it's basically unfortunate and how it works today but where a lot of stuff has to get dumped and liquided and hollowed out um so kind of like like what you were saying evgeny like it's like it's like starting a new chain but there's no there's no like kind of like foundation treasury and you have you have to deal with a lot of pain in in the short term uh but it's kind of like a vampire attack because you put the coins into the hands of the people who were using the product in exactly the types of ways um that they were using it before and they get exactly the kind of erc20s that they had before right so it's almost and i don't even think it's particularly bad for the ethereum foundation in that it's almost kind of like an insurance policy right in case like things are catastrophic then there is something there now obviously i think they would just roll back the chain like i'm not actually particularly worried about let's say like st in the long run right there could be some like liquidations in the short run because like we've already seen social consensus work with in that like keith kind of beat out etc right like ideological purity didn't matter that much social consensus mattered more devs mattered more right so like their their strongest and most true believers are the ones that have ste they're not gonna let those guys take losses on their bags right if something just look really bad happens right and they're going to bail them out right and i think at this point it's a lot less bad than i think the classic days because like the first kind of change to code is like notwa is like much more boolean i think than like the second one because it's already done been done in the past right and i think it makes sense for them to do that if i was them i would definitely do that right so you know i think there's there's like a lot of these kinds of considerations i have to say i think the main way that i uh would differ from you on that is the percentage at which you think there will be a spectacular failure so we'll see what happens um you know they've had so many successful tests so and they have multiple clients so we'll see but one thing i did want to ask you before we get into things around just um you know ethe itself um so we talked about how there might be replay attacks can you just talk a little bit about so if there are people out there who you know are thinking about trading this what are you seeing that they're maybe doing to either protect themselves because you know at this moment it looks quite likely that there will be uh given that this eve pow team hasn't really done the necessary technical work to to uh split the chains so are you seeing people you know protect themselves in one way or another or you know or how are you guys doing it well just like with with the hour of work it's like the main the main um players who can be affected by the lottery exchanges and i think they are prepared for it well also be called like tier one tier two ones i would say are definitely prepared for it and they will simply not gonna well be very careful with their withdrawal functions basically uh simply because of that but another one and it's a really interesting one um aspect of ripley attacks that we looked on our side is it's basically related to basically all the spending that will happen on proof-of-work chain and basically what can potentially happen is let's say i have 100 million usdc i sell it i want to ease proof of work and go and sell it on poloniex later on great i made maybe i'll make like a few few hundred k who knows um but what happens if the chain id is the same and replace attacks are possible is somebody can like if i have the same state on proof of stake chain somebody can replace that and screw me over big time because i will suddenly sell 100 million of real usdc against the syrian proof of stake and then suddenly i'm doing like a really bad trade potentially for me because i'm doing doing something really big that will potentially move the price and that's that that can be scared can i just ask you i don't understand your example because like usd circle or usdc already came out and said that they're not going to support the youth proof of work chain because obviously since it's backed by real assets like you can't just magically suddenly double all those so did you were you just making that up as an example or i i didn't understand how this could be an example it's more like so if if i do this transaction of proof of work trying to basically get this free econ proof of work from my very last usdc this transaction will have like transaction time hash and like everything so somebody can use the same transaction and replay it on proof-of-stake chain and execute exactly the same transaction you see right because yeah because there's no replay protection oh i get what you're saying and that basically so profiting from it is kind of more difficult but you can make you can screw a lot of people potentially and let's say i know let's say i sell 100 million of uh unisof for example into proof of work that will move units for price a lot and you can position yourself on the other side buying this union swap really cheap on proof of stake for example so that that can be like one fun thing to do and it can be one fun thing that people can on one hand try to profit from or if they're like really really malicious just trying to i know bankrupt like big train companies for example so for us it was one of those like what can go really really really wrong if if if this stuff happens and you can protect yourself against it but it's yeah it's a it's a quite a fun one how how um are you protecting yourself against it uh well it's uh the most easy way to protect yourself is not to do this for a chain in the first place that's probably the easiest well that's just because then there is nothing to replay um otherwise is because it's a state right so the state should be the same so basically if you during the first block you move all your usdc from one wallet to another and then during the second block you sell this huge this year and proof of work chain nobody can replay it because you don't have any usd and proof-of-stake so that's like another way you can do it and protect yourself and would would this apply also to nfts um it can apply to any singularity yeah yeah because like openc said they wouldn't support the eth proof of work chain i mean just imagine there might be some people who uh in the nrt world they may not know what a replay uh attack is um hopefully they'll they'll figure it out and and yeah not not do anything that would cause them problems yeah and maybe just to also add to that um there's a way of splitting your coins pre-fork too like there's certain contracts out there that they haven't been audited you know i i'm not vouching that they work or not uh but basically they figured out a way that on chain you can detect which chain you're on and for each side of the two split coins to be only valid on in it's basically a contract that allows you to split your split your coins up beforehand okay yeah and i just want to make clear nothing we're saying in the episode is advice for anyone financial or trading investment advice for anyone um okay so we've been talking so much about the potential trading of the proof of work fork and meanwhile eth really is the asset that will probably be most affected by this um so let's you know zoom out and let's talk just generally about what's going to be happening here you know kevin you have actually talked about how you know you are long e if you um you know believe in eve uh i think that's why a lot of people were you know not really happy with your comments but why don't we just sort of talk generally about like you know what kind of price action do you see run and merge what you know do you think will happen in terms of potential issues around selling the news um and then long-term you know where do you think the price of youth will go because of this news event assuming it's successful yeah so i think that it it depends on a couple of things and i just want to clarify yeah i so i do hold a little bit eat myself that's just been uh there for a long time um but that being said there have been periods that as a firm we have both been long eath and we've also been shorty and also most of the time just flat teeth so you know i just wanted to clarify that overall if the merge is uh successful i think that initially probably um just from the hype and just from the celebration you know probably a little bit more money is going to pile in but i think right now anybody who really likes seath is already kind of indeed i find there to be very few people kind of like on the sidelines that are kind of like neutral about this i want to see how it plays out and then to go along i think for the most part people even on the fence have mostly bought into the narrative uh and then there's like a set of detractors who will just never buy this thing no matter what happens so i think really you know the kind the lines are kind of drawn um already there and uh i don't really see the price getting bought up to really crazy heights now there are some counter arguments to this like for example that uh you know the inflation supply issuance is going to get reduced by a lot uh you know 99 uh 90 um you know and you know that will help things on the supply kind of overhang side but you know i think a lot of price action is mostly driven by demand anyway so really the question is like who are going to be the new buyers we know that there's a lot of people who are who are like kind of like it depends on like the demographic of like true believers and who can be converted to be a true believer after the merge is successful versus how much mercenary capital was piling into the long birds trade to begin with who will then look to exit for new opportunities in whatever the new narrative is so if the former is greater then the price should go up if the ladder is greater then the price should go down that would be what my guess is um you know on whether this is a sell the news event evgeny what do you think yeah i mean it's in general quite interesting that we are both here because our firms are both trading but like we're kind of doing very different things in a way because yeah if you if you listen to kevin like it's i don't know long ethereum short dodge coin like all those all those kind of plays well for us it's much more on the automation side just just making sure that we are that we can just provide markets continuously throughout the day like we typically don't hold long-term views on things we do hold some tokens as part of some of our venture portfolio we do hold some tokens like ethereum and bitcoin as part of our treasury effectively it's not it's not something that that can ever make us go bankrupt or even like jeopardizing operations but it's it's something we felt was the right thing to do also it didn't really work out last nine months or so but but we'll be okay but i think for us the interesting thing is just how to react to different things as they happen so we are much more preparing we are not really positioning ourselves to go lonelies or shorties or doing things like this but we are thinking okay like how how us and our algorithms will react to certain things and for example like one thing that we've been debating internally is are we going to be looking at proof of work a syrian price and what we kind of decided is not really because like it's well festival like no nobody can say what ethereum theoretical price is at any moment because it's just so many variables but like if proof of work goes to ten percent of ease it's not going to be a like a selling signal for us for ethereum because we we do see proof of work as much more of a meme coins than anyone else at this stage and i mean like there's a trade that we would be doing visitors would be looking at heat trading against ethereum classic for example or maybe against some other some other chains but in terms of positioning it would be yeah wait and see but position ourselves for for massive volatility basically for the first few months and just like i mentioned focus on how the mav game will change provided that the merge happens successfully yeah and uh you know maybe i could just add something to that you know i think a lot of what i've been talking about recently has been more about like sort of these long short trades uh mostly hedge some directional uh sort of like mid frequency you know maybe fundamental type plays um that's actually mostly not what we do actually we actually also do quite a bit of algo trading and not to the extent that winter mute does i mean i know that winter mute um is uh you know one of the big uh behemoths in algo trading across you know defined c5 i think you guys have like two of the top 30 accounts on ftx in uh in volume um for us you know we're much smaller we're maybe about top 80 right now on ftx but you know we also do have a lot of stuff where you know we're also doing market making we're also doing a little bit of hft training but you know that i i figure that's not going to be as interesting for you know the topic at him so i wanted to sort of just talk about um things maybe that are more relevant um to the viewers and you know things that they they might be you know they might want to uh think about and not financial advice but maybe some things that might impact them um and that they would think about but i'm also happy to also talk about like you know order book dynamics and like you know cute positions and tick sizes and that sort of thing too um we're gonna take it in a different direction because we're sort of running out of time and i did want to ask um you know there's we kind of talked about the narrative around bitcoin and how um there's a lot of news that you know has been challenging for bitcoin recently um but in addition eth's issuance will go way down after the merge it may even become deflationary so how do you think this affects the narrative around bitcoin which traditionally has been thought of as digital gold it has this digital scarcity um and so if ethan's even more deflationary you know how does that affect bitcoin yeah you know i think um i wanted to say that i wanted to draw the luna classic example but i'm not sure what side this supports right so like on one hand lunacy basically is introducing an on-chain transaction tax right making it actually deflationary and i made the joke on twitter that oh lunacy must now be ultrasound money um well you know obviously the point that i was trying to make is that uh you know just because something's deflationary doesn't make it sound right like if you tack on like a 1.5 transaction tax on lunacy i mean does it really make it that much better i mean this thing this thing is kind of garbage right um but that being said what the market said is that it really liked it and actually uh lunacy like just pumped on that news right um i don't know how much of that is sustaining i think it's you know fallen off a bit since then but the market really liked that news the idea of just like imposing a 1.5 transaction tax on chain right so like on one hand i do feel like you know fundamentally this makes no sense you can't just move around some numbers just because something is deflationary doesn't mean that especially something that that is so in crypto in general that is so demand driven doesn't just make it you know pump in price but on the other hand the market is actually saying well maybe just this cosmetic change is actually really good for the price so i actually have very mixed feelings about it i think before the whole lunacy pump i was thinking well you know i think you know maybe it goes up a little bit you know because of the the supply effect but maybe not too much but now i'm actually you know maybe i'm kind of revising my opinion now just given what's happening with lunacy and luna uh you know really hard to say i'm i'm constantly kind of reevaluating what the market is telling me whether i think that that's sensible or not i mean doesn't matter as much you know i think it's more about what does the market believe and i need to figure out how it's thinking about it right but so but how do you think this will affect bitcoin do you think that eth will you know the price will be boosted and at to the detriment of bitcoin or i think at this point there's not that many new people to be won over from the bitcoin camp to the youth camp like the camps are basically set i don't think there's many people on the fence and things have already gotten very polarized so i don't think that it's to the detriment of bitcoin per se in the short term in the long term it could be um i think just as a competitor to bitcoin but what i would say still say that right now the thing that probably impacts bitcoin the most is its own idiosyncratic events right so things like the gox coin overhang right like if that wasn't there then like that i think that's a much bigger primary effect than what's going on with ethereum but i do think in the long term especially in like maybe like a bull market or a couple cycles down the line they're gonna have to battle right like once like everybody has adopted crypto then along the borders there's a lot of like there's a lot more fighting for territory right and this is this is sort of why bear markets are very pvp because everybody sees the the pie shrinking and there's no way to get a bigger pie so everybody's tries to take everybody else's pie right but in a in a bull market that's not the case the pie itself is growing generally there's like less infighting everything grows but eventually it grows to a point right in in the success case of crypto that there's like full adoption uh you know worldwide adoption and at that point finally the lines are drawn and then uh there has to be a lot of this kind of competition uh so that's kind of how i see things in the different time frames evgeny what about you what do you think about how this affects bitcoin also very very similar i don't see people switching from bitcoin to ethereum it's more like the narrative can change so much that the future people will more likely buy ethereums and bitcoin so that's it's more about that it's about all the new people that will eventually buy one another because you cannot buy both you can you need to make a choice or maybe they will buy solano maybe they'll say buy something else that is not issued yet so it's it's all about this i don't but i don't think this here will replace bitcoin like completely uh i think like they're still playing very very difficult very very different use cases because bitcoin is all about the most basic blockchain algorithms there is which works which is well arguably the most decentralized cryptocurrency out there compared to pretty much everything else and it works like right like so many external shocks like i know banning bitcoin mining in one country and other like all kinds of things it still still works people are still buying it and yes we can have mount gawks we can have i don't know sailor being liquidated because of that there can be a lot of fun events happening but ultimately i think it has a brand like it it is the first cryptocurrencies that was and just because of that i think it will it will have like pretty consistent value and space theorem is just different because it's yeah this virtual machine it has define it it's i don't i don't really understand like well i guess i guess for me personally i don't understand why people saying ethereum can be such a great store of value it's more like oil to me i guess however cliches as the sound so it's like coil to be bitcoin gold i guess i just want to say i completely agree with guinea's uh sentiments there okay yeah arthur hayes was saying similar things when i interviewed him recently and last question i wanted to ask about this news that the white house recently said they're concerned about the environmental impact of proof of work mining and i wondered again how you thought this could affect that kind of i don't want to call it a competition because i agree with you that bitcoin and ether are actually just different things with different purposes but obviously you know as you said people will come into this space especially newbies they're going to be kind of looking at them maybe more just like as investments or whatever and so i wondered how you felt that the you know change in the ethereum consensus algorithm towards something that's more environmentally friendly would affect again the narratives but um between these two coins um yeah so i think it really depends on how the people want to play it and whether or not they're going to take this as an opportunity to try and take market share uh from bitcoin because i do think that the narrative on this favors them uh you know pretty strongly uh with you know obviously a proof of stake requiring a lot less energy especially during a time where energy you know there's there's energy issues um around the world um and you know you can make a case that maybe that energy would be quote unquote better spent on you know heating homes and and you know growing food or whatever all these other things right so i think you know it's i think the ball's in their core on what they want to do i don't particularly mind the moral argument like if they were to say that uh you know esg is just better for the planet it's good overall i think i think i don't what i don't particularly like is if they would try and i i always consider a lot of the disputes within crypto to be like family affairs right like for the most part um you know we all disagree with each other but at the end of the day we're all like crypto heads together right you know against the outside world against like uh fiat money that sort of thing um so you know i think that overall like you know i i've supported you know tornado cash and the developments that are going on there i don't think that um i think that whether or not eth is a security i don't think that the bitcoiner should go down that road right and i also don't think that the ethereum guy should go down the road of having trying to have state actors in force against proof of work i think the best situation is just have an open market have everybody just um fight on an equal playing field and then you know may the best coin win um i think you can make moral arguments i don't even mind you know ethereum guys i'm doing that i think it's just it's another thing to kind of have like an appeal to a greater authority uh you know with a monopoly on violence to try and enforce against your competition and to try and limit the scope of uh of their competition i think that that would be less healthy for the space in the long run and i and i think that it's um it's important that at a time like now that at least there is some level of camaraderie uh within the the crypto space which is also why i think tactically for the youth guys it's better for them to focus on the tech thesis and then subvert bitcoin on the money thesis much later rather than fighting bitcoin on the money thesis while already having won the tech thesis causing a lot of reaction from the bitcoin maximalist to then go attack ethereum i think it's a lot better to have some kind of truce there um so that you know a greater war can be fought and then you know later on can can deal with that uh can deal with that issue i mean ethereum can always make the argument that u.s equities are in total worth more than gold right than the market cap of gold i think that is a perfectly fair argument to make if they want to say they want to have like u.s equities plus you know the mark capitalization of gold i think that that is fair but i don't think that that's tactically correct yeah interesting oh kenny yeah look i'm i'm pretty much 100 percent agree like one thing i guess i want to say for zero yeah i mean it's totally political what's going on like and it's just part of continuation of this esg narrative that has been there for quite some years now i personally oh i'm personally hoping for the record that this esg narrative will visit and die because i think like the way it's implemented the way it's affecting like how people invest their money in meat space i think it's very stupid um there are like way more smarter ways how you can affect the change on the well with this environment and everything and yeah banning bitcoin is not not not the way to approach it like it's bitcoin is not is not going to make our planet greener that's that's if you think about it properly you'll understand that so i think yeah i fully agree that as crypto community we should go get together and like just not use those kind of occasions to destroy our opponents it's like very very simple okay well this has been a fascinating note to end this conversation on given that i do think certain members of the ethereum community would say that you're um you know fomenting chaos for them but anyway um before we go where can people learn more about each of you and your work i'm on uh twitter um at galwa underscore capital yeah i'm on twitter as well it's my first name last name you have gained gay way and that's mostly when i'm writing stuff i sometimes write articles but it's not as frequent as i would like to all right well this has been so fun we will see what happens next week i'm i'm definitely excited for the merge thank you again it's been a pleasure having you both on
