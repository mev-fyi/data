investor and the inventor of the stock to flow model welcome plan b hi laura thanks for having me heads up for those of you watching the video plan b uses a pseudonym so as to hide his real identity which is why we are showing an image rather than the video on his side so plan b your bitcoin price models have done really well over the years and this week you got even more validation for your projections in case people are unfamiliar with your professional background just give us a brief history and tell us how you came to bitcoin yeah so i'm in traditional finance for the last 25 years i started in dealing rooms and moved my way up to bank balance sheets insurance balance sheets and managing pension balance sheets mainly in structured finance or risk management functions or in the investment offices of those those firms so um yeah i've seen a lot in the last 25 years uh but one of the most interesting things i came across was bitcoin and for me that was uh 2013 that i first read the white paper i was hooked from the start and tell us how you came to create this doctor flow model and and what that is yeah well one of the things that i missed when i i entered the space was a valuation model for every asset we have a valuation model for for equities for all the derivatives not for gold by the way that has the same problem as bitcoin there's not really a valuation model although you can look at the mining costs of gold and that that's what most of the models that that were there for bitcoin were as well so what i tried to do was make some fundamental case for why bitcoin has any value at all because most people were saying well there's there's nothing backing it bitcoin is a pyramid scheme or bubble whatever so i sort of started from the assumption that scarce assets like gold and real estates etc have more value than than than less or non-scarce assets and of course in the commodity markets there is this this uh stock to flow measure where where you can sort of quantify the scarcity of an asset and i use that that known measure to correlate it with the price uh first only with the the time series of bitcoin so the bitcoin price over time and later with a stock to flow cross asset model i combined the data with gold data real estate data silver diamonds other scarce assets and what you what i found was a perfect linear relation between the scarcity measured in stock to flow and the market values of all those assets and that was astonishing for me and just gave me a rough i must say it's a very rough model but it gave me a rough indication that that bitcoin should be well worth somewhere in between silver and gold and going towards gold since it now has the the same stock to flow and and the scarcity as called so yeah very interesting uh discovery i put it on paper and and since then uh on twitter and with the interviews like we're having now it it really took off and and caught me by surprise so uh yeah especially now with over a million followers i'm really uh astonished by that yeah i i only imagine especially because you do have an anonymous account um so i you know i've heard you say you also use other price models i don't know if you've made too much about them public but in general i think your models have been vindicated this week why do you think we've hit this new all-time high of nearly 67 000 uh for bitcoin this week yeah i could give several answers to that uh but but uh yeah maybe maybe one step back when i made the model that was in march 2019 we were below uh four thousand dollar bitcoin after the 2017 all-time high of twenty thousand so we we crashed all the way to four thousand even going to three thousand i think i think it was three point two uh at the bottom and everybody's calling for for a thousand dollar bitcoin at that time and through the um stock to flow and through the scarcity yeah that guided me towards well there will be a half thing bitcoin will be more scarce approximately as scarce as gold so we we have to go up from here and not down and uh and we have to go up to the one trillion dollar market cap and um and we reached that cap at the moment and so the last uh two years or three years were really spectacular and and roughly uh led us towards that one trillion dollar market gap and i think based on that stock to flow model and and uh and the scarcity of bitcoin at the moment that we should go a lot higher uh than we are today towards the five or ten trillion uh a dollar cap at first the same dollar market value as as gold has but yeah more recently there's there's of course all sorts of things happening in the macro and uh geopolitical sphere that caused the uh that were the immediate triggers i should say for uh for the rises and of course the bitcoin etf is one of the things that that was that we have been waiting for for a long time to happen and that came to um yeah that that was a reality since uh this week and uh and that caused a major uh upwards movement i think in uh in bitcoin that helped us a lot and so since that was um bitcoin futures etf which i think the community um maybe didn't necessarily expect uh you know at least until recently and i was also criticized for saying you know it's not maybe as efficient or as good a product as a spot etf would be um so why do you think that it affected the price that way and how do you think it all affect the bitcoin price going forward yeah that's very true bitcoin's futures etf is is better than nothing but it's not as good as a spot etf and so i'm i'm already happy with the futures etf and i understand it because futures are instruments that the scc understands and for example in the companies i used to work for the latest company was a parent's pension balance sheet of 100 billion us dollars they did not understand bitcoin or well let's say my colleagues did understand bitcoin and had bitcoin in their personal portfolios but we did not have a mandate to go into a bitcoin a virtual currency like assets because our board did not understand it um and and and likewise um that the sec does not understand i guess bitcoin and or or has to get used to this digital uh currency world and futures and i saw that in my company as well futures on bitcoin that was interesting because they knew the instruments so a futures etf well yeah it's a first step and and but it's not as good as the spot etf for example i have been talking about the cash and carry trade before that there's a huge premium and conte contango premium between futures and spot prices the future bitcoin price is approximately annualized 10 percent higher than the spot price at the moment so a bitcoin futures etf would would lose that that 10 contango premium um compared to a spot etf and well yeah if bitcoin goes to x or 10x then then that 10 percent is is worth it but on the other hand it's it is 10 percent and um and as i i used to say there's a very interesting counter trade to that to those uh future etfs and that is the cash and carry trade where you short the you buy the spot and you short the the future bitcoin and cash that uh that 10 percent uh annually for for really uh low risk so yeah i i think it's a nice step a nice first step but spot for sure is better than than futures yeah it's interesting that you said you felt maybe sec didn't understand because you know the uh chair gary gensler used to teach courses on blockchain technology at mit i think he understands but i think he just doesn't trust that they can't regulate the spot markets um and so yes yeah he understands this for sure gary's a good one yeah all right so we're going to talk a little bit more about uh the price action and your models but uh first a quick word from the

so in the past there have been articles that have come out saying that the authors felt that when they tried to retrofit the stock to flow model with gold it didn't work and so then they felt that stock to flow for bitcoin won't work what do you say to such critics yeah that was one of the critics there's a lot of them um i like the discussion and and uh we've had a lot a lot of discussion this is one of the um arguments that i don't really understand because i i know that one study that was published with this argument used like 100 years of gold data and then concluded well yeah there is no uh relation between the stock to flow over that hundred per year period and and the market value but they forgot that since 1971 or everything before 1971 the gold price was the dollar price so there was no movement in the gold price denominated in dollar at all if you look at the charts for example there is uh one little jump in uh around the world war ii period where uh roosevelt oh it was a little before that was 33 i guess where roosevelt stole the gold from from the american people and it was illegal to have gold uh and in that period they jumped the price the dollar price of gold a little but from there it has been flat and before that 1933 roosevelt action it was flat as well bitcoin or um gold dollar was gold it was defined literally as a uh a measure a certain amount of ounces of gold so you can't take a data set with a lot of data before 1971 and then conclude that that the gold price did not move with uh with a stock to flow because it did not move at all and and in fact in my own charts i take 10 years of data stock to flow data of gold and um and market value data and what you see it's it it's it's one little dot on that on that chart so you see bitcoin move uh but the stock to flow of gold and the stock and the market value of gold did not move that much at all so i'll i'll repost that that chart in in one of the tweets uh later this week uh you can see for yourself it's it's really it's really not moved at all and and in that study you are referring to there was a chart with 100 years of data and uh yeah they just didn't acknowledge the fact that data that that gold and dollars were the same before 1971. so speaking of dollars um obviously we're in a very unusual time historically right now with the pandemic how would you say the pandemic has influenced the bitcoin price over the last almost two years yeah in the beginning it it went down so in march uh 2020 we had this uh yeah everybody was scared everybody was panicking and sold everything uh from from from stocks to to bonds to uh real estate to even gold and bitcoin but in the long run i think it it it has been very good for the bitcoin price because of debasement because of the fed printing all that money and of course that was the reason why satoshi nakamoto invented bitcoin for the first place the problem with our current money is the debasement that the central banks are doing and they have been doing that for ages literally since the roman empires they they diminished the the silver content of the daenerys uh as a way to enrich themselves and and still literally steal from from the people so that's what central banks are doing right now they do it for the greater good of course that's the narrative so to save the banks in the 2008 financial crisis and to save all the companies and for example airliners now in the covet period but but somebody has to pay that and and it's paid through the basement our dollars the dollars that you and i have in our pockets become less valuable and we see that in inflation first asset inflation house prices equity prices everything of value arises including bitcoin and that's so so it has been very very good for the bitcoin price but now it it trickles down to energy prices energy inflation gas electricity etc and even core inflation so of course central banks have been saying it has been transitory but we all know it's not transitory it's here to stay and it's getting it will become worse so yeah that those trillions and trillions of dollars i think it's 8 trillion to be exactly that the fed and also the the european central bank by the way is also a trillion dollars that they printed um that problem has to be solved and i don't know how how it's it's it will be very interesting to see in the in the next couple of months or years how that that's getting uh resolved but uh it it it will be nasty i think and there will be winners and losers and i think bitcoin um is one of your your safe bets in this in this scenario well speaking of kind of some of the geopolitical issues we have seen this big change in the bitcoin network due to china banning mining there and also the government just cracking down even more stringently on trading how would you say that all that has affected the price and and will continue to affect bitcoin going forward yeah china has been a big factor in uh bitcoin and especially in mining because all the free electricity in the provinces with where the the dams were and the hydro uh energy was available that was very cheap energy and of course yeah it has to be used and and bitcoin is a perfect use for that so i guess at one point china had fifty percent of the mining power the hash rate of the entire bitcoin network and then um they banned it they made it illegal and that had an enormous effect on price it was april i guess this year may april may this year and yeah they just switched off half the network which technically is not a problem of course but for the miners that are impacted was a very big problem and their entire business model and investment of course were rendered worthless or at least they had to uh they had to to go to a plan b scenario which they did they moved their uh their mining equipment their hardware to the neighboring countries of china and also to america of course and i guess now um a couple of months later the situation is is completely opposite that the uh united states has 50 of the hash power of the bitcoin network and china has zero so china has decided not to to play the bitcoin game and yeah in my opinion they gave away their a a very strategic and and an important advantage that's obviously as an investor of course yeah well yeah i think it's also good for the bitcoin network because there was always the talk that there could be a threat if the chinese government decided to take over the minors or or something like that absolutely yeah so now it's stronger and i think the last step that i heard was that in july the us had uh 35 of the bitcoin hash rate um so let's talk about your models for the price of bitcoin for the next i don't know six months or so um i did see you say that the floor for november will be 98k for december 135k how are you getting there and what drivers do you think will bring us to those prices yeah so i basically have three kind of models the first model is the fundamental one the stock to flow model that we talked about the second one is a floor model that is more a technical analysis price based model and it makes use of a mathematical error that most people especially the technical analysts make when looking at markets like uh bitcoin because bitcoin is not normally distributed the returns it's it's following power laws and you need different math for that and all the technical analysis tools are they are for normal markets for example the rsi the relative strength index it normally bounces between 30 and 70 when it's 70s a market is an asset is overbought if it's uh below 30 it's oversold while bitcoin's rsi never goes below or or at least well sometimes but almost never goes below 45. and and can go as high as 95 so that tells you there's some really different dynamics and also mathematical processes behind the bitcoin price and you have to look at things like fractal dimensions hers components that that kind of stuff so that's the floor model and the third thing i'm looking at and actually i'm spending most of my time there at the moment is on-chain models so the big advantage of bitcoin is that we have all the transactions on chain transactions available in the blockchain everybody can download the blockchain if they run a node it's about 400 gigabytes of data so it's a big data crunch but you can you can get that data and analyze it and you see all sorts of patterns in the transactions where they came from from old investors or new investors big investors small investors all sorts of patterns and those models are very useful for timing tops and bottoms so fomo transactions for example are very noticeable and the at the very bottom there the emotions there are very interested and interesting and and seeable in the transaction so i used those three models and the model that got most attention the last couple of months was the floor model because i i predicted in june 20th that was the same time by the way that the guggenheim chief investment officer predicted bitcoin to go below 20k at about that same day i made the disc uh prediction no no no no it's going to 47 and bitcoin was mind you was below 34 at that time uh i said well in august it will close above 47 in september it goes down a little bit it will close above 43 and in october it will close above 63. well it it's a bit of luck of course involved in there it has to be one cannot be that precise but but at least all those all those targets were met so 47 43 and we're waiting for the close of the month of course now uh of october but 63 is uh is in the book so yeah and and if that if that continues and frankly i would be very surprised if it doesn't uh that would be a black swan event uh that we haven't seen in the last 10 years but if that continues we'll go to 98 000 uh in november already and 135 000 bitcoin uh in december so that will be a very nice christmas this year if that comes true i agree so in the past bitcoin has breathed as one of my sources call it in cycles of hitting a new high kind of basically in a bubble like fashion and then drawing down again but to a floor that was higher than in the previous cycle do you believe that we're in a cycle like that again or do you believe that with these new levels of institutional validation that we're seeing and also i think kind of like a more diverse set of drivers do you think that bitcoin will not see that same kind of cycle again in which the price sees a massive drop after this um you know next high is reached until the next halving yeah i seem to be one of the few that thinks we're in a normal cycle that will go down again after the all-time high because everybody i guess hopes for the super cycle or the hyper bitcoinization to start right now and that we do not have a big crash after next all-time high so that we don't see a minus fifty percent or even a minus eighty percent drop like we have seen last three times right um and as as much as i i would hope that were true that we don't see that crash anymore i think we will we're still in a phase where bitcoin is very very small compared to traditional assets institutional investors either flat out deny the asset that don't want to have it think it's for criminals or or bad for the environment and all the stuff you read in the mainstream media they're still there so i don't think the world is ready yet for hyper bitcoinization or or the supercycle i think we we will be managed by greed right now and fear later on and see another minus 80 percent after we top out at a couple hundred thousand dollars but uh there will be a point in time and in that in that way it's a timing question there will be a point in time later on maybe after next halfing into 2024 when the market is ready and and ready for bitcoin but also ready to to see that bitcoin is the better money um because it's scarcer than anything else it's more divisible it's more fungible it's more portable it's really mathematical and thermodynamically the best money there is and and as soon as people realize that see that um yeah then then maybe the dollar is in trouble and we'll have uh global reserve currencies uh that's called bitcoin um but i guess my timing for that hyper bitcoinization or super cycle event is is is after 2024 maybe maybe uh somewhere between 2024 and and 32. okay okay well we'll have to check back and see because i agree i have other sources who also believe that this cycle will be different so um i guess we'll maybe we'll do a show with you and somebody who believes that and then you can discuss and we'll try to do it like for december january or something like right as right as we're hitting that high um okay well this has been so much fun thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you very much don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break did you know that exchanges take up to a 25 cut on

thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap proshare's bitcoin futures etf goes wild on tuesday the proshares bitcoin strategy etf went live becoming the first bitcoin futures etf to launch in the us trading under the ticker bito on the new york stock exchange the listing of bito marked a significant milestone for the crypto industry which has been attempting to get a bitcoin link to etf approved by the u.s securities and exchange commission since 2013. the fund tracks chicago merchantile exchange or cme bitcoin futures allowing investors to gain exposure to btc by speculating on the future price rather than purchasing the underlying crypto asset itself for now a spot bitcoin etf which would give direct exposure to bitcoin the asset has yet to be approved by the sec based on bito's performance over the first few days of trading investors seem fine with purchasing the bitcoin adjacent investment fund bito saw nearly 1 billion dollars of trading volume on tuesday enough to make it the second largest first day of trading for a usatf according to bloomberg's eric balchunus even more impressively after closing on wednesday afternoon bito assets totaled 1.1 billion dollars making it the fastest etf ever to reach a billion dollars in what balconies described as quote a poetically apropos movement the ito broke gld's 18 year old record of hitting one billion dollars in assets in three days the ito is trading so well however that bloomberg reports it is likely to breach the limit on the number of futures contracts cme will permit it to hold quote after two days trading bito owns nearly 1900 contracts for october and cme rules cap the number of front month contracts one entity can own it to two thousand what could help the situation is the next news item more bitcoin features on the way with the sec's approval of pro shares bitcoin futures etf institutions are flocking to get similar products to market notably the sec approved two additional bitcoin futures etfs to be issued by valkyrie and van neck respectively according to filings vanek's bitcoin strategy etf is set to go live after october 23rd meaning it will most likely go live via the new york stock exchange on monday october 25th valkyrie also gained approval and will list on nasdaq as soon as the 23rd which is when this podcast goes live amusingly valkyrie initially filed under the ticker btfd which for those of you who spend hours on crypto twitter will no means by the dip however the company ended up changing the ticker to btf etfs are not the only way to get into the bitcoin futures game on wednesday sibo where over 75 billion dollars in u.s equities are traded daily announced the acquisition of aeris x a digital asset exchange that offers spot and futures products under the new deal airs x will be rebranded to sibo digital and tilly chairman president and ceo of sibo global markets said quote we believe our acquisition of aeris x coupled with broad industry participation and support will help us bring the regulatory framework transparency infrastructure and data solutions of traditional markets to the digital asset space this is sibo's second foray into bitcoin futures as the exchange previously offered bitcoin futures from 2017 to 2019. more fines for tether last friday the commodity futures trading commission or cftc announced the simultaneous filing and settlement of charges against tether and bifinex for 42.5 million dollars total the regulator penalized the stablecoin issuer 41 million dollars for quote making untrue or misleading statements and omissions in connection to the backing of usdt the largest stablecoin by market cap ifinx was fined 1.5 million dollars for the misties of bitfinex such as operating a futures commission merchant without the cftc's permission and engaging in quote illegal off exchange retail commodity transactions acting chairman rosten benham said quote this case highlights the expectation of honesty and transparency in the rapidly growing and developing digital assets marketplace in a conversation with the block bitfinex's general counsel stuart hogner explained that what sparked the enforcement actions occurred during quote markedly different time in our ecosystem hogner went on to add that there is no finding that tether tokens were not fully backed at all times simply that the reserves were not all in cash and all in a bank account titled in tether's name at all times in related news celsius ceo alex michinski told the financial times this week that tether has begun loaning usdt against cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum as collateral but if you give them enough collateral liquid collateral bitcoin ethereum and so on they will mint tether against it said mashinsky decrypt points out that this conflicts with tethers legal terms which state tether will not issue tether tokens for consideration consisting of the digital tokens for example bitcoin only money will be accepted upon issuance additionally on tuesday hindenburg research announced a one million dollar bounty to be presented to anyone who comes forward with what they are calling undisclosed details about tether reserves the research firm says it is establishing the bounty due to doubts regarding the legitimacy of usdt's backing senators call for novi to shut on tuesday five democratic settoners including elizabeth warren sent a letter to facebook ceo mark zuckerberg urging him to shut down the social media giant's cryptocurrency projects novi additional wallet and dm a stablecoin disclosure i write a facebook bulletin newsletter in their bid to dissuade novi and dm from launching the signatories cited federal reserve chair jerome powell acting control of the currency michael sue and the financial action task force as regulators who are looking into quote the risks that stable coins pose to financial stability the letter came just hours after novi facebook's crypto wallet launched a pilot in the us in guatemala and announced a partnership with paxos that would allow users to send and receive paxos's stablecoin usdp through novi notably novi chose not to use dm facebook's digital currency project which has hit major regulatory obstacles since being announced as libra more than two years ago warren co explicitly addressed the pilot program in their letter facebook is once again pursuing digital currency plans on an aggressive timeline and has already launched a pilot for a payments infrastructure network even though these plans are incompatible with the actual financial regulatory landscape not only for dms specifically but also for stable coins in general in addition to citing concerns regarding financial stability the senators also went after facebook's history of moving fast and breaking things quote facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient we urge you to immediately discontinue your novi pilot and to commit that you will not bring dm to market concluded the senators in response a novi spokesperson told the block quote we look forward to responding to the committee's letter next headline new york state attorney general calls for cease and desist new york attorney general leticia james directed two crypto lenders to immediately cease operations within the state and three other platforms to provide information about their activities the aeg did not name the company she was going after the documents in the release reference both nexo and celsius disclosure nexo is a previous sponsor of my shows however celsius published a blog post this week claiming it has not received a cease and desist order in new york according to the new york ag's press release crypto lenders are facilitating quote unregistered and unlawful activities by offering interest bearing accounts which the regulator believes are securities the press release states that digital asset lending platforms must register with the state's attorney general's office before offering any such product to new yorkers cryptocurrency platforms must follow the law just like everyone else which is why we are now directing two crypto companies to shut down and forcing three more to answer questions immediately said attorney general james time for fun bits jack dorsey almost called bitcoin's all-time high on tuesday twitter and square ceo jack dorsey tweeted 705 742 no context no punctuation just the string of six digits the tweet sparked a variety of speculation with many and non-crypto accounts lurking in the comments trying to ascertain the meaning of the seemingly random digits luckily a follow-up tweet by dorsey cleared up the confusion off by 117 he wrote most likely in reference to how many blocks he was away from predicting bitcoin's all-time high by decrypts math this put dorsey nearly 20 hours off on his prediction as bitcoin did not hit its new all-time high above 67 dollars according to coin gecko until wednesday morning you can't make this stuff up the sam bankman freed led
