well I don't think it's a fertile ground for defy you know yes any Bitcoin Maxi listening can find some possible way that it could be used right to build anything right theoretically like almost any low-level language like assembly like at a certain point you know you can make a turn complete system with it and therefore build anything but it's not the right tool for the job if you're going to build D5 or something complicated Bitcoin is not the blockchain to build it on in my opinion I think it's great for the one use case it has which is transferring value between parties and that's the value proposition that's the narrative that's the value of it right I don't think it's going to be using this as the foundation for complex systems Beyond just transferring value
