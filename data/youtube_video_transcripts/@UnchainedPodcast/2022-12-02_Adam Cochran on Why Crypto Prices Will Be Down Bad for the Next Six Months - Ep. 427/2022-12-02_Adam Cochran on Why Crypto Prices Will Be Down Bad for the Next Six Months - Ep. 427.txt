Link in the description today's guest is Adam Cochran partner at cinepain ventures welcome Adam thanks for having me Laura just a heads up everyone that due to some issues with our schedules we ended up recording this on Wednesday evening rather than Thursday so if any big news breaks tomorrow or for you yesterday then I'll have to cover that during the recap rather than during this interview Adam not that long ago you and I finished watching or watching the tweets about the deal book interview with Sam Beckman freed former CEO of FTX what did you think I mean I I thought it was one of the uh greatest works of fiction since Game of Thrones uh it was this complex Narrative of and lies that either Sam has convinced himself of or um you know is trying to put forward to play this media game and I'm glad to see that finally the media seems to be stepping up with some hard-hitting questions rather than bizarre fluff pieces and when you say you felt that he lied were there any particular moments that struck you as qualifying for that kind of label many but like let's break it down at the highest levels we all know Sam's a smart guy from his background from his work and from everything we've seen of him in this space he is also somebody who likes control and was involved in absolutely everything that he did to a level where he became a Blocker in those things there is no way from the data that we know on chain that it is mathematically possible to blow a 10 billion dollar hole into FDX in a legal and legitimate way based on the assets that were there at the time and I can't fathom for a second that someone as smart and detail-oriented and constantly in control of his domain as Sam would be entirely oblivious to that that is the clever positioning of you know a son of Stanford law professors who realizes that negligence is a much lesser crime than fraud so are you implying because a lot has been made and even in this interview a lot has been made about how it's not the greatest legal strategy for him to be talking as much as he has been I don't know if he listened also to the interviews he did with Tiffany Fong the Celsius creditor who sort of somehow through dm'ing with him got him to do a couple phone calls with her but Andrew Ross Sorkin asked him this during the interview something like what do your lawyers think of you doing these interviews or something question like that so are is that what you're implying that somehow this is like a strategy what meant to throw people off or yeah look I'm I'm out of two minds of it and and while I'm you know well read on the law as a hobby I'm not a lawyer and I'm not based in the U.S so my understanding of these intricacies is probably off a little bit a lawyer is always going to tell you you never want to admit fault when you're under investigation right that is their legal strategy it's shut up and let us do our job I think if you were to realize you're in this position where you are absolutely cooked there's no way you're getting out of this the code and the blockchain are a immutable Smoking Gun for what you did then there is this idea that if you go out there and you push this I'm just an oblivious kid I didn't know we grew too big we grew too fast oopsie maybe you can bring this back into the realm of negligence which is not going to be the same as having had a specific malice intent to steal client funds and so there's part of me that thinks that this just has to be a legal strategy that he's come up with because he believes himself to be a really smart person across all these domains and able to handle this because the only other option is that he was truly oblivious to all this and that's stupid about a 10 you know 20 30 billion dollar Empire and that just doesn't reconcile with anything that we've learned about him in this industry for the past three four years yeah I mean something I think that has stuck with me is how small the staff was and so you know when you're not delegating a number of those duties out then it does call into question how much you yourself have your hands and those items right like you know the fact that there was no CFO is kind of something a number of people have called out so it would indicate that if there's not a CFO then it's probably someone like him if not him exactly who's tasked with you know kind of keeping the books in order yeah and I I mean you know we we hear this thing again and again where they bragged about having only 12 engineers and even them they were segmented and only small parts of them ever got to see the full breadth of code um they never scaled up that engineering team as far as we know despite the challenges that they've had with the site latency that crypto Twitter completely uh Rags them on and to put that into comparison I worked at a crypto Exchange in Canada in 2013 that served the Canadian market and was many orders of magnitude smaller than uh FTX ever was we had more than 12 employees right this was this was a tiny operation back then and we had more than 12 people so it at some point it became this conscious decision of exclusion and I'm I'm hard-pressed to find another legitimate reason as to why rather than not wanting to expand the circle of the scheme right and just to make clear I think FTX recently had a few hundred employees maybe somewhere in the 300 range but you were talking about the engineers yeah exactly just the just the engineering staff I think most of their uh staff have it ended up being on customer support operations compliance things like that but they were always bragging about a really small engineering team that didn't make sense to a lot of other uh operators in this space so let's also now talk about some of the big Ripple effects from all of this I guess drama and this big collapse obviously this week we did see block five filed for bankruptcy that was pretty much expected what do you think is the significance of the bankruptcy of blockfi I mean you know blockfi was on the ropes in a way that we kind of expected this was going to happen right um the FDX Lifeline was at best questionable right the the deal was not good for them in any capacity I think with block fi and Voyager we once again see small retail users who don't understand D5 get screwed over when we see large conservative investors who wanted to get exposure to this space yet absolutely destroyed you know Canadian Pension funds in Ontario and Quebec invested in FTX Voyager block fi in Celsius because Regulators here told them that holding tokens and doing Unchained D5 was too risky to put a teacher's pension fund in and that was you know for bankruptcies back to back those investors are gone for the next decade there's no way we are getting them back no no teachers union in the world is going to keep in place the investors who want to take that gamble again not happening we've also scored a lot of retail investors who only had a few hundred dollars to put into this space to begin with and the pain from that will leave a bad taste in their mouth we've done irreparable brand damage to this space in two key sectors and it's going to take us ages to ever try and rebuild even a fraction of that yeah I definitely agree here you know because a lot of these people were I think once who probably didn't fully understand their products one bit of news that's sort of been hovering and it hasn't reached a conclusion is that Genesis the crypto lender who which is a subsidiary of dcg is having financial difficulty due to the fact that it had made a 2.3 billion dollar loan to 3ac this was obviously months ago you know due to I guess the continued Fallout and um and you know other events Genesis may have to file for bankruptcy it might even pull dcg down with it and it was curious How likely it was that you thought Genesis would actually have to file and I think the moment that we saw some statements from them I became worried about both Genesis and actually digital currency group at large I don't think that contagion is done yet I would not be surprised if we see them move to sell some major assets from their books to kind of mitigate this damage and now hopefully short it up enough but we saw this kind of progressive rollout of them saying how much damage there was from hey we had no exposure to oh there's a gap here and then we finally got numbers around it I think they took a very hard hit in a hard environment and I would not be surprised if they have to sell down a lot of their their Venture book or key assets uh whether that's their uh steak and luno or Foundry or something like coindesk I I could see them liquidating to try and get the capital to survive this oh wow okay so you it seems like you are then pretty optimistic so you do you feel that there's a worry for dcg as well I I uh I don't know I think they have to be able to short up the cash and when I run the numbers of kind of what valuation of assets I would give them looking outwards I'm a hard-pressed for them to find enough cash if they do have to fill that billion dollar hole just because so many things are illiquid right now so much of their Venture portfolio would be hard to sell a lot of the liquid assets that they hold are very thin Market books so they're not going to get really good execution right now they can probably come out swing I I think the worst case scenario is they liquidate almost everything else and sell a bunch of equity in the parent company in order to maintain grayscale because that's really the Golden Goose oh wow okay so in a moment we're going to talk about what some of those moves might be but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

to my conversation with Adam so as you mentioned you feel like there are certain things that TCG Genesis could do to keep both of them afloat I don't know if you saw apparently a number of people are bidding for coindesk there was a report by semaphore that there was an offer of 300 million dollars for that Media company but that was rejected as being too low so when you talk about some of the different options on the table do you see that as a way a path forward for dcg yeah and I think part of the challenge obviously looking from the outside we don't have the clear picture on the status of assets on their book as well as you know how much debt is really there because they were originally trying to raise a billion and then they kind of walk that back down to 500 million if we're actually at that 500 million level if they sell something like a a coin desk if they sell you know some of their Venture book uh on a secondary Market they can probably plug a 500 million dollar hole not comfortably they don't want to do it it's for selling for sure but they can plug that hole to maintain grayscale and I mean I think they bought uh coindesk for something like six hundred thousand dollars back when they originally bought it so great Roi on that individual asset just not necessarily at the time that you want to be selling it I saw that Bloomberg reported that creditors of Genesis are working with restructuring lawyers to try to come up with options to keep the firm out of bankruptcy what do you think of of that do you think that is something smart for them to do and um if so you know what do you think might happen there yeah I mean I I think whenever possible uh debtors and creditors want to move towards a restructuring agreement that they can all agree on rather than going through the lengthy and arduous process of a chapter 11 bankruptcy which is just going to pull far more of the resources out uh in lawyer fees and court fees and filings and make it take years right like people are still waiting on their mad Cox repayments so who knows how many you know decades from now someone's going to get something out of FTX I think wherever possible a restructuring is good it just really depends on the specific nature of that whole how much debtors are owed and what they're willing to wait on right if this was happening in the bull market and uh grayscale was still bringing in amazing fees and these people were flush with their own cash maybe they say yeah you know what I'm fine to wait for five years for some debt Equity to roll over and pay me back in Grace but in this environment where cash is tighter where this Market is feeling a squeeze or the the larger economic picture could be moving into a downturn people are probably going to be a little more focused on getting cash in hand as soon as possible or extracting a pound of Flesh that's way more valuable elsewhere so that that could lead to a much Messier and pricier situation for uh Genesis even though you are optimistic for dcg because it is such a stalwart of the industry and has really been a Pioneer you know being so early in this space I was curious if that goes under what do you think the significance would be for the industry I think it would be sad because you know Barry is a icon in this space and has continued to be here from early on and take some really outsized bets in unexpected areas um and and Champion projects that often didn't get another look from a lot of large funding opportunities in this space and so I would hate to see them go under in that respect but I don't know that their ripple effect will be nearly as much as what we could still see playing out with uh FTX I think there's actually a lot more contagion out there there's kind of being hidden behind the veil right now and the only thing I really worry about with dcg is grayscale and if that gets forced into liquidation or sold to a new holder that restructures kind of the trust agreements we could see a lot of force selling we could see a lot of change in stance on regulation and their relationship with regulators and I do worry that some anti-crypto Regulators will use this just as more cannon fodder against the space Oh yeah wow yeah I mean I I imagine at this point one of their priorities would be to keep greyscale intact yeah I hadn't thought of that but you're right that that would be a huge negative impact for the industry and earlier when you talked about how you feel there's more contingent what are you looking for what are you you know keeping an eye on so I I think part of the challenge is when we look at something like three arrows Capital which was somewhere between three to five billion in the whole and a lot of it was Liquid Holdings that really liquidated quickly on chain you know we all saw the market that morning and we knew something had happened and it took us days to know what it was even in that case it took about a month before we hit the new low prices because contagion unravels slowly and I think what a lot of people in this space who haven't worked in traditional Finance or Corporate America on the kind of the business development or mergers and acquisition side fail to understand is that these large corporate entities unravel very very slowly we're talking about a hole here somewhere between 10 and 30 plus billion dollars because we know Alameda blew a 10 billion dollar hole in FTX we have no idea how many times Alameda pledged that same 10 billion dollars as collateral for other money right that's still a black box for us that's many multiple times bigger than 3ac and a lot of this has been held by private corporations who have come out and said hey we had no critical exposure to that because they don't have any obligation to tell us how bad things are and they'll quietly downsize sell awesome things do some layoffs do some restructuring and try and barter their debt across different books and investment structures for a while to come but it will pull liquidity out of the system it will create them selling downward pressure at inopportune times and it will unravel incredibly slowly I wouldn't be surprised if we continue to see contagion impacts of forced selling for the next six months but just an incredibly dry Market liquidity both on VCS and market makers I think one thing that most retail consumers fail to realize right now is that nearly every exchange used to offer credit to market makers where they could trade on that credit and as long as they settled the balance with the exchange over the next few days or with their OTC desk that was is fine that's gone away most exchanges most OTC desks are requiring pre-funding for nearly all of their clients right now and that takes so much credit and so much liquidity out of the space and the impact of that just causes increased volatility in every direction and leaves us so prone to other systematic events and so first of all what would you say then is kind of the prognosis for crypto lending in the short term the next like let's say a year or two poor um you know I I think at the end of the day we crypto lending has existed in this weird space where it is not as rigorous and analytical as the centralized lending system and these the kind of centralized lenders in this space are obviously not as transparent and robust as the decentralized platforms I think compound and Ave and things like that great they will continue to thrive because they were the ones that got paid back they were the ones that users are still whole and they were still afloat because you can't cheat a blockchain opaque centralized lenders who got into this game trying to lend like big Banks without the expertise and depth of book of big Banks those are the ones who got burned and they're going away and that had an outsized impact on Pension funds and investment funds who wanted to operate with these more traditional players and so I think we've really scorned ourselves in the relationships we were building outside of the industry so I think lending to that sector could be gone for years earlier you kind of talked about how you felt that there would be like low liquidity in this system in general so what do you expect the crypto markets to look like for the next year or so I think in part it depends on kind of where this messy Global macro continues to go maybe maybe we pull out this uh Powell soft Landing by the skin of our teeth and the economy recovers and we are back to this uh jubilant up-only economy and that would be nothing but good for us and the technological advances we've made during that time I'm not as optimistic about that and I think the reality is we will see increased volatility and increase Arbitrage in this space what really stood out to me is the wrapped Bitcoin issues the other day where wrapped bitcoin's prices were off of the index by a a couple of percentage points and it took almost a half hour before market makers closed that Arbitrage Gap even though the assets are as far as everyone can tell equal to equal and that is just a a symptom of this underlying disease of contagion that is there that we don't fully see the picture of because when market makers have such low liquidity and such low credit and they're waiting on transfers they can't fill those opportunities quick you know I a four percent gap between Bitcoin prices would not have existed two months ago now we can see that and I think that's a lot scarier than people get their credit for because if you have another Black Swan event or even a small event we lose another big exchange or some regulation comes down the pipeline we don't have anybody to absorb the selling the you know the buyers of Last Resort are all on the ropes or out of the game entirely and so I think we're in a in a delicate position where those who are still deploying Capital need to do so very selectively and projects in this space need to really focus on the technological Milestones that get them to real profitable user adoption over this coming cycle because we don't know when this ends and we don't know that it can't get worse we can hope we can hope this is that Plateau but we are on a we're on a bit of a nice edge here and we have to be very careful where we're walking so you cut you alluded to Regulators but I just wanted to ask more generally at this point what would you say are some of the lessons that you feel the industry could learn based on what's happened these last well I guess it's the last few weeks really but you could even stretch it back um a few months I I think the Core lesson is the importance of criticism we make this mistake time and time again in this industry we place someone on a pedestal we make them invaluable we make it a crime to ask them questions to the point that we will harass and send death threats to people who are making that critique and what happens is that those people who always want to put up that wall uh and be invaluable end up being the ones who are the villains of the space they become these main characters and we find out it's all smoke and mirrors the part of the value of the blockchain is the transparency and we should welcome critique and criticism because that allows us to make our projects stronger we want to have stakeholders in this space who are willing to make mistakes learn from them explain them in the open get involved and iterate to make this space stronger and if we keep on putting people on pedestals we are only ever going to be disappointed all right well Adam this has been a great discussion thank you so much for sharing your insights on Unchained thank you very much Laura pleasure to be here don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap Sam bankman freed tries to win over the public as we just discussed on the show former FTX CEO Sam bankman freed did an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times deal book Summit but he was also in a number of other places this week in response to a question of whether the funds from FTX were sent to Alameda his trading firm which was led by Caroline Ellison he said that he screwed up and that he didn't knowingly co-mingle funds additionally he said that he didn't intend to commit fraud as was noted on the chopping block live stream show on Wednesday which will be released on the podcast tomorrow whether bankman freed knew what was going on or not is very important because that could determine whether he will face criminal or civil charges many on crypto Twitter did not believe a word of binkfan Freed's comments Vinnie lingam General partner at multi-coin Capital said the svf legal strategy is to attempt to characterize fraud as incompetence in order to stay out of jail David Marcus co-founder and CEO at light spark said he was speechless at the level of reality Distortion field at play here however SPF got at least one supporter CEO of Pershing Square and billionaire Bill Ackman tweeted he believes SPF is telling the truth which promptly got ratioed and to which SPF responded that he deeply appreciates it also this week in an audio interview with Celsius creditor Tiffany Fong SPF dismissed the rumors of a back door which he allegedly used to move funds from FTX to Alameda without triggering any alerts he also addressed the value of ftt the token of FTX saying that it was more legit than most tokens in a later interview with ABC news's George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America bankman freed claimed again that he knew nothing about the improper use of ftx's funds and so that he didn't even try to do risk management however talking with New York Magazine's Jen vietner SPF said he wishes he hadn't bailed out the industry and he avoided the question of how the customer's funds were lost blockfi sues FTX apart from filing for bankruptcy blockfi is also suing Sam finkman freed over Robin Hood shares that FDX pledged his collateral bingvan freed held about 7.6 percent of Robin Hood class a common stock according to block five's first aid Court bankruptcy hearing FTX and Alameda research oh over 1 billion dollars to block fi with Alameda owing 671 million dollars on a now defaulted loan and FTX owing 355 million dollars in Frozen funds Apple decides that users of coinbase wallet shall not transfer nfts Tech Giant Apple valued at 2.36 trillion dollars that blocked the latest version of coinbase wallet until a feature that allows users to send entities over iOS is disabled the decision has to do with Apple's policy of charging a fee of 30 percent for every transaction going under a mobile application in its operating system iOS according to coinbase Apple wants to collect 30 of the gas fees required to send to nfts coinbase was openly critical of Apple's decision the company wrote this is akin to Apple trying to take a cut of fees for every email that gets sent over open internet protocols Apple has introduced new policies to protect their profits on the expense of consumer investment in nfts and developer Innovation across the crypto ecosystem authorities have their eyes on FTX the implosion of FTX keeps resonating with authorities in Washington at the New York Times deal book Summit U.S treasury secretary Janet Allen called it the Lehman moment for crypto in addition during the Senate Banking Committee hearing Senator Elizabeth Warren called FTX not much more than a handful of magic beans meanwhile during the first Senate hearing on FTX cftc chair Austin Benham kept pushing for his agency to have more power to regulate the crypto industry he said to prevent this from happening again we must be provided appropriate Authority by Congress as was previously announced legislators and Regulators are probing the collapse of FTX the house Financial Services committee announced that it will hold its first FTX hearing on December 13th hoping to get clearer answers about the mismanagement of the company additionally in a speech on Sunday the Bahamas attorney general Ryan Pinder said that Regulators in the country are also investigating Sam bigman freed and FTX Genesis is being investigated by regulators according to Barons Genesis is being investigated by the Alabama Securities Commission in other states Regulators are reportedly studying how crypto firms are connected to each other the connection between Genesis and Retail investors and the possibility that Genesis violated Securities laws one of the most pressing issues of dcg and Genesis is grayskills Bitcoin trust or gbtc many were worried that amidst the liquidity crisis Genesis was going to dump its gbtc on the market Ryan sulcus founder of massari brought some calm for gbtc shareholders saying that it's not possible for dcg and Genesis to sell gptc because of certain Market rules that don't allow them to do so South Korean authorities seek an arrest warrant for terraform lab's co-founder Daniel shin yonhab a South Korean news agency reported that the Seoul southern district prosecutor's office is seeking an arrest warrant for terraform Labs co-founder Daniel Shin tooform Labs is the entity behind the Terra blockchain which collapsed in May along with

the prosecutor's office issued warrants for three other terraform Labs investors and four Engineers the news comes after a prior request to arrest dokwan co-founder of the company wrapped tokens cause confusion amongst some crypto people crypto Twitter is where everything happens and it can be a great source of information but this week it certainly went the other direction many influencers such as Eric Wall Anthony sassano and banteg started messing around and saying that weft the wrapped token of ether was going to d-peg and then it was insolvent this isn't possible since it's a smart contract and borrowing a hack it's easy to see at all times that the weft contract is fully backed while they meant it it's a joke there were many who misunderstood the message leading to widespread confusion since wealth is such an important backbone of decentralized financial applications fear spread throughout people who didn't catch the joke on a related note Keiko a company that provides data and
