episode is the crypto scene in Asia how is it faring during the crypto winter here to discuss our Eric Meltzer and W on founding partners of primitive ventures welcome Eric and dubby hello thanks Lara it's great to be here before we dive into questions about Asia and there is a lot to discuss there let's quickly discuss your backgrounds can you each tell me how you got in a crypto and came to start primitive ventures why don't we start with you dubby yeah so I was born and raised back in China and I moved to us like she pursued my master degree at Carnegie Mellon University at age of 20 so I was at eBay for like four years as that paradigm manager and I move on to a large traditional venture investment like beckoned venture I've been doing like blush and investment investment a investment and like going to crypto when I was doing like blushing investment and I remember I'm so I remember I met with Eric like just doing this D cash time so that was like back in early 2017 and Erin died we were we were both the community board elector for the cash and so like that's how we get to know each other and we had not quite a lot and like ever became my like crypto buddy and so we literally just I taught every day and like afterwards in there so like we so but because I do not venture investment like there's a lot of like like you said like it's a problem like say for instance it's very hard to maintain your just as a liquidity and and like basically I have to hop between both a traditional venture and like crypto like crypto is already 24/7 and so it's pretty tiring and so like that's why me and everybody were thinking like what about we probably sighs thought our own things so so I I can be a full-time crypto so like that's my background and for your venture you were at dan hua ventures right mm-hmm yeah that's right and and just describe who they are oh yeah so like like dem ha capital has to be so like it has been a pretty like major Asian background venture from that in second Valley and um and so I think at the top our a um so like the Dan wasthat total so like the total AOM was over I have a bill in and so it is actually backed by some of the very top strategic money like Ali Baba Baidu tensor etc so like that's why it has been like a leading force of this I Asian investor so in the valley and Eric what about you how did you get in a crypto and if you have anything to add about how you came to start proven adventures yeah so I I went to college in China actually also um I was at Peking University and I'm also Jewish and so I guess those two things kind of conspired to make me really excited about Bitcoin and so in like 2013 I was introduced in yeah me elaborate here because I guess my interest in Bitcoin I think is a lot more political than a lot of investors and what that comes from is is uh you know as a Jew I read historically about how when the Jews have been oppressed in various countries really the first thing that happened kind of the predecessor to a genocide was a people's financial assets would be frozen and so like every every Jew has some story about how the ancestors had to flee with basically just the clothes on their back and so when I heard about this form of digital money that was completely outside of government control I thought that was like an incredibly exciting thing really from it from a political perspective I wasn't that interested in in the tech and to this day I really don't think the tech is is something that new it's kind of more of a recombination of existing interesting stuff and then going to China kind of further reinforced that because China has you know these super strict capital controls and so I had a bunch of Chinese friends that wanted to move money out of China and they they would have to you know find 20 friends that could each send $50,000 in order to move a million out of China and I had also just drove home for me that like it was kind of ludicrous to have our money in the control of a central government so that got me both of those things kind of got me really into Bitcoin but I didn't I wasn't that interested in crypto as a whole I kind of just thought Bitcoin was like this one-off really cool thing but the other coins that were around when I first got started that if you actually if you went and looked at coin market cap in 2013 there were almost all complete garbage they were just obvious scams there was mega coin and feathercoin and and all these ridiculous things that have since died and so I didn't I didn't think of it as an industry by any means I just thought it was this kind of cool thing and then way later I mean I bought some Bitcoin back then I held on to Bitcoin I would like read Bitcoin talk obsessively but I didn't I didn't I didn't think of it as like a sector and then in 2017 I started seeing things that were actually interesting and so like when aetherium and Z cash and these other coins started coming out and the exchange infrastructure really started getting built out it appeared to me that this was actually gonna be a thing and through kind of a crazy series of coincidences I ended up joining an investment for him in China called inb that's founded by this really interesting guy and in visa I who to this day is one of the biggest holders of Bitcoin and so I worked with them for a while became a partner there and ran an early investment fund at inb and that's how I met Debbie so Debbie and I were doing very similar kind of early stage investment stuff and I think the two of us are similarly picky if you look at like you know I think Debbie and I have more in common with like hardcore crypto skeptics that hate all crypto than we do with like crypto ultra balls and that like you know 99% of the stuff they hate we hate too it's just that we think there's sort of a 1% kernel of things that are like the absolute truth and our super-amazing and so it was really refreshing to meet someone like that and like Debbie said we ended up just talking constantly and we Co invested in a bunch of stuff and at some point I was like well I mean if we're gonna be Co interesting this Austin we may as well just have a fund of our own and so that's how primitive got started so the reason I wanted to have you guys both on the show is because I feel like you are both pretty steeped in the crypto world across regions and the last time I did a show about Asia was actually quite a while ago with like a year and a half ago so um I was really curious to know kind of where things have been going over there and so just in really broad strokes why don't we just start with kind of like the big picture how would you characterize the differences between crypto entrepreneurs and the crypto projects and teams in Asia versus the rest of the world so I mean something that W and I think about a lot is that like a crypto is inherently global right there's no sort of built-in restrictions in terms of where you can participate and so as a fund we look really globally and what we found is that the stuff that we like in Asia and the stuff that we like in the u.s. is completely different and so in China you know a very high percentage of distressingly high percentage of projects I think of as outright scams and if they're not scams they're just really uninteresting stuff but the the sort of centralized infrastructure around crypto so like the by Nance the whole be the okay exchange that you need these kind of guys are in my opinion like an order of magnitude better than the US counterparts and so if you compare like you know finance to not to pick on anyone but like you know Polonia X or something it's just the team is in competent their their execution ability is off the charts and so we found is that we do we look and we look at and do a lot more like equity deals in China that are for kind of crypto associated companies and then we do a lot more actual crypto currency deals in the US where I think there's kind of more sort of old-school cypherpunk like cryptographer talent y ou go ahead to be yeah right so especially for I just crypto entrepreneurs and like one thing we one thing like specific in China or just uh Asia and so Asia in general Islam so because we found like all this application this essentialize application are really good to use there and I think that's probably partially because of the whole thing type thing is pretty advanced like betting just I out that game just backing China so here in the United States and people are still paying with Placid and find out buildings of like paper checks like every year but like everything is cashless so if you ever go to Beijing Shanghai just that people just use Ali pay or like which I pay everywhere so I think the essentialize centralized application or centralized Intel infrastructure is way more advanced there so let that's why there's a lot of talents and entrepreneurs and life and this traditional thing to have founder who are converted to you like crypto founder and so that's where we find like the Chu talents that belongs to that specific layer of applications is that what you think that they differ in that way we're kind of like the startups and the infrastructure as you described it is more advanced and interesting in China versus here and then but then also in the flipside why do you think more of like the decentralized protocols and stuff are more interests are more interesting in the US I think like if you're entrepreneur who are building for like a centralized application and so you have to be really good at user acquisition like user acquisition in the sense of like like a consumer and when it comes to like a protocol layer winning so when it comes to like a protocol layer like projects and so like like the like by the first set of like clients like : coli clients are more like developers so you're basically targeting two different groups of users out there and so it's a complete different skill so I think like that's why that sets them apart like - so - or certain extent huh there's something else that W brought up a while ago that I think we should mention which is just uh you know if you're working in crypto you're working on a technology that's fundamentally anti-government and you're working on a technology that has a ton of you know regulatory risk and so you kind of need to be someone that's extremely comfortable with being a pirate and we've noticed there's more of those people than you would expect in China despite that there's you know this kind of not the crypto firepower that we would want for like these protocol level projects but in terms of like you know a cz and Hawaii type of team like you have a finance where you know they're they're just going to go ahead and do this thing and and if it works it's fine and if it doesn't you know they live in Singapore or something and we've actually it's been it's been slightly you know a bummer for me because there's been definitely projects in the US where they approached me with something that I think is really cool and I'm like well but like you guys are US citizens and you're under US regulatory regime and what you're trying to do is just not gonna fly at the US and so there's just we can't fund this because like it's not it's not gonna work in the States oh you know I thought you were gonna go in the opposite direction with that statement I thought that Duffy's point was that the FinTech firms had done well in Asia or China because it's alright that is that because the fintechs had done well that that's why these like startups these exchanges had done well but that something decentralized is really different and I thought where you were going with like being anti-government was that people in the West are more used to doing that and that's why they're you know more I guess developing more interesting decentralized protocols but you see it the reverse yeah I mean it's really I think it's really nuanced so like the nuance that I would try to try to explain is that like the these infrastructure firms that are flourishing they're doing so outside of China so it's Chinese teams but they're not dealing with Chinese regulatory risk because they don't have Chinese Fiat channels and so it's kind of there's some kind of interplay there and then the other thing is you know the general I think sort of Chinese developer profile I would say is much more sort of authoritarian and and you know unwilling to challenge authority but then you get you get these these occasional teams not to come back to finance but I think they're really amazing you know and the other big exchanges in China as well and a lot of the wallet projects where they're just it's kind of you know whether you love them or hate them it's sort of like the Travis kalanick uber model where they're like look we made this thing that we know people like and maybe the regulation doesn't fit yet but like we're just going to keep doing this and people are going to love it and eventually the regulators will come around and I think we've seen sort of less willingness to do that in the u.s. yeah I will urge people if you haven't yet to listen to my interview with Suzy I also think he's pretty amazing finances just like an incredible story you you really need to listen to podcasts if you don't know the story of finance so one other thing that was when I so now we you know we've discussed the difference in the entrepreneurs do you think that like investment in the two regions differ like do you see that Chinese investors kind of prefer certain things versus investors in the West I think like when it comes just specifically on Chinese investors or just just a furnace that's pacing like mainland China and I think so we have to categorize them into something different so we have like pretty good friends out there like NGC like @bg and like a few artists out there and I feel like their preferences are very much similar as that what we have but I think there are probably like hundreds of Latifa not or like these three funds or like crypto funds out there and but like they're actually not even fun so they're just simply like a stick DK and so like that's what we have seen like in like 2017 in like early 2018 so Alejandra's of less such funds like pop up and like many of them they're like extremely short term and so like the whole funds like oh so it's only one and like many of the knowledge ourselves pure just a pom and dampers and so most of them are just a trading centric and so they will help you to do market making so they will probably do so they will I probably do like all this at Ponzi design with you and so like they're like most men are like looking for just a short-term return and just a shortened acuity and I think like we have to carrier cross off those side not their legitimate founds out there and then like some of those liability so like Josiah someone just like get once out there and one thing I realized about the investor profile or some many of this I investors so they don't have any just I probably experienced like many of them are not working in like tech industry at all and so some of them are former you know like amateur trader of like crypto so buying Bitcoin early on and just like get rich overnight and like many of them so they were just like like so they will probably try to invest there assisting crypto and then into something they can just like keep the multiple going and so like that's a very common mentality that I have seen in the whole Asian landscape well-liked meaning they say they form these sort of temporary groups these short-term groups and then they just I mean like these protocols or these tokens so you know whatever the projects are like they would take a while to build but their training get a profit within that year yeah so it's like probably like a few weeks oh my god yeah well I mean I would add to that by saying that there's this kind of this shadowy ecosystem of like extremely shady projects in China and extremely shady funds and so you'll have these projects that are in my opinion just like pure garbage and they'll offer to their friends who are running these kind of like pseudo little mini funds these huge discounts with some form of lockup and then they play this kind of musical chairs game where the token gets released it gets you know they pay some listing for you to get listed on some exchange and then the funds that we're in early I'll you know make two or three or whatever 10 X depending on what the situation is and then they just rinse and repeat and so what happened is when you know during the massive bull run and 2017 they were able to do that pretty successfully and then when the market turned much less bullish they found themselves holding on to a bunch of you know just pure garbage tokens that were made by teams in my opinion really in bad faith and so a lot of those funds you know because what W mentioned they have this extremely short time cycle they're just there they're screwed I mean they're in a lot of trouble because they're holding assets that have no inherent value they have no one to sell them to and they're their LPS you know want their money back in two or three months so I think we're gonna see kind of just the way we've seen in mining and the way we've seen in projects like when the market turns sour for a while all of these kind of amateurs and scammers and everyone you know get washed out and I think we're gonna see a lot of washout of that kind of fun okay yeah let's hope what one thing that I wanted to ask you was I've spoken to both of you before and I noticed that I've seen or heard you both call they advantage that Silicon Valley VCS used to have you've called it an unfair advantage and and both of you so that you think that's changing now with crypto so what do you think that advantage was before and how do you think crypto has changed that so I think um in the past like the the huge advantage I think this advantage still exists to some extent and by the way I mean the reason we use the word unfair advantage is just almost like a term of art and startups where like if you're investing in a team you want to ask them like what's the advantage that they have that no one else can access and I think for Silicon Valley DC's the big thing was just there was this huge network effect where if you were a Silicon Valley startup everything you needed was in the valley like all your hiring was gonna happen in the valley all of your future fundraising was gonna happen on one on one you know on Sand Hill Road on like one Street in Palo Alto and so if you were a very well-connected Silicon Valley VC you could approach entrepreneurs and tell them you know we're well-connected to all your potential customers we can help you hire your future fundraising is going to happen with people like us and then crypto came along and in crypto the ecosystem is much more global and so if you're a project you have to care about like miners which are mostly in China you have to care about an exchange ecosystem that's truly global but also has a very large China presence you're many many of these crypto teams are hiring remotely in Eastern Europe in China in Singapore and in the US and so if you're an old school you know Sandhill Road VC you're actually going to be at a pretty big disadvantage because when a corporate project approaches you you really can't offer them very much and I think crypto projects are starting to wake up to that we're in 2016 2017 a lot of these projects were really excited to get like you know the big name brand name feces on board as investors and then they realized that like the value add being promised just wasn't being delivered because these people just they're not really in the right position they're not connected to the right people and you're starting to see a lot more you know specific crypto vehicles like fund that we like a lot is this paradigm and so paradigm was like Matt Wong left Sequoia and partnered with Fredersen and this Charlie noise to do a fund that's specifically going to be crypto focused and that will hopefully establish these connections and so I think you know that's going to be a trend and and that it is really just the global nature of the ecosystem that sort of eliminates that advantage that valley Beasley's had yeah and people who don't know Fred aresome is the former co founder of coinbase who left and I think late 2016 Debbie were you gonna add something yeah because I think the traditional venture business has been very regional or at least that started as a very so or I started as Aboriginal business and less Silicon Valley has been the center of flat so Aspen us center of technology innovation over the past few decades and I the whole ecosystem is complete right because we have been saying that like the whole Bay Area or the thicken Valley has been a stack like yeah difference in English well the Bay Area is the infrastructure Cisco Intel Nvidia and so like moving on to like the north of the bay is San Francisco where like all the application is happening and I think my harm I think when it comes to like crypto like everything's very scatter and ever since the early days and China and like Korea has been like a major players in the crypto landscape by the topic changes were started and less and I think like most of them they are so they are still operating back in China and like most of the biggest sand mining operations are so are also Lybrand by Chinese and there's also other thing I want to mention so it's about the drive and it also is about the desire for life social mobility that's one thing that's very obvious in South Korea when you can't realize South Korea by first off or like South Korea has a very strict like capital control and they're like because it has a very high demand and very very low supply and so like that's how the kimchi premium counseling to assist and then also that so and then I also dab kimchi premium kick off like a wave of like crypto hype so a mounted local Korean citizens and then I think like the hype of crypto and token investment and also like the very strong drive and desire for like social mobility and then because I there's like illusion that you can be overnight millionaire so begging Korea so so that has become like a social phenomenon so both investing and like doing crypto startup has become both the Chinese and Korean version of them also both the Chinese and Korean version of American Dream and so that's one thing that's probably lacking in Silicon Valley right now because level so I think most of the valley entrepreneurs so they're relatively philosophical and I deal with it comparing with some like Asian entrepreneur like who are definitely more like practical and then like the whole hype so like the whole hype behind crypto has so has like so has propelled that I wanted to ask you about actually before we move on I did want to note for listeners who don't know what the kimchi premium is that was this period especially during 2017 when due to like restrictions on on where you could trade demand in Korea drove the prices up sometimes I think to like 30% higher than they were in other exchanges is that roughly what it was the pink pretty much yeah it was just as insane you know for coins like Bitcoin and aetherium and stuff like that so I it's just the kimchi premium even exists anymore oh so I think this down to like less than one percent out because um everything has to be more long on this at equilibrium and because of a lot better liquidity okay yeah I do know that I did hear some other podcasts and other people that are a little bit more trading oriented talk about how I think some people would like try to talk to their friends and relatives in Korea to see if they could like take advantage of arbitrage opportunities I do not condone that behavior however that is I think what was going on back during those days um but just out of curiosity why do you think because I as far as I understand in general I think there's just much higher trade volume in Asia than in the West what why is that so in general I the trading volume um I think that trading volume because just exchanges out there right because I a Korea has had three biggest like changes out there so they can accept life via and so like that's why the fear on gram channel is like pretty sufficient there and then China before the ban I said before the ban last year like most of the major exchanges can also accept RMB so let that aside the fear and so like that's why the fear on Ram channel is very smooth and like even after the ban like I don't think just to quickly move on to Ali pay or which I pay as the over the counters like because a digital payment is already pretty advanced and so as long as so as long as like we can transfer money on WeChat and so I can have to address and so we can actually do like just over the counter transaction using this a peer-to-peer manner I think like that's why probably like that's one of the reason why the treaty forum is larger in general but in Asia and okay so I would add to that that uh you know when I first moved to China for college I was at a cafe and I saw like this you know middle-aged woman with her computer open and she had will look to me like a Bloomberg terminal open I mean it was this really advanced like trading interface and she was day trading Chinese stocks and I was like huh that's like you wouldn't really see that in the US and it turns out like in China tons of people are really active and in some cases very skilled day traders and so there's a lot more I think just like amateur traders in China I think that the structure of their markets is a lot more retail focused especially with like the you know Chinese domestic stocks and so you had this huge pool of people that were used to trading pretty speculative assets and so in crypto came around they were like they're really into it they traded it very heavily yeah I think they're interesting so there's also very um very very unique land market structure like that Asia so if we comparing what the dot-com bubble and so so comparable at the background bubble versus like the crypto bubble and so there's things not too many investment bankers out there like just a sell side by side agents so here in United States or like Silicon Valley for specific for like crypto products but like there are tons of less such channel or just selling Asian packing Asia and so in just saying Korea Japan China or Italian just all over and like people tends to have like crazy love into financial products and so like those financial products are like either insurance or a high or Prada or a shadow banking products so there are so many of those just like average your mom-and-pop and so like they were all buy into that and so like usually I can't be like a shadow banking prada like which is not very common here in the US and like manuals like those agents so they're actually selling like crypto products comparing with this that regular financial or just a shadow banking products out there and I think that that's one of this a very unique like marketing back in China and like picking Asia in general hmm one other thing that I was curious about though is if you were saying that a lot of OTC crypto trading is happening via WeChat and I only pay those are surveilled platforms right so you know obviously there is this ban on Bitcoin exchanges and investing and I SEOs so could trading on those platforms or investing the others platforms could that put people who use them at risk so there's actually like a certain risks out there like especially like the government they have been rounding all this lime or entering especially on crippled transaction but like if you are I think if you're not careful enough and your side like Aman is that small enough it's relatively hard to be caught but I think there's definitely leverage exposed to getting your banking account being phrase I stuff like that and so like many of my OTD friends has been being through that before but I think general I if so if you're just like doing like consumer-level and just a small amount on like peer-to-peer transaction like it should be fine yeah I think I think I think I think also um the you know the actual the situation on the ground is that it's illegal in China to run a crypto currency exchange that has Fiat but it's actually not illegal for me to sell you some Bitcoin for RMB yep if like the two of us are just friends and so that's you know it's unclear whether there might be some other kind of weird risks associated with that I had a friend who did a pretty small OTC transaction and then ended up getting basically a police summons that said we think you're involved with money laundering and she went and it was fine but I guess what happened is that like somewhere in the chain of either I forgot whether it was the Bitcoin transactions or the Fiat transactions some money that didn't have a good origin ended up in her account and they froze knock on but nobody said and it was kind of it was a hassle and share that it was fine like she didn't get in trouble or anything but it was pretty scary but yeah but it's just like a really weird like as an American the idea that a transaction that I'm doing on an app that the government would have some insight into what I had done like that's a weird thing to me is of course that's of course happening in the US as well right where right but I guess it's happening if you're using I guess what I'm saying is like because like a chat app right it's different from if you're using like a financial app well I mean in the US the government's have full surveillance of every chat up as well except for maybe signal I think that when it comes true so like so if you and I I want to transact crypto and I the only thing we're like the only thing we are going to communicate over like chat is probably just like a QR code and I think my best surveillance and so they would definitely try to labor like those that crypto relevant conversation but when encounter like small Armand and so it's just fine and then just a holding crypto it's actually legal so it is actually not illegal so yeah so like we don't know anything about like what is it so what is the specific like just monitoring policy behind WeChat but like so far if you is just doing by smaller man like it should be fine so we're gonna keep discussing regulation

cipher trace is securing the crypto economy back to my conversation with Debbie and Eric of primitive ventures so before we keep going with this discussion about regulation I did also want to ask you because I do feel like your fund is kind of unique in the depth of your relationships in both the US and in Asia so as curious how your connections in China have helped your u.s. investments yeah I mean so I think there's been a couple of like interesting examples but one of the big ones is really just like Dovie much more so than myself is super tied in with the miners in China and there's a lot of cases where you know US projects that are proof of work-based will want to do something that would actually be disastrous for them from a mining perspective and so like recently you know Zee cash has been discussing changing their mining rewards such that it's time locked so that the crypto that you get from mining is not immediately spendable but it's sent to you over a long period of time and w was able to very quickly talk to a bunch of Chinese miners ask him how they felt about that and you know came back with the result that it's pretty likely that would be like a very strong centralizing force and so whether Z cash does that or not who knows but you know they can get very quick feedback from us on what the actual look on the ground is there's been a bunch of other ones like you know we're really excited about this project called handshake people can check it out its pension org but the general idea there is to have a DNS root zone replacement handled by a blockchain and so you can do DNS routing of websites and then also have crypto if you want using these human readable addresses and those guys also had a proof-of-work issue where they initially were going to use an algorithm that's the same algorithm that grin was originally using called kuku cycle and they decided to switch it to you know an algorithm called sha-3 in the hope that they would be very a sick friendly and that they would have lots of people building Asics and we were able to give them some sort of inside info on like you know exactly how they should implement that to avoid having a Chinese company that has already made a six for that just be you know completely dominant in day one so I think my name is a big picture a big part of the picture I think the other thing is like we have really close ties to a lot of the exchanges and where that comes in is that like these exchanges every day get an overwhelming amount of contact from new crypto projects asking to be listed and they actually have a really hard time distinguishing like what's a really truly solid project that they you know she just immediately lists and that they shouldn't ask for a bunch of listing fees or anything weird like that and then what's just kind of a marginal project and so what Debbie and Ivor sure of the fact that like I said we're just like super super picky we're able to go to our exchange friends and say I can't look we're looking at this project we think they're really awesome you actually look at them too you know here's the contact and we can to make those connections I think really the kind of two of the biggest pictures are the mining and then also the exchange side of things and then actually just to circle back to the regulatory a thing I wanted to ask you because you can see and I and I feel like this is affecting a lot of your investments you can't see how the regulatory climates differ across regions how do you think that's affecting the development of crypto overall like globally yeah I mean I think like what we're gonna see what we're beginning to see is there's gonna be some jurisdiction that says you know this thing is extremely disruptive and like I said I truly believe crypto to be I think maybe anti-government is too strong over word to use I think it's something that like massively empowers individuals or for governments and so it's kind of a scary thing for any government in the world to be like yeah we're totally on board with this but I think what you're going to see is there will be some jurisdictions and I think Singapore is a good candidate for that I think you know Malta is is doing some stuff in this department and even some states within the US like Wyoming has been extremely positive they're gonna see that you know having this infrastructure that's going to be processing billions and billions of dollars of transactions is actually going to be something really valuable for them from a job creation perspectives from a financial perspective and so they're gonna start getting on board with that and that's actually that's why I guess I have a lot of friends involve akan is someone who has this opinion and I don't agree with this opinion in the opinion is they're very very worried that like governments are just gonna unite and shut down crypto and I think you know it's a legitimate concern but why I'm less worried about it is I think this is really interesting game theory where I like if every other government is like yeah we hate crypto then there's a high incentive for some government to say no no we love crypto come here and you know parent axes on your incredible returns and so you know finance made more money than joy to bank in q1 and Finance has 200 employees and I think dimension Bank has something like 100,000 so we're talking about very significant sums of money and I think that's gonna end up being very enticing to some governments yeah yeah I've already seen that happening like yeah the likelihood I think that all the governments United and one viewpoint on crypto is so low but anyway tell me what were you gonna say right so because I think that's first of all by the more than politician and so I think I like their job is not to form consensus right so it's so it's almost impossible lie for lie all decide major politicians like so to form a consensus right to shut things down and unless is about life and death and so like that's what we have seen about like World War two about financial crisis last time and but I think like crypto lie nowadays and so it's just I not big enough for them to lie think about life forming consensus as to like one entity and then so like the other very interesting game theory is um I think that right now US and China are in a very interesting historical moment and because I like both in China and like us and we have this a very strong mida leader and so because of so pickers of them and so there so by the strong-minded leader list your political tension and so when it comes your political tension and anything that China bends and US blue so I think like us will probably never ban it and so let that's up to like the third interesting game theory that can actually kick crypto survive and then so like that's actually like the tier one last almonds days right and so when it comes to Teochew you're like Singapore Japan Korea and so they're actually moving very fast or like clarify and record trade playbook and license qualification stuff like that because that they have very strong incentives like chiefest the whole industry and like City as like a great opportunity when US and China are in this I power struggle so and then and then so because I'm currently actually in Singapore right now and so I live in a building and which is very interesting that so three other very influential crypto entrepreneur like back in China so they all relocate to Singapore and so guru just that live in the same building here right so I think like that I want a very major phenomena data many of this side Chinese entrepreneurs so there will interest you you know like give up what I have back in China and I move out to a state that's like more friendly and just I start everything all over and I think like the survivability and Josiah sustainability of this Asian entrepreneur are just amazing it's like just like cockroach love of survivability yeah like definitely yeah so I think like that's my plan on on by regulation in general all right so let's move on to something that's been on everyone's minds recently which is mining how is crypto winter affected the miners so okay what incomes remaining because some like one thing we have to understand is for so just that for all the pure W mining just that proof of work right so when all the pure W mining and so they have so like they have one thing that's difficulty adjustment so when encounter difficult adjustment wish beings like the difficulty is actually like a trailing indicator of the price so when the Bitcoin price crash so like that so the Bitcoin difficulty level is not going to adjust immediately so it's always lag so that which means like like all the minor has to keep the same level of my hash power in order to so in order to keep producing the block and so like that's why a lot of my miners and like who are not very efficient or who are not on a very good like unit of also who are not on a very punitive Kannamma so they will so they will actually be like washed out because that if you're like blood reward cannot cover your marginal operational cost and basically it's a so basically designed by the economic as a minor and then so you're not going to mind because you will be losing money and so there's a lot of fun this side turn the off of the machine orgeous I just I have the merchants out so I have to so like all probably just sell the Machine at like a deep discount to some minor that can be more efficient so that's happened in that last couple of months then I think like like so we can actually see everything's reflected on the total hash ray so like if a lot of minor turning off their machine and so we would see like a hit on the hash as well so I remember our hash rate right now is about like 40-ish and so that's a Lisa so like from the P it was about 30 to 40 percent dropped so yeah yeah and just to explain it for people who maybe aren't super familiar when W was talking about the difficulty essentially the more computer power that there is on the network the harder it is to find a block like the more electricity that you need to put into it the harder the math problem gets and that's because they want this software was designed so that there would be a new block found of roughly every ten minutes but of course if you have more people and more computer power on it then you would just find them more quickly right so instead the difficulty will adjust to make it more difficult but what W Singh is the reverse has been happening where the difficulty is dropping but it only adjusts every two weeks and so during this period where the price has dropped there are a lot of people who cannot keep paying the same electricity to try to find the block rewards or to find the file to find the blocks to get the rewards and so those people are just having to quit and maybe sell their miners so do you think because as far as I understand I think also that whole cycle hurts Bitcoin in a different way which is that many of those miners may also sell their Bitcoin reserves which then further drives down the price or do you know if that's happening I feel like that has happening so like that has been happening for a while and because I for like every model of the Machine and so let's say if you're probably mining with the best machine for like Batman last night and so like asthma has like a certain level of like price point that can like break even so if you hit the break-even point and so you have to sell so you have to sell the quant that you have mine and just like to cover your operational expenses so like every model of the machine has like a different break-even price and so like the better of your machinist and by the lower their like break-even prices and so like that's why we have seen a lot this a relatively like outdated model like say for instance some early model from the Avalon like and like and and then probably from payment as well so many of them cannot just like cannot sustain and so for like many of them anything under 4000 so it's actually hitting their breaking even point and so like that's why they have to just like keep selling or otherwise you sighs stop completely well so I'm glad that you mentioned that main because they've been in the news apparently they're undergoing layoffs and potentially on a really large scale with rumors of the layoffs hitting more than fifty percent of staff and this comes in this period after they filed to have an initial public offering so can you tell us what you know about the layoffs like do you know how many people it which departments like any details you have there so before we get into the Pittman stuff I just want to add one thing about the mining issue which is it's been kind of interesting to see that like despite all of the negative stuff that Dennis whatever which is all totally true the coin is kind of just kept on chugging and so there's there's there was this theory that like you know whatever you described with a difficulty adjustment and also selling off reserves that you would end up with something called a mining death spiral where like as more and more miners abandon the chain the difficulty level adjustment happens too slowly and so no and combined and so even last miners mine and ends up just completely halting the chain and we haven't seen that happen and in fact we've actually seen the difficulty levels start going back up so the difficulty level hit like a low I want to say in early December and then it's been climbing ever since and it's the new difficulty adjustment that hit around December 31st was an awkward one so it seems like bitcoin is actually pretty resilient even to these really extreme price drops coupled with you know crazy regulatory action and a bunch of strife for miners and so I think in the long term it's actually pretty exciting for Bitcoin it's just kind of like yet another thing that was supposed to kill Bitcoin and didn't yeah it's things like that that remind me of how when I was first learning about it and I just I just felt like learning about the coin was just blowing my mind in so many ways and even all these years later when I realized that it works I was just like wow like that's kind of amazing that they figured that out I just feel like it's the longest game of I don't know just like something where you have to keep like a balloon afloat in the air or whatever like it just keeps going and it's kind of incredible I forget who said it but there was there was some great quote about like Bitcoin is the only thing that looks better in practice than in theory so interesting what's going on there um yeah so like all the things I know so that's actually not confirmed officially by like beaming and but like we have so because that the load like the local community is just so small and so we have pretty much know everything like even like before any of so even before any official thing came out so from like what I have heard so the lid off is that definitely more than 50% and I think it's probably hitting that 70% like just yeah so let's just to let you know about the total I like the total employee number of like bang bang like before the layoffs and so it's somewhere around 3000 so it's a huge company and because that based on their IPO fowling I remember it is around 2500 ish just based on the IPO fouling and so they have been hiring like crazy like even afterwards for like a few months and so that's why before the layoffs is around 3,000 and so from what so from what I heard us like they're like Beijing office so I wish you stare headquarters so it's going to be cut to 300 from over a thousand and so they have - engine office so there's like a stringent office and it's so I think exchange and office is going to cut from like 800 to like 200 so like one specific department that's been hitting really hard up so probably to you one is the PCH client department and like the other one is like a I Department and like the mining department it has a cheese up office and one is the mining pool and I think like that has been reorganized she somewhere to like 20 to 30 and so the other office is the south mining like basically like the whole mining farm and so doesn't that I'm not clear yet but I what I heard is that they have like a major reconstruction of the whole like south mining facility thing and so I've heard rumor that so they might be speaking out because that one problem with their like current IC so with their IP accounting is suicide majority of their like mining come it's very hard to put into this aerial accounting arm so regular accounting mechanism and like payment has been investing quite a bit in life so in mining facility and like just international mining farm in like Canada and England all over the world and so I have heard rumor saying that that they might be spinning and I'm not sure yet and the light definitely indeed Bitcoin cash client team and also the AI chip team has been hit really bad and when you say Bitcoin cash client you mean the software that's used it to Bitcoin cash yeah so like like like clients idea sounds like the I think like the proko team is okay but like anything on top of that coracle like difference and like pick on cash Waller like pick on cash on API and just anything on top of that and so they have like a separate team for that and so that has been hit really bad do you think it's their ideological shifted Bitcoin cash that has caused these problems um I think like that's definitely one of the reason because I know like Jhon just like jaehun bet on Bitcoin cash why happily just after they're like after the initial aha fork and I so I remember they have spent over like 2.5 billion just in buying Bitcoin cash so like after the first like half work and so they have acquired a lot of my pecan cash from their big composition and but like they have been just like a buy more like Bitcoin cash and so that's around 2.5 billion u.s. dollar and so I think that they are really ambitious on just pushing out between cash and on payment on on like pretty much everything smart comment we're taking a payment for their miners in Bitcoin cash right like you could only buy the mining equipment yeah yeah so that must have a huge amount of it and I'm sure the price of that is is down yep yeah I mean so one one thing that I thought was kind of interesting is like when when they were doing this IPO I asked some of my Chinese like PE friends what they thought of it they had read through the docs that got leaked and they were all like really shocked by the amount of Bitcoin cash on the balance sheet and I mean I do I do exclusively early stage investment so I don't really know much about this stuff and so I couldn't I couldn't have like a really solid take on like what this is normal and their take was that it was insane and that it represented a massive risk to the company and it seems like that that's played out there like you know holding that much Bitcoin on the balance sheet would be scary for a lot of these traditional investors and so when they see someone holding this you know alternative asset that hasn't even proved itself in an enormous like very relevant to the company amount I think that was really scary and I think they were right to be scared if you look now this really hasn't turned out well for them yeah and according to one report the regulators in Hong Kong which is where that main file to IPO they've indicated that they think it's too early for an encrypted company to go public so do you think I mean it just feels like if they cannot get this cash injection that they were expecting from going public what do you think the prospects are for bit main yeah also because I would never like any just that bear market or just at any like nuclear winter and I think only the top player are gonna survive and what even Big Bang has burned a lot of cash and I think they still have like decent egg roll and like especially especially after this a massive layoff and I think like this oh I think they will have for decent control on their like operation expenses and you say general expansion plan and I think that big man should be fine because that there are the biggest like a sick maker out there like they're like the biggest miner out there and so as long as like they stay that's the biggest one so they should be okay yeah yeah I mean so I would I would bet against I would bet against bit main like disappearing as a result of this but I think it was a massive step back for them and I think it opens up competition where they have there's a lot of like technical teams in China that are competing with it then and in some cases I think they actually have a stronger technical team than bit made but what they don't have is what W was mentioning like the massive economies of scale with you know foundries the TSMC and all the supply chain stuff and all the shipping stuff but I think at the point where bit man faces this huge setback in terms of their cash flow and in terms of their asset balance sheet it opens up you know a space for someone new to come in and I think that's actually something I really love about proof-of-work where it's this extremely chaotic extremely tied to the real world you go system and it becomes very hard for anyone to be a monopolistic power for too long like you just make one misstep and and now you're out and now someone else has taken over I think that's really valuable for the chain itself yeah yeah I just going back to Debbie's comments I just realized after I asked that about that mean that may be one of the reasons that they are doing these massive layoffs is because they kind of get the you know they've taken the temperature and realized that maybe they won't get their IPO and so this is their way of saving themselves so I also want to ask something else about the Chinese government which is I read this other report saying that the Chinese government wants to get Bitcoin miners to exit China okay sorry yeah or get Bitcoin miners in China to exit the industry so do you know if that's true and if so do you know if miners are complying yeah so as far as I know I don't think so like there's to a lot of like just I might not prison and so both like legally she said both legal and illegal on and so I think there's two operating okay like the right now the problem is like not from the government so it's like more about the just like economic in general because like the hydropower just like the hydroelectricity cost is actually not so s - so is that not that low back in China and many of these that Chinese minor are going to Russia going to Ukraine going to why the other part of the world and to find some like ship electricity like to further around so to further around their operation I think it's more economic trend Bella and not like garment ribbon yeah no I totally agree with that I think also the other like like everything I mean it's so much more nuanced than the general media reports so like there's not enough there's not like a ban on mining what there is is if you're on the national electricity grid they don't want you mining however a lot of miners have their own electricity and so we know some folks that used to be gold miners and they have their own hydropower and their own coal power that they were using to power our gold mining operation and they now switch like half of that over to Bitcoin the government doesn't probably doesn't even know about that and certainly doesn't care about it and so you see like you know when people say the Chinese government I think very rarely is that an accurate phrase and what they mean is like you know the province of Hunan government or like you know the central government or whatever but it's it's not a really a monolithic organization and there's this great phrase in Chinese schongau Huangdi yeah the the mountains are hot the mountains are tall and the emperor is far away and so honey there are lots of places in China like what the central government says is not necessarily what's going to happen immediately and I definitely I don't think there is some like Bing I don't think there's some like big push from the government to get rid of my house and because just like checking on my recent conversation with one of my big minor friends and and so like he's actually considering like buying some major dan just some buying the Dan out there just to produce like he's so like his own hydrate so hydroelectricity so I actually don't think that people are like moving out because of like garment ban yeah okay well cuz yeah I mean I guess so I you know like I said I saw that report that they were trying to do that and in general I feel like in the West we have this conception that everything is extremely top-down over there and that when the government wants to do something they can do it you know just like oh man I was going to use a very unfortunate phrase I was going to say they could steamroll over people to do that but let's not think about that so but one other reason that I thought maybe they might have a motivation to do that is there's been this talk of a crypto yuan do you have any sense of how much of that is just talk and how much of that is like an actual intention of the government so let's first of all PBOC just the People's Bank of China and so that is that a fad of like the fat equivalent and they have been so because I have chat with some of your insider there and so they're actually extremely knowledgeable about everything on crypto and all the way from protocol to like monetary policy to everything and so I think if they really want to roll it out and so they can probably do tomorrow and so it is --slide not about disability it is that more about timing and about application and about you know like overall sentiment etc um so I'm not sure like like I was specific timing that like they were made a decision but I think they have the full capability there to do it and like the UN and so I remember like the PBOC like there's like so they have like a research team so they actually recently published like a paper like talking about blotching and so that's one of the most insightful paper that I have seen that published by any Chinese player and in one of the solo one of the author of that paper Reina is actually the chief economists of pygmy so I think he join I I think like he joined bit me after he published that paper and I also like there's one company and back in China and so invested by Sequoia China I remember and and I think also China Merchants Bank and so they have been disseised PBOC in-house blotching engineering team and so like the founder used to be working for if you're in foundation so I think like the technical capability is so it's like definitely there so it's like more about like what are the specific application and like how to synthesize the whole infrastructure because like the whole banking infrastructure back in China is kind of chaos so it's that pretty chaotic at like difference and if you so if you have saving on one difference in like China Merchants Bank and so China Merchants ban does not share the database with so with the China Construction Bank so I think there's a lot of this like data synchronization problem that I have to figure out like before they can go out by the whole just a digital cash or just a digital yan and but but but like just have purely from like cryptocurrency perspective like I think their talents and like you said competence so is that definitely at a pretty high level so we're running out of time but I just want to ask you guys one last question which is I know there are a lot of people in the Western crypto community who say that one motivation that Chinese citizens could have to use Bitcoin is to escape the surveillance state and things like this Social Credit System and whatever how much do you think that motivates actual Chinese people what like who you know who used Bitcoin or trade Bitcoin or other not at all not at all I think it's yeah so like nobody actually care about that credit isn't at all I first saw like just that first of all and just that people do not associate cryptocurrency with that thing and then people were only a little for that whole that whole thing is like such an overblown like faith yeah it's like a fake news story like the Western Western media loves reporting on this credit system and like no one I know in China even like knows what it is or if they do it's like it's not it's not very well integrated most people don't use it it doesn't touch most people's lives but this is like really scary dystopian sounding thing doesn't touch most people's lives like I mean like you you must know for instance if somebody goes missing one of the first things investigators do is they look at their financial transactions to try to figure out what they've been doing where they've been stuff like that and so in in China where so much of financial transactions happen in this cashless way on these apps that are surveilled by the state like don't you think people have an awareness so so so to clarify what I'm saying is the the sesame credit social credit score thing is an overblown story that basically doesn't exist I mean it exists but it's just not a big deal the surveillance state stuff you're talking about is totally real and totally exists and definitely does touch people's lives I I would think those two things are totally distinct Chinese people aren't motivated to use Bitcoin for that reason like they don't connect the two no yeah yeah they're not and it's just I mean they're not a they're not that worried about the surveillance and B and I mean I would say from a factual perspective Bitcoin doesn't get you doesn't get you much in that report it would be and I think I mean even given those things like I think crypto is pretty far from being a really robust payments layer so actually like IV and I chat with the folks who run we chats or like run ten cents fund and and one of the figures I was super curious about is like what's the what's the TPS you know the transactions per second that we chat seeds and I think look we're asked not to share the numbers but it's it's insane like the amount of transaction volume that something like WeChat sees especially during peak times is like mind-blowing and there's no crypto system as of yet that's getting even close to that I mean the only guys that that I've seen that kind of have the closest chance of being an actual payment system or the mobile coin folks and and you know that'll be something where like it'll work as a payments network if everyone in China adopted it tomorrow though it would collapse like all the other ones and so I think this idea that like people in China are you know jumping on crypto as a as a payments thing or as like a way to avoid financial surveillance is pretty amiss guided but I do know what they are using it for is to avoid capital controls and that's that's yeah I think I saw so there are two primary purpose of light using crypto one is as an investment asset people want to get rich like simple asset and second nature said moving capital out just I'm moving RMB asset into crypto asset and then the first transfer to probably US dollar asset so that's not a cheap primary purpose that we have seen by Chinese to go are using crypto yeah I think so I mean I know we're running out of time but I think sort of one one thing I think it's really important to understand just from a sort of fundamental perspective about crypto and I think it really informs dubby in my perspective on what's happening in China is that like all of these systems have to first function as a store of value before they can start functioning as a unit of account or as a medium of exchange and so I think Bitcoin has done very well at becoming this sort of store of value use case and we're seeing that you know where our sort of value doesn't mean you never transact it means you know you're not buying coffee with this thing but if you want to move a lot of money offshore to go buy a house in America or something you would use it and I think we're going to start seeing sort of the medium of exchange use case come about in like you know mid 2019 early 2021 projects like mobile coin ship I think stellar is looking into stuff like this and I think we're gonna start seeing that but I think right now that's just it's not the reality on the ground and so as a result it's not how people how people use these systems in China or anywhere all right well this has been an incredibly fascinating discussion they had a bunch more questions for you I think maybe I will see if you guys can just write a few answers for me by email for those additional questions and I'll put them on my website for people to listen to or to read I'm so like when I started doing the podcast I would often talk about the readers and then I'd have to be like the listeners and now I've like switched the other thing but anyway um so yeah like I said this isn't such a great discussion where can people learn more about you guys and primitive ventures so we have primitive ventures for the for the fund there's not a lot of information there but there's contact info if anyone wants to say hi and then double you and I are both pretty active on Twitter so I'm wheat Pond on Twitter whta tpo MD and www are eight yeah just like just just
