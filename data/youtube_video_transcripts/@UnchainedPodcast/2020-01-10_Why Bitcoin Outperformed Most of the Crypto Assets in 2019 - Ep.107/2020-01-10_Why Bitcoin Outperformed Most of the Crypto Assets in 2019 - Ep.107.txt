guest is nate majorie senior research analyst at coin metrics welcome Nate hey Laurie thank you so much for having me so although now we're ten days into 2020 I thought coin metrics had a great post summarizing where the major crypto networks are as of the end of 2019 and you I believe we're the lead author on that post I wanted to ask you kind of what were the main factors by which you analyzed the networks and what were your top takeaways yeah I wrote a pretty long Poe about just looking back at kind of main trends of 2019 over four main categories so evaluation is the first one usage and adoption is the second and then also looking at economics and then lastly security in health so basically for each of those four kateri categories we looked at five or so different metrics and just looked at the trends across the year for about 18 different crypto assets so there were a lot of different takeaways which I'm sure will dive into but I think the biggest one that I want to start off with is just Bitcoin Bitcoin outperforms over the year even compared to most the other major crypto assets Bitcoin was up about 90 percent over the year compared to etherium which was actually a little bit down it was down about 5% on the year and I think that's really interesting to note because this is one of the first years where we've really seen that sort of separation between Bitcoin and etherium and some of the major other major crypto assets and when you say that you mean by price by price and by market cap yeah and so why do you think that was and what does that mean yeah so I think a lot of it is because we were in a bear market this past year so we've typically seen a Bitcoin outperform a little bit of bear markets people tend to consolidate and sell some of the smaller coins but I think we're also seeing some more evidence that Bitcoin is really being used as a store of value and kind of interestingly we've written a lot about this year about whether bitcoin is or isn't a safe haven asset and there a lot of different opinions on that but I think we're actually starting to see some real compelling data that people might be viewing Bitcoin as more of a safe haven asset and we're actually doing some research now to kind of work out Bitcoin is reacting its the recent events in Iran but Bitcoin has been kind of correlated with gold a lot this year while aetherium and some of the other smaller coins have not something also that was a kind of a little bit more nuance to look at the market cap factor or figure is that you looked at something called realized cap how do you define that and when you analyze networks based on that what do you see so realize cap is a metric that we created a coin metrics so basically market market cap most people are aware of but it's a pretty simple calculation to get market cap you just take the total supply and multiply it by the current price for realized cap instead of multiplying by the current price we look at the price at the time at which each individual coin last moved on chain so for example for like Bitcoin we'll look at each coin individually and if say there were a thousand Bitcoin that last move when the price of Bitcoin was five thousand dollars those one thousand Bitcoin will all be priced at five thousand dollars instead of the current market price then we take the aggregate of all those and that's how you get the realized cap so basically instead of just instead of valuing each coin the same it's taking into account okay if this coin has sat dormant for ten years then we're gonna value it differently than all the other coins well and one other thing that was interesting was then what you did was you created this other metric or you analyzed on this other metric called market value to realize value which you called em vrv so what is that and then how do the different networks compare on em vrv yes so MVR V is market value to realize value so basically it's just the ratio of market cap to realize cap so I mentioned how we kind of calculate realized cap but there are different ways you can interpret it the way we usually describe realized cap is we think of it as kind of an aggregate cost basis for crypto investors so basically the amount of money that people are paying as their initial investment so if you if you look at it with that in mind then the market cap is more of a signal of what the market is valuing it out while the realized cap is more a signal of how much investors are actually putting into the asset so if you look at the ratio of mark got to realize cap MVR V there are different ways to interpret it but the way we usually look at it is whether whether investors are in profit or at a loss so let me explain exactly what that means so if you have M D RV that's above one that means the market cap is greater than the realized cap that means that the average investor if they were to sell they'd be selling at a profit because their cost basis the amount that they invested into the cryptocurrency is lower than what the current prices are so they can sell for a profit if the M vrv is below one then average investor is likely in the red so if they were to sell they would be selling at a loss so you can look at M vrv to get kind of a quick gauge of the health of the investor base of a network if you have a high M vrv everyone is feeling pretty good if you have a low M vrv then people are probably in a lot of pain and so how do the different crypto networks compare by M V RV so Bitcoin right now is above one Bitcoin I believe is about one point three big ones realize cap actually grew this year it grew about 27% while etherion drops and ripple and Bitcoin cash also drops between 15 and 20 percent so in terms of MV RB Bitcoin at the end of year was about 1.3 a theorem was about 0.61 so again that generally means that bitcoin investors are in a little bit of a better spot but an alternative kind of interpretation of that is it could mean that that aetherium is a little more undervalued compared to Bitcoin and vice-versa so right now the market is valuing aetherium a lot lower than kind of investors are valuing it based on what they're putting into it so there are different ways to interpret it but in general I think if you if you look at the ways it's kind of trending you can see whether investors are are kind of selling at a profit or just kind of selling at or capitulating and selling more at a loss and let's move on to stable coins you wrote that the market cap for tether on aetherium by almost 3,700 percent over the past year - a total of nearly 2.3 billion meanwhile tetherin omni that market cap fell by nearly 39 percent to a total of about 1.6 billion and I actually had previously interviewed you're calling Jacob phrenic about this and at the time we actually weren't sure why Heather unnethe earring was started going so fast this past year because it's been around since 2017 so I wondered you know if by now you guys had any more insight into why there's so much momentum behind tether on aetherium and why it overtook tether and Omni and market cap yeah heather has been a really crazy ride this year so yeah as you mentioned tether on etherium just blew by tether on Omni this past year to the point where if you're in tether is not being used much more than on each other another kind of interesting update in that story is now heather has also been launched on Tron and also just recently on liquid so now tether is just kind of all over the place we're actually also doing a research piece about how tether is kind of morphing into this multi-headed Hydra that's almost going to be unstoppable and just like popping up on all these different chains but yeah I think as far as we could tell a lot of the move on to a theorem was was due to exchanges switching from the Omni version to the etherium version the usage on the FDM version has also gone up so it's it's probably kind of being used more maybe in defy but to be honest we haven't really seen any hard evidence for that so yeah it's mostly probably driven by the exchanges but like I said it's now also morphing into all these other outlets as well all right we're gonna discuss a little bit more about stable coins and also look at usage but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible are you

starting from January 15th 2020 sign up on the exchange now and stay tuned for more listings back to my conversation with Nate Matri of coined metrics so we were just talking about tether but I believe there's also some movement among some of the other stable coins what are you noticing elsewhere in stable coin land yes so this has been a big year for stable coins overall tether is still by far the most dominant stable coin in terms of market cap we also saw a lot of growth for Paxos we saw a lot of gross growth for USD coin which is USD see also die you know switch over to multi collateral died this year so they saw a lot of good progress I think you SCC is an interesting one it's grown by a lot this year a lot of that has also been driven by defy on us DC has started been to be incorporated more in defy this year mostly on aetherium so like compounds started incorporated in u.s. CC which rivals die a little bit but in general we're seeing a lot more usage shift over to the stable coins and especially with the with transfer value transfer value on us CT aetherium the tether version of aetherium actually overtook the transfer volume on aetherium this year which shows that people really are using stable coins as kind of a method of payment or medium of exchange at least and they're being transferred a lot more than kind of the layer 1 assets like during the bitcoin interesting that also i feel like him at some change in usage but another way that you looked at usage was by looking at daily active addresses and you saw that that actually decreased for four assets which of the four assets and how much and why yes so we saw active addresses increase for all of the assets in our that we've looked at except for for the forward ripple aetherium a stellar and C cash for Ripple stellar and C cash active addresses all decreased about 50% over the year aetherium was actually relatively flat it only decreased about one percent but as I mentioned all the other all the other assets the active addresses actually increase and one other interesting thing about that is those four assets where the active addresses decreased all had down years in term of market cap and price so I'm kind of hopefully optimistic that that means that valuation is kind of being driven a little bit more by this usage or at least is connected a little bit more but in my you know who knows if it's correlation or causation but yeah I mean it's it's basically showing that the usage of these chains is starting to be reflected at least a little bit and the valuation of the chains it would be nice to think that there's like a reason for some of the price movements yeah so you also broke out number the number of addresses with a balance of at least ten dollars and you know choose to separate out no address says you know with that threshold amount and when you do that what do you see yes so we actually have metrics at core metrics for addresses with balances ranging from all different amounts of from one dollar up to I believe ten million dollars so there but we specifically looked at addresses with balance of greater equal to ten dollars because we use that as kind of a proxy for retail investors it's a large enough amount where it's probably not dust account you know for only looking at addresses that have any balance a lot of those just have tiny dust balances so we make it big enough where we avoid that but also small enough where it could be kind of an average investor what one caveat about that though so when we're looking at these addresses it doesn't necessarily directly mean that that's the amount of users there are so for example for Bitcoin on the year there were an average of about twelve point two million addresses that had a balance of at least ten dollars but that doesn't necessarily mean there were twelve point two million individual users since a lot of users have multiple addresses but but it does serve I think as a proxy just for general usage of kind of more retail type investors and also you looked at transaction fees what a transaction fees tell you about the different networks so transaction fees is another really interesting one because I think that transaction fees is actually one of the best metrics to look at when you're looking at real usage because transaction fees are there a lot of different things that go into it but if transaction fees are going up it basically means that the space in individual blocks on the blockchain is at a premium and people are willing to pay more and more to to use that blockchain so for example you know a lot there's always a lot of discussion about our fees a good thing is our low fees a good thing is it better - high fees a lot of block chains have kind of launched on the premise that they are a low fee blockchain but in the end I think fees are actually a really important indicator of the health of a blockchain and on that note we really only saw two block chains this year that any sort of significant fees and those two block chains as you might affect our as you might expect are Bitcoin and aetherium so to give you an idea looking at the total daily fees for both Bitcoin and aetherium Bitcoin had an average of about four hundred twenty-six thousand dollars worth of daily fees aetherium had an average of about ninety five thousand dollars of daily fees the next closest blockchain after that was litecoin which has about 1,000 dollars worth of daily fees this was on average over 20:19 so it's just a huge gap well that big point obviously is so yeah it's still in the weed as well but yeah I think like I said I think that's actually a sign of real usage or at least real demand for usage where the other chains are really far behind yeah yes yes I feel like this is a theme for our husband a theme for quite a long time all right so going forward into 2020 what will you be looking for like what trends are you watching you know what questions do you have what are you you know curious will happen yeah I'm definitely gonna be watching this trends kind of I mentioned at the top of the show about whether Bitcoin and etherium stay separated in terms of price and market cap I think that's gonna be really fascinating to watch going forward especially as etherium kind of transitions towards etherium 2.0 knock on wood hopefully it it starts making progress this year but I think that would be really fascinating to watch I'm also just kind of more on a meta level I'm really interested to watch this year if we really do see some of these kind of crypto fundamentals starting driving more valuation and investment strategies which I'm hopeful for but I think we're starting to get it to a good place for crypto where we're starting to converge on some of these important metrics like fees and like fees to revenue ratio for example which we also included in the report but I think converging on these metrics is going to be a really healthy thing for the crypto industry and kind of all getting on the same page about what metrics we should be paying attention to and hopefully making kind of a healthier atmosphere for investors in general and just to go back to when you said that you would be interested to see if the coin and aetherium is market caps remain uncoupled is that because you're saying that like previously they moved in tandem simply because like retail investors would get in and just buy anything they'd heard about or something like that is that what you mean or yeah yeah yeah I think in the past you know we've seen it we see most Kryptos move in tandem but yeah I think a lot of that is just because retail investors just kind of pile they either look for something that looks cheap or isn't due or kind of trendy and it also I think it's also important to note that it does change kind of depending on the market conditions you know in more bull markets we see people investing in all sorts of all coins and different different coins and bear markets people do kind of tend to consolidate and go more towards Bitcoin but I think that that's part of why it'll be interesting to keep an eye on at this upcoming year especially if we do hopefully get into a little more of a bull market to see if that starts changing because I think it's actually in a way it is a good thing if it does separate because that's kind of a sign that investors are becoming more educated and kind of evaluating each chain individually instead of just lumping them all together all right yeah well I think that would be a good trend to see more education ok well it's been great having you on the show thanks for being uh nun confirmed ok thank you so much Laura don't forget next up is the news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break cryptid outlaw is run by crypto og is based in New York who are operating in the crypto space back in 2013 and accept crypto as payment one of the partners a Creek Hellman is known for drafting a bill submitted to Congress in 2014 aimed at exempting on shame

operate a FinTech business have a dispute with some person or business involving crypto or need crypto related legal advice email info at calment law that's ke l ma n dot law or go to the website at wwlp.com it was a bit of an uneventful week so this week's recap will be short and sweet first up telegrams seriously distances itself from grams Wow someone's got the message from the SEC telegram publisher notice that practically had how he was here a graffiti'd on it the subheadings alone are pretty indicative the first subheading nobody can buy or sell grams yet practically blares our tokens are not tradable until the network is five the second subheading tun will be decentralized and maintained by third parties says we do not satisfy the fourth prong of the Howey test and I could go on but the rest of the subheadings hammer on that last prong the notice then finishes one telegram is under no obligation and makes no promise or commitment to ever establish a ton foundation or similar entity in the future - at the time of the anticipated launch of the ton blockchain telegrams ton wallet application is expected to be made available solely on a standalone basis and will not be integrated with the telegram messenger service you can practically hear Kix leaders well kicking themselves for not doing this plus a court-ordered telegram which is battling as you see to explain why it should not have to explain how it spent the 1.7 billion dollars it raised from the token sale next headline a former backed CEO now on committee overseeing CFTC file this under do they not care about optics former backed CEO Kelly Leffler who was recently sworn in as a US senator has been appointed to the Senate agricultural committee sounds like an appropriate placement for Leffler who grew up on a farm except that the same committee oversees the CFTC which is the regulator for the derivatives on her husband's exchange ice in a statement Leffler said i will recuse myself if needed on a case-by-case basis next headline the efficient market hypothesis and the bitcoin having as we all enter 2020 a number of us are wondering what effect will the bitcoin having have this year on the price nick carter explores the efficient market hypothesis as applied to the bitcoin having his conclusion is priced in he writes quote anyone with an interest in bitcoin has been aware of the supply trajectory from inception supply was encoded in the very first implementation that Satoshi released to the world in July and not July in January 2009 long schedule changes in the rate officials do not constitute new information any presumed demand side reactions to the having catalyst can also be anticipated by sophisticated funds who have a strong incentive to front run investor optimism next headline sees 2020 New Year's letter on all the by Nance things Qiang ping Chau or cz the CEO of Finance wrote a newsletter that sizes what the company was up to in 2019 and where it's going and it's worth of read just to see the sheer number of products and services finance is launching and to experience that sensation of seeing the future one interesting part of the letter is when he describes how both centralized and decentralized entities use the name finance he writes quote just because something has the name finance and it does not mean it is operated by the centralized entity by Nance comm he then explains he doesn't view centralization and decentralization as a binary thing but more of a spectrum giving his examples of things they're more and then less to centralized with Bitcoin being at one end of the spectrum aetherium a little less decentralized since the creator is known and finally by Nance chain which is more centralized since it has not open sourced its code and also features just a small number of validators next headline Maalik dough is 2019 Year in Review Maalik Dow kicked off what ended up being a year of many revivals in dows and its end of year recap is a nice way to see all the developments even if they're small in scale on in one go here's a selection of the highlights listed at the top Moloch Dow launches on Valentine's Day at eath Denver in May Metta cartel created the first Fork of Moloch in August a grant for yang Dao passed in August or rocky Darrell forked Mallick to fund Def Con events in September Mariano Conte built Salado in November to Mike Rossi Earth announced a quadratic voting for and in December meta cartel began the for-profit venture down until I went to write this I missed that it also noted that Amin Soleimani the founder came on Unchained to talk about Malik Dow and it listed that as a highlight of the past year which is hilarious in my book I don't know if I'd consider that an accomplishment but I do urge everyone who missed that episode of check it out as it was a really great discussion and I included it in the best of 2019 episode and for other people interested in down there are also a few other episodes such as the one with Mariano Conte and Peter Pan of Salado and Medicare tell Dao they both discussed aus and then the other one o was the one with Glen Walla and Santiago Seri of democracy earth and quadratic voting is discussed there so I will link all of these in the show notes finally fun bits coin Jazeera delivers the perfect Nakamoto org spoof Butera Norg coin Jazeera delivered
