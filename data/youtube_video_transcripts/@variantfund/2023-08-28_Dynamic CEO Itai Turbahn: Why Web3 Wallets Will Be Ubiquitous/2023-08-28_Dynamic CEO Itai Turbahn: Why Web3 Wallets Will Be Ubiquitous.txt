foreign [Music] how's it going thanks so much thanks so much for being here I know it's super late where you're at so I appreciate you being here so much um you have an incredible like resume with like a bunch of startup experience and now you're co-founding a company called Dynamic so would love to hear more about yourself and and what you guys are building we can start with that sounds awesome thanks for having me sorry I lost my voice uh yesterday so I apologies as I like cough Midway through the conversation uh but thank you guys uh for having me I really appreciate it I am in a very late hour here I'm still in Israel for another couple days uh so it's just before midnight um and uh the good thing is my kids are asleep so no one will yeah but the bad thing is my dog is usually awake for an hour a day and it's usually this time so if you hear about your barking apologies in advance but I'll do I'll do the following I'll introduce myself real quick maybe to your point talk for one minute about what dynamic is at a high level and then we can kind of talk through kind of details and talk through kind of you know the journey Etc but very quick um you know myself and my co-founder Yoni uh both grew up in Israel served in the Israel Defense Forces Army intelligence uh just like most Israelis probably in Med uh we actually did our undergrad together at MIT that's where we already and I met they're like two Israeli undergrads at MIT every year so we have to be friends it wasn't really a choice but we have known each other for about 17 years we've been trying to start companies for a very long time together uh Yoni mostly worked on the engineering side myself on the product side and you know we worked uh in multiple and of high growth companies and it was very clear to us that it's time for us to start our own company now we bought our first Bitcoin in probably 2012 and uh if you were to go back and record uh the conversations between you need me over the last 10 years you would see it in about 80 of them are crypto related so it was very very clear to us that we're gonna start a company within crypto uh and so end of 2021 we decided that that it that is it that is it that it is time and so we found it Dynamic we raised our seed from AC a16z and first run capital and Solana and circle and a lot Gill and a bunch of other uh folks and uh the you know we launched our closed beta in the summer we launched our open Beta in September in March and the kind of the the one sentence version about Dynamic is we're essentially building an auth zero for wild base authentication so we kind of think that if we fast forward five years everything in your pocket it is an app on the website essentially becomes a wallet and you can do a lot of really cool things with wallets right they're login devices their payment devices their communication devices and so that will change the way you interact with sites and apps instead of email based account creation you would have wallet-based login and developers that want to support that or want to support all the cool functionality that happens after login we'll probably need developer tools to do that that's where essentially Dynamic comes in so that's what we're building essentially and all-in-one authentication platform our customers today and sorry this one's the longest intro of all time so apologies in a second I'll stop talking but um our customers today include folks like Flipside crypto or Doodles or sound.xyz or token proof so if you go to any of those sites click login you will essentially see the dynamic experience um that's a very long spiel bad blank we are awesome well I have a bunch of questions I want to ask about Dynamic and like the wallet as the server space as a whole but something you said really stuck out to me it's like oh you feel like basically all of the applications on the internet are going to be wallets and they're going to be like portals to your transactions essentially so I guess tell me more about that do you think the future is going to be a world in which every consumer crypto app is going to have their own app specific wallet and if so how do you think about interoperability when it comes to that yeah so the the reason first I say everything becomes a wallet is because and this is unrelated to crypto there's if you talk to any company every company technically wants to be a fit tech company over time and wants to implement Financial Services into their application or into their website now wallets are inherently if you think about it they're essentially super apps right there are payment devices again and you could do communication one day through them through an xmtp or a while connect and you can store things through Davidson verifiable credentials and so about nfts and you can do memberships they're inherently uh super apps in the box and they come in two forms right they come in a branded form like the made a mask and rainbows Etc but they also come in in embedded form and so what that inherently means is if you fast forward five years what I think happens is that you're gonna wake up in the morning and if you look at the homepage of your iPhone or Android and look at all the applications there a large number of them are just going to have a new tab which is a wallet tab it might not be called the world that you might not necessarily need to know it's a wallet but it's going to have all this cool infrastructure that you as uh and consumer can use to communicate with anyone to essentially send money to anyone in any other app to authenticate to a site and interact with that site and so it's this really cool value proposition that you can give your consumers whether the web three consumers or Not by embedding it into an app and now we're at the other side of that we're essentially on the side of well if that happens then every website will want to interact with those wallets right but the vision is very much that this is kind of this you know the fastest way to turn into every app into a thin fintech app uh very very quickly and so that that's where the vision is from yeah that makes a lot of sense it seems like you guys are definitely working to increase like onboarding us essentially and I think that's like a huge bottleneck in crypto right now so I'm actually curious to the like a question for the fellows like what are some of the biggest file next to onboarding you guys have noticed in your projects whether it's for like customers or developers or users you can just put it in the chat and then I'll get to it after but yeah super curious about that I guess like one thing that I'd love to do is take a step back a time like can you walk us through how you view like the wallet and the wallet as a service landscape because for me it seems like there's like a million and one providers right now there's a dozen projects working on this project and it would be helpful to hear from you like hired the game at the space how it all fits together and kind of what part of the stack Dynamic plays in yeah absolutely so maybe I'll actually start with what part of a stack Dynamic plays in because then it can kind of reflect on Walt as a service and how that works but we the way to think about Dynamic is kind of a combination between an Authentication platform and the orchestration platform so unlike an on your uh that does that has to do email login and then passwordless login and task keys and social login Dynamic has to handle and if the vertical first meaning login then a wallet Creations for those that don't have it in authorization then essentially communication information collection etc etc so we're at depth first platform versus prep first but the way we work is we actually are inherently like a Marketplace so we work with a lot of providers we don't just do things on our own but rather you are able with a click to say hey I want an enable Dynamic and I want to spin up across mint wallet or I want to spin up a magic wallet or I want to spin up a blocked or wallet so you as a developer get choice now coming back to the wall to the service category to your point uh and everyone on this call probably knows it there are a lot of cool startups out there kind of focusing on Walt Disney service and I think we can divide them into you know we can divide them across multiple lenses lens number one is their customer Target customer a subset of them Target dapps right those would be uh cool companies like Caps or again webcreased or or magic right and their goal is to say hey when someone logs in and doesn't have a wallet let's spin up a Wallace order a second category targets applications right and their goal is to say well if you're um you know an etoro can you add a wallet as a tab in your application and be essentially an identity provider and those are companies like portal and companies uh you know like coinbase wireless service etc etc where and sometimes webs we are where they target a different audience right so you can either activate a wallet on the um kind of you know create an embedded wallet that interacts with things or create an ad hoc wallet in the DAP itself so that's kind of one lens to think about it the second language things through and by the way then you go into the Enterprise while doing the service right so the uh fire blocks the fortifies the the finessens ETC right and there's a really cool breakdown of those for anyone whoever wants to play while to service trivia we can kind of spend some time uh you know naming all the names of world service companies but the other legs to think through and again apologies for the very long answer is the technology lens which is what technology these wallet and service providers use and there's no kind of you know one winner take all answer right so some of them use uh MPC and within NPC some of them use Shamir Seeker chair which is older technology some security risks of the key being kind of you know recreated at a specific point of time some of them use threshold signatures and within threshold signatures some of them have built their own some of them use an open source tool then outside the NPC land some of them essentially just use regular kind of you know uh bat you know uh just seed phrase based key management and then do account abstraction on top of that and those are companies like zero Dev or you know some tools that Stack Up by economy offer and some of them take a complete different approach and say well none of this actually matters let's up optimize for user experience and then there are companies like magic link or TurnKey then essentially use different components of aws's KMS or kind of secure enclaves in order to do key management and so short answer is you can look at the short answer to my very long answer is that you can look at the kind of target audience lines or you can look at the technology lens um it kind of you know create a Matrix Matrix of some sort where some of these companies play so it's a really interesting field where a lot of these folks with slightly similar technology Target very different parts of the market right this makes a lot of sense I think it's I'm glad you mentioned MPC and account abstraction smart contract while it's all of it because that's kind of like very politicized and controversial right now like which one is better than the other the way I see it is that they're definitely not mutually exclusive and you can have like a combination of all of these Technologies to kind of get what you need out of it so I'd love to hear from your perspective like how is dynamic thinking about these two or three Primitives and like how do you see them all working together and how do you enable that functionality through Dynamic yeah to your point if if uh if folks have seen the vitalik tweet from the last 24 hours yeah one wishes that we could live in the world of Kumbaya like no arguments about NPC versus the cap attraction but we here we are right the the way we think about it is that there's no one solution that's a winner but rather there are solutions there are a fit for your specific need right and one more lines we did talk about is the custody lens right custodial versus non-custodial the way Dynamic works and I'm very biased here because you know we do this for a living and I kind of think our strategy is correct is we let developers pick and choose so you can set up Dynamic do the full user management authentication multi-wild linking uh email based login and then choose cross mint as your Walton service provider and optimize for custody and nft handling or you can say I actually want to treat magic and optimize for Mom custody but then spin up in zero Dev wallet on top of it so the ability within Dynamic is actually kind of imagine it for anyone who's ever seen our dashboard imagine it is a kind of set of toggles that you can toggle on and off for Your Right Use case so there is no one to technology that is the winning technology right there the technology that's right for your use case if you're um you know a financial type service you probably really care about long custody or you really care about custody right but you have very strong opinions right so for you um you know the model the magic provides might not be the right model and a model that you know a portal provides might be the right model right so they're a lot more a turnkey with uh you know provides might be the right model question there really quick I think it's great that you mentioned like all of these different um optionalities because like actually the last maybe two weeks we've been talking a lot about like the modular stack when it comes to block space but there's also just like modularity in in general when it comes to this stuff and you're basically creating a custom choice for what fits your users needs I guess my question is do you feel like they're smart defaults like how should app developers be thinking about this because they're thinking about their users they're thinking about their core um like use case and I feel like if they have to make all of these decisions about like key signing I feel like that is that is a lot to wrap their heads around that's right and look I I will I think you need to kind of divide the world into folks that already started their companies and folks that are starting their companies right some of them have made decisions right and are stuck with them and now have to orchestrate things around them right so if you have a million users on Magic OS you can't wake up in the morning and move to coinbase while doing the service it's not practical for you right but to your point um you know I have I've spent the last 15 minutes right naming a name dropping the largest amount of wall of his service providers out there uh and there's going to be some called consolidation so in our approach you're not going to see 50 providers to choose from but rather you're probably going to see like four or five and we're going to explain um you know as a tree of some sort the logic of when to choose white right because to your point the other risk uh specifically of wallet and service providers and it is that there are a lot of early stage startups out there and I say this with all you know respect like being one right but um as it you know as customers have to or developers have to also consider the going out of business uh path for some of these companies where you have a non-custodial wallet that was generated through them and now you're pretty much stuck right because you can't take action on behalf of the user right and so you know to your point I don't think we're gonna offer 50. I think we're going to offer four or fives and we're gonna vet them on behalf of the customer or in our case a developer so the developer can go from not knowing anything about this to setting everything up in two minutes right there's the the fact that we're and sorry again about the very long answer here but the fact that when we're in this room talking about like NPC versus you know other options it's it's really weird right because at like no one's like you're it's like we're literally talking about like which type of math do you choose to like secure your keys and that's like a very low level conversation that I don't think the next set of you know developers need to have yeah totally agree I mean this is where I feel like a lot of the intense conversations that are happening on Twitter kind of going into this like you really just know what you want your users to do you have like an attention with this transaction um how it happens shouldn't really like matter and I feel like key signing is like very similar um I think Carson you had a great question around like balancing ux and security do you want to unmute and ask it yeah sure um that was simply really the question is kind of how do you balance user experience and security and how does it differ from uh you know authentication and web 2 because I think one I think user experience in crypto is pretty bad but I think people are familiar enough crypto users are fine with it but it's not good for onboarding like the next editor so how do you think about that especially as like the best security would be lock everyone out so obviously there's a balance yeah the best security is now to go online right but I I think look I I I've I've spent a lot of time like staring at a wall and thinking through this and I I divide the world into short term and long term and I'm being very like yeah abstract but I kind of the way I'm thinking about this is that I go back and I think through in like the the 90s did Amazon have to teach people about creating an email address right like because if you think about like you would go to Amazon and what percent of folks would actually have an email address at that point no not 100 right like my parents my grandparents would not have an email address right and so and then you would say well that's really terrible ux you show up by their website and like you have to like sign up with a thing and then it asks you for an email address and you have no idea what that is we're at that stage of Wallace right which inherently means and then like AOL cancel comes along and abstracts that and like all that fun stuff um and I'm getting my dates confused but I think that's overall accurate we're the same stage with wallets which means that in the short term if you're like an Amazon you have to create ways to abstract away the like teaching someone about an email address until later on in the process and that's where like embedded wallets at the DAP level right there are ways to essentially defer while creation while conversation and just show you what's familiar log in with email login with social Etc but if you fast forward like Amazon right now if you go and you like have never used amazon.com before they assume that you have an email address there's an an ongoing assumption that you have an email address and you'll be fine right so if you fast forward 10 20 years we'll assume that you have a wallet and so the entire concept of creating that wallet ad hoc for you I think goes away because it doesn't like everything on your app on your foamy cups of water now in terms of security um I would say that it really depends like security of what meaning there there are some Services where custody is critical at which point you can optimize for ux because you log in but someone owns the you know controls your asset but if if there's non-custody then you have to establish things that you the end user knows that no one else could know like essentially uh a share of NPC or pass keys that encrypt stuff right so um they're the trade-off between security and custody is usually a trade-off a little bit around uh sorry Security in ux is usually a trade-off a little bit around questions of custody awesome um another question someone asked is around like kyc and regulations of Boris do you want to unmute and ask it I also have something to tag on to it at the end yeah absolutely hey thank you for you know for explaining everything so far and uh if I were an application that receives uh a signed in and authenticated uh client request uh basically you're saying hey you know this person is a tie and this person is actually tying at somebody pretending to be Thai uh is it possible that you can also say and in the real world this attack is indeed a tie and not somebody else pretending to be tied that you know happen to create account on his behalf and it doesn't have to be you know uh explicit it can be completely Anonymous right and and you just say hey trust this person is real person and you're not gonna know who but we know this person is actually always legitimate player yeah I I I'll give you the super honor sense right which is first if you look at our comparable in web 2 like not zero and you go to their Marketplace they have Integrations with all the kyc providers like on Fido and you know Cognito and like all these folks and you can talk or jumio and you can toggle it in and it pops up as a particle in web 3 over the last year and a half there are a lot of really cool startups that started thinking about tokenized kyc where I inherently write the ideal flow for dynamic is exactly what you described which is right we handle the full UI right so you click log in and it pops it up and you log you log in with your metamask in in an Ideal World I check whether you have a verified credential um tied to your wallet that is a tokenized kyc and they let you in based on that that's like the idea the the the problem is that we had over the last year about like 10 or 15 tokenized kyc startups that started and a lot of them unfortunately pivoted away from that right so broad on cuadrata and violet and like all these really cool companies that I think realized and they would know a lot more about this than me and I hope I'm not misspeaking but outside looking in I think they realized they're a little bit too early to Market and there's a not enough kind of Market pull for like tokenized kyc different good example is circle and coinbase and now it's Verity right which is like their token or their kyc tokenization with verified credentials right they had an entire thing around hey if you verified on hvide or identity verified on coinbase and we issue that to you as a verifiable credential that you can carry around with you so what that inherently means to me is that this is a great idea but in two years I know in three years uh I haven't seen out of the and I've talked to a lot of customers over the last year and a half and of all those conversations I want to say I had one where they asked for kyc we do by the way integrate with chain analysis right so if you're a D5 platform you can toggle onto analysis with a single click and we would run every address through ofac uh if you're us-based and need to kind of have that compliance um but but not kyc as like the standard identity verification they've taken it and tokenizing yeah thank you understood I wish I had a better answer I like it pains because it's it's true right that's the state of the world so you know we will have to build it ourselves thank you great question Boris um I guess I think we have maybe time for one or two more questions so I want to end on I guess you guys have been live for a while now you have quite a few customers which is awesome so I'm curious like what have been your biggest learnings from all of this user user research and feedback and kind of how have they led to changes and how you're addressing the market and even just thinking about wallet as a service as a whole the biggest learning we had was and again we we integrate with a lot of Walters as a service provider just as a good example yesterday we launched an integration with Crossfit right so if you actually go to crosman's Twitter and of an hour ago they have false read about it but our biggest learning is that developer tools have to be extremely flexible extremely extremely flexible right and everyone has a slightly different opinion when it comes to how they Implement and how they think about kind of Authentication and so while you never want to kind of you know throw your roadmap in like 50 different directions you have to implement um we had to implement dynamic in a way where the marginal feature is very easy to implement and a good example is we started uh by creating two themes for the dynamic user experience right so if you go to our demo environment we have a light in the dark theme and then we realized very quickly that if you're a game that that like there's no way you put in interface that's not fully customized there's no it doesn't doesn't work like you can't have the second click in your entire product be a fully different UI and so one of the learnings on the on that side was hey you have to let someone control every pixel of your product and today if you go to our demo environment or docs you can see that you could control every part with CSS right so that example is on the customization side but it's true for any part of the product which is sorting Wallace which is sorting the order of where email shows up which is controlling the copy uh that was our biggest takeaway which is to have a successful product uh you have to have it customized the second big takeaway is that at the end of the day we're selling a security product and you can't mess that up and so it starts with sock two compliance and which starts with a bug Bounty program it starts with our first hire was a developer uh the devops higher right that that's kind of a a cultural thing that we have to embed internally in order to make sure that we're always world-class there that makes a lot of sense well I think that's all the time we have thanks so much etec for coming in I think this was like very very helpful because based on like the reactions in the chat it seems like everyone is thinking about a lot as a service essentially or just wallets um so yeah this has been this has been great foreign
