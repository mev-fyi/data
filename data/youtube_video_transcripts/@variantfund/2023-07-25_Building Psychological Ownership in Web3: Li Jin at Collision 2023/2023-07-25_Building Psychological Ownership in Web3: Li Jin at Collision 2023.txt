hmm okay hello again nice to see you all again um my name is Akash I'm a reporter at the information we are joined by Legion from variant capital capital today Lee has a very fascinating background in Venture she was a partner at andresian Horowitz at one point she started her own Venture fund investing in the passion economy backing companies like patreon and substack and now she's at variant where she has committed herself full time to the wonderful world of crypto thank you for being here with us thank you thanks so much for having me so I want to talk about a piece that you wrote recently in the Harvard Business Review um it was quite interesting it was called building psychological attachment not just ownership into web3 we'll get to what you wrote in a minute but I want to start by asking why you decided to write this piece in the first place yeah so this piece was really inspired by my Reflections and retrospection on crypto over the last couple of years I think everyone has noticed that we have not yet reached mainstream adoption we've had a number of projects that have gone through this boom and bust cycle we've failed to retain a lot of the users that tried out web3 over the last couple of years and this piece was really inspired by asking why like what has gone wrong in crypto over the last couple of years such that we haven't actually reached mainstream adoption and so I probe into this concept called psychological ownership which is the feeling of attachment or mindness that you have over certain products and services I think it's really the hidden X Factor of a lot of successful software products and basically the gist of the ideas that crypto has introduced asset ownership to the internet ownership of tokens or assets that are tracked and enforced via blockchains but we haven't built the corresponding emotional attachment or that feeling of owner shop over projects and so when you have asset ownership but no feeling of ownership that paves the way for rampant speculation for really short-term minded users for people who are just motivated by profit and I think that's the state that we're in so the missing ingredient to me in crypto really is psychological ownership to unlock that next level of growth so how do we build that psychological ownership then if that's the problem yeah well that's the billion dollar question that all product Builders are grappling with how do we actually build products that people love and care about and feel loyalty towards that is the job of product Builders but in the piece I basically outline a lot of the drivers of how do people wind up feeling like owners and there's a few drivers and and this is all taken from background research in consumer Psychology by the way this isn't a New Concept but I remixed it with crypto and so in the research there's been a lot of studies about how do people get to feel like owners how do they feel really bought in and there's a lot of things that you can do as a designer of products as a product Builder to actually cultivate that feeling of attachment and those things include like getting users to invest their time or energy or effort put an effort to customizing a product feeling increasing light increasing levels of Mastery going up that power our user curve you can also create a very strong narrative that users feel a lot of alignment with their self-identity towards and so there's a number of different drivers which you can basically Implement in product design to get people to buy in to a particular product and feel like an owner of it I'm curious if you think the idea around you know the idea around crypto being able to make you money you know the idea of what you call Asset ownership you know so many people are focused on that short-term gain from crypto if you will the possibility of making money with crypto does that even allow for psychological ownership or does it sort of limit the technology to an asset class where once people aren't getting the returns that they want from it they will just move on to the next asset class yeah I think this is the most interesting question in crypto is how can we use asset ownership to actually total charge the growth of products such that they are more successful more retentive have more loyal users than if they didn't include asset ownership and I think there's a lot of mixed studies about the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation there's studies that show that when you introduce extrinsic motivation like financial payment people actually report feeling less motivated to do the thing that they previously had enjoyed so there's studies about if you pay children to draw they report that they're less interested in drawing whereas if there had never been any monetary payment they would actually want to do that action but then there's also studies that show the opposite there's this really interesting study a couple of years ago from Colombia about the impact of stock ownership on brand loyalty and consumer spend and basically they found that when users of the spintech app were rewarded with talk in certain brands after shopping at those brands they actually bought a lot more at those brands that they they were stock owners of so they're they're spending jumped anywhere between 40 to 100 after they became stock owners and so what all of these studies are telling me or what I'm getting out of it is it's critical to turn users into owners not just give them cash payments there's a subtle difference between being an owner in terms of governance and economic power in a project that creates that incentive alignment versus just giving them money to do something will result in that kind of loss of intrinsic motivation and then secondly I think the implementation details of how to distribute asset ownership are super important asset ownership is not a substitute for product Market fit it turbo charges users who already love your product to have greater Word of Mouth greater retention but that intrinsic love for your product needs to be there in place before you level up that with any sort of Financial incentives or tokens it strikes me that you know where we might find psychological ownership first you know you have to get further away from Trading you have to get to the more creative applications of crypto I mean you think about nfts you think about gaming you think about tokenizing assets where are we most likely to see psychological ownership first in your mind yeah in the crypto world I'm really bullish on media culture any any sort of creator-led application that mixes this idea of asset ownership with psychological ownership because I think creators media those are categories where they basically invented consumer love and this idea of psychological ownership and we're seeing that play out already in projects that are introducing the concept of digital ownership as applied to songs or as applied to Fashion can you can you give us an example uh you know maybe make it a little bit more tangible here are there companies actually doing this yeah there are so um one example is a platform called sound the website is sound.xyz there are music nft platform that allows music artists to sell their songs as nfts and you might be wondering like why would anyone buy a song nft when I can just listen for free well it turns out because music is a discipline with so much consumer love so much like desire for affinity for the music artists people are willing to pay that price to collect the asset that has been sort of touched and blessed by the Creator simply because it deepens their emotional resonance with that person and so today I think just over the last year they've sold something like five million dollars worth of music nfts about 500 artists have released music nfts and there's about 15 000 collectors of these digital assets who are really motivated by more deeply expressing their Affinity to that particular music artist right and so you use you use this as an example of a company who in your mind has been able to develop that psychological ownership separate from the asset ownership yeah that's right I think both things are in place users are purchasing these that's not only for the desire of financial profit but they're buying them to express their support for a particular artists in the case of sound you know um I'm wondering if you could talk about what metrics you look for as it relates to measuring psychological ownership I mean if certainly you know trading volume is one way you could look at activity but trading volume is volatile and so do you do you what do you look at yeah I basically look at all of the consumer metrics that I have always looked at as a consumer investor throughout the years for people who have a record in crypto and not consumer what are those metrics yeah I look at things like user retention are people coming back over and over again um things like uh they have Word of Mouth growth are they loyal to the same artist do they consistently purchase music nfts from the same person and those metrics kind of can tell you like are these really speculative assets that people are just trading or is this a purchase that's motivated by love and attachment to that individual hmm you know it's you know you mentioned the Creator economy we sort of had this phase where a lot of the big social media platforms when crypto was uh was the most popular Topic in the world now a few months ago um you know we had this this era where every social media platform was coming out and saying we are starting to explore nfts we are thinking about an nft Marketplace so to speak I mean there's an example of companies that have developed so psychological ownership yeah over their product expanding into crypto and web3 do you think that's the more likely outcome or do you think it's more likely that we will have a net new crypto native company that starts with asset ownership and you know comes up from the bottom to develop psychological ownership it's a really good question I think we're gonna see both um so I think who does it first definitely the net new companies are going to do it first and history has already shown this to be true where First Capital says then that new company is doing it but it's just proven out to be true first you have the companies that truly believe in crypto that are pioneering on the fringes of what nfts can be new form factors of nfts introducing them to Consumers and educating people and then the web 2 Brands look at that and they're like oh there's something there there's you know like spend happening or consumers seem to be interested in this let me graft it onto my product as a feature right so the Innovation starts with the startups it might get popularized through the web 2 platforms but ultimately I think they are an entryway to Consumers discovering what web3 is and then wanting the real full-on experience kind of like how AOL and that Walled Garden experience was ultimately just a portal for people to discover the broader open internet I think the same is going to happen with web 2. platforms and then people learning about web3 and wanting to embrace and explore the full World Of user-owned Products right you know we talked earlier about what it takes to build psychological ownership crypto is an engineering and finance heavy uh talent pool right now what kind of talent do we need more of at crypto startups to get to a place where we're building psychological ownership is it marketing is it product is it yeah what is it yeah I think it's consumer product expertise we need more consumer products builders in crypto this is a call to arms for everyone to refer their consumer product manager friends to to build in web 3 because I think we have such a Darth of product Talent people who are gifted in terms of identifying user needs and crafting products that serve those needs I think the last couple of years in crypto a lot of people were sort of under the assumption or there had been this narrative that web 3 just wasn't subject to the same laws of physics as web 2. people thought that this was this whole new universe that just had different laws of physics and reality than what web 2 companies had to face and it turns out that that's not true the similarity between them is that at the foundational level you just have to build products that people love you have to build products that are serving a widespread user need and design a product that people really feel emotional attachment to and then you use tokens and asset ownership to turbocharge that to boost retention or boost growth but it's not a substitute for that underlying product Market fed and so we need more talented Builders designers product managers and crypto right I mean look there's a you hit on a good point here which is starting with designers I mean there are Frameworks out there there's a popular framework called the balance breakthrough model which is essentially a Venn diagram of uh you know what consumers actually desire what is viable from a business perspective and then what's feasible from an engineering and a build perspective it feels to me like most crypto companies today are started with feasibility and what we can build and what the technology can actually do and not with what people actually want do you agree with that well I would say that I think they have started with what people want but they've honed in on one particular thing that people want which is profit and that is a really dangerous value proposition to go after because it's something that is out of your control as a builder it's something that is the output of Market forces it's not something that you control within your company that you can build for and so by serving this user need or desire for financial gain you're giving up control over your own destiny and it can be a very short-lived sort of value proposition that when it goes away there's just no no use for your product anymore and I think we've seen that in a lot of the projects that have you know churned through a lot of their users so I think there needs to be um an exercise of really deeply understanding what are the remaining consumer pain points that need to be solved what can be solved much better with crypto and to build for user needs that go far beyond speculation you know we talk about this in a and we're talking about this in a consumer context uh with consumer-facing crypto applications I wonder if you've thought about building psychological ownership from a developer perspective at all in that you have a number of protocols out there um they're all trying to attract developers to build on their chain is there any more psychological ownership right now with respect to how developers see protocols or completely yes yeah it's definitely not just a consumer phenomenon it's you know anytime you involve humans into the equation right people have feelings and they feel things towards products they feel things towards services and also towards protocols so I think if you consider all the different protocols out there on crypto or different blockchain ecosystems I think that the ones that have been more successful have been the ones that engender that deep feeling of attachment that have some sort of degree of emotional resonance with developers and that might be because they align to a certain set of values or they have a leader or a figurehead that people really admire but if you think of the biggest layer one ecosystems like Bitcoin or ethereum I think they've attracted developers and retained them because developers feel psychological ownership and that psychological ownership is then also turbocharged by the asset ownership of the token native to that blockchain so by turning those developers into actual owners of those ecosystems you have the most powerful and potent combination of the two right the last Point here we've got 30 seconds left here on the developer piece I I mean are most of do most developers today do they commit to one chain or do you see developers still experimenting with multiple different chains and I mean look the jury's still out which one still works uh have most people committed or are they experimenting I think most developers tend to build in one particular ecosystem they have pretty strong social network effects and also developer Network effects but I do see a lot of exploration of different l2s right now in terms of scaling Solutions on top of certain blockchains cool thanks for being here thank you for being here everyone thank you guys [Applause]
