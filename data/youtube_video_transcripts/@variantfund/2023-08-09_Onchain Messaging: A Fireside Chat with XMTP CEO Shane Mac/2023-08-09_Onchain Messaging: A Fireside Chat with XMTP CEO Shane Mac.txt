foreign so great to have you here today thanks so much for being with us I think the founders and our founder Fellowship have a lot to learn from you in terms of your experience um getting adoption for xmtp as a messaging protocol the decisions that you've made in terms of what to include in the protocol as well as the general importance of web3 messaging um and maybe even some implications for how they think about boosting engagement and retention for their own applications that they're working on but before we jump into questions I wanted to give a brief introduction for Shane um so Shane is the CEO and co-founder of xmtp which is building a open protocol and network for secure web 3 messaging prior to xmtp Shane was building in the web 2 space he was the founder of assists which built the first messaging platform for Facebook Messenger Apple business chat Google Business messaging and SMS for those of you guys who remember all those different messaging platforms and how businesses were leveraging them that company was acquired in 2019 and before that Shane co-founded and bootstrapped a company called squared away which provides remote EAS power powered by military spouses probably there's a few folks in the room who've either worked with squared away or have heard about it and that business recently passed 25 million dollars in Revenue led by his co-founder and Shane is based in Nashville so Shane thanks so much for being here today it's uh really great to be here thanks for having me so first of all I think it would be great to kick off with just what is crypto native communication what is web 3 messaging can you just sort of Define that for us yeah for sure I I look at it as there's a new identity which is a walled address which enables actually the ability to own infinite number of identities and in that world how can you make sure that every identity can reach each other and so for for the way that I kind of looked at it and the way I thought about should we start xntp in the past messaging and communication usually follows a new identity mechanism happening um and so whether it was a a website leading to emails whether it was phone numbers leading to SMS the question for me was really is this going to be a new identity and then how is that going to play out and you know I think it's still playing out but it's it's clear that the ability to reach a wallet address that you otherwise could not reach through any nether mechanism needed a new way to do it and that's kind of how the company started Robert leschner the founder of compound Labs he was talking to us about three years ago and he's like I have 11 billion dollars in a smart contract and I can see every single person's address but I can't reach 95 of them and that was really where it all started I think that's a great segue to doing the demo and like showing people um what the experience looks like and and putting it in a more visual way I think that's the best way to get people does everyone here have a coinbase wallet I think most people do because we ask them to download coinbase wallet yesterday so folks have it on their phone why don't we just do this why don't I just open coinbase wallet um why don't I go in my inbox why don't I tell everyone to scan this which will drop you right into a message with me so if you scan this QR code it should take you right into the inbox and it should be right into the inbox uh to message me if anyone needs it again I'll put it back up Shane do folks need to First scan the QR code to activate uh it should activate it actually while it's doing it so it it should drop uh drop you right in there and it'll activate it if you don't have messaging turned on but it'll also go direct to it if you do hey Nick hi Lee whoa I'm getting all kinds of messages so what's cool here is uh if I go out of coinbase wallet and I go into actually another application called Converse I actually use Converse as my main messaging app but I also use coinbase wallet and what's cool is the messages are fully portable so I think what's completely new here is you own your conversations like you own your assets the application and your private key is actually the thing that decrypts and takes your communication with you so you're not locked into any ecosystem so if I go back into coinbase wallet I can see I'll see all of your messages coming in here I can do face ID I can open up and I I can see all the uh all of your messages so everyone who just started messaging me if you've never messaged me before it starts out as a message request so it's kind of cool I can accept or decline it and say say Lee here I can go in and see conversation with her I get a message query I like your emoji cool the the unique thing that coinbase did is if you hit the plus button you can actually do payments so I don't know who this person is but maybe it's your lucky day and I'll send you 50 bucks and now someone in this group just got fifty dollars from me and the message receipt actually goes into the message feed and so that's what we call Standard content types and the ability for Content types to be able to be interoperable where now you can have secure messaging globally but also because of crypto's killer use case is the ability to do usdc and payments globally and now you can actually do that all together in one and the coolest thing is that the message is verified by the private key so the person you're talking to and uh the message itself the actual message object is provable that it's from the person's ID or identity they're using and the person who owns what they say they own and so one of the biggest problems in all of web 3 is the scams happen on Discord and Twitter DMS and all these other platforms because you can't prove that the person that you're saying hey this is my address just trust that it's me I get anxiety every time I send money but what's really cool is that you have the ability to do payments now and messaging together in one seamless experience the no more sending eight cents and 10 cents as like a little verification of a wire the message actually is the verification because it's talking from the address that you're actually the same as you're sending the money to and what's cool is then if you go into Converse all of those messages show up and so I actually have all my conversations you know hey there what's up uh and so I can use any application I want and the the magic part of this is yesterday a company named duffel pitched me and what's cool is they don't have to they don't have to rebuild a social network to start and so for developers there's no more cold start so they built this whole crazy experience and all this stuff and these new features and all these new ways to show content types Etc but I opened the app and my entire history was there and so just thinking about no more cold starts is a problem I think is a fascinating kind of look into where this all goes in the future I think that's a a really um interesting and like provocative point which is that as a developer like integrating with xmtp basically gets you past the cold start problem if you're building any kind of um social use case or or any kind of application that could benefit from messaging um I think it would be great to hear from your perspective what you think some of to hear deeper um thinking on like what are the benefits for developers to xmtp when you go into these conversations um what are you pitching what is really the the value add that xmt print XT xmtp brings to an application developer and how are you able to get those first few Integrations in place I think there's two things to think about here one is why were so many messaging platforms started that didn't work in this space um and that question to me is I think people were looking at it as can you message this new wallet address identity and use that as a way to send messages and then building it in a silo and they're thinking oh I'll use this public identity and then I'll use that as the as the thing and then anyone who uses my app can actually message each other using that identity and that played out over and over again you know it's not like what we're doing is actually this crazy novel new thing I think it's a unique approach to what makes it different and the problem wasn't can we use a wallet address identity to send message the problem is is there a ubiquitous Network where everyone adopts so that you can make sure that all the messages get received and that latter problem is a harder problem but I think it's the one we're solving and so to solve that you need to figure out where the shelling points that have the most reach with the largest inboxes that can also get all of the identities onboarded so therefore you're solving the cold start problem so that any developer who plugs in can now reach everybody and I think for us that was going for wallets and focusing on wallets of the center of the universe how do we incentivize work with get them to be investors in be on the cap table be a token holder in the future how do we make sure that the entire world of wallets has a reason to work with us as well as has a reason to work with other wallets and I think thinking about why should coinbase do this themselves I mean that was where we started two years ago and obviously that's the first place everyone starts and I said wouldn't metamask ever build on top of coinbase messaging probably not but now you have this public identifier and I'm going to be like hey I sent you a message Lee uh just FYI it's to your wallet address and every single app has a different inbox it really just doesn't work and it kind of through throughout all of the times that this has been tried that's been the thing so I think it was very intentional why we didn't build an application and we just focused on the network and protocol layer to try to highlight why the problem wasn't can you use this address as an identity to deliver a message the problem is can this address be reached in a ubiquitous way across the entire ecosystem and then you have to work on and I think what we're still working on is aligning the incentives and the consent protocol so that all those applications get value in the ecosystem itself but really I think focusing on the core wallets as the shelling point and then just aligning thousands of Developers to that Vision so that if we do have a ubiquitous Network and there's a way that every address can reach each other that every developer gets a ton of value but if we end up in 25 different silos no one has any value there so that's the that's the you know the game we're playing and I think it's a it's a long road but it's going in the right direction it's definitely a really fascinating shift from the web 2 messaging world where all of the users messages were extremely siled to that particular platform that offered messaging and there was no kind of open identity system or no concept of messaging one canonical profile it was all coupled with a particular product or a platform and and obviously you're chasing a very different Vision now that is newly possible um I think another interesting topic that we have been discussing as a cohort is the question of um getting adoption for a protocol and building the first plot a product on top of it as a protocol developer so a few weeks ago we hosted Hayden Adams from uniswap and talked about product versus protocol and basically how uniswap was also the developer of the first product on top of the uniswap protocol and how that was an important strategy for them to get liquidity into the protocol itself I would love to hear your your thinking on this topic and did you guys ever consider building a messaging application yourself to seed the network and to get user adoption for the network itself the organization you have to build and I think with startups it's all about the sequencing of what you do and the constraints by which you operate and getting that wrong is how you die and so well if we had coinbase wallet but didn't have an app what would happen like that's what everyone's asking for if we did have a our own app but didn't have coinbase wallet no one seems to care yet we're spending tons of resources and now Staffing up a go to market team to think about consumers using our product and that whole thing versus our customers developers versus our customers users and that was really the deciding factor for me and we had this debate who is our customer we're only going to pick one if it's both we're not it's just not an answer and at the end of the day I think our customers developers um and from where I come from my whole reason for doing this company was I spent 15 years building on top of web 2 platforms getting screwed over by API changes and then building an app to beat me with an app and I was like my whole reason for being here is actually to create a better experience and a better incentive for developers to be able to build with the protocol that all works together and the incentives actually move the value and money to the developers not to us and like I still believe that so we killed it and I think it was the greatest decision we did love that um continuing to pull on that thread of developers being your key customer um could you share a little bit about the developers who are building on xmgp today what are the types of applications they're building um and what are they seeing so far in terms of how users are using messaging we actually see it as just two pillars so we have inboxes and we have platforms so inboxes are a place for daily use the common denominator touch point with xmtp this would be coinbase wallet this would be Converse this would be all the lens DMS this would be uh other other wallets is really kind of the focus and then platforms are web 3 Centric dapps that need re-engagement or a place to communicate to wallet addresses that could otherwise not reach think snapshot think uh paragraph just launched last week think openc lens Etc um and I think there's two kind of pillars of use cases inside of those B to C and peer-to-peer on the b2c side I actually feel like that's the real problem today that can drive a lot of value for both sides as long as it's an opt-in and a consent based relationship and so paragraph launched last week now you can do all of your newsletters it can be delivered via wallet you can get that in coinbase wallet or any other application on xmtp and then the notification actually comes there and that you consented with your wallet on the paragraph site so seeing creators and fan like in and writers and artists starting to actually do one-to-many kind of announcements but also they turn into one-to-one relationships I think is the killer use case uh there's a company called holder.xyz there's a company called absolute labs and the converse team just built broadcast dot converse.xyz so if you go there it allows any Creator in the entire space that's ever launched in nft or minted anything to an audience the Creator can actually reach that audience now in a more targeted and a direct way to have a conversations and build relationships I I think a lot about snapshot use case I think governance and doing that in a really meaningful way where the end-to-end loop you can send a notification about governments you can act governance you can actually vote inside of the wallet and then never have to go back to the site and completing that Loop is super powerful I think everyone will have a wallet newsletter or like an interoperable newsletter in the future so a subscribe button uh on every single site we're thinking a lot of like imagine the ERC kind of update to the nft uh seven I think it's 720. uh imagine there's a sign or a check box or another signature that is the opt-in to communication so imagine that on the on the heels of every mint you're actually giving consent or not to letting people message you and having that relationship and then uh with that creator and so those are all like I think really cool use cases on the peer-to-peer side I really believe what coinbase kind of cracked which I showed and the ability to do secure communication with Global Payments for free is a Holy Grail use case that is just much bigger than people realize uh because when I see WhatsApp try to do payments for a decade but the payments rails are so complex to be able to pay people across borders and then I can't pay someone on venmo in Canada or even Mexico in the U.S let alone you know anywhere in Europe crypto's killer use case is actually Global Payments and so to see l2s and coinbase support free gasless payments mixed with secure communication that's verified you know this is like Western Union venmo WhatsApp territory and those are just huge businesses and opportunities so I think those are cool I would say the the discovery stuff is pretty amazing too the lens forecaster using any Identity or social graph to be able to help you know and discover who to message that's probably something I could have showed at the beginning the converse if you go into Converse the app they actually do an incredible job at doing Discovery from on-chain data poapps social graphs Etc and I think building and discovering your graph and your People based on the communities you're already a part of or the identities you have is is a huge use case yeah that's very cool I think we're like shifting from this world in which our social connections had been um originated from offline sources into online sources and I think the next evolution of that is that a lot of our social connections originate from on chain sources and so being able to discover People based on shared on-chain activity or co-ops that you have or things that you've minted is definitely a very cool use case for xmtp um we're going to transition to audience questions soon but before we do that I think it would be great to get your advice for a lot of the really early stage builders in here on General go to market strategies and insights especially you know given that a lot of the founders here are just launching their products or about to launch and and hoping to gain traction it would be great to hear your advice on just general go to market in web 3. it's an interesting question I feel like my all of my advice would be the opposite of all of web 3's advice um because web3's advice is like make sure you have the token the token's a growth model and all these things like when I came into the space you know I'm from messaging and building secure messaging for almost 15 years my co-founder Matt way more crypto so he's very much last company got acquired by Kraken started building on ethereum and right when it launched like huge in the space um and I think we kind of defaulted away from that of what I've learned in web 2 and I think we're learning here is one thing I think about from growth is truly knowing who your customer is and not building for both so when I heard but yeah we need an app but we should also do the protocol and we should also do this and think about the Chrome extension and it was really like hard for me to understand like is the end user are we building a team for go to market is actually about monthly active users and it's all about the application metrics and getting people to open the app daily or is the customer developers friction to adopt sdks what is the failover rate do they have interaction success with who they're trying to reach Etc so I think picking that was very important which goes into my like main philosophy of things smaller to build bigger I really think that this space specifically needs really really great products for a lot of really big problems um and take like just uh everything happening around like a smart contract wallets or account abstraction and the just the onboarding sdks like there's a lot of companies in that space But that to me feels like an obvious just like amazing problem to be solved and focusing that specific on really this thing solves a developer's problem like completely it's 10x better than having to deal with what Wallets on your phone the wallet connect connection I can now support email and SMS consumers don't have to deal with it and like that specific of a problem is a huge idea and so I always just try to keep reducing the surface area so then my go to market is so targeted I think go to market follows actually getting that right and a lot of this space feels like they forgot the product principles and then they tried to go to market with like philosophy around token um and I I don't know if that's right or wrong you know and we chose to go the other way but I feel like if you do have product Market fit and you do have adoption and adoption comes from really specific products having good constraints being able to make sure that every single person really loves it then you get to launch a token for me I'm so excited about that because we can have all of our like ducks in a row not launch the token to then find if I can find the product Market fit um and maybe that's completely counter to this entire space but I think I'm really excited about that approach yeah I I think it's the approach that we advocate for as well finding product Market fit first um and building that community and this is where I go to markets tricky because go to market like get users get growth whatever for me go to market is always the opposite it's you end up lying to yourself as a Founder by thinking the next feature is going to be the one that grows versus editing reducing or removing the features you have that aren't growing and really continuing to edit or change or throw out and sometimes look at experience like throwing out our entire app level and redoing the go to market to a whole different org we started over and the fear in this space I felt a lot at the protocol level was but we can never change it and I would be like yeah I'd be like to my co-founder be like hey we're a year in if it if the if the answer is start over but we have a year of experience and we can go six months and do it again I'm fine but I think there's this fear I've felt in this space around like oh my gosh we can't it's a smart contract we can't unwind this a blockchain lasts forever like all this and I'm like just shut it down and start over but that experience I had from the past where when you try to morph things or you try to like add to it or I'd always ask Founders when I was an investor my my trick question would be like what are you going to build next and the founders that actually told me a bunch of features I knew they didn't have it figured out but the ones who were like actually were trying to actually get this one thing over here to work it's kind of close no one's really we're going to edit it down remove a bunch of  we might delete this app we might try it again we might do a different on it that was actually a signal that they had the loss of the loss of version strength which is the hardest thing it's twice as hard to remove something versus at it and that's the thing to actually like lean into because that fear and that feeling is the thing that really will help you get to a simpler thing and that I've always that people are so scared of loss of version of we we probably spent you know at least an investors so I probably shouldn't say this we probably spent over a million dollars building these apps probably more than that I mean we build up a six-person app team I had to let two people go we got rid of our head of engineering because he was app Centric like it's been not an easy shift but I think it was really the right shift and the editing and the constraints and I say as a leader reducing your surface area actually leads to go to market because if not you're trying to go to market with a bunch of things and then the hardest thing is that if you don't have a thing you can lie to yourself that six things are kind of working and you really get up when you like have six things that kind of work because everyone's like oh well this they all they all kind of work and that's where you end up in like spirals that can go downhill that resonates a lot Simplicity pairing things down finding what what actually works rather than over complicating it um let's switch over to audience questions so the chat has a lot of questions in it I feel like I just got preached there I didn't mean to no I I think a lot of Founders resonated with what you just said that's the hardest thing and so I I empathize with all of you as well and I struggle with it every day too yeah so I see a couple of questions in here about the business model for xmtp and how you plan to monetize so let's tackle that one first totally I think we're getting uh we're making a ton of progress here and I'm super excited about it it also goes into the other question I saw consent and spam um coming from the messaging world and you know from the last 15 years of my career there's no bigger problem that I'm excited to focus on and I think what's interesting is when you have a default public identity you need a different mechanism for which you do consent so email and SMS were supposed to be default private all of our data got resold in the world so I can spam Wallace got created to like try to protect us but really it's just black boxes trying to like protect senders social actually invented a public identity but supposed to be private messaging so you know Facebook owns WhatsApp and messenger and Instagram DMS and Twitter DMS and you kind of have a social graph so you can do a lot of things in this world ens names fire Caster names wallet addresses its default public so I think you actually need a default opt-in Network so the biggest thing we're excited about is a proof of consent model which is how the world works today if I'm a brand I want to put a subscribe button on my website an opt-in button I want to put an opt-in button underneath the ads on Instagram so if you're running ads on Instagram right now you can do a send a WhatsApp and you can do a WhatsApp Messenger button we would want them to say opt-in and now you can get messages via xmtp on any client you used and I think the opt-in being um opt-in by default so people control their inboxes and you this kind of would change everything where you can't just message anybody the only reason everyone here could message me is because you scan my QR code so the QR code is actually an opt-in mechanism I think you can do a lot of things around links so users could actually manage tons of links oh yeah make one for anyone with this nft you can message me so now if they tried to message you that actually would be a consent mechanism and the second piece of this is putting that all in a smart contract publicly so every xmtp identity lives on a chain and that's public the consent mechanism of can Lee's wallet message chain wallet is a private attestation on that identity whether or not that identity is yes or no and I think that to me is like a fundamental good for the world because that consent today lives in the sending applications of the SMS tools the SMS marketing tools support tools spam engines and all the government runs around trying to like make sure everyone got those numbers the same and if you want to sign up on a website for a new SMS tool they're like hey it's going to take a week to turn it on because we need to go look at the language you use and are these your real phone numbers do you have consent to do this but no one really knows so I think that's the most valuable thing we can do and then the business model is very simple it's brand stake money to be able to reach the people that have opted in it's the exact model of WhatsApp and if you have a million people for Nike doties Nike is happy to stake fifty thousand dollars in the protocol to be able to reach their most valuable relationships and I think the Innovation there is actually if you do staking at scale you can actually pay the ecosystem and fund it on yield and so we're thinking a lot about how to actually do that where then Brands if they ever wanted to leave one they can take their network with them because it's while IT addresses but two is they can actually just pull their stake and they didn't have to lose any money versus today they pull all their money into SMS and email marketing and it's just gone um so we're thinking a lot about it there but the money will be made in one-to-many sins and I think the Innovation is actually the building a building a protocol of consent yeah that's really interesting I don't want to take us down a rabbit hole but I imagine that it will be difficult to ascertain who's a brand versus who is a consumer versus a prosumer versus like an influencer who's like borderline user borderline brand um like I think all of those things probably need to get teased out with this particular business model I don't know because I've been in it so long that I've realized you can't figure that out um when messenger tried to launch this they actually tried to add tags for like oh this is a marketing message this is a support message this is a brand this is a person and all it did is actually everyone just figured out how to hack the system to build to be something else they're like no no I'm just a person sending a bunch of messages or whatever they're like this isn't marketing this is news and they had all these different variations I think if you have an opt-in Network by default where even lead to message Shane can't happen unless I set my inbox so that anyone with a Lin sandal can default opt right can automatically um can automatically message me or if you scan my QR code or if I send you a share link or if my website says you know I have a button and actually you can click that but if you actually don't differentiate between all the different types you're just basically saying everyone has to get an opt-in even one to one could it slow the growth of the network maybe but unless everyone actually wants the control and they can create easy someone could say Let everyone message me right and that would just actually turn it where any message that tried to message them would turn green as an as a consent because they they set that but it's a user controlled setting that makes sense okay so we're running up on time this has been super informative and interesting Shane thank you so much for coming in to chat with the fellows um definitely gives us a lot of food for thought I think you also got a lot of new users for um the messaging experience inside of um coinbase wallet and and all of the other places where xmtp is supported so let's keep messaging there um and I guess yeah if you have other questions now you can reach Shane directly inside of coinbase wallet or any lens application or or anywhere where xmtp is integrated so um I'll volunteer Shane to continue answering q a in that messaging experience so thank you Shane so much for being here [Music] foreign
