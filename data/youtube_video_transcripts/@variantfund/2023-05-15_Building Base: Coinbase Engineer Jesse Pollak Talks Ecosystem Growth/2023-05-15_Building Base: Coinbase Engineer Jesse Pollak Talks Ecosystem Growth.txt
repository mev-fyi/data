foreign [Music] I think I've met most of you but I'm so excited to be here with all of you guys so the impetus for this event was twofold one when talking to our portfolio we identified a common question that was shared across across the board and kept coming up which was basically how to think about scaling engineering teams and then two obviously base coinbase's newest block space incubation was announced recently and there's been a lot of excitement around it and learning more about it so we thought who better to bring forward to the portfolio than Jessie Pollock who has experienced in both of these areas so a little bit about him he's a true crypto OG he spent over a decade in Tech starting as like a software engineer then serving as a web 2 founder and then finally spending the last six years or so at coinbase so five of those years he spent leading all of coinbase's consumer facing engineering teams and now he leads the protocols team which is building out initiatives like base so we'll go deeper into his background throughout the next hour but Jesse would you want to say a quick hello to the audience and maybe share one thing you're excited to touch on today that was great intro um I'm Jesse uh nice to see everyone glad to be here love variant long time fan um I'm I'm excited to talk about it all excited to talk about scaling engineering teams I did that for a long time so you talk about scaling ethereum doing that for a long time now um so yeah just just fair enough to be here cool lots of scaling so before we get started let me quickly set the stage so we have two main goals for this event that he touched on one to draw out learnings from Jessie's tenure in crypto primarily focused around scaling engineering teams and then two uh to get the inside scoop on base and scaling ethereum okay I guess I'd love to get started by asking you Jesse about just like your journey in crypto in general so what were you doing before and how did you get into the space um I learned about crypto for the first time in the spring of 2012 I was sitting at my college lunch table my first year of college and this random guy sat down the table we started talking about Bitcoin he told me what Bitcoin was and I later learned that he was this guy Olaf Carlson we who was just stopping for a week at coin uh where I was in college and like staying in my friend's room on his way to join coinbase as the first employee and so that was the beginning of a long friendship with Olaf but that was what I learned about crypto I then um started a company that fall so fall of 2012 um uh that was during kind of security identity authentication mostly working with crypto companies um dropped out of school the the spring of 2013 built that company for four years and it's called clef we worked with folks like bitconnects and bitmax back in 2014 and 2015 doing kind of login and identity for them um that business didn't work uh and so when we kind of went down the business we went to the aqua hire process coinbase made an offer to acquire us as a result of you know I got connected to coinbase through Olaf um and my whole team actually decided to sell to twilio but I was so excited about crypto I'd been working adjacent to it for four years at that point um I was like what do you mean you're going to Twilight I'm going to crypto and I joined coinbase uh when it was like 70 people at the beginning of 2017. um and then yeah it's been six years I I hit six years on March 13th so it's been an incredible ride that's great congrats you basically have a PhD so speak to me yeah truly speak to me more about your experience at coinbase so what was your first role when you joined six years ago my first role so at the startup clef I was my title was Chief product officer but we never had more than like seven people so what that meant was I wrote code for like front end and back end and I managed our support person and I managed our design person and I ran like our products roadmap um and when I joined coinbase I had the option of joining as a PM or engineer and I joined as an engineer uh just kind of like doing full stack back-end front end stuff um and I lasted about a month as an engineer and then coinbase started you know it was 2017 and so things started picking up and we started growing the team and they were like you you've managed people before um I never managed an engineer at that point but I took on managing like a four-person team and then kind of every six months for the next four and a half years my job changed as that team Grew From four people to about 200 people in about four four and a half years so um a lot of learning along the way a lot of mistakes but a lot of learning I'm excited to dive into that yeah that experience that you mentioned I think is very common for a lot of our early stage Founders that started as like technical Founders and then kind of eventually as they scaled had to start managing people so how did you kind of think through that shift in your role from IC to manager and I guess do you have any advice for folks in that position to kind of prepare for that transition themselves um I mean I think for me it was a lot of just like what the business needed and wanted to kind of optimize kind of optimizing for where I felt like I could make the most impact um and I found I think I've learned over the last five years that I like the way I can make the most impact is by supporting people and coaching and managing and you know it's it's a mix my my role has changed a lot so you know being a manager of a five-person team is very different than being manager or a 50-person team is very different than being a manager of a 20 200 team and today I am again back managing maybe like five people directly um but maybe like a 20-person team but then like a much larger cross-functional effort that's um not just engineering I did engineering for for four and a half years and now I'm kind of doing everything um I'd say advice wise I mean maybe like first off decide whether it's something you want to do like you know you don't have to be a manager if you don't want to be a manager there's kind of different roles you can carve out for yourself and you can build the right team around you especially if you're a founder and so like really deciding like do you like and do you want to work with people and Coach people and help them be successful um so that's the first thing and if you do want to do that that's awesome if you don't want to that's also awesome there's tons of other ways you can make an impact um and then I'd say the second thing is just like early on trying to figure out what your like inherent strengths and weaknesses are um the two ones that came up for me really early in my career was um I wasn't strategic at all and so I got about a year and a half into managing teams and like the feedback that I kept consistently getting was like people know what they're doing now but they don't know where they're going in between six months and so that was this like really powerful learning for me that I've been able to kind of like shift and compensate for by building new school new skills um and then the other one is I'm just like a super positive optimistic person uh that's kind of Who I Am Naturally and uh that that comes through with people too I I give people the benefit of the doubt um I'm very positive I give a lot of positive feedback and it's I think this has actually been like the most consistent learning in my career is just like recognizing that that is a superpower but it can also be like one of my biggest weaknesses if I'm not able to like concisely distill down like how can people be better and how can I push them harder um so I think like building self-awareness of like what are your strengths and weaknesses naturally and how do you compensate for them um with like skill building yeah that's great advice I I really like that I feel like especially as like when I was an early career engineer um like having that sort of mentorship is super important and like having managers who actually want to be managers is incredibly important so I like that you pointed that out as like you should do that introspection in the beginning um I guess like one thing I'm curious about is I understood that you kind of oversaw the growth of the engineering team from like four to two hundred people at least on the consumer facing side so how did the needs of those teams change over time as you needed to scale um yeah I mean when I joined the engineering team was 25 people total at coinbase and when I stepped out of that role it's probably like 1400 1500 people um and a 25 engineering team is just radically different than a 1500 person engineering team so I'd say like the biggest change was definitely just scale and and the organization needing to have a bunch more kind of like people infrastructure in order to support that scale I also say that like coinbase and you know many of you all are crypto Founders almost all of y'all are assume we're crypto Founders like coinbase also very much went through the ups and downs of crypto from that time it was 2017 through 2021 and so that was like the beginning of the 2017 bull run through the kind of like very beginning of the 2021 defy summer uh era and so we grew very very quickly and then we kind of stopped growing and shrunk a little bit and then we started growing very very quickly again um and I think in those times a very quick quick growth I was both a kind of people challenge because we need to figure out how do we want more people and make them successful and then it was also like a technology challenge like having onboard more users and keep the website up now it's like a big part of my job and I'd say we did a okay job with that although we got a lot of for it made a lot of mistakes as well um yeah I think the like probably the biggest learning through all that for me was like the Temptation is always to grow really quickly people wise and it's almost always like you're growing too fast people-wise it's a bad idea I've just like seen it happen at coinbase now like four times where everyone is like we just go faster we need to go faster we need to go faster we need to go faster we grow insanely fast and then we get like six months out of it into the next bear Market or whatever and everyone's like wow we made mistakes mistakes have been made um so that's kind of like an impossible urge to resist and I've now seen it happen many times at coinbase but I think it's something for like to be conscious of um like don't grow until you have to grow and when you have to grow like grow as methodically as you possibly can from a people perspective yeah that's good advice I feel like broader like Tech is going through this right now as well I guess do you have any best practices for preventing this sort of a fire like how do you be like methodological when you're thinking about hiring and scaling your team yeah um I mean one one thing that a rule that we didn't follow but we probably should have that I've tried to follow since is just like trying not to grow more than 2x in a year and I think that that that's maybe more applicable to like you know mid-stage companies like going from 50 to 100 or 100 to 200 or 200 to 400 Less in the case of like growing from five to ten like I think going like five to twenty in a year is going to be hard but totally workable but once you get like to that bigger size I think I've seen it be a much less good idea so that's one that's kind of one metric that we used another one that we've used is just like keeping that sense sense of kind of like how your team is balanced like making sure you have a good healthy ratio of Engineers to product and design we've tried to keep engineering like a high percentage of the company 30 to 40 of the company which is like a pretty operationally heavy business business like coinbase is a real challenge um I think that's been really useful and then I guess the last thought that I haven't this is mostly just for my learnings over the last three years that I've transitioned to this new role a year and a half um is like the thing that I consistently seen is you can literally have tedx more impact and leverage if you are building with on-chain Native tooling like if you are writing smart contracts and you're building applications to finance smart contracts and you are using the infrastructure around smart contracts you can literally ship things with 10 times to your engineers and those things can then reach 10 times as many people around the world and so I think just being like really really rigorous about like the rules having changed over the last one and a half years and People Like Us in this room having kind of an unfair Advantage versus the rest of the world where if you're if you're rigorous and you're thoughtful and you lean into this new technology Trend you can outperform everyone at 10x to size so that that then that's what we're doing base you know the base team was there's a four-person team it was me and a four-person team of engineering perspective um and you know I think made a huge impact on a 4 000 person company that's insane yeah that's actually a great segue into what I wanted to touch on next I guess I want to shift gears and talk about like what you're up to now so to preface this like I see you as one of the most crypto native people I know in the sense that you're an active contributor to multiple Downs including the one that we're in together you started a project called City 3 which is being used to create a community currency in Oakland and then most recently you put out an essay about a year or so ago which emphasized that coinbase was going to start embracing decentralization so someone who clearly is a champion for for decentralization how do you feel about coinbase's role in that decentralized space good question um I think my I was talking with someone I forget who had coinmates but I think they said it well which is that like in a decentralized ecosystem it's not about all the players being decentralized or you know being structured in the same way it's about having a big diversity of players in the ecosystem that all have kind of like different influences and different strengths and weaknesses um and I think coinbase obviously is coming at it from the perspective of like how do we be a really good centralized actor in a decentralized ecosystem which I think is totally compatible like those two things are not incompatible you can have a decentralized ecosystem that many centralized um Afters for instance like ethereum core development all of those uh kind of core clients are actually built by and maintained by a centralized organization and that's okay because you have a large number of them that are coordinating and so I think like coinbase is kind of historical ethos is like we're going to be the good centralized actor in The broader crypto decentralized ecosystem I do think that that started to shift in the last two years um in particular I think we've realized that the future of our business is on these odd chain decentralized systems and I've actually like started to use the word on-chain and off Chain versus centralized and decentralized because I find it to be a much better descriptor um because you can actually have centralized and decentralized octane systems and centralized and decentralized on-chain systems I think what coinbase has realized is that all of our business today is not all of it but the vast majority of it is running on off chain systems um that are you know custodial and centralized um and built on this kind of web 2 infrastructure that the company was founded on in 2012 when there was no ethereum there were no smart contracts and then I existed um but that the future of our business and the future of the world's economy in the future really like the entire world is in on-chain systems that are written in smart contracts uh where there's a lot of decentralization but you also can have centralized parties uh acting in those on-chain systems and our like business is basically shifting around that insight to try and figure out how do we re-platform um and how do we shift you know from being 90 off chain 10 on chain to 100 on chain over the next five to ten years and so that's that's my mandate that's what I've been doing for the last year and a half two years um the blog post you mentioned was like directly coming out of that uh We've really been on a journey like a spirit Quest as a business trying to figure out what's going to be the Catalyst what's the infrastructure what what's the what are the pieces we need to put in place to accelerate that transition so that we can position ourselves for this new you know future that's coming and also so we can accelerate that future coming and make it happen faster um because the sooner we can get you know a billion two billion five billion people on chain um I think the better off the World's Gonna Be I love that I specifically really like the framework that you mentioned like it kind of distinguishing between decentralized centralized versus on and off chain I I like that quite a bit I guess like the experiment with the bass is one of the most like on-chain things you guys could do and I know that that's what most people hear like most excited about so I guess for those of you who don't know uh this is the L2 that coinbase was incubating it's built on top of optimism's op stack it's completely permissionless to build on top of Etc could you give a brief overview of what base is and I guess what what it aims to achieve as a project yeah um and you give a pretty good overview it's an ethereum L2 it's built on the open source op stack we're joining as the second core developer of the op stack um and our goal is to bring a million builders on chain who create actually useful applications that a billion people want to use so that that's what it is it's like it's our bet and investment that if we create a platform uh that makes it easy to build and we create a platform that connects into our consumer experiences to make it easy for users to actually do things that that can help bring about this kind of next phase the crypto economy or on-chain economy where everything's happening on chain um yeah that's what basis it's been it's the result it's Downstream of a lot of iterating um in 2021 I step back to my previous role came back took a few months off came back to coinbase and basically took on the Mandate of like figure out how to bring our business on chain um we iterated through kind of three or four different ideas um some of which are now kind of launching in various different forms um and all of them were kind of with this goal of like what's going to be the Catalyst to enable coinbase's business to move on chain um and I think that each of those kind of products that we were building and as we worked with kind of teams across the company what we saw consistently was they were getting stuck with like almost the simplest questions and those were like how do we build on chain I you literally what smart contract language are we using are we writing infinity and evm are you writing rust with Solana are we building Cosmos SDK app chains um and most people were kind of by default choosing evm that was like the kind of natural thing that people were doing but then even if they were making that decision they were then getting stuck with like where do we build on shame okay now I have the contracts where do we put them if we put them here is it going to work with our other products is it going to uh make the coinbase ecosystem stronger is it going to be helpful for our business like are we going to be in the wrong place because over here is going to be better and so so we in the beginning of 2022 basically identified as a business we need to get alignment on something so we aligned EDM as the toolkit and now it's kind of made in q1 of 2022 um uh and we aligned it on ethereum as the kind of L1 like the security context we're going to be deploying in and we identified that L2 was kind of where we wanted to be building consumer scale applications but then we really took the second half of 2022 to basically go and talk to every Altru team and build their own hypothesis it's around like how was this architecture actually going to shape up um and I think the thing that shifted in our perspective and we started that process being like there's gonna be one L2 and the thing that coinbase needs to do is like pick the winner and if we pick the wrong one that's gonna be really bad for our business and I think we ended that process actually thinking much more that there's been many of these things at least for the foreseeable future and in that world where there are many of these things coinbase having uh like an onshine native home on chain native developer platform that could give Surety to all of our teams but if they built there they knew it would just work and it would work with all of our developer tools we would work with all of our consumer experiences and it would be a platform where any third-party developer could also come and build and they would know it just worked and they knew that if they built there they would also get access to all coinbases distribution it kind of became a no-brainer where it was like oh duh like of course we want to contribute to scaling ethereum of course we want a native place in this crypto economy that's that's kind of coming together of course we want to be putting our resources in into these public goods that are so critical um and and that's the basis it's that that message I love that yeah it sounds like it commenting The Best of Both Worlds with like coinbases a robust engineering team and then obviously all the decentralization and composability that you get from building an L2 that's that's awesome I guess and I think also I'm sorry go ahead I was also saying not just the the centralization interoperability from building it all too but also from building on an open source MIT license toolkit you know that was a really important part of our process as well it's like how do we do this in a way that's not just like coinmates going off on our own and like doing something and everyone being like wow coinbase is creating an island but instead like doing in a way where it's a bridge where like if we do this right it will bring people in it will make it more interoperable it'll make it more freely available you know make these systems like more embody ethereum and the platform that ethereum's created I think that's been a core part of our egos from the beginning it's amazing you kind of touched on this a little bit but how does this complement coinbase's existing products and what are your guys's internal plans with base yeah and if you think about how coinbase is like the vast majority of our business it's basically by making it easy for people to use crypto but for the last 10 years like there's only been one use of crypto which is speculating and so we've only really made it easy for people to use crypto for one thing which is like buying and selling crypto um and I think our thesis with bass is basically like if we create a developer platform that allows our teams to build allows third-party ecosystem to build um and allows them to get interconnected into these these kind of interfaces that we've already built we're going to make it so there's a lot more things to do with crypto so instead of just trading you could also save and spend and borrow and land and do game music you know pick your thing it's going to come on chain um and in that world like the way coinbase went and the way we grow our business is by doing what we've always done which is making really easy for people to do that and So based in many ways is like a bet on developers it's a bet that we can like create more information which then Downstream creates more use cases which then Downstream creates more things for people to do in coinbase products um and then we can do that in a way that's like open and decentralized and not coercive and doesn't have the same lock-in as like the Apple App Store does where we're charging everyone a 30 fee and that that's going to be better for and that's going to be globally available and everyone's gonna you know increase their economic freedom as a result of it so that's that's the why that's the what in terms of our plans our plan is basically to make base the default experience across all the coinbase products and so that means that everything should just work um and I think our thesis is that um if you look at the last five years of crypto they've been very chain Centric you know like basically at the beginning of every experience we're asking the user like okay you want to use this app what infrastructure do you want to run it on gcp or AWS and like for the very small percentage of the population that's here that's worked um but for like the vast majority of people they don't care they just want to use the application and there's you know characteristics of the chain that I think are really important to enable the right kind of applications and to enable their Global accessibility in particular the centralization but beyond that I think that most users just want to use the application and so our thesis is like let's just provide a really great easy to use decentralized low-cost secure default still give users the opt-in if they want to change that experience that they run on different infrastructure um but really focus on just building high quality user experiences that people love so that's the plan I love that yeah you touched on two interesting aspects there's like the protocol and then there's like the applications on top of it and our portfolio which is entirely crypto native is kind of um pretty varied like there's there's a lot of protocols there's a lot of infrastructure protocols there's also a bunch of applications both Define consumer built on top of these things so I want to make sure that the next like 10 minutes or so the conversation we kind of touch on both of those needs so I guess I'd love to start with the protocol so how did you all decide on the op stack like is there a possibility that this wouldn't stay an optimistic Roll Up full term um yeah I'm just like curious why you guys are convinced that this is the best way to scale ethereum yeah great question um so how do we decide on the op stack um a bunch of different things went into it uh I think a lot of it started because we in the beginning of 2022 started working on um ethereum scaling ethereum through something called eip44 which is an upgrade to ethereum that's going to lower the cost of l2s by 10 to 100 x by creating something called blob space we can talk about that more people are curious you can also go to eip4844.com to learn more about it but we actually started working on that before base was even an idea like a twin coin or a because we wanted to scale ethereum and the people we started working with were optimism because they were the only other people in the industry who were like we see this Vision we want to put in resources and so we started building a relationship with the optimism team at the beginning of 2022 through that so I think that was like a really powerful contact like working on ethereum is this really powerful starting point and we've seen it kind of across a bunch of our relationships is that if you start working with people on like a common good like ethereum instead of easier to like ladder up into doing other things together um I I wouldn't discount that um beyond that the other things that are released to that test about optimism was were um the technology and this goes to your question around kind of uh optimistic Roll Up is it always be an optimistic roll up the way we're building the op stack is basically to be modular so if you think about a roll-up that's kind of a general construction and there's a bunch of different components of it there's the data availability I use like where is the role of transaction stored um there's the kind of sequencing protocol I.E like how are transactions ordered um and processed there's the proving uh protocol which is like how is this connected to the layer one that you're rolling up onto and how does the bridge actually function and I think our thesis is that um like those things can be uh pluggable uh and that over time what will happen is that because so much of this technology is open source uh you'll basically have many options for each of those things and you'll be able to choose the one that best fits your use case and so if you want the kind of like maximally secured and centralized thing you're going to use ethereum for data availability you're going to maybe use multiple provers uh multiple ZK approvers or multiple optimistic proofers for the kind of approving layer and then maybe you'll use something like um uh well like uh nav Boost Plus like the protocol like Suave uh for sequencing um you know all that has to get built out still but I I think our general perspective is like this isn't like based in optimism or not optimistic roll up the Roll-Ups and right now the best uh most secure kind of most proximate technology is optimistic provers but over time we're going to see more optimistic Crews be developed and we're going to see uh ZK approvers or validity proofers mature and more of them be developed and we're basically gonna have our pick of like what do we want to secure the chain with and so that's going to mean that this is going to start as an optimistic roll up but sometime in 2024 you know we'll have probably a ZK prover that'll slot in um bring some of the benefits of that so that was the second reason was the technology um I'd say the third reason was the way the technology is built like open source MIT license from the beginning that's kind of similar to ethereum and that felt really important to us we wanted to be contributing back to kind of that open source public good and then the the final piece um was that like I think optimism is a really good counterbalance to coinbase coinbase is like a centralized Legacy business optimism I think is like the most decentralized goes Forward Thinking organization on governance probably in the world right now and that complement felt very right it was like that's how we needed to balance ourselves like we couldn't go and work with the centralized players we needed to work with the maximally decentralized player because that was going to kind of Bring The Best of Both Worlds the best of coinbase is kind of know-how and distribution and kind of consumer trust with the best in the centralization um creating a really powerful package yeah it definitely sounds like a yin and yang I think that's what makes this partnership so cool and it's not only codified socially but it's also in the protocol right like I understand you're giving up some of the the transaction fee into the optimism Dow so could you speak a little bit more about that yeah yeah so we we're making a bunch of commitments as part of joining the the building on the op stack so first is we're contributing our resources to it so we have a five-person team now just working full-time on the op staff core development um uh we'll we'll gradually work towards having a separate client implementation um one of the things that I think we're all really excited about is making it so that uh there's many implementations of the op stack specification uh so we can kind of live up to the values of ethereum so that's the first big one it's like joining us the second core developer putting our best people on building the technology um uh the second one is we're doing a kind of Revenue share from the chain back to the optimism Collective to fund public goods we're not sharing the number of publicly right now but we will because it's going to be on chain like literally we're going to do the revenue share on train you're going to see the fees come in through the sequence server base and then you're going to see them get split in the contract on chain you're gonna see a portion of that go to the optimism Collective you can see the rest of it going to kind of uh the sequencing like coinbase vaults we're restoring those value um so that's the second big kind of commitment we've made and really excited about that I think it's no one's ever done this before like you've never had a Fortune 500 company do uh agreement with a Dao then it has a revenue share represented through a smart contract like that's totally novel um but I think really powerful and Powerful illustration of what's possible here um and then the third big piece is um we're committed to kind of building this vision of the super chain with them which we think is a world where we actually have many of these chains running in parallel that are going to share infrastructure like sequencing like Bridge uh like security councils that make it easier for people to get started um and make it easier for these things to work together so they have more interoperability and so increasingly uh the experience for users doesn't feel like there's many changes you have to be switching between but instead you're just using the applications and they're maybe homed on different like pieces of infrastructure um and my general mental model for this is if you think about web 2 and you think about the progression of um most kind of applications in web 2 they generally start in like a shared context um uh like a share compute context like an AWS or a Heroku or whatever people are using these days Railway why um and then as they grow uh they might expand to many shared contexts that would be like expanding to like multiple chains um the first one is like you deployed on one chain and then as they get even bigger they might actually have their own data center um uh where you run your own infrastructure and I think that's going to be like running your own chain and so I expect that as we kind of see the on-chain infrastructure uh continue to kind of emerge and grow you're going to see that same life cycle where applications start in a shared context then maybe they expand across many shared contacts because that gives them more distribution or more availability and then they almost reconsolidate um back into one kind of owned infrastructure context with entry points and all the other places um I think that's like this Vision that we're going to make possible together with optimism um through the use of Open Source MIT licensed fully you know freely available toolkits yeah this this idea of shared infrastructure is like it's kind of been replicated in a lot of different parts of like the crypto Stacks that's it's coolest thing that you guys are really leaning into that um I know there's a couple questions in the chat I definitely see them we will get to them um but before we kind of switch into the more like consumer-y part of the the questions that I have the last question I would say about the protocol is I think the whole crowd is wondering what is a decentralization roadmap so how are you guys all thinking about that how important is decentralization um of the entire stack of Base important to you guys yep uh one of our value our values for base are bridged on island which I talked about earlier this concept that we don't want to lock people into base instead we want to use it as a way for people to come from off chain to on-chain and then go anywhere uh that's the first one the second one is decentralized and open source that's pretty self-explanatory but that's one of our core values and then the third one is basis for everyone um and that's really all about it's not just for coinbase it's not just for defy it's not just for the United States it's for everyone every company every use case every country um base is built for you um and so we take decentralization very seriously um in terms of what's our concrete roadmap so we're basically running the same roadmap as optimism we've now committed our resources to that um and so when we launched base there will be a pretty meaningful amount of decentralization this is actually really important from a regulatory perspective um we can't be a sole custodian of a bunch of things um and so we're not talking about the specifics of that right now but we'll be starting tomorrow over the next couple months as we get closer streaming that um but there will be a a lot of conceptualization from day one that will enable base to remain permissionless open to everyone um and then from there uh we are basically executing against how do we decentralize the op stack as quickly as possible roadmap um so there's a few components of that that are kind of top of mind right now um one is decentralization of the upgrade Keys um so we're running a project object to expand the multi CPAP controls them right now having time delays and make it so uh there's more controls on what that multi-think can do that's the first one the second one is um uh something called output proofs which basically enables folks to withdraw from L2 even if the sequencer is down um and so that's the second big thing we're running and then the third one is around fault proofs which is going to make it so people can permissionlessly uh kind of challenge bad transactions for me from L2 to L1 um and so we have line of sight on shipping those things all this year um some of them coming out in Q2 some coming in Q3 except communion Q4 so a lot of work to be done and when we have all those or two or three of those we'll have uh base and options and may not be stage one Roll-Ups and then we'll be working in into uh in 2024 or tap then B stage two Alps queer arm side to that too that's awesome yeah I love it and then looking in decentralization in so many different aspects of the protocol that's that's awesome yeah and I just say last thing is like right now the governance uh and kind of execution of base is um all coinbase like I'm I work at coinbase I'm a coinbase employee but we expect that just to centralize over the next one in two years as well um so we're not talking exactly what that means but um it will happen yeah makes sense great so before we shift gears into opening it up for the Q a um one thing I definitely want to touch on is what are your what are your plans for getting people to build on top of Base so I'd love to switch gears into strategy like what do you think are the best sorts of projects and developers to build on top of Base what are the best user personas in your opinion yeah yeah so I I think about this generally in concentric circles um uh kind of like who who do we have to win in order to be to make base successful um and I think that at the center of the concentric circle is coinbase like if we don't win coinbase and help coinbase transition from an off game to on-chain business that I don't think Bays can be successful and so um that's not to say basis only for coinbase it's to say that like my mandate is to help a Fortune 500 company transition on chain because that can be the beacon on the hill for everyone else and so winning coinbase winning those thousand Engineers that work at client base uh the 4 000 people who work in coinbase and getting them all to be building on chain I think is like the P negative one that if we do it alone will have a huge impact like putting aside everything else that will be hugely impactful um so that's the starting point uh and I still spend a ton of my time internally just like driving line and getting people to think in an unte native way like literally last week I got looped in and it's like hey we're building this new product it's going to be awesome we're doing it all on quantumbase.com it's going to use all of our same service there we can get all this reusability I'm like no don't build a smart contract please and then we've been to this whole two-week process where it's like why are we building a story founder because of this how would that work this way what are the missing dependencies here and like that kind of Sherpa for the large business I think that's the kind of P0 um the Nets concentric circle is coinbase alumni and Venture companies um these are like Corpus is the largest Venture portfolio in the world uh in a crypto perspective I'm sorry Darien um uh we love variant but coinbase is Venture portfolio is just insanely large uh Emily Choi real real star um and then we have like the largest Alumni network in the world and all those people already get kind of like our values and who we are and what we grow up and so um I think bringing those people in and getting all done through building in the same place and like feeling that energy that they all were part of in some way but then opted to decentralize out of that's kind of like the next concentric Circle I think that's the really powerful kind of like decentralized developer ecosystem that will seed base and then the final continuing circle with everyone else like literally every builder in the world um I think can either build on base or can build an OP stack chain that will plug into the Super chain alongside base um and they are um we're running basically like a developer go to market uh which is very ethereum-centric um you know we had our big kind of coming out at Denver um we're going to be at a lot of the East Global events we're doing a lot of content creation um in general we're trying to give as much like support uh and resources to builders like y'all to get started building on chain uh if you haven't built on chain or get started building on base if you're already building someone else um so that's the that's the final concentric circle of developers there's one other big concentric Circle uh which is all of the web two companies in the world um and I think this is the place where kind of coinbase has an unfair Advantage because we are a Fortune 500 company and so we already have all these relationships with the name your fortune 500 and who's thinking about crypto and I think for them bases now just this like Natural Choice um where it's like oh here's the offering that looks like the other offerings but instead of being offered by someone we don't know and don't trust um this is now offered by like people we know and people we've got and so I think those people will be building right there use cases on face as well that's awesome foreign
