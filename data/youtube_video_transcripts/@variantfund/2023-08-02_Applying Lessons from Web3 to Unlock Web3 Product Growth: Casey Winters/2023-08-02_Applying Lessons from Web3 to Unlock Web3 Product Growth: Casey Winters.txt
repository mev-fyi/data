foreign thanks for for joining us today I know a bunch of you guys are in Paris at Paris including me so it's not um you know forgotten that this is 10 p.m and so we really appreciate your being here right now um but I promise it'll be really worth it today we have Casey Winters here with us who is leading a session about growth loops onboarding and product Market fit I'll give a brief run of the show for today before we dive in so first we'll hand it over to Casey to do a presentation that is really distilled from his years of experience leading product and leading growth then we'll take audience questions with Casey and so if you have questions that throughout the presentation just drop them into the chat and we'll address them at the end and then um before we wrap up we'll break out into small group discussions afterwards to synthesize takeaways and learnings for about the last 30 minutes so that's the agenda for today and before we get started I wanted to share a quick introduction for Casey so Casey Winters who is here with us is one of the foremost experts in the world about growth he I think unpacks growth topics in a way that is really incisive and actionable and really turns growth into a science that can be optimized and implemented in a really tactical way he's helped many web tube Brands and businesses across key milestones and reach the next levels of their businesses previously in his career Casey started the marketing team at GrubHub he led the growth product team at Pinterest and then most recently he worked as the chief product officer at Eventbrite during the very tumultuous pandemic years when events were obviously going remote and each of those roles Casey LED major expansion efforts that resulted in user growth for instance driving GrubHub from three cities to over a thousand cities optimize user Behavior each of those companies including increasing sign up conversion at Pinterest five-fold and he also bled various product pivots including refocusing Eventbrite strategy to Outlast the pandemic difficulties and so throughout all of these experiences he's gleaned a ton of insights about growth retention and onboarding that I think really transcend the web 2 world and are applicable for early stage Founders no matter what your vertical is and today Casey works as a strategic advisor for Tech startups and has worked with companies like Airbnb canva Fair what not Reddit Tinder as well as Greylock The Venture firm so without further Ado I'll turn it over to Casey for his presentation that he'll take us through thanks Lee for the great introduction I will try to share my screen um and then slideshow this everyone can see that okay okay excellent um well I don't need to cover this slide because they did a really good job um so I'll just uh skip straight to the content um but today we're going to talk about three topics basically product Market fit um developing growth loops and then onboarding and you'll see why those three are connected as I go through the presentation hopefully um so first um you're probably all obsessed over the concept of product Market fit and you know generally when I talk with Founders there's a lot of confusion on what it means to have product Market fit and you know if you go like Google advice on this the internet the you know the generally the best you get is something like this which is like oh people will use your product you'll love it they'd be pissed if it went away you know your main problem is that how do I get more customers not do I have a product that works and if you're like me and you're very quantitative you find this like absolutely unhelpful um and if you've gone deeper into the topic which I know you all have because um of who you've accepted money from you've read this post from Rahul the founder of superhuman and it basically adapts this concept called the Sean Ellis test into a more rigorous framework to see if you're on the path to product Market fit this post is great it's instructive it's also not what I want to talk about today because it's still uh a survey based meaning more qualitative view on what it means to find product Market fit uh you know and as Lee said a little bit more of a science person uh so I want I want practical data to say whether we have product Market fit or not so I'm going to walk you through what it takes to get build that data um so the first is figuring out what metrics actually matter and retention is usually where we start for 9 out of ten businesses sure there are some businesses that are not retention oriented which we could talk about those edge cases if you have a question there you know in the Q a but for most businesses we're trying to get people to use a product regularly and to do that we need to understand what is something they do in the product that we can measure that indicates the receiving the value we intend them to receive we call that the key action in reforge parlance um and secondly we're trying to figure out how often we should expect the user to want to receive that value which we call the designated frequency so you know for GrubHub going through this exercise super easy there's only one thing you can do it's order food and have it show up and be you know tasty and people did this activity before the internet existed they ordered food they just used the phone to call the restaurant they waited on hold you know all that kind of stuff so you can look at how often they did that to try to determine what your designated frequency should be and we found that most people order food once or twice a month back then so we set our designated frequency Target as monthly super simple no controversy but in trying to replicate this exercise for Pinterest it's a lot harder not a transactional business so there's actually lots of things you can do inside the Pinterest product you can save content we show you for later you can click through to the content to learn more about it and potentially buy it whatever or you could just browse lots of content so we actually had to do more analysis to say which of these best correlates to us seeing that real product value has been delivered click through had click bait issues you know browsing could show a lot of intent but us actually not servicing the right content for you so saving was definitely the best in terms of we recommended something you liked it enough that you wanted to get back to it later um offline analog was also like fairly easy for Pinterest what did people do to browse content related to their interests prior to the internet they browse magazines magazines came on a monthly and weekly or Weekly subscription so we originally set the destiny frequency monthly as a growth leader I found that way too easy to optimize for it's just like super easy for me to send a push notification to get someone back at least once a month with cool content so we ended up shifting that to weekly but this just gives you a framework to start on um you know what's the action I'm trying to measure and how often should I expect the user to receive it so when you have these two concepts then you can actually build a typical retention curve through cohort analysis right where the y-axis is that key action and the x-axis is the designated frequency it could be days it could be weeks it could be months depending on the natural you know frequency of your product and if you have a product on the path to product Market fit you start to see a graph that looks like this where the the number of people that started using your product of course a bunch of people will drop out of the code word even the best uh products you know on the market have people that don't retain but for a product that's product Market fit you see this flattening out where some people will continue to use the product and basically this graph of usage will never cross the x-axis you know eventually 50 years from now people will die and stuff but you know if you think in on a 10-year time Horizon uh you see this kind of flat retention curve over time and that tells you you're delivering core product value consistently for you know a certain percentage of the users in this case it would be you know around 20 25 of users is where the the line finds but this is not enough to say that yeah product Market fit is just kind of the first step um I've lost my ability to move forward here okay there we go the second question for product Market we just want to spend most of our time on today is can you grow with the level of retention you have um and normally the way we measure being able to grow uh is the ability to acquire users unless the amount of money you make from them uh and we use the concept of payback period uh mainly to measure that so payback period says hey if I spend this amount of money to acquire a user how long does it take me to make that money back in their usage of the product right and for early stage startups you might want to keep that timeline really tight like a few months and then as you get bigger you can extend that to six months or maybe a year you know some SAS companies that have very predictable Revenue even go beyond a year payback period and they're very comfortable with that because they just they know they'll eventually make it back basically the more history you have the more risk you can take with payback period uh and if you're not making any money like when I joined Pinterest you have to be able uh to use your retained users to grow the number of new users without spending money so things like paid acquisition and sales are you know out of the window um and then you could kind of have this this graph that can show both of the things that matter for product murder fit on the same graph which is you know do I have a flat retention curve at some level and is that flatware attention curve allowing me to scale new user growth over time right and this in particular would be an example of a graph that has like a fairly healthy product Market fit uh score in my opinion so how do you actually go get some of those new users we're going to talk about that for a little bit and there's really two types of growth uh that people get confused about you know in in building startups and I call them Kindle strategies and Fire strategies so the Kindle strategies are the things you use to get your first users um mainly what you care about when you're getting your first users is not gross it's getting just enough users in there to validate if your core product value hypothesis is correct or not like am I bringing in these users and they're finding something a value a value that they want to stick around and allows you to test which audiences you know actually are finding that value Fire strategies are when you've already identified your core product value and you're trying to scale to the broadest audience possible and unfortunately at least in the web 2 world there's only a few strategies that work as Fire strategies that can really scale uh you dramatically into you know hundreds of millions of Revenue or IPO or whatever that Benchmark is um the other thing about Kindle strategy is beyond just bringing Just Enough users to measure if uh if your core product value there is they can also help you unlock a fire strategy that may not be available to you immediately um you know upon starting a company so this is an example of this on the right hip Camp is a company I started working with when they were at the seed stage and hip Camp knew they wanted to grow bookings on the demand side primarily through SEO there's a lot of search volume for like you know camping near me or you know camping near Yosemite or whatever and hip Camp's just a Marketplace for Unique campgrounds but in order to rank for terms like that Google has to trust you and the way Google primarily trusts you is who else links to you and how trustworthy those people that link to you are so if the New York Times links to you they're very trustworthy if my blog links to you I'm not really as important as the New York Times so it doesn't matter as much so what we did at hip Camp is uh there was a solar eclipse in 2017 we built a landing page that showed you all of the campgrounds you could book that would give you an amazing view of the solar eclipse and then we spammed every press Outlet we could especially in all of these areas across the US um the story about how to have a great view of the solar eclipse we got a bunch of people write us up got a bunch of people linked back to us and then that helped us develop our domain Authority which is now made SEO the primary Channel with which hip Camp uh gets bookings and now you know it's a CDC company it's much bigger um you know that strategy of sequencing from a Kindle strategy to a fire strategy it has worked okay uh Kindle strategies don't work for very long uh you know when when Paul Graham talked about do things that don't scale on his blog this type of stuff that he's talking about um Kindle strategies either have very limited scale or they're just too expensive to do at dramatic scale um and unlike Fire strategies which I said there's just only a few of them that work at scale um a lot of the Kindle strategies we see startups employ are very like bespoke like you don't really see them do the same ones across a bunch of ones now paid acquisition is like a as a counter to that a lot of people will just buy their first users to validate product Market fit and then start to figure out like if that's the scalable solution or if there's something else um but you've seen some really weird  like you know Airbnb selling cereal or or hacking Craigslist those were two different things they did uh that were Kindle strategies um and it's really just focused on can you do things quickly um to get users in uh and do they give you some Edge in making one of these more scalable strategies possible you know mid to long term so the Fire strategies are you know sustainable growth levels reforest called growth Loops uh and uh like I said there's only a couple uh that uh tend to work uh at scale and you know we'll go through all of them sales probably the most common one people think about and this is effectively when you have a good enough monetization uh to you know put that Revenue you're making back into hiring sales people and paying them commissions and going out and buying leads uh and the more Revenue you bring in the more sales people and leads you can buy and you can kind of continue to fill it out it's never super cheap to be growing via sales but it is fairly predictable uh paid Acquisitions the second one that I think most people are familiar with and it's got a very simpler a very similar uh growth model uh to sales uh except you know instead of hiring sales people uh you're just focused on taking the extra lifetime value you're getting out of purchases and you know using that to buy more ads to find more people who also generate lifetime value and completing that process and you know this um it tends to be a cautionary tale to rely on this entirely for startups because with paid acquisition you get um you know a soundgard has a song called it pretty noose right and and paid acquisition is pretty news because the first time you know you go Target people you target the best people they have great conversion rates um they have great activation rates they have great retention rates they're ltvs through the roof and but then you start reinvesting that and you have to expand the target audience and then when you expand the target audience product Market squeaker conversion rate gets a little bit worse activation rate gets a little bit worse uh retention gets a little bit worse which means your payback period goes up and that at some point you may not even have an effective payback period you know five years from now and you've seen this with a lot of companies that have gone public a lot of the specs look like this just total Reliance on paid and now they can't grow uh profitably anymore content is really the one that I've most focused on in my career um and it's also I think the least understood and this is about you have a volume of content uh that you can distribute through basically any network larger than yourself to try to expose people to your product in some way that can bring them in uh to start creating content themselves SEO is the most common one like using Google as the network but you can use any social network Facebook Instagram Tick Tock Twitter whatever online communities you know like Reddit um and that's just a mass a massive amount of content and you have to be able to distribute it quite effectively because the conversion rate of people seeing a piece of content going to your you know product you know becoming a user and then creating their own content tends to be not that high so this tends to be the one that takes the longest to start working but once it starts working it can be very sustainable and generally outside of a few like really high uh monetizing niches like healthcare uh or like big time Enterprise businesses the in order for you to scale content Loops as a strategy you have to get your users to create content um in order to just get enough of it to scale and this is certainly you know how Pinterest works and we'll talk about that um last but not least I think the most understood there's literally a book called viral Loop uh if you want to go deep into it is for reality and this is you know getting users to tell others about the product and which means your core flow has to build sharing into it and you need to focus on figuring out the right incentive to get people to share is if they want to look cool is that they want to collaborate or is it they want to get paid um you know those are basically the three viral Loops tend to grow the fastest but they tend to you know have the shortest lifetime in terms of working you know as a fire strategy so none of these are perfect uh but you know these are generally the four options you know startups have and this is no longer okay there we go um so you know the general thing that I counsel Founders on is that um you don't want to wait until you have great retention to determine what your fire strategy is going to be you need to be baking how are you going to grow at scale into your product Market fit hypothesis so that when you know you're delivering core product value that second part of the graph starts to take care of itself either through invites or through user generate content or you know through just monetizing really effectively and being able to reinvest that and say it you know uh sales or marketing right so don't wait until you know you have a product that works to figure out how you're going to acquire any users it might be too late you might need you might find you need to completely re-architect the product to get the second part of product Market fit to work which means in my opinion quantitative product Market fit represents satisfaction that creates sustainable growth satisfaction nine times out of ten is going to be measured by retention you know that cohort analysis retention curve and sustainable growth is going to be measured by the effectiveness of an acquisition growth Loop that's driving you know new users per month up on you know a consistent basis all right uh and in my career um generally there's one acquisition Loops that drives most of the early growth um so you can see here some examples of companies have either worked with as an operator as an advisor the supply side of marketplaces is almost always sales right um pay acquisition not as much my jam uh I did it as a secondary driver at uh GrubHub but it wasn't the main driver but Lyft company I worked with it was the main way they acquired Supply and you see a lot of you know consumer subscription companies choir Supply and of course Tick Tock famously spending just billions of dollars on paid acquisition to grow its Network um content being the primary way you know as an operator or both as an advisor I help companies Drive growth so you can see a lot of the companies I've worked with as an advisor this has been the main thing they've used to drive growth uh most of the time this just ends up being through SEO on Google but not always um and then virality people think of it mostly as like a consumer social lever but you can see here a couple of examples where like in fair use morality and B2B um which is really interesting Lyft used incentivized referrals you know to drive you know demand um as well okay so what's it look like to work on one of these Loops so this is the example of the Pinterest growth Loop that I helped build so when um when Pinterest started growing it grew mainly on top of Facebook by you signing up with a Facebook account and anytime you saved content it would be distributed to your Facebook feed and all your friends would see it they would click on the content and then they would sign up for for Pinterest and then Facebook turns the open graph off and Pinterest stops growing so this is when Pinterest brought me in and they said hey Casey we think SEO is going to be the lever that's going to work for us but we don't know anything about SEO I'm like cool I got you like did this apartments.com did this at GrubHub and and this is the loop we built which is we take the Pinterest content which was primarily boards created by users on different topics could be wedding dresses it could be men's fashion whatever we distribute those to Google we get them to start ranking for when people are typing in you know Chukka Boots or mahandy wedding ideas whatever we then allow users to see a free preview of all that content but as they start scrolling or as they start clicking into images we block them and ask them to sign up to see more because you're not really getting the true Pinterest value prop by just browsing one topic of Interest then as you sign up we activate the user with relevant content related to their interests and we we allow them to get the extension that allows them to save other content from the internet and then that does two things when people see a feed of content related to their interest and they start saving things it gives Pinterest more signal on the content that works and when they start saving new content uh from outside the internet it gives Pinterest just more content both of which improve the content that we can show to Google and its users to drive more users and this has now been the primary driver of growth of Pinterest for you know seven eight years now um but we had to build it from scratch in 2014. Eventbrite somewhat similar still what I would call a Content Loop but a little bit different in that an event Creator comes to Eventbrite and they put they create an event listing page of an event they're going to host you know in the real world uh the Creator then goes but and does a bunch of their own marketing to share that event with potential people who are interested and bring them to Eventbrite to transact and for sex while doing if they're successful at doing that they will sell tickets consumers will attend the event and then wow it turns out a lot of those creators end up a lot of those consumers end up becoming event creators themselves and hosting future events on Eventbrite and then also with this you know middle uh uh Arrow uh indicates is when creators are effective at selling tickets they tend to come back and they put on more events so this was the primary way Eventbrite grew in the early days so a different form of a Content Loop so when you think about growth in Loops it really changes the way you approach growth inside an organization because I would say when people are thinking about growth and in terms of more dated Concepts like funnels uh they tend to just focus on the top like how do I get new acquisition channels how do I get more users but when you model loots you realize it's the retention of the users that matter as better retention makes every way that you acquire new users easier so if you're retaining more users uh and you primarily acquire via sales and you have better lifetime value to reinvest in BGN and hiring more sales rep for paid you have better Lifetime and value which allows you to invest in more ads and have a more effective payback period if you are primarily going through content the retain users just create more content which means you have more distribution of content to bring in new users and for reality retained users have more opportunities to invite or refer you know others literally all of these uh retention just makes everything easier and generally the biggest lever to improving retention is onboarding so uh I would say when I talk with startups they typically think retention is driven by adding new features that make the product more valuable uh and I would say the opposite is generally true um frequently that just makes the product more complicated and harder for new users to understand and therefore they they activate worse over time because it's harder to figure out what the core product value is so nine times out of ten reducing friction through making it easier to connect to the product initially uh is the biggest retention win you can find uh and something you know that I've worked with dozens of startups on at this point so what's actually the job of onboarding uh and I think this is something that a lot of startups get wrong the job of onboarding is to get users to retain long term so if we go back to this graph earlier and we separate the people who churn out of the system and the people who actually onboard effectively right onboarding's job is to get you to the point where you stop losing people in the darker blue right where you get that uh people who are going to continue to go uh and use the product on whatever time period you know makes the most sense so we had a third concept to the product Market fit graph that we talked about earlier just not only do we have the y-axis which is the key action uh and the x-axis which is um the designated frequency we also have this like retention interval which is how long does it take to tell if someone's going to build a habit and you basically you know in this graph it's when you stop seeing any more dark blue you know over time um and uh we call the the time when um people realize they're going to continue to use this thing and they've already built a habit The Habit moment and we Define that with a habit metric which is what in our data allows us to tell that the person has built a habit and it's going to continue to use you know this product you know regularly and if you're trying to get as many people as possible to this habit metric you have to work backwards to what's the right product experience that's going to get them to reliably build the Habit so generally the first thing you do is you try to figure out well if there's a habit around doing the key action at the designated frequency how do I get them to do that the first time and you know we call that the aha moment as measured by the AHA metric and then you can work backward from that and say what work does the user and the product need to do to most reliably give a good chance that a user will experience the aha moment and we call that the setup moment and the setup metric and I'll you know explain how you know you use these Concepts uh in practice so let's take Pinterest so you know the the typical like funnel based approach uh to this problem would be you bring in traffic like in in you know our case we started bringing it in from Google and uh you know Pinterest uh wanted to activate people mostly on mobile so we we try to get app downloads then you try to get people to sign up uh and none of that is like you know onboarding quite yet uh what was happening after sign up when I joined Pinterest is we were connecting you with friends and with influencers and then showing you the content that they saved and that worked really great when all the people you're acquiring were moms in the midwest it did not work great when you were acquiring you know uh people on the coast people in different genders people in different countries uh the content relevance just wasn't working out so we switched the model um to have people uh tell us what topics they were interested in um then we focused the first user experience on teaching them you know how to save and get them to their first save that became the AHA metric and if you saved in the fourth week we knew you would save in the fifth sixth 125th like you had built the habit of using Pinterest to find you know cool content related to your interests so um once you know uh like using your data and running some experiments what the Habit metric is um then you actually have to optimize the experience and this was the experience that you got when you signed up for Pinterest when I joined a company you see there's a lot going on here it's not really that clear what you're supposed to do there's a bunch of different content related different topics um you know you can invite friends you can find friends there's all sorts of metadata so one of the things we just started doing is like simplifying this experience pretty dramatically so hey turns out friends is not the best way to find interesting content so let's delete that um uh well it turns out we shouldn't be asking you to invite friends until you're activated so let's delete that and finding friends is not the best way to find interesting content so we should delete that module these are outdated Concepts um then [Music] um thinking about attribution of where pins came from it's a little bit too early to explain that we haven't explained how to save content to boards so we should be removing that from the experience we also should be removing pin descriptions because um the main thing that attracts people to activating is just seeing cool images related to uh their topics of Interest uh and you know attribution from like the websites and metadata from the insights is interesting and Rose Burns cute and all but that's actually not roseburn so we had some major issues related to the quality of some of our data and we shouldn't be showing you know wrong data to users because that you know prevents people from activating so all this stuff we just deleted from the product and we raised the activation rate as a result of keeping the product you know more focused on what got people to actually build a habit of using us um and one of the things we realized in doing that is that our mobile app activated at 3x the rate of the website um so whenever people were coming in from mobile web uh we just pushed them to the app as aggressively possible and we start up with the way Apple recommends which by the way is the worst converting uh variant we've ever tested um so what Apple recommends turns out it's not a good idea um then we shifted to you know a full page takeover um with our value prop and how we had you know high ratings um with kind of what the product looks like in the background and then we just kept iterating kept running more a b tests so then it's like okay let's use animated gifs related to the content you're about to see let's change the CTA to continue instead of download um Let's uh make it a header that you could scroll past and actually see all the content on the board and then when you click on the content will push you to the app uh uh and then this is you know kind of became like the more dominant version where it's like a representation of what a board looks like a b tested copy a b tested imagery a b tested ctas you know all of which had Mass improvements on the amount of people that actually you know got the app which was a a better uh converting experience but then we ran into a bunch of issues you know with Once people got the app there were a bunch of conversion issues that were printing them from experiencing the value so before we used to ask you you know to um you know sign up and give you a bunch of information first thing we tested was splitting that into steps and giving a progress bar to show that it wasn't that much effort and this improved you know conversion rate to completing sign up and uh then we started trying to get more information that would help us activate better like knowing your gender you know helps us uh improve activation rate um then we started seeing if we could consolidate these fields so we could pick up your email address automatically using Android permissions um uh things like that uh we redesigned this uh flow based on what we were learning from the mobile app from the mobile web experiments and that had higher conversion rate and then we got to a point where we're just dramatically able to shrink the amount of steps so we went from five steps to three where two of them are uh actually not required like you cannot give us your gender or not give us your age and we will pick up your email address automatically we'll pick up your name automatically by reading the contact list and then we'll just get you right into the hard step which is picking five topics then we know that we have cool content to show you that's you know going to give you a high chance of activating into a retained user so this is a ton of a b testing once you know your growth Loop optimizing every step to get it to turn as fast as possible and for us you know all the biggest experiments were in onboarding we could probably spend an hour on the SEO experiments or things like that as well but um this is really uh where the the biggest impact tends to happen uh we also started removing distractions on the mobile experience so removing you know descriptions getting more content in the flow removing you know Footers that we had in the experience all sorts of things like that just to keep it really focused on showing you cool content related to your interests but we did add some education to make it really clear on how to use the product effectively which is really scrolling tapping and saving content um so that like actually like pulses around the the save CTA button uh we actually changed that it used to say pin it and then we did a test changing it to say save and that alone was a 15 Improvement in activation rate so it's not like all of these are major overhaul sometimes it's just really thinking about how to make it very clear for the user what to do in the next step okay so what happens from all of this type of work you you understand what your growth Loop is you've got it working you're tracking people and now you want to optimize it well in this case um we were able to double the activation rate from sign up to retain users in a year and a half through all this work and that does a bunch of the experiments I just showed you experiments I could show you also would show how a 5x conversion rate um on the web uh the other things I showed you today is how we you know improved mobile conversion rate from download to sign up by 30 percent um so once you really understand like what your growth loop is and what the constraints are you can just iterate endlessly on it to continue to improve the metrics and continue to grow you know quicker and quicker um it's not always you know this easy right you're going to find points where like you just can't move activation rate or higher you can't get any more traffic and you're needing to need to think about you know other growth loops and there's certainly examples you know of that from Pinterest and Eventbrite but this is more like what an early stage growth Team Works on you find the growth Loop that works and then you're a dog with a bone and you just grind on it you know you run a bunch of experiments you improve every step of the loop um and you'll be surprised at how much better you can grow as a business right and this basically has fueled uh Pinterest growth from 40 million to over you know 500 billion users so um you know at that point I'm like okay I got all this onboarding stuff figured out right I've done so many experiments I know how to optimize conversion I know how to optimize you know retention rates uh and then I joined Eventbrite and then it's a very very different Beast um so with Pinterest it's a consumer product and with a consumer product um a lot of times people are coming in with not very high intent right they don't know what it is they'll check it out if it's cool they'll stick around if it's not they'll build right and Pinterest in particular it's a very hard product to describe so really we just want you to get in and experience it because then it personalizes and you start seeing more cool stuff so everything you saw in all these experiments is around how do we remove friction uh that prevents people from experiencing their product value but add friction um if we know we're unlikely to show you there's real product value if you don't get it like you know making people pick topics so you know the core thesis was you know get to the product value as fast as possible but not faster uh like if you're skipping steps that's converting people from seeing something cool don't skip those that'll just drop activation rate Eventbrite where I'm mainly acquiring businesses and these are very small businesses they're you know events businesses but they are businesses they are more rational they know what problem they're looking to solve and they are willing to spend more time learning a product to see if it can solve it so at Eventbrite we don't hyper focus on removing like every possible step of friction from the process we more so focus on how do we communicate all the value in a way that's sequenced to understanding you know uh why they should stick around and continue to use this product and run their events business on it right so on the time to get people to you know the aha moment or even the Habit moment um eventbrite's kind of in the middle on the scale and on the right of the scale you have your super Enterprise companies where you know you're selling to hyper rational big business they're willing to penitentially spend six months of investment before they actually start seeing the value right uh and this is you know how a lot of Enterprise sales works right takes a while to implement it takes a while to get the sale done all of that kind of stuff so what you want to try to understand is where are where's your products on the Spectrum are you hyper consumer like Pinterest where it's like get them into the product value as soon as possible understand the few constraints you need to add so they're actually actually going to activate are you more like an Enterprise business where like you're gonna sell on the dream it might take six months to a year to achieve the dream but you know you're gonna have Champions inside the company that back that and push you all the way to the end or are you somewhere in the middle like Eventbrite which is you know more of your classic plg SAS sort of uh growth model even though it's actually not SAS which we could talk about um where you know you've got time but you don't have infinite time uh to really show that you can help you know your customers you know grow be more successful happier all that kind of stuff so this important thing to think about you know as you build your companies where do you feel like you are because your approach is to the onboarding of your product you're going to change uh how much humans are involved is going to change right how many steps and how much time it's going to take to activate it's all going to change based on this info so okay um totally uh down for kind of the next phase of the process in Q a uh if you want to dive deeper into this stuff I have a whole six week course on reforge on you know retention engagement that deals into effective onboarding uh and also a course called Advanced growth strategy which talks about how to build growth Loops um so if you want to dig into that in a way more depth obviously head over to reforge but I'm also happy to take questions now and you know anything I discussed thank you so much Casey that was awesome um chat has been going wild with questions um which we'll definitely get to um if you're able to go over the top of the hour a little bit um so I think let's prioritizing and grouping together some of the clusters of questions um I think a big theme of the presentation here was about how to get users to the aha moment more quickly or how retention is kind of dependent on um sustainable like satisfaction that users are getting some sort of value that they they want from a product I think a lot of the founders in this particular Zoom chat are really really early and perhaps at an even earlier stage of their businesses where they're still trying to identify what is the key action in my product that I'm trying to drive users towards and there's hypotheses there but they might not know conclusively and so is there advice that you would offer to really early stage Founders who have yet to really crystallize their product Market fit in terms of how you explore the potential Pathways of how to get there how to even identify the key action and maybe this draws on some of your experiences at Eventbrite too where um you experience those uncertain market conditions and were first forced to Pivot the product in a complete action yeah so uh I will I will cover it for different business models and then talk about like the Eventbrite case in particular so there's really um three different pieces of advice I give depending on the type of business you're building on the path to product Market fit um so I have a post I wrote unlike generally the two Frameworks in product Market fit that are most popular in the world which is like For Better or Worse called I call the Eric grease model and the key for boy model and both of them have pros and cons I'm not religious about either one of them being like correct um but let's break it down by business model so if you are building an Enterprise company um congratulations you picked the easy path to building a startup um doesn't mean it's easy but it means the Playbook is just most developed in terms of the path to product Market fit right which is you get your teeth into some type of archetype customer right you try to understand every problem they're having you start seeing which problems potentially there are better software solutions for you start building them testing them and getting them to a point where that customer is excited you know to pay for that and then you hopefully are doing that with a customer that's representative of a much larger base right and in that case you're just going to look you know at you know how much money you're making versus the cost of sales and the retention of those customers it's a fairly simple model doesn't mean there's not a lot of hard work involved but like uh Founders are generally less confused about where they are in the process um and then when you move that into like more plg SAS which is like I want the products to grow rather than like you know handshakes and steak dinners um then still the model is fairly similar you're just generally using something else besides Enterprise sales that's the acquisition lever you need to have a great self-serve product onboarding flow instead of like manual training uh those people either need to be creating content that they share with their teammates or they need to be paying you a bunch of money because you've got like a great freemium model that gets them uh to a paying model very quickly uh so you're just trying to see like okay what sort of features am I building that people start to use regularly which ones are they not using regularly why are they not and you run this kind of data plus uh qualitative research you know loop on as many customers as possible um and you know Dropbox and slack were kind of the first couple companies that done that and now you know people built that into more of a Playbook like the Notions the air tables the world Etc so that's starting to become a lot more common uh then when you move into marketplaces uh oh things get a lot harder um uh because you're actually Building Product for two customers at the same time supply and demand um but there's still a Playbook here which is you're trying to understand what's the shape of the network you're trying to build is it local uh is it category specific you know in the case of like what not just started with Funko Pops as their initial Market you know GrubHub Bobby started in one neighborhood in Chicago uh and then you have to understand how much Supply do I need in the market to create a reliable product for demand so in the case of you know GrubHub I need 50 restaurants to be able to have enough uh variety for people to come in and have a high enough conversion ordering food and retaining into ordering food regularly and then once you build that then you're building kind of a repeatable Playbook of how do I get to 50 restaurants how to expose those 50 restaurants to enough users that the restaurants are going to stick around turns out in our case the restaurants needed two orders a day to feel like it was valuable enough so that became an easy benchmark um so you're just trying to like map the shape of the network effect you're gonna get like a really clear metric on Supply really clear metric on demand that indicates product Market fit which mostly we call liquidity in marketplaces and then you're like how do I stamp that across categories or across um geographies um to to expand right so hard generally takes longer to find product Market fit than most Enterprise companies or plg SAS companies but a more durable form of product Market fit because it'll be Network powered once you find it and then last but not least is consumer more like social products or consumer single player products and you know I'd rethink your life decisions if you decided to start a company in one of those spaces because dear God it is impossible um I just wrote a post on consumer subscription and why that's so incredibly difficult um if you want to dig into that concept but consumer social uh is worse because with consumer social the value prop is network based uh but there's also something you're doing inside the network so in order to validate um your product your core product value hypothesis you have to go not only launch the product to a certain number of people you have to guess who's the right people and what's the right size of network um and then when it doesn't work you are not sure if you launched to the wrong people if you have the wrong value prop or if you have all those things right and you just don't have enough people uh to consistently expose the value prop to create you know a habit uh formation so generally with consumer social Founders do is that you have a really strong hypothesis on the target market like you know Evan Spiegel at snap right it was like he was a USC student at the time you knew exactly who he was building for right or um or they go really big on network uh to try to make sure that they're not going to lose based on the network size being wrong and then it's really just testing you know uh core product value or or target audience so you're seeing this play out right now with threads right threads is launched inside a massive company of course in meta and they're like YOLO we're just gonna launch it we're gonna have 100 million people sign up 80 million or something are gonna churn because the product doesn't have product Market fit for them and through 100 million people of various shapes and sizes trying it we're gonna hopefully see some that we find product Market fit with we'll understand from the other from the 80 million that churn why we didn't have product market today and we could decide if we want to expand the product to those use cases over time obviously you're not going to replicate that strategy because you don't have 2 billion Instagram customers to spam for free like they do um but it's just really hard to parse out these different elements so your product Market fit hypothesis to understand like which one's off like Clubhouse thought they had it and they went big and then they went too big with the network and it ruined the product Market fit in my opinion and they've never recovered um so you know generally not my favorite business to start even though I've LED growth one of them before um uh but there's just these different questions that you have to run through in terms of the Playbook based on the business model you're trying to build uh okay so that was the first part of the question second part of the question was uh Eventbrite so there's a couple parts of the story right so for those of you who are not familiar I joined Eventbrite nine months before the pandemic um and I knew it was a turnaround situation uh the company was not growing fast enough to be considered a growth company on the public markets and it was primarily my job to fix that so you know first you're kind of auditing everything that's being done by the current team less relevant for Founders but in my opinion like there's a lot of stuff that shouldn't be done there was a lot of saying yes to ideas not a lot of being focused and saying no to the right ideas so right around the time I get really good at auditing all of that and understanding you know what parts the strategy make sense what part of this so the strategy don't make sense the pandemic hits and revenue goes below zero which didn't even know is possible but that's when you're processing more refunds than transactions per day and this is because you know every country operated in had made Live Events legal uh and online events was less than one percent of Revenue at the time um so fortunately for me um it was enough time to know exactly what um was wrong with our initial strategy um and what we should focus on for the long term but of course there's a lot of shiny new objects in that period of time hoppin had raised a bajillion dollars you know meta Google Amazon we're all coming out with these online event products you know our online event revenue is obviously going through the roof so a lot of people wanted us to just become an online events company and I think from my perspective I was like look this is hot right now but assuming we don't all die from the pandemic we will eventually go outside again and when we do that this Market will still be a very tiny subset of the in-person event Market um and uh not really play to our core competencies because we don't know anything about video historically as a you know 14 year old events company and um it'll be a pretty impressive competitive landscape um that would be competing against if that market is durable right obviously well-funded startups as well as big incumbents you know jumping into to The Fray so just didn't see a path for victory there um and so as we looked at some other things that we're showing promise like helping event creators get better with their own marketing and building out more of a marketplace where we're driving more of the demand directly instead of the Creator doing their own marketing to drive demand we thought those were things that played more to our core competencies better uh that were eventually going to be larger markets than online events uh and be less competitive uh than than online events so you know to the dismay of some people inside my team we went and bet on the world returning to Live Events eventually we'll make some online event Revenue you know in the interim but we'll just integrate with zoom instead of build our own thing and you know that's turned out to be the correct strategy you know uh eventbrite's now been cash flow positive for six straight quarters and he's growing you know healthily uh but there were some dangerous moments in between um so that's not necessarily replicable for U.S startup Founders right because I had you know 14 years of data I had the knowledge of everything that was being worked on and what was actually helping Drive growth versus not drive growth I had millions of customers to talk to um and you know we mined all of that and I wrote that document in a day I wrote that document on a Saturday and shared it with you know the CEO and the rest of the executive team on a Sunday we started pitching it to private Equity that Monday so like we didn't have time to debate you know for multiple months of what the strategy needed to be nor do you all as Founders generally right um but uh it wasn't that in one day I figured out what to do it's that for nine months I've been learning about the business and it became crunch time and you know we were ready to make the right calls right yeah that makes a ton of sense so kind of like based on the data formulating a lot of hypotheses also um gathering information about the competitive landscape all of that led to um a kind of data driven but also partially intuition driven decision about where to go with the product yep um I want to switch gears so there's also like a vein of questions um that have been asked about tokens which I will sort of up level into your thoughts on financial incentives as it relates to growth and sustaining retention obviously um that has worked to great effect um but not sustainably in a lot of web 3 networks and so um I guess like the question is like how effective are Financial incentives in generating growth and can that last and what would your advice be there yeah so I think you know a lot of my peers in growth uh and certainly in the VC Community I'm sure use obviously um we're like oh my God crypto solves acquisition problems because we can just incentivize users with you know virtual currency that didn't exist before to motivate them not only to you know retain try but also bring other people into the fold and I think I was always like yeah it's only ever that easy um because if you incentivize to product Market fit you did not get to product Market fit because part of evaluating product Market fit is evaluating you know price to value and incentives change that dramatically in a way that isn't sustainable three six months 12 months down the line so generally my advice the founders is you want to pull incentives out of the core product value hypothesis because as soon as saving money or making money becomes part of the core product value hypothesis it will subsume everything else um so we saw this at GrubHub right if you gave a discount on first order the value prop became saving money on food rather than ordering food online uh which is what we really wanted the value prop to be so we did not incentivize first order a lot of our uh competitors did and what do you know we found that they had like retention rates that were like half of what ours were um it's just not a good way to sell and what you generally want the value prop to be which is not you know uh money related incentives are really useful um uh potentially to get people to The Habit moment to get people to try something that's kind of scary but then the core value prop is strong enough to stand on its own after an initial experience or to increase the engagement of people who already have some form of habit built so some of the things we did at GrubHub which are relevant here are um you know we built like a game that you played after every third order that gave you a one in four chance of winning free food and it was unbelievably profitable um because people that were using GrubHub occasionally but not for every time they ordered food all of their ordering to Grub up so they could play the game more um and the game is variable reward game so like you could win everything from as small as a free drink to free food for a year uh and you know there's some core psychology hypothesis in here which is you know what are you doing after you order food it turns out a whole lot of nothing until the food shows up so we had this captive audience to like do something with we decided to create a game because of the unit economics of GrubHub uh and it worked out you know really well in terms of driving more engagement so I think Financial incentives to drive things that are valuable to the company um uh that you can model out an A B test unbelievably good so Financial Financial incentivized referrals have worked very scalably as a solution for a lot of marketplaces doordash Uber Lyft Etc nothing wrong with that you know exactly what the payback period is going to be you can measure what the retention rate and therefore LTV from those channels look like to make sure you're building a profitable transaction which is what all of us in the growth Community do and for driving deeper engagement into the product um like we could incentivize people to order sushi which is a higher ticket item at GrubHub um and when we did that uh and they tried sushi for the first time everyone loves Sushi and they end up ordering it more often which means they order more frequently and their average order size goes up which you know makes GrubHub more money so all those things are really great I just be really careful about your introduction to the product incorporating some sort of incentive or discount because it can tend to block them from uh focusing on like what the core product value is and this is like my biggest critique uh near the web 3 community in general right is like when you're incentivizing every internet transaction you have no idea when someone's talking about something if they actually care about it or if they think they're just gonna make you know a rake on it um and that's a a big challenge for Founders that are trying to involve tokens in bootstrapping that error so I think you know the thesis probably five years ago was like oh all marketplaces are going to become you know crypto incentivized because it's a way to get the liquidity faster and I think now probably the vibe is the opposite like you're actually gonna get faux traction and then uh you're gonna have like this impossible task of figuring out like do you actually have core product value being delivered on both sides of the marketplaces you know that once you've got like on paper what looks like scale yeah for sure I I think a lot of the narrative um and the desire among Founders that I've seen it has shifted from using Financial incentives to just getting users to sign up for a product to try it and for you know at the beginning to deploying tokens in a really targeted way to enhance retention or get users to build a habit for people who are already intrinsically interested in using something so I think we did a session with Andrew um earlier uh this this um cohort and he had this great quote which um I think really applies here which is like the laws of physics are the same um the use of financial incentives can really subsume a lot of users motivations if deployed too generously or or ahead of time prematurely and so anyways I think tokens are sort of converging to how Financial incentives have been deployed in web 2 contexts yeah I'll give one quick story there which is um when we were series D at GrubHub we acquired a competitor campus food I say competitor but really they were in a bunch of these college towns that we weren't in yet so it's about uh accelerating our Geographic expansion and um you know for GrubHub if you ordered a second time within the first month we knew you were gonna retain basically you know then I started doing the due diligence on campus food and they have this complicated model on like oh it used to be three orders and then we incentivized to get to the third order and then it moved to five orders I mean incentivized to five words and then we incentivized getting out seven orders and it's like you are never going to solve this problem because like incentives is just like the wrong solution you're just you're just delaying proving out whether they're going to stick around and pay full price right so we canceled a lot of that stuff once we acquired them right and and that's the thing that incentives do it can kind of Kick the Can down the road on actually like proving out your real hypothesis uh on if you have you know great business or profitable economics whatever the case may be that makes sense um Carson had a great question about product onboarding Carson do you want to unmute and ask it I know you had been essentially said like reducing the friction in onboarding is good for enabling retention but then you know later you're also talking about like some friction is good because it gets people invested and like feels like they've put time in so how do you kind of balance simplifying the onboarding but then also you're essentially having people uninvested and it makes them easy to off-board so in reforge we have a concept of good friction versus bad friction right um so bad friction is things that makes it harder for a person to get to the product value and going through them doesn't materially raise the product value that can get created uh and good friction is like oh it actually prevents them from moving forward but if they go through that step it raises the chances that when they get to the core product value they're going to actually like experience and stick around so uh there's a good blog post it's actually on Andrew Chen's blog but it's not written by Andrew Chen it's written by this guy Darius contractor who is at dropbox at the time it's called the psyched framework and what they use to Dropbox is basically like trying to measure on every step of onboarding is it raising intent or dropping intent um and you can get some really um curious results when you apply this framework like Stitch fix is famous for having like 50 steps um you know when they're onboarding but they barely lose any one of those steps because the user sees uh the impact of giving them more information and Trust in that building you know ultimately a better recommendation on you know what um what fashion that they're going to be shipped right so you can measure all of this you know in your product um to see if it's really creating good friction or bad friction and then you can qualitatively test it like something we just did endlessly is we you know put we brought someone in we said get Pinterest on your phone sign up go through the experience and we just saw what brought them joy and didn't bring them joy and you know we would then go make changes based on you know what what we saw um and like I spent a lot of you know one particular year at Pinterest flying to Brazil to France flying to Germany and watch people use our product and just fail uh and then go back and make a bunch of changes based on you know what we saw and that's what allowed us to have like a really successful you know um International expansion because like it just wasn't working when I got there like International users were not retaining um so there's a mixture of kind of the quantum the qual there right um but you're trying to build that intuition you know as a team right of like is this good friction or bad friction right now like is it raising their intent is it raising the value that we can create you know as a product because we now have this information on them or not if it's not get rid of it and then if you're with a group of people if you're acquiring a group of people that's very patient and very rational you just don't obsessive it as much right like for Eventbrite like I'm not trying to shave seconds off a sign up flow like I was at Pinterest because it just doesn't move the needle that much um uh but at Pinterest I mean it equates to tens of millions of users uh you know so it's just it's just different math Nico had a question about the strategy of shifting from a Kindle strategy to um more sustainable growth strategy Nico did you want to unpack that question anymore absolutely um I was wondering like pretty much how to Pivot your your Kindle strategy to or like when do you know it's it's uh you've tried it enough and then you need to change to a different strategy and maybe also tie it a little bit to a product like when you're still trying to find product Market feed like how to change like a feature to fit to that so when you're straight when you're still trying to validate that you're building the right core product experience you're you're really only getting enough users in just to see if you're further along the path of delivering concrete product value to as many users as possible Right so that's where you generally want to be constrained you know obviously there's cases like threads where they haven't done that and um that's the right strategy for a very big company like meta but generally not the right for startups um uh but yeah you're basically trying to like just start to see if like the product even works if people like it you're probably talking to as many of those people on the phone as possible to get like all their opinions like all that kind of stuff and when you get much more confident in it's really valuable and the quantitative way to look at that is the retention curves but if you're hitting product Market fit early you're not going to have 12 months of data you're just gonna see that like oh they came back week over week at a really high rate or whatever like that and you're going to project if it's like flattening out at a good rate um that's what's going to make you start to think about like okay now my Kindle strategies need to be helping me sequence towards true product Market fit which means I have a scalable acquisition Loop that can power my company so right in that case of hip cam it's like okay cool I'm gonna need um enough links that I can rank on the first page of Google for camping near me right in the case of Airbnb it's like I need enough Supply with a high enough conversion rate um that I can go pay for users you know on AdWords that are searching for vacation rentals um so there's this clear kind of bar usually um you're trying to get above right in the case of your hip Camp it's ranking on the first page of Google it needs more links to do that and it needs more inventory to do that in the case of Airbnb it needs inventory and it needs conversion rates to be able to make AdWords work with a profitable payback period and now they don't even do AdWords which is kind of like a famous um thing from chesky yeah they canceled all that stuff um but in early on there's a lot of AdWords spin um for Airbnb um and uh so there's there's a kind of that kind of different model marketplaces nine out of ten times it's like how do I get enough Supply where the demand side product feels great uh Thumbtack is like the one out of ten where they actually went demand first and then they just sent the leads to suppliers to try to get them on the platform and and buy the leads um but nine out of ten are gonna go Supply first um so yeah generally there's some sort of Hump you're trying to use to get sales paid marketing content you know of reality to work virality has the most most math on it probably published on the internet Rahul Vora from superhuman has some amazing posts on how to do that math um that are still out there somewhere I'm sure we can link them uh at some point um you know paid in sales is just kind of like you know you know all in payback period calculations like and again they don't need to be perfect at series a but they need to be on a path to like you know being in a relatively good spot well maybe today they need to be perfectly they can tell you what VCS care about today um but historically it's more like are you projected to have really healthy Returns on on you know your paid acquisition or your sales Channel it doesn't need to be you know perfect out the gate um and then content like I said it's the hardest is usually you need a ton of inventory if your GrubHub or Airbnb or a ton of boards if you're Pinterest um which means you need to be doing something else until you trip some threshold that you know the content starts to take over as the primary driver uh of the users thanks Casey is there a rule of thumb for how healthy your retention should be or what level it should flatten that as a product builder for you to then switch gears and say like I have product Market fit now I can focus on growth yeah so the the rule of thumb which is probably not super helpful to answer your question is if if the the curve flattens at a high enough level where the engagement from this user either the money you're making or the content they're creating or the invites they're sending each driving the user grows sustainably up you're there that could be at five percent that could be at 65 so just in Social you can see the disparity Twitter's activation rate historically was 18 I would consider that god-awful turns out it does not matter because the Press talks about them every single day um so their acquisition costs have been zero forever um and the ubiquity with which you hear about this product is just could not be higher and it's been that way for over a decade right so Pinterest sorry Twitter was able to sign up basically the entire internet churn four out of five and still have you know a few hundred million dollar a few hundred million Dau business to be able to create an ad business around and it's still TBD if that's going to be a sustainable business but like paper that should work out Instagram was 65 percent so efficient right um activated the majority of the people that signed on to the product um and as a result has grown a lot faster uh and more sustainably you know than uh than Twitter able to hit you know well over a billion you know daily active users right and it's you know valued much more than Twitter and all that kind of stuff um Pinterest is in between Pinterest 45 percent so very good compared to Twitter uh like cool story bro to Instagram right um so turns out that's a 20 billion dollar company with a 45 activation rate and basically you know no acquisition costs on the demand side so because the content Loop is really strong at Pinterest 45 is plenty uh because the type of people that activate on Twitter are so influential in reaching everyone else 18 it turns out was good enough uh should they have focused on getting it higher of course they should have and they did try they just never really were able to unlock the activation problem on that on that Network um I would say take those outliers out uh generally you don't really see anyone below a 25 activation rate be able to scale to like you know a billion dollars in Revenue um so in consumer subscription you're generally thinking you you need to be at least in the US you need to be above 50 maybe even 60 annual retention meaning people are paying you for a second year um and very few companies have done that right like Amazon's done that spotify's done that Netflix has done that uh Duolingo probably did for a long time and but it's just below that calm got above that for a while not sure where they are at today um so uh depending on the model and how you how much it costs you to acquire users these numbers you know will change Pinterest is Pinterest and Twitter have never needed to spend a dollar so they could potentially get away with lower rates consumer subscription apps which tend to rely on paid acquisition need the number to be a lot higher or else pit acquisition just starts to become upside down on unit economics you know at scale right that makes sense um okay I think we have time for probably a couple more questions so Blake had a really excellent question about content as a growth strategy Blake do you want to unmute and ask that sure so uh you just mentioned during the presentation that your kind of particular expert in content and so I was curious if you could share some of your learnings around you know content strategy is typically for small companies if they're getting started with a Content strategy from the from the ground up yeah so you know normally I would have tell told people in the past content's a great second growth loop it's not really a great first one because it could just take too long uh and then once it starts working it's kind of hard to up um the uh I would say I've changed my view in that in particular um Google has made it easier for startups to compete over the last few years um in that now you know domain Authority which used to be a concept of just kind of the quantity and quantity uh the quantity and quality of other websites that link to you has been a bit replaced by like micro Authority on pert on a per topic basis so what startups can now do which they weren't able to do in the past is really focus on a particular Niche and have really amazing content it could be user generated it could be company generated but if you really focus on nailing um a particular piece of a particular topic and get all the adjacent topics covered really well you can actually start to develop like a successful SEO strategy a lot earlier in your life cycle than you know maybe 2014 when I joined Pinterest um and uh we've seen some startups you know do this I have some Angel Investments that I've worked on that have done this and either it's a niche topic or a new topic that people couldn't have been searching for for 10 years because that's been around for 10 years like ai's probably most prominent recent example um or there's just a genuine care to the topic that didn't previously previously exist so some things that you know um or you're you're leveraging some other form of authority that helps with like engagement rate signals from Google so like masterclass is a recent example of this um in that like you know they go work with Serena Williams or you know like the top most important person you know in whatever that topic is and then they write like content as if it's written by her um so people are gonna trust that a lot more even if the domain Authority isn't there um so they've leveraged that into like there's a Gordon Rams you post on chicken recipes then Gordon Ramsay actually write that post no uh but it's Gordon Ramsay sponsored and it's really in depth and they've been able to you know make that a part of their growth model in a way where they were just kind of all paid before um and I think you see this in in because what Google's trying to do is Google's trying to say like okay it used to be you search this topic you search this keyword what are you know the websites that talk about that keyword the most and have the highest domain Authority and then there's like some you know math calculation to what shows up first and now it's more like okay you know okay uh Blake you searched this keyword here's the universe of things I know are related and then which page covers the entire topic of related things and what was searched best is is going to be what shows up right uh so that means um like if someone's searching coupons uh they actually care about coupons and how long it takes to ship and shipping price and related products and all this kind of other stuff right so the people I cover all of that on a page rank better than you know just the highest domain Authority free coupon site or whatever so that stuff is starting to change which is good for startups now of course you have ai disruption and the search results which could be bad for startups as well so we'll have to see how all of that um plays out but I think generally if you focus on how do I build core product value where the output of that core product value is the user creates content that they're proud of um that's really interesting it's really interesting for B2B and it's really interesting for b2c because they might do some sharing of it B2B inside their company you know uh you know like the Notions and you know air tables of the world you know b2c to their friends or post to social media and on top of that you might be able to get it indexed on Google um those are kind of different strategies that like you know tend to not be uh as well known that have played out really well awesome thanks a follow-up question to that Casey I'd love to hear your thoughts on how sustainable SEO is as a strategy um because I can definitely think of some products off the top of my head which rely a lot on SEO um and it's it's so reliant on SEO that perhaps the users don't even recognize they're using a different product they think they're Google they're just they're sort of thumb test problem when I started working with them yeah Reddit as well um quora maybe too and so like is the content growth Channel ideally one where users find it through SEO but then become like a native user of that product or can SEO itself be a sustainable growth strategy so I think you know I've definitely focused my career on on the former right which is like SEO gets you the first visit the second visit needs to come directly through the app or through your website wherever and that's how he operated at GrubHub that's how he operated at Pinterest um but that's not always possible given the way your product works right for products that have an infrequent need we talked about high retention but some products like pardons.com where I started my career you just don't need to search for an apartment like every day of the year like you generally need it once a year for like a one to two month period so we tried to do stuff to build a direct relationship between apartments.com and the user we've built like you know more content related stuff non-transactional it just didn't work so you know what we just said we're going to be number one when you search anything apartment related on Google and we're going to win that way and we're gonna buy AdWords too um and that's the best thing we got and we sold that business for 570 million still like a pretty good outcome you know I know we're all focused on these companies worth a trillion dollars now but like pretty good return um and I think some people have been able to push past that like Zillow Zillow had the same exact problem with apartments.com people don't search for new homes a ton of time so they built a second product this estimate um that created some voyeurism around what my house is worth but maybe more importantly what my neighbor's houses are worth and then it created like real estate porn of like browsing dream houses all of which keeps that engagement with Zillow so that you have the Zillow app and don't you know go back to Zillow and go back to Google and or you know um uh you know a slave to their algorithm changes right um and then there's other things people have done you know which is more like the online travel agency world so you have Expedia and booking and uh I don't know how well known this is but they own every other search result every single one is owned between those two companies so if you go search I don't know like hotels in Chicago or something you're gonna see 10 results there are only two companies behind those results because they have Bots anyone that gets any good coverage in Google and their model is to have a portfolio of Brands to make sure they suck up all the energy from Google and they of course do a bunch of brand marketing to try to bring people directed to try to build loyalty programs but still the majority people go back to Google and there's just nothing they can do about it so they built more of an M A type growth strategy and a portfolio of Brands and you know those are still really big companies like booking.com and Expedia have done awesome as public companies um so there's not only one path to Victory certainly the path I prefer is the one you laid out you know get Google from the first visit build really strong retentive direct products and that's what I focus my career on sometimes it's just not possible the frequency isn't there or you're not able to get the core product value High Enough I think Airbnb did a good job of challenging that in travel right they created a product that was both better in meaning in a cooler part of the neighborhood and cheaper like it was cheaper the hotel it used to be maybe not So Much Anymore um and that actually did get people to go direct to Airbnb the next time in a way that just never happened in travel and that's part of why they built such an amazing business um so quickly so but that's like you thinking more about uh core product value innovation right whereas travel was pretty static it was like those hotels and flight listings for a long time and Airbnb is like what about a person's couch and everyone's like well that's stupid and turns out like that would ended up sequencing towards uh something that you know especially younger consumers preferred a lot more which means they don't need to rank number one on Google to win in a space that's very hard to do that because of course Expedia and booking are very good at that game that makes sense so we're running up on our allotted time so I want to start bringing this to close this has been really really fascinating um and and we've spoken about lots of different ways that you've grown products converted users demonstrated core product Market that across many web 2 companies and I think a lot of Founders on this call are probably wondering how to how does this translate to the web three context how does this translate to the projects that they're working on and so um yeah do you have any parting words with them or advice to builders who are starting projects in web 3 in terms of what's applicable and what might be different for them you know generally I've been in this game long enough to say like um with these Innovations whether it be web3 or AI um at the end of the day the game is still basically the same which is you need to figure out something that's genuinely valuable and you can't like hack that you have to be building like a real product that solves real problems and if the blockchain is the best technical solution deliver that great if AI is the best technical solution deliver that great but you can't get sucked into the technology being the value prop and you can't get sucked into the financial incentive being the value prop they're not um they're just a means uh to deliver the core product value so focus on that and as you're thinking about that uh also in the back of your head think about is there something in how this product is being built that's going to help it grow and be experienced by more users don't wait and say like I got like my worst conversation I have with Founders I have a great product I just need to find more people uh you know that can experience it I'm like you're dead like pivot like and no one wants to hear this of course right but it's like if you don't have a growth mechanism in the core product value you've created like it's over like start over um uh so those would be the the two things right still most of it should be how do I deliver core product value but at least you need 20 of your brain working on if I'm on the path to do that it's Gotta create content it's got to make money it's Gotta like want to invite other people because it's multiplayer um you know those are the things that I would just like be 100 focused on if I were in in you know your shoes yeah the technology does not equal the value proposition and the financial incentive does not equal the value proposition I think those are wise words to live by thank you so much Casey for coming in today this is awesome um and thanks everyone for being here as well hope you guys got a lot of this um fill out the survey that we just sent out Casey really really appreciate it um check out reforge guys if you want to hear and learn more about all these topics that go like many magnitudes deeper than what we were able to cover today yep thanks for having me all thanks for coming
