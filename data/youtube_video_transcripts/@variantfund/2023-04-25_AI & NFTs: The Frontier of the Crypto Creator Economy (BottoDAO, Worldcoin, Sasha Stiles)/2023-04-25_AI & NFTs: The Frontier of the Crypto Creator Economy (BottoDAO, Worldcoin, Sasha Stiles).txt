foreign [Music] thank you guys so much for being here today welcome to not the variant office but the space that we're using for today um I want to thank everyone for coming out here on such a crazy warm day I know that maybe the journey was not the most comfortable but now you're here and this is going to be the highlight of nft NYC so it's wonderful to have everyone um so we're going to be having a conversation today about how AI is impacting crypto and the Creator economy and we're going to be exploring questions about provenance authenticity Creator livelihoods artist consent and much more and here to unpack all of these topics are these esteemed panelists so we have Simon from Botto Dao Sasha Styles who is an artist and researcher about AI as well as well as Thiago from worldcoin and in a moment I'll have them introduce themselves but the reason why we're hosting this discussion today is because variant has been extremely excited about the growth of nfts and more generally the intersection of crypto and creativity for a really long time for basically as long as the firm has existed a little known fact is that variant is actually the owner of one of the first pieces of AI art on ethereum on the blockchain in January of 2021 we purchased Robbie barat's AI generated nude portrait number three for about ninety five thousand dollars for those of you who aren't familiar with what this is Robbie bra is an artist and AI researcher who when he was 17 years old fed a bunch of nude portraits into again a generative adversarial Network and generated AI based nude portraits from that and what resulted from this are a series of artworks that kind of resemble human nudes but look honestly quite surreal and weird there's limbs growing out of different places they look like weird Blobs of Flesh and we collected one of these pieces because we felt that this was really a groundbreaking moment in the history of nfts and in the history of AI art I share the story really to emphasize that we are super interested in the frontier of creativity and Innovation and so I'm really excited to be having this conversation with everyone today and by the way I'm Lee in case you didn't know that I'm one of the general Partners at variant all right so let's get started um with that I wanted to turn it over to our panelists to each introduce themselves and say a little bit about their work we'll start with Thiago and go down the road yeah for sure thank you for having us um so my name is Thiago I'm originally from Mexico from Mexico City and I am head of product at a company called tools for Humanity this is a company co-founded by Sam outman we might have heard of and that's a company that co-invented the Whirlwind protocol amongst a few other things and so day to day I oversee a bunch of our engineering products and design for a lot of the software products in the in the world of an ecosystem hi everyone um yeah thank you for having us it's so lovely to be here my name is Sasha Stiles I'm a poet um who also happens to be an artificial intelligence researcher um strangely enough I'm also a visual artist and do a lot of work that integrates text and Technology I'm really a lifelong writer and I've spent most of my career really writing in a more analog sense but you know for the past 10 years or so I've I've gotten very very interested in thinking about language and poetry as a code as a kind of technology and you know from that standpoint integrating various tools very you know various Advanced tools including artificial intelligence into my practice so I've been thinking quite a lot about these things lately I've been working with large language models since about 2018 and actually have an AI powered Alter Ego who helps me write some of my poetry and we actually co-wrote my my first book of poetry together and this book is called technology and it came out in 2021 and we've been publishing poetry on the blockchain as well so really excited to get to chat about the intersection of AI and creativity and web3 and all these fun things awesome Simon Hudson I'm an operator of bottodow and we govern Botto bottle is a decentralized autonomous artist which is a fully autonomous art agent it's a closed loop system makes all of its own art Untouched by human hands we can go into the details of that now or later but the idea is it's an experiment in um really asking the question can a machine be recognized as its own as its own artist now the machines don't really know what good art is and that's where the Dow comes in so bottle presents its work to the Dow and we vote we say this is good art bad art those votes go to train bottle over time and the proceeds of the sales pay for the labor of the uh of the Dow members myself I'm an operator I'm probably I think I'm technically the first hire out of the community I joined pretty much right after the the project launched full-time job setting up governance setting up collaborator programs contributor programs research programs and it's a progressively decentralized project bottle itself is an autonomous agent but there's a lot to be done to make it more and more autonomous over time as well as making the overall project fully decentralized so the the training of bottles decentralized but right now you know bottle is an instance on a server so we have a lot of work to do and that's what I spend my day doing we call ourselves janitors because we're mostly just cleaning up Messes in the community but yeah awesome thanks everyone and samples of botto's art as well as Sasha's work are on display people can look at them later on the screens that we have in the office but at first I wanted to start with Thiago so you have this shiny looking orb sphere next to you um tell us what that is and tell us why proof of personhood is even necessary in an age of AI yeah so I'll give it a little bit more context on which is worldcoin as a project so about four years ago Sam so that like this whole AI thing was going to happen a lot faster that like most people thought and he was like I don't know if openai is going to be the one to crack it but it's very clear that very soon we will have artificial intelligence powerful enough um to like really disrupt a lot of things in society change the way we go about things some jobs will go away we will have some new jobs and um and while that was incredibly exciting it was also clear that there was some new questions that we're going to have to answer and there was some new challenges that we're going to have to face and so we're all going as a project really its premise is saying okay how do we address these new questions that that come up in a world with really Advanced artificial intelligence so what specifically are some of these questions well first of all how do you make sure that every person has equal access or Fair access to these really Advanced AI systems right it's gonna suck if a few people get to access Ai and other people don't because then there will be just like a huge wealth divide um even taking that democratization further is well how can you start thinking about decentralizing governance of these systems right when they get so big and they're so important for our day-to-day lives is there a way for not one person or one company to control them but actually people do help control and govern these models also things like well all of these economic benefits that get generated how you distribute them more fairly across Society right and uh and partially also to make that transition smoother right that's where things like Ubi might come in but there's a bunch of other things you can do and then lastly in a world where everything can be fake or everything can be generated how do you know who and what to trust online right when you're uh when you see 20 000 accounts or those 20 000 real people or are those one person in Russia with like 20 000 bucks that you're like trying to push like some opinion right and so at the core of all of these questions there's an ocean of personhood right uh if you if you can know what is a unique and real person online uh and then you also give them the ability to transact digital money which is ethereum uh those two things combined allow you to actually solve a lot of those problems and so worldcoin emerged uh first as a very nebulous idea that has crystallized over the past four years as a way to say let's solve this and let's solve this in a way that um that we'll be excited about and so what does that mean like at this point and I think like I tweeted about this recently like it's really obvious or it's really clear that we will need some sort of proof of personhood the question now is like will that be decentralized will it be privacy preserving or will it be open source because there's also like governments will build their own systems private companies will build their own systems and what we really think is that just as AI might be too important for one person to control the same applies to infrastructure like ballcoin right and so Whirlwind is uh it's basically like a really large network of real people and this course is a protocol where people can get verified in different ways the flagship way of getting verified today is the device called the orb but you can think of this as like us bootstrapping and building the first verification mechanism just as we've built the first client that supports it and then the way you actually grow this system is by giving out its ownership right and so um you as a person join the network you get ownership in the network and that's what gets hit to scale so that's that's what we're up to at work and we can talk about why and like the effects of that person both in a bit yeah so I'm hearing that really in the future when everything can be faked when all these creative Works can be created through AI you need some mechanism to tell what has actually been generated by a human person versus by a machine and Sasha I would love to hear your thoughts on this topic especially since you as an artist have co-created work with AI your your book was co-authored with gpt2 and gbt3 which are the precursors to chat GPT and so I would love to hear your view on this topic of that distinction between human creation versus machine creation and how you think Human Art and creativity is going to evolve in this age of AI yeah small question um yeah well I I want to start by saying that I'm coming at this from the background of someone who has studied literature and language not computer science you know I'm not a coder I'm not someone who really has been steeped in this so I really came to a lot of this through my curiosity about what technology is like AI kind of represent maybe in a in a more poetic sensibility and have kind of been drawn into the mechanics and the inner workings of it through that um so so you know I think in the beginning one of the things that I was really intrigued by is the idea of being able to sort of set my own understanding of myself as a writer someone who I I think is kind of someone who lives in my head and has my own thoughts and I'm able to create original ideas that versus being able to tap into a mind that is really representing a collective Consciousness that is a hive mind that is representing not only you know input from you know people all around the globe but also you know literature throughout various time periods and just vast quantities of information and just thinking about me as a little writer over here and then being able to have all of that at my fingertips and so that was sort of something that I was very interested in the beginning and it led me to think quite a lot about this idea of originality um you know versus there's so many like words to to offer as maybe the antithesis to that but when I started using these tools I would write things with AI take them into poetry workshops take them into you know editors and my mentors and my peers and all that and they would kind of say well this isn't poetry this isn't literature because it's not original this isn't you know it's not yours and therefore it's not valid and so I was getting a very sort of definitive feedback there from folks who are saying because it is sort of a compilation or an amalgamation of ideas that it it sort of can't sit alongside what we think of as valuable poetry or you know original creates creativity and I have always really bristled at that I think on the one level because my personal experience working with these tools has been that a lot of the output um to me and you know increasingly I think to to readers that I'm hearing from it is actually striking them as real poetry it's profound it's it's doing things that are similar to what human language you know does to all of us and has done for a long time so I think just on that anecdotal evidence there is something there that you know that is important to consider but I think you know coming from my point of view as someone who's studied you know language and literature and comes from that academic point of view I'm also kind of thinking about Ai and training data sets and this compendium of language kind of as the equivalent to canonical information canonical texts and thinking about how you know I as a student of literature have you know all these really important touchstones in the Canon that you know are kind of available not just to me but to all of us you know we think about things like Dickinson or Shakespeare or you know fill in the blank here but these are all things that are sort of available to us and whether or not I is a poet am you know consciously grabbing from Whitman or from Octavia Butler or whatever these things are in The Ether and they're part of culture so they're informing me they're informing all of us in different ways I just think that you know both in practice and in theory that to me feels very similar to what is happening when I'm working with AI as a writer I'm tapping into this um this you know this vast brain that knows all these things um in a way that's not too dissimilar from how I've actually written my entire life which is contrary to popular thought not as a solitary writer locked in her room you know being touched by the Muse but actually as someone who's been absorbing information all my life and what comes out of my pen or what comes out of my fingertips is the results of all the data points in my own head colliding and creating something new which again to me feels very very resonant with how I've learned AI works and you know learning that firsthand through using gpt2 and gpt3 but also in my experience working you know as a researcher with projects like the bnf48 project with terracim and being able to actually work with developers to mind map data and to look at how word associations and vectors are actually linking ideas together so yeah I think that there's a lot more um it's really hard to say that human creativity is original so so hopefully bristle at the idea that AI can't be creative because it's not coming from a quote-unquote original source yeah that's really interesting I I like your take on how AI can augment human creativity and how you fuse the two when traditionally the different forms of creation have been viewed as quite opposed and I know that bottle has its unique spin on this as well through the Botto Dao which is the community base that I think now numbers over 5000 depends okay members who are steering the AI artist I would love to hear a little bit more about that from you and how you think the role of human input evolves in the age of AI how the role of human input evolves and the age of AI you know I think one of the things that's been really surprising with Botto uh was you know was posed as uh well Mario who designed Botto who's here where are you Mario there you are Mario designed bottle and when he launched it you know he posed it with one of these questions of how do we pay our rent when we've automated creativity um and so it was very tied into this idea of pain for the human input to just train bottle and guide bottle to what is so-called good art which is a microcosm of the larger AI alignment problem of these highly subjective questions but what's been really surprising or at least didn't expect this or wasn't looking for it was how that role of meaning making doesn't go away so with the traditional or when I say traditional human artist makes art they're expressing themselves as human beings and they they deliver their work with an intent a stated intent and that largely guides the meaning of the piece now it might be received and interpreted interpreted by critics and audience and that complements the meaning of the piece but it's very driven by that human artist in bato's case it's a machine it it there's a bit of the concept but there isn't a whole lot of intent about it delivering with its peaceability not now which I just my mic's still on okay um it's not delivering a lot of intent with its pieces not now maybe a little bit more once we plug in gpt4 um now the pieces that come out um it it generates thousands of pieces a week it curates a small set and then presents those to the community to vote on um and I mean they almost might as well be random it it really is in the discussion this is all off-chain activity and the discussion in the Discord between members about what they see the meaning they see the patterns they see interpreting it in the uh within the theme that baby bottle is working on in that period within bada's overall body of work or in their personal meaning and that meaning over time that discussion that ends up being the meaning that attaches to this piece and with absence of the intent of the artist that ends up being in the meaning of the piece now there's some aesthetic qualities and there's I think you know Collective human culture that attaches to the symbols that might be present in that and that beat might be emanating from that latent space but very much it ends up being that the meaning making shifts over to the community there's a void and so that just ends up filling that void um you know we're in a human world and we're talking about AI alignment because we're talking about AI systems in our world and we need to align it to our meaning our symbols our values so I don't think the human input ever goes away it is always present and I think a really important part of the bottle project at least for me and I'm I'm one member you know anybody can join in and present their opinion and trying to find these values as well but um it's it's it's a exercise in AI literacy and seeing the agency we have in the systems we live in to impact and to shape the direction of them the development of them the values that they uh that they are Guided by um and I it's again it's a microcosm but I think it's a really important thing in terms of all of these new systems coming online and seeing the agency we have they're largely marketed as these fully automated things they're magic right um but there's a huge number of people that are making these same these things you know so-called non-toxic I mean chat gbt there's a big article article that came out of these two dollar wage two dollar an hour wage workers that were giving it feedback to guide it away from toxicity um and there was this huge shock because it's presented as magic oh it just works but there's a huge number of people and so I think giving people not just telling them hey you have agency but giving them an experience of how they can exercise that agency and then a stake in the outcome in terms of a sense of ownership and that trans intrinsic motivation in addition to the financial motivation um I think is is really important and I hope you know I don't think you know bottle is gonna become the main AI system that takes over the world and we're thankfully guiding it but um can at least present some lessons in that and some first-hand experience and what that can be like right so in this world where the Botto AI is able to proliferate tons and tons of output the role of the community then shifts to more of a curatorial role where it is making sense and describing meaning to different pieces of output is what I'm hearing yeah and um you know there's different ways we could communicate that but it's something I think we all see if you're in it you attach that meaning and um yeah there's uh there's definitely a lot of ways you can end up communicating that and end up making sort of this multiplayer uh media agency of just producing that and taking that meaning and putting that out all around these individual pieces that I in some cases are really just a snapshot of the development of that community over time right I want to shift the conversation to um the implications of AI on creators specifically around the economics of it and the idea of artist consent so Sasha a few weeks ago you had this tweet in which you said quote having a hard time understanding the impulse to opt out of data sets versus figuring out meaningful ways to engage with the collective Consciousness as creators have always done if we fuse blockchain and AI can we license our content with established provenance what royalties for something like this be a kind of universal basic income so obviously there's a lot of controversy going on right now around what value accrues to artists versus to AI companies in these systems so yeah I would love to hear you unpack that tweet for us what is the right way for artists to be thinking about these AI systems and how it's going to impact their livelihoods and what is the right way to Route value back to them sure I love when my tweets come back to Harmony you should really be more careful um no I mean I um I think that again like my in my experience working very closely with a lot of these tools for a long time might you know my my fear in just hearing a lot of people sort of talk um in a very sort of uh black and white way about either being in or being out of a system like this is just that in order to be represented in the outputs in order to be part of a system part of changing a system for the better or part of training a system um to look and to sound and to to be representative of all of us like we all need to be involved in it in some way in some way shape or form so that was really just a response to I think you know a very that was a very sort of like timely discussion that a lot of artists were having about just you know pulling out of pulling their work out of data sets completely and I think on the one hand again it's I I don't know why as an artist you would not want to be part of a data set like part of you know part of what is there in popular knowledge I think you know as an artist you you hope and at least for me as a writer all I ever want to do is to write something that someone will read so what I you know what the last thing I'd want to do is sort of pull that out and make it not available to these systems to to create texts so um I think for me it's thinking about then what is the right way to um to both sort of bring data into a training set like that in a responsible way so that it both represents all the things that it needs to and that it's also you know obviously compensating or remunerating or in some way kind of acknowledging the people who have been part of creating it um and on on that note I think you know one of the things I wanted to mention I touched on being a 48 before I just wanted to like Linger on that a little bit more because it's relevant to your question here but that project is really um sort of like a niche project done by this company called terrorism I don't know if anyone here knows to being a 48 project but it's basically a humanoid Android that has been created as a repository of information for a living you know human being named Bina and this is sort of a sort of like an external like a backup or sort of like a you know a version of this human that's it presented as an experiment in digital immortality and it's basically memories and data and information powered by a neural net that enables that data to become something like a Persona so it can you know talk to and respond and kind of bring up information and I've been working with them for a little while really focusing more on um you know on the poetic aspect of what they're doing but my hands have been like very deep into this system these mind files when it comes to like how the data is being integrated and uploaded and where it's coming from and who is inputting um you know there's so much talk I think when it comes to large language models they're so vast and so complicated it's really hard to know what's going on so for me working on this this being a project which is like very much kind of a small data project it's a small smaller comparatively speaking model has really made me aware of how important it is to be qualitative in our approach to data and I I think there's something of that also in this question about how to tie this in with the folks who are contributing to the system it's both kind of having some kind of a a road map for what's important to integrate into a system not just kind of going through and you know scraping the the internet willy-nilly and a lot of my work has also been about the results of that kind of an approach where you know you need to have you need to have quantity in order to power um uh language models to do what they need to do but there's so much garbage that gets into the mix and that comes out all the time and I've tried to surface that in a lot of my poetry too just to kind of show you know how all of that can happen for better for worse I think there has to be some sort of more qualitative approach and I I don't think any of us like have a solution for that now but figuring out how to preserve the vastness that enables the systems to work effectively but that also is much more thoughtful and qualitative and curated in a way and when I talk about working with um with AI systems like Bina I actually don't call it training I call it mentoring which I don't know is you know it's maybe not scalable for some of the massive massive systems but I think it's a really nice way of sort of differentiating between just kind of ingesting data and taking a more measured um and creative approach to how that works yeah let's see that you had mentioned to me both on the phone as well as in in this particular um tweet that you had written is the idea of how we could create something like a universal basic income for artists whose data is being contributed to these models and I know that a lot of the origin story of worldcoin is around Ubi and how can people pay their rent support themselves in an age where potentially productivity is being done by Ai and so Thiago I would love to hear your thoughts on um you know how like how the economics flow back to contributors back to the artists who are contributing data to these large data sets um to create these AI models and how could crypto help route value back to all these participants yeah it's a really good question um and it's a three problem because there's a lot of parts to it right I think it all starts with the provenance it starts by knowing uh like hey who who gets credit for this thing right and that can be a human that can be something that's not a human it can be can be bought on like that's that's great really bottom can get credit for that um but I think the first thing that we need to figure out is okay how do we how do we sign these pieces right so that when you are training on them then at least you know what went into it now and the question is like how do you distribute the Ubi right whether it's two artists or to people in general they're there's a bunch of challenges there's a challenge of the money side of things which like crypto is fortunately getting closer and closer to be able to solve which is well how do you make this money programmable how do you move really small amounts of money in a way that is efficient uh how do you make all of these things automatic and trackable and very importantly trustless right and and the solution for that is I fortunately neither at worldcoin or other companies today or other projects we need to reinvent that there's been like 10 or close to 15 years of work at this point in crypto to make that happen and at this point it's just scaling and making that really cheap and then getting adoption right and so one of the things that we focus a lot on is not just giving everyone this self-custodial ID but also self-custodial wallet right because we think it's very important that everyone is able to to receive that and then the second piece is well how do you prove that you're eligible for that given Ubi right some ubis might be the requirement is you're a human right other ubis it might be like hey you contributed to this data set or you're from or white country and so we don't think a lot about the rules for that I think other people are much better so than someone like myself to think about well how should artists be compensated for x or y piece of work what we want is we want people to give the tools to have those discussions and so what we're working a lot on is the world ID protocol allows you to make those statements about yourself in a way that also preserves your privacy and so the world ID protocol allows you to say hey I'm a real person and I've never claimed this Ubi before and you don't need to know anything else about me just pay it to this address and next time I want to use a different address or I'm a real person that voted on this or that contributed to this data set and if you want to reveal what piece you contributed you can do so but we think it's also important that you don't always have to and so we think a lot about that infrastructure that allows whether it's on the identity side of things to make statements about yourself always minimizing the information that you have to reveal and then also on the financial side of things just getting everyone to adopt crypto so that you can then combine these two things and you can have this really smart systems on maybe smart contracts other might just be triggered by a back-end and like that's fine uh what matters is like if I want to be able to send you the dollar that you get for your royalties because your piece went viral in this other website there should be the pipes to make that happen and so that's what we think a lot about and how we create those pipes in a way that that improve the state of privacy that and that give people more control over those pipes rather than less which is the direction where we're headed yeah that makes sense in exploring the question of could the revenues or value from these AI companies be routed back to participants um something that I've heard from people in the industry is the juice might not be worth the squeeze in other words the like royalty payments might not actually be all that meaningful if you actually end up attributing that output back to the original artists um Simon I would love to get your thoughts here as well because Botto has been earning revenue from sales of nfts that bottle the AI artist creates and that gets routed back to token holders who are voting and steering the AI right do you think that that is going to be a new class of work that is substantial for people in the future how sustainable do you think that source of Revenue is that's a good question so just for context botto's done about uh 2.8 or 2.9 Million Dollars of art sales if you converted the e at the time of the time sale getting hot here um and uh yeah so depending on the size of the community that gets spread pretty far and it's also very connected to your Capital stake uh so we are very susceptible to becoming uh highly plutocratic uh with whales just dominating the boat and taking the vast share of Revenue um thankfully we have a mission of making a great artist and so I think that counterbalances it because those whales recognize that that's not a very exciting concept for art or as an artist so there's a lot of I think shared debate and shared discussion um and we're looking at delegation systems as well to be able to spread that so that you could really be a patron where you spread that wealth and give people the ability to really earn without having that capital or as large as a capital stake um but yeah I one thing we've seen is as the community has grown that Revenue gets spread thinner and thinner and I think one thing that I've just that's kind of occurred to me is just the importance of that intrinsic motivation we we did a study with the MIT media lab on a number of things and one of the things they looked at was just you know why are you a part of Botto and I mean the token was in the absolute dumps at the time so nobody was making money off of it and everyone's like well I'm not making money off of it but I I just love that I'm being a part of what I think is the future of Art and some people's perspectives the future of society um and that intrinsic motivation was highly motivated I mean we have people who are spending tons of time for not a huge financial reward and and I think that [Music] um yeah I I mean it it I don't think it's going to be paying a lot of people's rents um but I think it is going to give us uh control over things that give us the autonomy to carve out a life for ourselves say if there's Ubi that's not necessarily based just off of small fraction of royalties but actually a cut of of say some larger companies revenues um that give us meaning and give us purpose and have a sense of agency in our lives because if we don't have that I mean I don't know how you feel about it but I'm not feeling good if I don't feel like I have agency and you know there's this talk of people who are opting out of these uh these AI training systems and I wonder how many more people would opt in um not necessarily for a cut but just for a say on how that data is used that ability to govern these things uh so I I think that agency is incredibly important if you know I listen I'm not making predictions here I don't know if it's going to solve all of our material problems but let's say it does we're going to have need to have some meaning and purpose and it's going to be that Collective meaning making so I'm kind of skirting around whether it'll actually pay our rent but I think through different means and purposes but it can give us meaning and can provide a medium to make reading meaning with love that the takeaways and the key themes that I'm with are around how it's not just about AI versus human creation that AI can really augment and enhance human created work and be used to extend the imagination of the Creator or the author we also talked about this idea of how the human role shifts more towards meaning making and curation which affords people a sense of agency and control and meaning in their own lives as well and then I think there's also open questions but also potential to design new economic systems to Route some of the proceeds back to artists themselves potentially through a universal basic income or Universal creative income type of program it all starts with Providence and where this work actually originated from so anyways I wanted to thank you guys for being here today for an awesome conversation Simon Sasha Thiago thank you so much thank you
