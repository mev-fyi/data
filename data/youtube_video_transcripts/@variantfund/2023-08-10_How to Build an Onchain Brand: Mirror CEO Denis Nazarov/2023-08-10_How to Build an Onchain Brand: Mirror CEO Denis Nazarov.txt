foreign I'm Dennis founder of mirror really excited to be here I'll talk about my background in a little bit thank you for having me you guys bring awesome people together uh this is a big big honor to present here so the presentation here I'm going to be talking about building an Unchained brand uh and the the subtitle is about how projects and creators can leverage nfcs to activate their communities and build long-term engagement really excited about that I think topics everyone is interested in um basically we're seeing some really exciting new ways especially companies and projects are leveraging nfts just to build really engaged communities and it's just completely new marketing strategy and Community Building strategy I'm going to talk a bit about that and also how a mirror fits into that Journey all right so just 15 minutes I'm gonna give a big introduction talk about unchain Brands talk about value versus greeting for both creators and collectors you have a little case study of a project you guys may have heard of called base and talk about some additional examples and we'll open up to questions very excited about the question part so intro um as meta was saying uh I go way back with the variant team which a big honor variant was was our first investor at the company and yeah Jesse and I were actually co-founders of a company called media chain media chain I think is kind of a intellectual precursor to a lot of ideas behind mirror we were exploring ideas of Creator contribution uh uh content provenance using blockchains and it's a project that's actually started before ethereum existed before nfts existed but what we really we're really trying to create an event was nfts which I think solved a lot of the problems we were exploring at the time and had a fun one year Spotify before being on the founding team of B16 crypto where also continue working with Jesse and met people like Lee and Nina who are super awesome and again very very special to begin without a mirror in 2020 and I've been working on that for the past few years and just a little kind of segue into uh what I'm gonna be talking about here is about a year ago I published a blog post called collect this thing you like and the premise of it was that you know these core interaction models you know actions we take in web 2 platforms you know liking content following creators following Brands following projects which is kind of becoming more and more devaliant these were just clearly these you know siled interactions that lived in databases they weren't very valuable and as we were studying nfts more and more closely this new action the collect action the mint action was looking similar to web 2 interactions but it was just way more valuable it was creating new forms of business while new forms of community engagement and we think that it's revolutionized how creators think about their practices online but also that Brands and projects you know companies as big as coinbase and I think it's going to resonate with a lot of what you guys are building here you know projects can leverage nft strategies to grow much bigger and much more engaged communities and be much more successful so what is an on-chain brand and I want to start with kind of putting it in perspective of Legacy Brands and the problems with them and main issue I think is that just if you look at a legacy brand after you understand an Unchained brand is that just they're just way more passive these passive audiences right even though Brands invest so much money in 2022 alone over a trillion dollars was invested in marketing globally truly limited it's really fallen short I think the main issues are that these creators they really lack ownership right these networks are in total control they can boot participants as they want and creators don't own the content that they share and a creator of a project may be leveraging multiple platforms like Twitter Facebook but it creates this fragmentation it goes with core architecture you know these themes are very familiar to everyone you know these identity systems are not interoperable the data is siled you have this these relationships kind of in fragmented platforms the data is fragmented it's really hard to work with and then I think the most important thing is that these web 2 actions are low value as I was saying before there's really no incentive to meaningfully participate in the Creator journey and I think as as Brands and projects try to create communities that are way more actively involved and way more participatory web tools launcher right and just sum it up is like you can like a post but you can never own it you can never own that be part of that Journey own a piece of that story The the project describes itself to create I think unchain Brands as a foil to that they enable active communities to to the passive audiences of support you and what is that predicate on one it's connection right NFC based experiences we think facilitate this notion of digital belonging I think the best brands have leveraged you know physical assets whether it's you know think of fashion think of sports teams where you know merchandise Collectibles are so important to create a sense of physical belonging in the real world and I think we've until nfcs we haven't had a technology to facilitate that digitally and this new connection is possible with like like an individuals who are becoming collectors that collect these lftus and the foundation of that is ownership so when you give your supporters at stake and what the in the process deal with nfts you create these really powerful incentives your friends want to help build with you they want to improve what you're doing they want to spread the word by marketing your project and they want to become patrons of what you're doing and because it's on blockchains and using nfts and open protocols you get an interoperability out of the box again unlike this channel fragmentation we're seeing the core identity primitive of warps 3 is a wallet right and you know while it's an interoper with applications and they can be used across multiple channels you can see your for example your mirror users as well it's but maybe those same collectors those same subscribers that you see as well it's you can also see them as users of your own products you know if you're building a D5 protocol where people interact with you on chain it's the same identity system and this internet offer ability is really really powerful and then the flip side of that is because what's in your wallet is public it's a way for your fans to share what they love because it's in their wallet and nft is kind of this new form of cookie that's way more powerful and then finally because nfcs are programmable there's a completely new design space of rewards and incentives you can incentivize your collectors and reward your early supporters by building that into to the nfts I think just to tie it all together we're going from web to social graphs to web3 socioeconomic graphs and unlike you know before creators produce content that lives in a database that had these weak interactions of likes and follows content is now assets right content is how nfts you can own it you can put in your wallet and The Collector is now an owner a stakeholder they are way more active socioeconomic participant I think this new kind of socioeconomic graph is emerging so you probably recognize a bunch of these projects and logos these are actually all mirror users and they're all taking this Unchained brand strategy nft strategy to to make their community members collectors owners of what they're doing and what's uniting all of them is that the donkey and assets are getting the socioeconomic growth through ownership so what what what is the value of this for creators so as I was saying before these passive followers and uploaders now they're active collectors and collecting is a super high intent action so before you know people talk about the friction of crypto you know gas costs are are a big problem um you know using a wallet is clunky Etc but the fact that NFC ecosystem continues to grow I think it proves that what these community members see on the other side of that collect action is something really really valuable uh something really worthwhile doing even though there's friction I think it's friction decreases so she's going to grow more and more I think the flip side of that is the second notion of economic participation it's not just a social kind of a follower or audience member this is an economic participant in what you're what you're creating and what's really powerful and this is what mirror enables with our kind of hybrid subscription um and email and wallet identity is that you can associate a wallet address with an email so you have both a way to re-engage your audience and communicate with them but also you have you have the role and the notion was very powerful because your brand can now live in the wall of your Community member and it's a way for them to propagate what you're doing so think of you know the way you wear you know uh maybe a company t-shirt you know you're a big fan of NASA or SpaceX you know it's part of your identity when you wear it on the street you kind of signal what you're into what you believe in we again we believe that nfts enable that digitally and that wasn't possible before before this technology and it's all about open data and the activity being just launching and finally because of this new patronage relationship that creators have way more Independence and design space to create something that fancy themselves in and again I think like discussion of participation uh being part of something the engagement higher quality and better so on The Collector side I mentioned before like think of it as a brand t-shirt uh maybe it's a it's a it's a band a music band that you really love or you know a tote bag for your favorite magazine like the New Yorker tote bag is a a weight and Signal identity as you're walking down the streets of New York City that you know you're into you're kind of intellectual you're into this certain type of content you know you you build your identity around the information you consume I think nfts you can think of as digitally native swag you can get from a project and your people you can put their daddy you're out I think unlike generic swag it's a way to record the community member's support from day one and you can build rewards on top of that right you can uh you can represent status you know something as simple as a Discord role but maybe more power more powerful privileges or voting rights in your community it's a way to say the how close you're affiliated with the project it's a way to get an equity stake in the project and I think some of the more advanced Parts you know they they invite a community MSC part of the creative process part of the decision making there's this uh there's this uh powerful stat uh done by McKinsey around traditional brands that brands that provide personalized experiences are seeing way higher engagement and their customers are more likely to buy from them I think also the fact that entities are programmable it's this new design space of personalization um enabled by the programmability of nfts and generated MCS being being one of them it's this kind of an emergent field design so I'm going to give a quick Speedy quick case study um I mentioned base earlier uh many of you are probably familiar with bass uh I think uh in one of the variant events uh we have actually adjust the lead behind base uh I'll give a presentation about the strategy there but base is uh it's an ethereum scaling solution uh incubated by coinbase uh they're building you know too I think they're taking on a very interesting Community Building marketing storytelling strategy uh that's kind of Unchained first meant first they're trying to leverage as much web shoot web 3 creative tools as they can they're trying to nfts around their entire journey and it's I think it's been paying awfully well uh to build the early engaged Community for them so I'm going to talk about a little bit about their marketing Playbook so base started off with a Genesis nft ending this is a big a big pattern emerging across the ecosystem when you announce yourself to the world you know we used to have white papers maybe you know back in uh 2017 2015. today we're seeing the the Genesis NFC when you announce it it's a first touch one with your community and it gives them a way to to own uh your logo it's a way to you know their brand to to live in their wallet and mayor has one of our Hallmark features is called subscribe to Mint it's a way to offer a free nft edition freedom in um it's a way for frequently kind of a gift to your community what's unique about it is your audience is required to subscribe to your publication with their email in order to collect the free NFC it's this really powerful way to activate your subscribers you give them this free nft and at the Genesis of your project you bootstrap this communication Channel with your audience that then as you tell your journey and track the Milestones of your community you have a way to send an update directly to your community environment so basically very successful there's over 400 000 ft's minted at the time is one of the most popular uh nfts on ethereum they're also leveraging this tactic of partnership celebration so basis built uh on the optimism stack optimism technology they made this nft to celebrate the collaboration I think what was really clever and smart here was that base started off you know it was an unknown project unknown brand they didn't have an established following this fled them cross-pollinate user bases optimism had a big engaged audience already this nft which was also shared by optimism exposed the Optimus liquidity to this new project being built on top of optimism so it's again celebrating collaboration with a different Community we're seeing a bunch of projects nft projects doing collaborations Crossovers and we think nfts Vision activities visual representation again something for your community to own so over 200 000 collectors went through this there's also a tactic of community celebration so this this nft is actually a screenshot of an email the base team got from a Community member the Community member they actually own base.e the ens name and they said hey I really like what you guys are doing I really like the vision behind bass I want to give to you base.e so you can have an unshamed native name you know it's kind of very Vision aligned with you it was really awesome celebration of a gesture of Goodwill from the community and again kind of leveraging nfts to just you know propagate this you know story to everyone to put it in their wallets and it was formed two-way marketing right that The Narrative building doesn't have to come top down from the marketing team or the founders you can actually Elevate Community Voices and you know the fact that you're making Collectibles is a powerful way to place it in the wallet your audience another tactic is celebrating uh in-person events using co-ops and kind of uh Collectibles of representing IRL events so a couple of months ago base had a big Presence at Denver um they they gave talks they had some hackathons around around their test net Denver and I think was just really powerful way to again continue telling their journey to create a new Milestone their Community you know celebrated the 5 000 people that visited in their booth and they have this cool animation and I mean again it's very cool combination of High relevant with with giving you something to code then you know their blog post obviously blog post on mirror that announced some of the stats on the success of the event but again it was it was uh punctuated with something to collect to celebrate the journey and then finally I think the most trouble and tactic is this Milestone celebrations so a few weeks ago base announced that early August they have a date set for launching mainnet and this is obviously you know all of their community members were just something they've been waiting for for a while um for an L2 that's going to integrate with the coinbase ecosystem is is something people are really excited about and it was just this cool animation that commemorated them all Stone so a lot of projects are also leveraging something similar when you know they're launching features they have a release they they launch on mainnet they give their Community something to collect to commemorate that milestone and and it's this big celebration uh that lives in the wallet so just to recap I think what we're seeing emerged is not just uh you know doing an nft as a one-ops but seeing a coherent strategy where you have strong tactics for activating your user base with this Genesis 10ft of your brand but also a coherent recurrence strategy to re-engage your audience you know giving them something to engage with every week and do it in this much higher value on chain uh in wallet way where there's both narrative consistency you know think of it as a you know a screenplay with you know different Acts or like a series uh on TV you want narrative consistency but also I think this has done a very great job of aesthetic consistency like every if you look at all the nfts together there's really consistent creative Direction in your early steel like you know you want to collect them all you want to complete the series and you're proud of showing it off in your wallet and just to share some stats I think it's it's been really exciting so uh over a hundred thousand writing acts you've sub invented and just another feature of Mayor that all content you publish on there every uh all written content it's collectible by default so without doing any extra work if your team already has an editorial strategy maybe you're doing a newsletter maybe you're doing just you know weekly updates celebrating your ecosystem mirror lets you make those collectible by default and it's just another touch point for your community to collect your content so over a hundred thousand have been minted of those uh base has over 60 000 total collectors and we're excited about was the recurrent collector stat that over 26 000 collectors have collected more more than once and some super fans are are trying to collect everything they're putting out on visitors we're also seeing that on the order of 10 times more visitors for a post that has an nft embedded so just if there's something to collect the amount of traffic content Garners is is supporters of magnitude higher which is really exciting and then finally base is about to hit 500 000 total subscribers just showing that you know in only a few months uh they're able to much more quickly uh with shop a really engaged subscriber base and we think that nfts is accusing if you compare that to you know a typical substance strategy you know people refer to fabric but the nuclear slog but you have to publish content weekly monthly for a really long time to kind of linearly grow your audience we're seeing nfts as this incentive to much much more quickly activate a subscriber base so just some additional examples and beforehand um this isn't only working for big projects or companies like base it's also working for small creators I think this is actually the origin of the Playbook is is how creators and of Market you know their nft projects so nicknell is a small artist Collective that uh recently released this uh nft drop and these mirror and other nft tools to also kind of build awareness of their project they released a few mint passes kind of in this aesthetic of a video poster but there was three of them to like they were free nfts they used this to uh bootstrap a way to communicate with their audience and the early collectors of the 3dfc were then added to the OLS so they just created more engagement through this kind of built up to the eventual campaign and it was this combination of Storytelling of releasing free NF teams and against all kind of uh this cohort Twitter collectors were minting more than once which is really exciting and again mirror really helped them associated with that their on-chain address with an email address and made it easy for the community to keep in touch uh with their families and they ended up actually adding every mirror subscriber to their allowance because all your subscribers are also wallets they got added to the all lists uh the allow us members got a discount and the the eventual job was a big success so we see subscribed in working really well for for all kinds of projects Linea a few months ago activated uh in about a week an audience for 100 000 collectors optimism is also one of our most engaged users uh they had they did this they have this really cool Phoenix kind of mascot that was afraid of two that over 300 000 people collected and also seeing Partnerships being a really big scene I I imagine a lot of you are familiar with with zorbs and and this kind of supersora brand asset that they've been using over the past year uh and there's there's been a Zorb collaboration with with every brand so there's a resort with optimism um this work with gallery and I think it's really awesome unified aesthetic of this sphere that is is this Zora brand that's kind of become iconic at this point using it for crossovers with communities again to cross-pollinate um audiences and then interface is a web 3 mobile app that's kind of an activity action activity Explorer they recently interviewed Emir content into their product and did an nft we're using Premiere logo with a kind of a representation between their products so again these crossovers are a really powerful way to Leverage nfcs and that's basically it um it yeah so you guys want to uh we'd love to invite you know all the all the great Builders are present in this
