foreign is about psychological ownership so this is a topic that I have written about a lot recently um and something that I'm really trying to instill in Builders Minds is something that can really differentiate products in our competitive space so I'll first give a recap of the piece that I published But ultimately I think this is a topic that is best Illustrated with examples case studies and discussion on your own so we're going to walk through some case studies and then do breakout discussions with small groups of Founders so you'll have a chance to meet each other later on and also I want to make this session really interactive so feel free to drop questions or comments into the chat throughout okay let's get started so firstly just to refresh quickly what is psychological ownership it's the feeling of possession or mindness over a product or service in other words it's that feeling of emotional attachment that you have over a particular product um it's a concept that actually has been studied very extensively in consumer psychology and consumer marketing so it's not a term or a concept that I came up with myself but rather it has a long history in the consumer marketing world and I really just recently remixed it with crypto and notably this sense of attachment over a product or service is actually distinct from whether users legally own something so people can be legally an owner of something but not be all much ownership and vice versa they can feel a lot of ownership over things that they aren't actually legally owners over um what are some examples of products where users feel a lot of ownership but may not actually have legal ownership feel free to drop in some examples into the chat social media yes a playlist exactly yeah these are all great examples I often talk about social media as an example of this um where yeah users really feel like it's theirs but it's not legally there as per the terms of service and then in terms of the counter example of cases where users have legal ownership that don't feel a lot of psychological ownership I often talk about stocks ET apps mutual funds our retirement accounts um things that we probably don't even know what's in there but we actually do own them so yeah psychological ownership exists on a spectrum and and there are products that have weaker psychological ownership and those that we have very strong psychological ownership over psychological ownership is really important in the consumer product world because it's associated with all of these positive things like increased willingness to pay greater retention more word of mouth growth users will feel more responsible over the product they actually feel more satisfied with the product and in digital communities where people have a high sense of ownership they actually contribute more and they contribute at higher quality so the the reasons why this happens is also rooted in Psychology there's a lot of behaviors um that people exhibit that aren't entirely rational but have their grounds in consumer psychology so for instance there's this thing called the endowment effect where when people own an object they actually value it much higher irrationally over its market value um similarly loss aversion is this other phenomenon where when people own something the pain of losing it is actually more powerful than the pressure of gaining it there's another cognitive bias called the Ikea effect where consumers place a disproportionately high value on something that they themselves have partially created in reference to Ikea furniture and so anyways all of this is to say that psychological ownership is very deeply rooted in Psychology it's behavior that users exhibit perhaps not rationally but it's this very invisible X Factor that successful products can leverage and once you're aware of this Dynamic you kind of see it in all of the products around you and the good news for Builders is that it's not just a fixed quality of products you can actually do things as a builder to actively cultivate psychological ownership through storytelling through marketing or through product design and we'll talk about how to do that so why is it important for crypto projects in particular to care about psychological ownership so I think in crypto we've introduced crypto ownership or digital asset ownership which is kind of the digital counterpart to Legal contracts enforcing legal ownership but I think a lot of projects haven't developed the same level of psychological ownership that goes along with that asset ownership and as mentioned people aren't just rational beings they are irrational and so psychological lover is this lever that you can pull onto gender positive outcomes for your projects these are a couple of comments that came in response to the piece that I published that I really agree with I think introducing asset ownership without introducing psychological ownership enables speculation should run rampant and it also encourages people to join projects or to become holders of projects not because they actually care about them but because they're interested in a financial being farming an airdrop or just for earnings I also think another reason why crypto projects should care about psychological ownership is because asset ownership plus psychological ownership can be a very powerful combination so we now have this new tool in the toolkit which is to leverage tokens and to turn users into actual owners and if we combine that with a sense of attachment it can mean projects that are much more powerfully retentive can unseat incumbents can grow much faster and quicker than the unowned unuser-owned version could so before we dive into how to design products that actually engender this feeling of attachment let's unpack the different drivers of psychological ownership and I'm going to speed through these because a lot of this was in the essay that you've already read so I'm going to illustrate it with examples so there's basically four drivers of psychological ownership that are in the literature there's self-investment control intimate knowledge and self-object congruity Okay so self-investment who can tell me what self-investment is and why do I have a photo of David helps Twitter in here thank you someone could unmute and and answer or they can drop her into the chat any takers I'm going to call and call on people how about Benny Benny Chang I was just writing a big question for you Lee um I just sent it in the the chat uh I don't know what self-investment is but I was if I was to guess it's about investing in yourself close it's investing yourself into a particular product so it's about investing time energy effort contributing to projects um yeah like basically pour in your heart and soul into a product and so why doing what they call dog fooding a product or no different I think that's different yeah their self-investment is what users do dog booting is what developers do to test something but self-investment is basically getting users to contribute effort and energy into product and by doing so they develop a greater sense of loyalty and attachment to it because they've put themselves into it so I Illustrated this with David Phelps because I think he is a Twitter power user and at this point Twitter is basically an extension of his identity because he has poured so much Blood Sweat and Tears into it um so the next driver is control this is a driver of that feeling of ownership because if someone can control something even like physically control it through touch they are much like more likely to feel ownership um and this boost in that feeling of ownership contributes them being to being willing to pay more for an object to being much more likely to impulse purchase it and to Value it much more highly you can see this effect in action through different products out there that encourage the sense of control among consumers so there's a lot of try before you buy products out there that get you to like feel control and tactically touch an object in the hopes that you're going to convert to purchase even test driving a car has been shown to enhance that feeling of ownership because you picture yourself owning it and and then you're much more likely to actually buy the item in the digital world this sense of control can also be built in as well so on the left hand side and I put an example of a user on Tick Tock saying commenting to stay on Swifty Tick Tock taking Taylor Swift tick tock to affect the algorithm and to customize their own experience so users on Tick Tock very much feel like they can control their app experience by doing things like this by commenting engaging with videos that they like and so they have a sense of control over their app experience and it enhances their feeling of ownership over their own Tick Tock they feel like it's their Tick Tock experience or their algorithm another way to help users feel control is by including them in the product feedback process or including done in the co-creation process I think this ties in well with governance for jowls in crypto governance is one way that users feel control and so deepen their feeling of ownership with projects there have also been a lot of studies showing that if you include customers very early on in the product development process if you solicit their input and do user surveys they feel much more bought in and much more likely to refer other users to it because they feel like a part owner of it and I think it's interesting in crypto that um basically this governance aspect is usually put in place after users actually become owners of an asset so the governance power is attached to an asset that you own whereas there's actually I think an opportunity to flip that where people can build an attachment to a product through participating in co-creation and thereby become an asset owner later so Mastery or intimate knowledge is the third driver of psychological ownership basically as users get more information about something their feelings of ownership increase in a software example like after learning all the shortcuts of superhuman you feel more bought in you feel like a pro you feel like this is your email client that you're going to use and so it deepens your sense of attachment with it and in the offline world we have examples of like people feeling like a restaurant is their local restaurant or they're they're at their neighborhood park is their park because they have so much intimate knowledge or Mastery of that particular thing I think also to continue the Superhuman example I think one of the ways that they've cultivated this intimate knowledge is through their onboarding process so if you sign up for superhuman early on um they did this white glove one-on-one onboarding experience that got users up the power learning curve and cause them to develop intimate knowledge and therefore become much more likely to activate and retain and continue to be engaged okay and lastly We have self-object congruity basically it's a mouthful but what this means is like alignment with how users see themselves it's the idea of the product and the self-sharing meaningful associations so the the products the token or whatever um what it stands for all of its values its connotations aligns with how users see themselves and so users gravitate towards Brands towards products that closely match their self imagine their self-concept whether that's real or aspirational in the Fashion World you might purchase things that UCL aligns with your self-image and this also happens in the digital world so for the manifold example the reason why I think one of the reasons why manifold has taken off among creators is not necessarily that the tools are that different from what else is offered out there but people want to call themselves a manifold Creator because it has associations with serious art and on the right hand side I think Bitcoin is an example of a community that has really high psychological ownership where people really see themselves in the values of the Bitcoin community are there other examples of crypto projects where you guys feel like self-object congruity is a key driver a user's sense of attachment with that community I think of the uh the the Constitution Dao like people had a really strong sense of ownership over that doubt because they liked seeing themselves as like owners of democracy or like supporting of democracy and so I can see that for that down yeah I agree with that and I I think the fact that people were changing their Twitter handles or Twitter like um usernames to reflect the Constitution logo or Emoji reflected that alignment with their self-concept like any project that um people are willingly like opting in to change their profiles to basically advertise that project indicates to me that people feel really um really aligned with its values and they feel like it's a reflection of themselves it's a way to Signal their identity okay lots of examples in here nouns agree um mean coins definitely for some of them dot E I agree with 40 yes noggles as well yeah I think this is like a really big driver of that feeling of attachment in crypto um is this element of self-object congruity and I think even to some extent like the way that developers choose what chain to deploy on or which altuja boy on the self-object contrary and that values alignment and what they want to project to the world is at play as a factor as well beyond just the utilitarian aspects and so for Builders I think the the takeaway here is if you want to tap into this driver if you want to cultivate that attachment with your users standing for a clear set of values making it easy for people to to understand what you stand for and to feel alignment with that is pretty key and that's where storytelling comes in okay so now that we've gone through all of the drivers of psychological ownership let's talk about how to actually put this into practice as Builder so let's go through some case studies of projects that I think do a good job of creating attachment with their users and then we can tease out how exactly they did it and then we'll tie it all into strategies Okay so bright moment since the first example that I have here the but the reason why I included bright moments is because it is an nft that I hold that I feel disproportionate psychological ownership over out of all of the nfts that I minted um so just to share the back story of how I got the Sprite moments on FG and what even this is so bright moments is a gel they do pop up in person live minting sessions at cities all around the world they found activations across the US and Europe and in Asia recently and I personally went to London to mend this thing called a crypto engineer and basically the experience was that well first of all I physically flew to London I made an appointment to go mint my nft at a certain time and date I then showed up to the appointment I was led up to a room with piano music fresh flowers I was given champagne the co-founders were there to greet me in person and I then live minted this nft which I saw through this magnifying glass they gave me a book they also gave me sheet music which was generated to correspond with my nft um and so I've sent home with all of these things and yeah I feel much more attached to this nft than to a lot of other nfts that I just mentioned through pressing a button on a website so yeah I would love to hear from you guys what are the drivers of psychological ownership you think this experience tapped into and Madea just dropped in before drivers here into the chat to remind you guys that self-investment control Mastery or alignment with their self-concept so which of these do you think is at play in this experience um Megan can you say more about self-investment here yeah you had to physically book a flight you um took your time and energy to like make an effort to in be present to this experience um so that's why I thought and self-investment I think yeah I agree I agree with that I agree with the control aspect as well it Taps into um because it was like a tactile experience and I could actually physically be in the space be the nft in person um I felt more in control of the nft that I got even though it was just a psychological element Carson can you say more about um alignment with self-concept yeah I mean uh obviously I don't really know you that well but um seems like kind of the way you describe the event with like the music and the flowers and the location and the people there it I would assume aligned with things that you kind of enjoy like okay very clean experience I like clean experiences making everything uh like making every part of the experience uh like tactile and special with the sheet music and stuff like that and attaching things uh that you might align yourself with even if they don't have to do anything with the nft like makes the memory of the event so much more special than just the nft itself yeah I think that's a really good Insight um I hadn't even thought of that but I very much agree with you I think the nft um does align with myself concept I mean the fact that I opted into going to London going to this in-person experience it already showcases that there was some sort of similarity there between the crypto Londoner and me um so I agree with that okay let's keep going through some other case studies so the next one that I'll talk about is the Shibuya producer pass nft um so these first two examples are for for tokens for projects that are launching tokens in some way and then the other examples we'll talk about um other products that don't necessarily involve tokens because I know that a lot of builders in the room might not actually be launching tokens but Shibuya is this Community Driven content creation platform with fan-driven funding and fan-driven decision making of films so their first film called White Rabbit was crowdfunded through a sale of producer past nfts like the one that's shown here and nft holders get to basically use their nft to vote on the plot of every subsequent chapter of the film and so this mechanism gives fans a richer experience of ownership it's not just an nft that you own but it's an nft that you can use and as a data point um that I think is very interesting I think they have really high psychological ownership and I I can say that because 80 of the producer pass holders are participating in voting so far which is really really high compared to most governance experiences so users are definitely very active and engaged with the community and so yeah what drivers of psychological ownership do you think this producer pass nft or should we as a platform is leveraging here um control for sure it's a type of control that's very um tangible and real to users people are able to control the outcome of the film through their nfts I think that's the primary one I think self-investment is there as well um people are investing time money energy creative energy into this experience of the nfg um so very very much agree nikhil can you say more about alignment reviews or self-concept yeah I mean I think it's if you're getting that kind of flexibility and control to be able to do certain things you're actually able to shape that in terms of how you kind of see yourself um so any type of like nft project that allows you to kind of have that type of flexibility and dynamic nature mm-hmm yeah I agree yeah there's an element of like you are electing to affect the the plot of the film and so you're you're um naturally choosing a plot path that aligns with your interests and so I think there is this manifestation of that alignment too okay cool um by the way great question Jesse can you have self-investment without control I think something to note which um I hadn't made explicit is a lot of the drivers are very much overlapping so a lot of them interplay with each other through one you can get the other so for instance um in the process of gaining Mastery or deep knowledge about something let's say you get really deep knowledge about your local restaurant you're also investing your time and effort and energy there too so those two things I think are really coarsely coupled um yeah I think all of the drivers are interrelated okay let's keep moving so the next example here is sound the music nft platform and in particular this is Coop's Cooper turley's profile on sound which is comprised of his music nfts that he's collected the artist that he's backed it also has this badge on the right hand side to show his ranking of like his basically his leaderboard ranking in terms of his collector because if you're on the on the platform and when I asked Cooper how does he feel about this profile does he share it um and like how closely aligned with it does he feel he said he told me I share the coop record profile quite a bit I think it's a good representation of my music identity which is a subset of my wider on-chain presence and so to me that sounds a lot like self object congruity alignment with his self image and so um basically by creating this profile that is populated with nfts that he's and chosen he's assembled this image of this reflection of his on-chain music taste and so I think this experience deepens his attachment to those particular music nfgs um and it also potentially deepens this attachment to sound as a platform because sound is then the public profile that he's sharing out to others that he's using to display his identity one thing that I'll add in terms of I think how sound can actually further cement users attachment with its product is by making the stage even more personalizable right now there's limited ability to personalize the sound profile Pages you can set a bio you can write a small about line but there's not much beyond that and so there's limited ability to invest yourself into your profile Beyond just purchasing things I think if they're equal to if users are able to customize their profile Pages much more um it will enable people to invest much more deeply into their sound profiles okay um I see a lot of questions in chat yeah okay agree by the way I'll take a pause for questions after these case studies okay um PSD projects are a great example of the power of identity signaling and creating user attachment I think pfps took off because they took advantage of an existing surface area which was Twitter that allowed users to Showcase very their digital identity Twitter for over 300 million users is already a core part of your identity and so pfps were able to piggyback off of that and be really effective in identity signaling and signaling who you were what your tribe and Community membership was what values you had because it had this space that it could leverage on an existing social platform I think it's really notable that other categories of nfts that are more emergent like maybe fashion nfts or podcast nfts they don't naturally have this surface area on which users can experience their ownership and identity signal because there aren't really the display spacers for those nfts and so a lot of those emerging nft projects are actually then having to build their own verticalized products in the hopes that users can then self identity signal in the context of their own workwise products okay I'm Gonna Keep moving in the interest of time so um Blackbird is a membership and loyalty platform for the restaurant industry uh users loyalty to certain Merchants is denoted through these nfts that you collect um and so your nft has certain level Associated which gives you certain perks of these merchants and then every time you check in you also earn their point system called fly so I'm the owner of three of these Blackbird nfts at different restaurants in New York City and um one time recently I actually walked one and a half miles downtown just to use this membership nft at morgensterns even though I passed by probably 20 different ice cream shops on the walk there um and the reason why I did that was because I knew that I'd own this thing I felt a lot of ownership I wanted to utilize that ownership um and yeah I would love to hear your thoughts on like what how does lockbird engender this feeling of attachment or ownership with its users like which of the drivers are at play here this one's a little bit more complex oh any thoughts about Frankie and staff I'm gonna call on people I I think it helps you feel like a little bit more than just a consumer or a customer for a company when you have this added attachment to it and for the reasons like you just said you kind of walked past all these other places you could have gone to because even though you might not be a regular at this place you feel like Still A step above just a shop because you feel can a direct connection to it now right and and I think that really leaned anxiety of Mastery uh the gamification of it especially where there's a there are levels as you progress through the New York City uduri Scene yeah I agree with both of those things um I think Mastery is at play I think self-investment is at play um but basically like Yeah by I think Blackbird has done a really good job of gamifying the experience of developing Mastery of these Merchants um and so yeah the the fly system the nfts and the fact that they level up it leads users through the Journey of developing intimate knowledge of merchants um and so it like on on balance like I'm much more inclined to go to a blackbird Partners store because the experience of checking in there and being at the restaurant is gamified and I'm get getting rewarded for it um and through that process I'm also deepening my attachment to the restaurant and so um it kind of feeds it's like the Spy wheel that feeds on itself I'm they're creating more attachment to these Merchants through this gamification system and over time um all of my nfts collectively I also feel like represent my dining taste um and are something that I'm quite proud to Showcase as well so there's also an element of self-object congruity as well um nikhil to your question of like how does this feel different than something like four squares it's interesting that you ask that because Foursquare is literally my next example in here um so I'll talk about that Michael yes it is a soul bound token um so these nfts are non-transferable at least for the time being and I think this is another critical element to make me feel more tied and and to feel more ownership with Blackbird um they they've LED with like creating emotional attachment to these restaurants into these nfts instead of leading with financialization and so um there's a lot of studies about how extrinsic motivation can actually crowd out intrinsic interests and in this case they've totally removed the extrinsic factor from from the equation there is no potential for profit and so really what I'm channeling my energy into is investing in Blackbird the app the nfts and developing intouchnet with the merchants without any extrinsic motivation okay um and then the last case study at that I'll talk there is from the web 2 world so even without tokens products are able to Garner this feeling of psychological ownership and I think Foursquare is a really good example it's this local check-in and Discovery app that it looks like a lot of people used to use I used to use it got up to 50 million users at one point and they had a lot of really neat gamification and competitive features inside of the app for instance if you checked into a particular spot more than anyone else in the past 60 days you were Crown mayor of that particular place and so I was mayor of a bunch of places in Cambridge and New York um and I think this experience created intense attachment to Foursquare and to your profile and almost irrationally users wanted to check in everywhere and we're very afraid of losing their mayorship and they had lots of other features like Badges and leaderboards and so the drivers of psychological ownership but I think Foursquare tapped into where personal investment so you invested a lot of time and energy into Foursquare trying to get these Badges and and trying to get the mayorship and that deepened your tie to this app um you also felt Mastery and intimate knowledge of the app as well because you through this experience of investing your energy into it you obviously became a power user and then there was an aspect of self-object Hungary as well because who was mayor and who had these badges was public um users could see who was associated with certain spots and so there was definitely an identity signaling uh being known as the mayor of a place or or being a power user of the app um and people were proud of that element okay so putting it all together what are the common strategies in all of these examples I want to synthesize it for everyone so the first strategy here is really applicable to projects that have a token or are looking to launch a token but creating a richer experience of ownership like the bright moments experience or the Shibuya experience of control can help deepen the tie that users feel to your token versus just treating it like a financial asset enabling identity signaling is another strategy so enabling users to flex their ownership to signify what they want to about themselves through your product is a good way of creating that sense of ownership personalization so products that are personalizable and customizable like Twitter or potentially your sound profile these products through person through being personalizable they allow users to invest their time energy and effort into it I think this is a driver that is underexplored in the web 3 product World by the way and lastly gamifying the process of investing energy into a product and the process of gaining Mastery is another lover that a lot of these products that I just highlighted utilize so that gamification can take the form of leveraging points tokens or off-chain features like mayor shops but through that gamification through competition they create um the conditions for users to want to invest more of themselves and their energy into a particular product and through that process develop really strong and loyal ties to it and the last three strategies on this list um can be leveraged by all types of products tokens apps um even like l1s and so I think these are strategies that are very broad-ranging and apply to all sorts of things that people might be building okay I'll pause there for questions that folks might have and also she could scan through the chat yeah does anyone have any questions and wants to unmute and ask I have a quick question yeah I guess I'm thinking about like potential uh pitfalls of of kind of following some of these strategies maybe before you have like a really strong sense of like product Market fit um so how do you you know how do you think about like incorporating these things into a product that like you've gotten a reasonable amount of validation on versus maybe falling into some of these things and then potentially getting like false signaling um your products value yeah I think that creating psychological ownership is definitely not a replacement for getting to product Market fit and like I think of psychological ownership as more of um a lever for retention and continued engagement versus unlocking product Market fit so once products are out there once they're solving a need that users have in order to continue to hold on to those users psychological ownership can be really important but it's not a Band-Aid or fixed to a product that locks product Market fit okay um going through the chat I wanted to let's see um scan through some of the questions in here so Benny you had a question about dunbar's number and psychological ownership are there like basically is the question like is there a cap of things that we are able to care about is that right yeah essentially I I don't know if you've come across anything like that but or if it even exists but um yeah I'm mostly curious about that yeah I haven't come across anything like that in the studies that I've read although I wouldn't be surprised if there was a limit um like there might be a dunbars number for things that we own not just relationships that we have but I haven't seen any discussion about what that what that cap is and I think it's also something that you can build around as like a product Builder like there are product experiences that you can build to maybe like increase the number of products that you care about and feel ownership over cool thank you yeah [Music] um okay let's see Jesse can you um say more about your question uh yeah sure I'm referencing maybe so my question just for references um how could psychological ownership be relevant for non-consumer facing products um so maybe mainly for like infrastructure companies or Dev tooling um I guess like not traditional consumers so for example we're building a compliance layer where our customers may be protocols for examples projects maybe traditional institutions yeah yeah I think it's a great question I I think that psychological ownership is probably um strongest for like most applicable and relevant to consumer-facing products I think um in a B2B context when you're selling to any sort of business for a soft solution or software like I think those customers tend to be more rational and less like prone to psychology as a lover for driving certain outcomes our team in discussing the topic of psychological ownership um we did discuss how we think psychological ownership is very much a factor that is at play in a lot of like core underlying infrastructure in crypto where a lot of these ecosystems and communities tap into different drivers of psychological ownership and are able to attract and retain community members because they feel like owners it's not just a utilitarian calculus but rather it's the alignment with their values the fact that they want to Identity signal that they're in a particular ecosystem over another and I think the the infrastructure projects that have been most successful have had a lot of clarity over their values and their mission statements such that users can decide whether or not they resonate with it and whether they want to align their own identity with it I challenge you just a little bit on the uh the B2B one um I think that I think that you're right is that consumer applications like we have you know more degree of likely inherit most of these properties but I do think that there is some degree of ownership with certain B2B products I'm thinking like like AWS where there's sort of a high degree of self-investment into learning how to use something like that um really high switching costs you have to retrain the team to use a new product if you want to do that um because you've invested so much time and so you're probably right that they these are sort of less common and less prominent but um I think they're still there in some B2B products yeah I think that's a great comment um sorry I can't see who's speaking in mind Zoom but whoever that was that was an awesome example I very much agree yeah B2B products can engender that kind of like um High degree of self-investment and Mastery such that switching costs are even higher okay um so there's a lot of questions in here um maybe I'll just take one more and then we can move into the breakout discussion or yeah the breakout exercises so um Carson do you want to unmute and say your question out loud yes so my question was just do you think financialization hinders psychological ownership and is the best route with crypto to stick with something soul-bound like you did with Blackbird or like as you explained with blackbird because I kind of think it does yeah um I think potentially it does yeah and there's so there's been a lot of studies about the interplay of financial incentives with intrinsic motivation to do something so there's all these studies about like how if you pay little kids to read they report that they enjoy reading less and so there does seem to be this crowding out effect where even if someone had enjoyed something before by introducing a financial component they are less intrinsically interested in doing that thing um and so in terms of psychological ownership we're really talking about like how can we get users to care and to feel attached to a product and I think by introducing financialization it potentially creates the risk that you're crowding out that intrinsic desire to use a particular product that said I think this topic is really complicated another study that I came across was basically around this was referenced in my essay it was around stock ownership and the impact that giving users stocked in the company would have on their spend at those Brands and so there was a fintech app that ran a study of users where if they were already Shoppers at certain brands they could be rewarded with stock in that brand and after they become became stock owners they're they're spending at those Brands actually jumped by like 40 percent and so in that case financializing the relationship giving them skin in the game further enhance their brand loyalty and their propensity to actually shop at those Brands but I think the critical component there was that those users were already emotionally attached those Brands they were already existing customers and so they already had a buy-in to the brand and this was further amplifying that versus simply paying any person on the street in stock and expecting them to then convert to Shoppers um Graham I will have to check it's it's referenced at the bottom of my hbr piece and I'll also send it out in slack I can't remember off the top of my head okay I think given um the time we should transition to putting this into practice and talking about um from examples of uh like companies that could benefit from psychological ownership and how to put this into practice for your own projects so there's a couple of case studies that are workshops that I designed so we're going to be splitting you up into groups and the first breakout exercise is to discuss in your group a particular crypto project that you think does an effective job at creating psychological ownership and in your group you're going to talk about which drivers of psychological ownership does the project tap into and then also Part B is to talk about how it could further amplify users attachment to their projects and then I I would love for you guys to also introduce yourself in your breakout rooms because there's Founders amongst fellows mixing together and also appoint a spokesperson to come back and share your learnings at the end of the conversation [Music] [Applause]
