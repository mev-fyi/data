okay my name is I'm in charge of the head of partnership at Crescent and I'm here to share what we've done and what we are going to do about the modular blockchain and before before I start about what we are going to do and what we've done on the modular blockchain I just want to point it out some strength and advantage of the modular blockchain so I want to start with the why modular blockchain first so why modular blockchain first so modular instead of one blockchain doing everything modular modular blockchain specialize in optimize to perform a given function to perform a given functions and this specialization provides a provider breakthrough in special scalability low entry barrier and flexibility also interoperability it's enabling developers to build smart blockchain application for Mass adoption okay let's sleep dive into each strength one by one the scalability scaling difficulty is mostly occur when one blockchain tries to handle all functions at once under a single layer but when we think about the mode core concept of the modular blockchain is that they separate all functions they separate the function across the multiple chains so this kind of the concept bring a lot of the scalability so the modular layer 1 like a Celestia they can specialize in providing a data data availability and security so modular layer 1 can focus its own resource on providing data availability and security for the layer 2 like a roll-off so next one is the actually the next page is the low entry barrier for the developers if developer could focus on the minimum such as execution and they can just plug in another modular blockchain component to handle the specific task like like a execution then it can highly reduce the burden of running a new blockchain so um learning a new blockchain I'm sorry about that so the last one is the flexibility so purpose build blockchain pro offers greater flexibility with respect to trade-off and Implement a design design implementation so um layer so the design Implement so when you think about the security and data availability layer they can they can get an extra benefit from the scale from the scalability because all all kind of the transaction is processed it separately and when you think about the security execution layer which is optimized to the scalability that can get a huge if huge benefit from the security so we just talk about the what kind of the benefit and all kind of the advantage of the modular blockchain has then let's I just want to share about the how we can flourish the modular blockchain so there it is really important for the modular blockchain to expand and build their their Market that can utilize and intensify the modularity so there are so many segments uh segments you can see the defy game and nft metaverse which can intensify that and tap into the modularity so I just want to uh talk about the D5 more deeply so when it comes to the D5 so to bring out the best in the modularity is that securing the connected liquidity so Crescent has a crescent has a vision to support the securing the connected liquidity then securing the liquidity is securing the connected liquidity is why is that so important it's because that because securing connected like they play an important role not only for the D5 but also the entire ecosystem there's a great example of the arbitrom actually RB trumps at the market strategy that can bring a high tvl and high high connected entire arbitrary ecosystem so they set the high tvl Market strategy so they start to incubate a lot a various part of the segments is DM and they they expand and they support a lot of the various segments D5 or D5 and various segment is diff icult so here's interesting data that we can we can see how arbitrome actually make a great Market strategy and go to market so the first of first of all the tvl they set the high tvl Market strategy so they so they incubate and they start to expand their Market which can bring a high tvl so this is as you can see at this point you can see the high tvl and it can make a lot of the app as well so because they their go to market strategy was the incubating various DF and various segments so the number of the DF is increased and next one is the daily active user because of the their go to market strategy their daily active user grow naturally because the number of DF increase and and organically a lot of user brought a lot of transaction as well so consequently as a result you can see a lot of the transaction can make a revenue of the entire platform so here's the here's the virtual cycle that RBS are actually going through the TBL growth and they said the market strategy that can bring a high tvl so they incubate a lot of the DM and they incubate the utility and it makes a lot of user and it brings a lot of transaction so transaction brings a lot of a lot of Revenue so this Revenue can for can contribute a lot of great utility and a lot of tons of the user user experience and user inter face so it this kind of the virtual cycle going through over and over and over and again on the entire arbitrary system so it's the modular ecosystem so to thrive in the modularity ecosystem they need to focus on the securing high high tvl so Kristan has a vision to Crescent has a vision to migrate specific feature on the Celestia to contribute the Celestia ecosystem we have been built Crescent on the Celestia for securing the connected liquidity which means the tvl so I'm here to share about our experience about uh our our experience about the module making a modularity and migration on the Celestia all the experience consists of the first step the first step is the roll kit version so actually the celestial rocket is made by the asike on and the most app chain or the most made by the SK also so you guys need to check the each for each version of the S key to make it compatible you need to understand what kind of version SDK each thing has been made the next step is for the customized SDK you need to choose the two direction the first direction is the rebasing and remove and second direction is the overriding and debugging the reason why we need to go through this process is that uh most abstained heavily customized their SDK for their app chain and this kind of SDK like customized SDK can cause a conflict because rocket also made by the SK and actually also made by the SK so you need to figure out what is the conflict and you need to you need to fix the conflict the first way is just rebasing and removing all the conflict and second one is just overriding and debugging all the conflict so actually we we tried a both of way the first one the first reaction we tried it under the block race Chestnut on the Celestia and it only take a it only took one day and second direction we tried it for today's demo and it took three days the first direction is easy and fast and second Direction takes much more time but there's a two there's a big pros and cons the first one is easy and fast that is a big strength but you cannot completely migrate your whole functions on the on the Celestia but second because it's just removing it the second direction is overriding and debugging all the conflict so you can use complete version of your your old protocol on the Celestia so on the right side I we write down all the modules that make a conflict between locate SDK and Crescent SDK on the Black Block race we just remove all the conflict but for today's demo we debug all the function so I can show you the complete version of Crescent on the Celestia so here's the last last step of the our experience so we finished to finish to make a volume as under Celestia so I just want to share about our complete version of Crescent on Celestia so this is the way we choose the second Direction so because we debug all the conflict we can use complete version of the Crescent on the Celestia so not only for the swap but also the order book transaction and the range it pool we can use all our protocol function on the Celestia very very completely so this is the demo that we walk walk through all our protocol function on Celestia and it works very well so this demo video is the two minutes lasting because we are testing all our function function and all our protocol on the Celestia to check it uh working well so all transaction and all Swap all order book all the thing is working well okay can we move to the last slide so I just want to share about our review so without the critical modification so it's really easy to integrate it on the Celestia so that is the big strength and actually Celestia is made by the SDK so it's really easy and convenient to the developer who has experience on the cosmos ecosystem and the last one is roll obtain has a row dependency to the Celestia main chain so it's easy to conveniently operating the chain so here's the here so this is the thing we want to share about the experience with with God and thank you for listening this presentation thank you [Applause]
