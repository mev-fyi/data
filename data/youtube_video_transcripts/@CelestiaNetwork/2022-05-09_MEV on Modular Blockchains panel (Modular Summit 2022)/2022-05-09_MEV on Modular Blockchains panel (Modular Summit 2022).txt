all right hello friends i think we're we're supposed to be four people but we're currently three people so in the middle of the panel it's going to be interrupted by someone rushing to the front and sitting down and joining the conversation we could also view it as uh my alt actually is my alt the proof where it's finally being revealed so this is the panel on mav on modular uh i think we're going to try and split this up very plainly into into three sections or questions that the panelists are going to kind of hopefully run wild with and they're related to sort of uh security on modular then incentives and finally uh winners and losers in the preventative game of mav so before we get started uh maybe we could do some i mean the reason i'm excited uh to sort of host this panel is because actually all three of you wrote the paper on crosstrain maybe right i think not guillermo but yeah you're two out of two two out of three two three so the people who literally are writing the book are sort of present so we can get their perspective but maybe they have more profound sort of personal details that are relevant that they want to introduce themselves very briefly yeah i'm tyrone um founder of gauntlet but also written a lot of papers on uh yeah oh i'm alex researcher at flashbots wrote a paper with tarun as a co-author on cross domain mev and did some research on mev on different fronts um yeah before carlson enemy v i was looking at proof of stake and mev on proof of stake chains on ethereum in particular cool well so what we wanted to do to start the panel even though we're kind of midway through the the the day is um start out with sort of some definitions of modular just so we all use the same uh words when we mean the same thing i mean the same thing when we use the same words i think that'd be helpful and we want to sort of do that in the in the context of security so when i guess the biggest we could start with like the worst case of mav is uh these sort of long range time time-banded attacks that are sort of hopefully prevented by uh some kind of economic security so maybe we could start there with asking like what is the model like what does a modular blockchain do how is it secured what are the assumptions and what does that have to do with the overall stability of the system um i think the best way to think about module modularity is sort of the classical computing analogy of you have many different computers they have different resource access so they have different compute and different sort of state that they're executing and they have some method for communication that method for communication might be some type of message passing system it may end up being some type of deferred computation system uh but effectively they have a way of communicating yet operating somewhat independently while synchronizing anything i miss because i you wrote the definition for domain in that paper so yeah no i think i think that sounds good i i saw there was a talk earlier by mustafa um and i think you were defining what a modular blockchain is in your context um so i don't know there's like multiple definitions floating around and i'm not entirely sure which one we should let's use the simplest one that's well i mean the simplest one is what tyrone mentioned i think it's the the kind of like the architectural one but then in practice i think you have different applications i mean different approaches to uh where you want modularity on your on on your chain and so there's like some approaches that have been stated i think earlier today um yeah then there are other approaches as well i think what tyrone is referring to to some extent is the modularity even in like parallel con computing right where you have like multiple threads to some extent there's like modularity there and how you manage communication between these threads sure i think like if if we had slides and we don't there would be like some kind of diagram and there'd be delay actually the last presentation from the guy from zk snarks had this this photo you know where you have like and there's a transaction and someone executes it and then someone agrees on the order and they're not in the modular architecture they're not necessarily the same people right which of course you could start to envision how there'd be sort of a different as soon as there's communication as soon as there's asynchronous as soon as there's layers and two things that's kind of where mav lives sort of at the intersection of varying security models at these at these layers you could say so talking about security now we have an idea like if we were on bitcoin and hopefully no one's using that anymore you'd have some notion of like how expensive it would be to um you know rewrite the network right and it would get more expensive do those security assumptions hold true in the marginal does the marginal architecture first of all say anything about that is it indifferent to sort of uh proof of work professor whatever or does it does it really imply certain new um security assumptions um i i guess each unit has its own local security assumptions but then there's sort of some synchronization guarantees that are you know uh held between the different units so and and maybe it's because i'm i'm older than the space but i think of everything in terms of like old school parallel compute and you know when you write kind of like multi-threaded code or you write multiprocessing code you oftentimes will have this sort of notion of like independent units that have some amount of minimum shared state and they're only allowed to kind of communicate through that channel and one of them could flood that channel and then halt execution somewhere else because it kind of ddosed the other chain or other process you kind of have the same same issues here where effectively you need to ensure that the communication channel is sort of resistant to some extent to being ddosed that the it's expressive enough that it can actually send all the messages that are needed to be concisely communicating between the two chains or two processes um and uh so you basically have three sort of between in any pair of communication you have three security kind of models you have one for each of the two sides the two processes and then you have one for sort of the synchronization mechanism um and one of the biggest you know if you if you look at something like the wormhole attack uh you know these kind of like mint bugs come from the fact that like the two sides may not agree on the security model for the communication layer and that's usually what's exploited but you could say that in in some ways the offering of a project like celestia or one instance of this modular architecture is to kind of share security so that there are sort of like something that some component that does the data availability and then state machines and executions are kind of separate from that and there's this idea that um maybe if security is cheaper right you could do you could do more things you can push innovation to other layers so in this modular stack you could have one layer that is maybe super secure and but not very useful in general sense and then other stuff that is like much more useful uh and doesn't have to worry uh about security but from uh from an mev perspective you could imagine that at some point someone has to decide on the order and uh and that's the bit that i would imagine you would want to be let's say the most secure yeah so if we actually think a little bit back to linux's development it took almost 10 years for linux to actually have reasonable uh smp which is like its multi-multi-core multi-processing unit so that when you write some piece of code the linux scheduler could decide how to sort of like shard the memory that for each process and allocate the processes cpu manage the page tables all that stuff and the reason it took 10 years it's actually really hard to get this communication part right like and this is without people having economic incentive to ddos your cpu it's actually that scheduling algorithm is actually really hard to write because you need some notion of shared state and common state to all these processes which is where i think something like celestia becomes useful is actually having that initial kind of agreement on on sort of data before you start trying to do these kind of like mutexes lockless queues things like that this is this is completely off topic but interesting to me so i'm going to say it like in uh previously are you familiar with what happened in freebsd and so there was like there used to be this freebsd and then it became dragonfly bsd because they had different models uh or different yeah different models of parallelization that was sort of sufficiently different to sort of warrant the project sort of um working do you think that this is something or these kind of disagreements like is the intellectual space of modular blockchain sophisticated enough that there are sort of like multiple models and how do you think those models will sort of maybe evolve and parallel compete or eventually integrate yeah i mean i think one one important piece of interoperability between all unix-like systems and post-6 like systems is that their file systems are very similar right like they all can you can you can basically install any formatting uh on any of those devices versus like the windows version where like you effectively had to do all this emulation and it took forever for linux to actually be able to read windows formatted devices um but i think the second thing is that uh the memory the memory models while different have some notion of translation uh and you can get some sort of bitwise identical behavior on both sides and that's the key thing right you want bitwise identical execution and bitwise identical sort of storage and agreement on that and and as long as you have that as a standard then you can get a lot further than uh say you know like what ended up happening in windows where like parallel compute never was able to take off and to some extent i would argue that windows missed like i mean there's many reasons microsoft missed the cloud computing world but one of them is this is that it was extremely hard to actually interoperate with these and sort of alex from from your understanding and and research on uh i guess on the ethereum space right which is let's say more diverse it's a pretty big ecosystem many examples of this modulus like split there's many l2s in in ethereum they're already um sort of competing i would say in a way um what's your what what's your sense and like uh like which one is best for me what's it oh and why which one is best for me yeah which one is which party i mean for bain capital for bain capital no but i was going to bring it back to what turin was talking about if we bring it back to like the the space today uh i think tarun is kind of talking about standards to some extent as well for communication for interpretability to some extent i think we kind of need that um for security i think if you have completely different security models i think it's much easier to so take take like let's take two different worlds one where you have like one big blockchain right where if like a homogenous security model where you have like you know security model can be understand holistically understood holistically and then say you have like a patchwork of chains that have different security models different like however you want to define your security model et cetera intuitively it feels like the patchwork of chains is easier to attack because you can attack like smaller units of it grow in strength and then be able to attack more whereas the first one i think is harder to attack maybe upfront but if you find a flaw you can like the whole the whole system can fall i think currently we have these like patchworks of different uh chains and different models even in the modularity approaches there's like different modularity approaches but also in where the security assumptions lie same thing for like the bridges whatever this is all over the place right now and i think it makes it much easier to attack to a sophisticated attacker that wants to like attack the overall system um so what a thing and also for for usefulness of the system if there's some standard that's agreed upon that people can coordinate against it can be a very simple tool but something that people can coordinate with cross domain but there are sort of like concrete examples like i know that polka dot has xcmp cosmos has ibc right uh there's there's a few i agree i agree but i think i think maybe we need that um that's more universal or more general i think ibc is hard to integrate in some uh chains as far as i know as hard as integrating a like client yeah like classic you know non-non-trivial um so maybe that's that's the thing related to mev right the more you modularize the more your stack is complex the more there's like new attack vectors that emerge and the more there's complexity and being able to reason about the economic security of that stack i think that's important in the case of modularity where you use something like celestia as your data availability layer there's also the the security budget you need is kind of dynamic right so the more like domains you add on top that use celestia for data availability maybe you have to think about how that affects the security of that layer so i think it's also dynamic in that sense and to me trying to reason through this the more simple that is and how we reason about the security of these different domains and how we compose the security together the more often we can build like a strong resilient system but what are the sort of like to switch topics now onto sort of incentives like as like a an l2 creator or a rollup like like if you were just launching i don't know sushi swap clone as a as a rollup like beyond the incentives of like the settlement layer being sort of um secure you wrote a little bit about how there is this competition from fees to move between the base layer and uh and this sort of roll up or the application or higher up the stack so how maybe you could elaborate a little bit like how do you see like vowel value accrual sort of evolving with you know potentially deeper stacks you know l3s and and so on and what impact do you think that will have on sort of stability like not just having something secure at one point but sort of long-term security predictable security so maybe two answers and i'll pass it to roon as well one in terms of like value or cool from a perspective of designing the system you want value to be where you need like security right so like value related to security budget um so i think there's like some relation there of like where value could accrue and then the second thing is like owning order flow and owning where the customers are i think to some extent there's like value there because you own the touch point that creates economic activity so these are like two ways to look at it so to some extent the order flow part is like whoever runs the ui that uses interface with because then they can you know redirect your transaction to some other stack very easily but at the same time a stack that isn't secure won't be used for long and so you need that stack to be secured properly whatever that means in terms of value that has to back it how much has to be staked on it how much does it cost to attack it relative to the economic value that's on top of it is there an incentive to attack it because you make more money by the value that you secure on top of it et cetera but there's also cases when uh the protocols are incentivized to sort of like be attacked like in the sense like if you're a dex or whatever and you're trying to bootstrap you're trying to get liquidity like you know you want to pay the liquidity provider as much as possible if someone is sandwiching or more adding more value like people are sandwiching attacking consuming the spread technically that money is going from users to lps right so there is this incentive play where it isn't always clear and probably changed over time like hey here he is [Applause] i was expecting music while i was coming in but clearly that didn't work out what happened yeah well sorry very nice to meet you all right sorry yeah i guess uh this is i'm just a paid actor actually i'm not really uh i'm in stand-in really so it's great anyway sorry no but we were talking about incentives but i think i interrupted uh terred if you wanted to speak sort of about the incentive uh question yeah i mean one very high level view of like sort of the [Music] game theory difference between single chain mev and and multi-chain mvp and obviously it's a stylized simplified version of this is that in uh in a single chain muv is really a congestion game there's just like a fixed number of opportunities there's a bunch of people who are all competing to uh basically capitalize on those opportunities and auctions are can be designed to be like a reasonable way of dealing with congestion in like most economic situations however in the multi-chain world it's actually really becomes like a routing problem right of like how do i go between these different chains and maximize my value and the routing problem is actually a much larger sort of state space of like possible ways that things can go wrong which means you need to coordinate the incentives along the whole chain so like let's suppose i have a sandwich attack that's a sequence of sandwich attacks across bridges that on each side use an amm well then i actually need to make sure all the lp to your point earlier i need to make sure that all the lps kind of end up having like similar incentives but there's not really a great way of guaranteeing that in in a sort of multi-chain world right you you actually would have to synchronize those constantly across all of these or just take the risk like or be atomic and then you say oh i assume that i'm using flash bots that i'd zero risk but if you're like again being capital or someone with serious money or like a market maker oh sorry you're here i forgot you'll just you'll just execute the trade your short-term prediction model will say whatever is going to happen and you'll do it and you're going to be right you know enough times to to be bank capital you know so so here's a fun little alpha leak actually um so it here you have a model of uh that's probabilistic yeah turns out that problem is convex too so actually you can you can solve it um but anyway sorry i didn't mean to detract uh shouldn't maybe that's too much of an alpha leak um but but i i guess the point is like you have to coordinate these incentives a lot more right and and right now we don't have you know the fact that like flashbots can be isolated from the incentives that are people using to bootstrap pools is is not really possible when you when you think about it in terms of modularity so is that to somehow suggest that smaller players are going to have a harder time in this fragmented liquidity world absolutely yeah you need more capital to be able to do this right yeah it's kind of it's kind of rough because i was talking with uh with zachary about this and like it's like oh when you have like a million fmo space chains or whatever maybe not a million like let's say a thousand and we're trying to ask this question like oh should like will it actually be possible to do this kind of things i was like do you think like jump capital would have any problem putting a million dollars in a thousand place i don't think so i think that most market makers are big enough to like make the spread to take the inventory risk and sit there and get like the juiciest part when it arrives so if someone is writing this complicated model and like even if they are like say everything is connected over ibc and you actually can there is sort of some kind of secure transmission between these things like it's not like an exchange where they can like stop withdrawals or something it's like an automated permissionless interrupt thing even if the people who are trying to move liquidity around are always going to have a harder time than someone who just keeps liquidity everywhere i mean i guess this gets to alex's point about like who owns the order flow owns a lot more than what you than you think and the question is in this multi-chain world will the order flow actually be owned by an aggregator or will it be multiple kind of like separate front ends that end up fragmenting the order and then right now it looks like the ladder right no one's actually built a very good cross-chain aggregator and part of the reason is that the front ends don't want to take the inventory risk uh right like the market makers do but the market makers also don't make products so they're not like getting user flow but it could be just because it's just not worth it yet like the markets might be too or i don't know there's some bridges that are backed by market makers right wormhole being you know notable for sure for sure for sure i mean we we get a sense of the size of their ambition that by the fact that there was a hack and the next day they you know paid 350 million back to the bridge but they also raised that again right after let's not let's not forget that it did get covered in this fundraiser i think the overflow cross chain uh is at the bridge level in my opinion i i think when jump started wormhole there was kind of this sense uh amongst people that like this was their version of like the microwave tower and like you want to win the new york chicago microwave tower there's a really horrible movie that if you want to watch on the history of this called the hummingbird project worst acting i've ever seen because it's a movie about like hft so it's like can't be good acting uh but but like honestly jesse eisenberg isn't that yeah yes exactly and still a horrible movie but i liked it but but it is factually accurate that like the bridges the effective war we see with the bridges now in the normal world converge to one thing but here it actually seems like it's not going to be true right like it really does feel like there's going to be quality of service versus bridge security trade-offs and you're going to have like the spectrum of that and then people are going to allocate to that and that that'll have a totally different microstructure than normal markets um yes i i think that makes a lot of sense but even in a permissionless system like some people use bridges but not everyone needs to and i guess the question is when is it eventually gonna or will it will it happen that the bridges will sort of like if you wanted atomicity across a bridge you just have to be two like if you're if you're validating on like who's to say that you can't operate on both on multiple networks simultaneously but as like an infrastructure provider i guess like i'll talk from like the cosmos case because that's what i'm most familiar with a lot of validators operate on multiple networks there's no reason if the blocks are like uh the leader election the person proposes block is predictable if you could predict the time on both networks right then you could actually do a risk-free cross-chain thing and go around the whole bridge dilemma um so how do we think about the sort of the incentives for not just jump but but even hopefully smaller valid or smaller operations to start doing multi-chain operations to sort of benefit from multiple or simultaneous order flow one one thing there uh that's part of the paper across the main mev paper right so we talk about that to happen but then we talk about the fact that if um say you're a leader on chain a i mean i'm a leader on chain a you're a leader on chain b and you want to collude or collaborate however you want to frame it yeah uh in order to get that like economic atomicity across ourselves we don't trust each other so we need a way to trust each other we also need a way to communicate right i think you can model all of that as some like additional economic cost that a player that is the leader on a and b at the same time doesn't have so i think you can maybe point to an incentive for someone to control both of these like validator sets for example um and that's what's problematic because maybe the the the pursuit for you know alpha is such that the system equilibrium doesn't go towards many smaller validator sets that actually have a way to collude with one another trustlessly at minimal overhead but rather a very large player that starts owning more and more of the validator sets on many sides so that they get these leader election slots and they can reduce the overhead of communication there's still some communication but it's internal communication and you don't have that trust cost as well because you can trust your internal systems to work to some extent um and so you can lower the cost to do some interactions and you can maybe even seize pockets of opportunities that for us who don't trust each other the cost of coordinating for that opportunity would be too too high well you could put an action between it right i think that's what you're sort of alluding to yeah i just think like the the the lack of adamus administry actually changes the outcomes of these auctions right so so you sort of have to like have an auction where you coordinate like the like let's just even in the simplest case of like i have two first price auctions of like on on both sides and i go across the bridge i actually have to coordinate that the reserve price and the floor price and stuff like that the initial setup is the same across both places uh and there is a cost to that like if eventually you still have to pay some amount of money to to synchronize those things but that might go that might go to zero over time though ideally it does i think i i think we wanted to or at least not zero but i like i think zk stuff will be the only way to get to the point that that cost gets arbitrarily small in the long run because what because it lowers the communication complexity yeah exactly but you would still have like a back and forth to some extent right you know the question is like i only have to send you one packet and you can verify that like it's correct at the same time that it's like i did the computation correctly on the other side so i don't have to like do any interaction so okay in that sense that's good question for you both right what if say we go back to that same example right and we send each other the packets but now we need to split the profits how do we split the profits i mean that you can have a contract on both sides right the profit you store the final profit on one side right right it's always on one side it can be on both sides that's that's doing that you could also do like i mean the question i don't know if the question you're getting at is like how much profit do you split yes this is like the key telling how do you say the optimal profit split yeah yeah so this is actually a well-studied problem in uh okay in game theory which is called the the cake cutting problem the pie cutting problem depends on who you ask and what your aesthetics are so uh it you could actually there is like a weird set of equilibria that you can talk about here um and often they're actually quite stable too so um it is surprising depending on who the first person is who's like taking some of the risks okay but but and how do we think about like adversarial things we're like say we're splitting and like we agree on 50 50. but maybe uh there's someone else who's willing to do 60 40 or or maybe over time if you like in an iterated game instead of this particular opportunity it starts making more sense for me to own more of the network rather than split with him right because then it's like a hundred zero instead of 50 50. i mean this is why proof-of-stake networks that have uh that draw the entire valder set over an epoch before the epoch where you know know the blocks like are just you can't avoid this problem right because you already see this in solana and avalanche right where like people are basically just paying validators ahead of their block number and co-locating like for liquidation yeah i mean even decks are people are just basically paying do we need to avoid like any kind of uh leader election that's in the future do we need like proof of work like leader election yeah yeah that's the zk thing right the single secret leader election kind of type of stuff is is only enabled by like homomorphic encryption and zk stuff so i think this cost goes down with cryptography gets better it's not it's not a purely economic did you use the like algorand leader election model that's like vrf based or something with the committee i mean you still the there's still these like poison committee attacks that are known you also often grind too so sorry to cut you guys off do you guys want to take one question from the crowd before we uh get off super interesting conversation i just want to open it up a little bit to uh if anyone's been waiting has a question i don't know how this works i just point to the person and then mike goes yep yeah yeah guys we have lunch one um so this will probably be one of the last questions where was the person there there you go this is a question for alex about uh flashbots architecture and how you see it changing in context of multi-layers and modular blockchains so like flashbots right now and the way it's designed is very practically helping democratize mev on ethereum with like enabling many searchers to participate and minors um but in context of like what you guys were talking about with like you know people with the most capital being able to get mev on like cross chain world and multi-layers and modular blockchains how is flashbots intending to like change its architecture to help further democratize mev and um yeah in context of like obviously you guys are also trying to like become censorship resistant and decentralized so you seem to have a lot of like competing priorities but i think this is like a big one coming up so curious to know yeah uh great question um we think a lot about there is that i mentioned earlier this like centralization of validator sets across many domains and how this kind of world can be attacked we also see it as like it's inevitable that the world at least for the next few years is going to be like multi-chain or whatever even if you focus only on ethereum you have many layer twos that have raised like hundreds of millions are going to be able to subsidize activity for a while even if it's artificial and so we need to prepare for that asynchronous world and what that means there i don't know if looking at it as simply as like oh players need more capital to participate makes sense because even today on ethereum you know there are flash loans but if you use flashballs today flash loans are not gas efficient compared to having the capital directly so a lot of players need the capital to be able to execute a lot of opportunities but does that change massively in the cross domain world i think what changes is maybe like the inventory management logic that you need to have and also there may be economies of scale that if you have more capital you can warehouse risk a lot better and so you can maybe take more opportunities or take more risks so we think a lot about that we think a lot about like this dystopian future of like very centralized blockchain world in general where you have like a few validators that run validators on like 100 different chains and you know run bridges where they provide liquidity to users uh that's like the worst thing for us and we need to adapt right for what i just mentioned now we're going to announce more on this relatively soon uh so you'll have like extra details there but we're we're worried about the same thing that we were worried about when we started flashballs a year and a half ago which is we want to keep the system decentralized we want to keep it transparent as much as possible because the more you have opacity the more it's difficult to understand what happens within it yeah what else do we want to keep it we want to keep it like accessible to to most individuals um yeah i guess i'll add one one point on uh the fairness aspect which is that even though these bridges that have synthetic assets tend to be the ones that get exploited first uh synthetic assets and like staking derivatives especially in proof-of-stake networks do actually lower the cost of capital for the actual validator because validators basically smaller validators can lever up around opportunities that they want to kind of subsidize and so one real question is going to be how do we balance this uh centralization effect versus like should we allow like more kind of derivative assets across bridges and that's obviously going to be this big security question because you know wormhole is the greatest example of like what happens when the staking derivative blows up uh but you know it is clear that that actually does lower uh validator centralization so um yeah long run in the long run that there's going to always be this kind of trade-off between like how much we want derivatives for uh equalizing access versus why why does it lower the cost yeah so like let's say i'm a small validator and i have like one percent of stake i can borrow against my stake and basically at least for a short amount of time get to say like 3x leverage on my existing stake and now i can go restake that get three percent increase my number of blocks and try to basically but surely surely if you own 50 you can borrow 3x leverage as well right no you're you're actually if you how do you borrow three times oh you said there's no liquidity for it there's no could do so so the the there's this kind of liquidity versus security trade-off that naturally comes up and secret derivatives um so it's always going to end up being this war between like how much do we want these kind of very hard to price derivatives that can blow up versus how much do we actually want centralization cool i think that's a great place to end it thank you very much panel [Applause]
