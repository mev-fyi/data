welcome to Sovereign radio our short form podcast series created for the modular Summit I'm here with Ismail welcome Hey thank you uh I'm is my coffee co-founder and CTO of celestial labs and uh yeah I've been working on that project for almost four years now so we're here in Paris I am curious to hear how has your experience been so far this week um the week has been rather quiet for me in the sense that I did not attend many other events and I only met with the team and um with a few people otherwise I was I was preparing slides and getting them working we are getting ready for this and also getting ready for launch yeah so we're recording this on the first day of the modular Summit it is just started but I am curious what are your impressions of it so far it's amazing I mean the venue is amazing the organization is amazing we have a bunch of really interesting speakers like when I looked at the agenda I was like oh I really want to listen to all of these talks nice like usually I just like ah I want to listen to like a few talks but this time is like the agenda is really packed with interesting things yeah actually I mean the CK validator one of my companies we're actually organizing the ZK track today so I'll obviously I'll be there I'm excited for that um okay I think it would be great for us to start talking a little bit about Celestia uh Celestia is one of the teams that actually co-produced the modular Summit and The Sovereign radio um and but I mean more more primarily it's a blockchain project tell us a little bit about what it is uh Celestia at its core is um the most minimalistic player wanted you can imagine but um it decouples so it's a general purpose chain that decouples execution from consensus and data availability so the core idea is that applications decentralized applications only post their data onto Celestia so they it gets ordered and it gets we guarantee that the data is published to the network and other than that Celestia doesn't do anything else yeah and like all the applications the business logic um run on roll ups or on a layer above their Celestial so you just mentioned Roll-Ups and I think a lot of our viewers are probably familiar with rollups but I think they're Familiar of like they know the infrastructure in ethereum context so what's different here um it's very similar the main difference to ethereum is that we do not have an enshrined settlement layer um what does that mean um a settlement layer is a specific execution layer that can be used for bridging between Roll-Ups like the assets yeah you mean like the actual tokens yes okay so you don't have like there will be never like a roll-up that will like send a token to Celestia and then it will be sent like the tokens don't live on Celestia I mean I wouldn't say never but like the current configuration the current um way we're launching it there's no general purpose execution environment on Celestia so there's currently no way to bridge in and out from and to Celestia directly right like um it will be used to will be possible through third parties like chains via IBC um could could you could swap out the tier token to a different chain and then to a roll up and roll ups can talk to each other as well but like there's no direct way Mustafa actually proposed a very interesting way to do bridging from and to Celestia without enshrining a settlement layer which uses ZK snarks interesting yeah yeah very good it could be a own episode but wait I want to understand this so like the execution layer is um where you'd also like deploy applications and things like this so you're saying like Celestia won't have that there's no applications directly directly or like there's no generalized applications what can like at the same time I'm assuming developers will interact with it somehow so what are they doing with the base chain um are they just deploying roll-ups I mean let's put aside like all the projo stake logic and what developers will care most about is basically one transaction type which is pay for blobs so they submit when when a roll up or like some other layer submits data to Celestia they do so via um triggering a transaction type which is called pay for blob and that's about it and they also run a light node so it does they do data availability sampling we should actually maybe make a distinction here so when I the question I actually had was more like the roll-up developers so like the like a roll-up developer how do they even like create a roll-up to lock into Celestia especially going back to those original ideas of Roll-Ups like Roll-Ups are a collection of smart contracts often so if you can't deploy that what are you deploying on Celestia um so on Celestia directly you do not deploy anything it's more that there will be infrastructure on top which allows developers to easily deploy Roll-Ups which could also be smart contracts like in the ethereum case but um they're very specific maybe yeah they could be like very different ways to um and we're already seeing this there's there's different service providers where you can like have one-click Solutions you write your program for instance in solidity and then you deploy and in the background what what's happening you use the shared sequencer or you spin up your own sequencer or you directly post data like as a base roll up you directly post data to Celestia um okay so it's like different ways to interact and it's it's very nuanced in my opinion but like it's very um if if developers are given the choices directly they will have to choose from very different set of configurations and trade-offs but um luckily there are companies these and projects working on simplifying this so such that developers can very easily interact with Celestia by abstracting it away essentially I think I'm realizing that I've been sort of thinking about Roll-Ups on Celestia wrong maybe so the way I always think about them obviously having looked mostly at the ethereum case is that like to deploy a roll-up you're you know you're talking about months and months of work and maybe less now because the libraries were built but originally it was like you had to build these things from scratch you have to like you know kind of build a space for other users and other developers to be able to use your execution environment and then you'd create that connection point and then you deploy it but what you're what you just said makes me think like actually the the DAP producer like the DAP developer the one who's just creating an application that users could use is creating a very fast roll-up that then hosts its single app yes okay this is it's like I've heard sort of talk of that but I hadn't realized that that is actually what you're imagining so when you think of Roll-Ups you're not thinking of like a single L1 with like maybe four Roll-Ups that then have execution environments you're thinking of like like hundreds or maybe more little application Roll-Ups exactly I mean so there's oh right like there's these Roll-Ups like like optimism there's like um there's currently deployed uh op stack on top of Rocket which puts data to to sliced directly uh so there you can deploy smart contracts but there will also be application specific Roll-Ups and yeah I mean the the vision that I think we will see play out more and more in the future is more these application specific Roll-Ups that's so interesting but I mean kind of going back to that idea like the data availability layer the the sort of thing that Celestia is doing does do those roll ups need to also connect to any other chain to be able to exist in space if you know what I mean like did they I mean right now it sounds like you could create an application it will live on that roll up but I don't how does it like touch anything else um I mean uh again there will be different ways right like there will be Sovereign Roll-Ups which will be their own um um chain essentially that directly posts data to Celestia you can imagine like uh uh a cosmos SDK up built uh with uh on top of roll kit and then you have your own chain but there also will be as I said there will be obviously like settlement hubs also Roll-Ups on top of Celestia that uh will fulfill the function that the settlement layer has on ethereum as well such that um applications that are using that settlement layer can Bridge directly right like they can touch or interact with other roll apps in in its own kind of ecosystem very like seamlessly and interoperate very seamlessly The Sovereign Roll-Ups will um if they're using a committee can use IBC if they're not they will have to use like some some multi-sig or like some other provider um there's a bunch of bridging providers that are currently working on how to bridge between this heterogeneous set of uh Roll-Ups it's almost like so in the ethereum case you see so much of like evm and then evm compatible like AVM Roll-Ups but here it's like you've taken the different pieces of that underline uh blockchain and then sort of sliced it and so Celestia is the da but then you'll have another one that's settlement and I don't know is there anything else that you would need um yeah I mean you can have you can have general purpose execution environments on top to have people deployed as my contracts as they used to um but yeah I mean and on that you could again have a different layer right you can probably set on the contract uh for for for a layer on top as well but I think what we will see is rather Celestia several settlement hubs and then a lot of application specific Roll-Ups and these these settlement hubs will kind of have their own ecosystems as well it's like um as you describe this I can't help but remember like or think about the cosmos sort of model as well which is like there is no Central kind of point of truth there's like lots of blockchains that are connected through IBC here you'd have you're sort of slicing the blockchain differently so it's like there's different groups that will have parts of proof of what's Happening and do you actually imagine something like a DA layer an execution layer a settlement layer being sort of connected would you almost have like a group which tends to work together or do you imagine these groups like independently working with very different partners like almost branchy I don't know I don't know if I'm doing a good image there but I think I think there will be like clusters of chains um interacting like with with each other essentially so I mean um there will also be like the other ecosystems obviously will continue to exist as well right like so there will be a large a larger blockchain ecosystem where roll ups talk to each other and um other ecosystems that are not using Celestia also talk with Celestia or Celestia Roll-Ups cool can you tell me a little bit about those other projects like are there I mean are these like like if someone's using role kit creating a settlement layer as their thing is this a partner are you doing this also in-house or would you like yeah I'm just kind of curious like is Celestia purely focused on the D.A and or does it does it help with the other stuff um because it's a very like distinct Vision that I just need to kind of champion a little bit yeah when we started there was no there was no um roll-up framework whatsoever right like so we had to build one at least or start one in-house today there's many options there's like Sovereign SDK there's opstack but when we started it there was nothing so um we started building um roll kit what is called roll kit today um back then was called optiment because basically basically what it is it takes um all the abstractions that tenement provides but it strips away the consensus so it's like a ABCI app uh you can build ABC I apps as you're used to with the cosmos SDK or if you're familiar with ABCI you can like continue using exactly the same Paradigm but under the hood it uses Celestia for data availability so that we built in-house um we recently like it has it it's on purpose that it has its own branding and its own GitHub organization because we want to be as neutral as possible and eventually this might be spun out and um built by a different different uh project or team let's talk about data availability and why like you kind of mentioned you strip out consensus so it's also doing consensus like for the blockchain for the whole kind of Celestia yeah Celestia yeah but like why what's the connection then of consensus and datability data availability I've actually been a little bit confused about that because I'm like why don't you just say consensus then yeah well is it only like a flavor of consensus that you're doing I mean you could argue that like any layer one provides State availability right like exactly automatically built in but um what we mean by data availability layer is you somehow guarantee that the data was published right how it usually works in other chains is like full nodes download the data and ensure that it is published by doing this and then in Celestia's case there's like this technique called Erasure coding employed um which makes it possible that nodes can sample like small chunks and with that ensure that the whole block has been published such that like these roll ups these application specific rollups can only download the portion of the data that they care about so they don't have to download the whole block as it's like usually if if you if you um if you verify layer one you have to very like they have to don't have all of it exactly are these like lines would you call what these modes are sort of like client-like except that they do the sampling yeah I mean they are classical uh tenement lifelines essentially that are augmented by the functionality of doing like they additionally do data availability sampling and with that gain like probabilistic almost 100 certainty that the whole block has been published you mentioned earlier this like the at the developer creating the rule like the role of would like put a blob is that what you called it so is that sort of the equivalent of what the evm sort of the ZK Roll-Ups on on like a on the ethereum case are like posting to chain just whatever that is or is it different I mean there's also two I think like two roughly um without going into detail but like roughly two configurations how ZK roll up circuit is this validium method that only posts uh the the um um like proofs onto ethereum and the data to a data availability committee or to some like to some data layer yeah um so Celestia is more like the data availability committee but as a proof of stake chain huh but do you imagine like with roll kit are you like are the types of Roll-Ups being created ZK Roll-Ups they could be I think um where then does the proofs go then would you need a separate environment to post the proofs if there were ZK roll-ups um if there were ZK Roll-Ups and you um yeah you would need and it was the not what it was we're saying not the validium type but the the other type of roll-up yeah I mean again it kind of depends because like if if the ZK Roll-Ups use a settlement layer that would post their proofs on the settlement layer if they're not the the proofs could also be like dispersed on the peer-to-peer layer or amongst full nodes like amongst light lines as well so it like kind of depends again okay when you mention that I want to go back to the like client topic so who runs the is it the Roll-Ups themselves is there like a like line on the roll up or is there a light client on the Celestia side um for the roll up for the roll up yeah and it's only on the rollout yeah Celestia does not run the uh roll-up light claimed got it um Celestia just runs like the consensus and it's the roll up sequencers or the roll-up infrastructure to ensure that the data has been posted to Celestia they run a Celestia Lite client essentially that's doing sampling exactly it's doing something and also um you you verify the commitment to the data on Celeste that's why you need the header as well and the data availability header the way we Implement rocket is also more General like we we're not implementing it that it can only be used on with Celestia it's also general purpose I think the rocket team not too long ago was the first uh team that used Bitcoin as as uh uh for data availability essentially so how they do that though um the very basic idea is there was an upgrade to bitcoin that made it cheaper to post data directly to bitcoin okay and then instead of using Celestia as a data availability layer they use Bitcoin as a data availability player using roll kit and post uh the blocks directly to to bitcoin without sampling but like you have to download the whole block and everything like it doesn't have all the benefits but still is more general purpose and uh yeah that's cool I actually want to ask you about that because like working right now in the space like you're creating open source software role kit you're just I mean the example you just gave is not even for a Celestia case but how do you approach that like are you trying to also just like create a little bit more of like the vision you have to create the tools to be able to work with your system but those tools could also be work could be used with other systems and you're cool with that yeah absolutely yeah yeah absolutely I think I think it's important that like I mean it's not called uh modularism maximalism as a meme or it's what we believe in and I think um yeah we need these interest like this infrastructure is necessary anyways and if other teams use it um or Fork it and modify it that's I think it will benefit everyone anyways nice I know that um your background had been a bit more in Cosmos and you sort of like hinted at IBC stuff everything we've described I think still lives primarily within like the celestial world but how are you seeing bridging or any sort of connection point to other networks I think initially you will mostly uh for the Celestia ecosystem we mostly see like more like axelr XLR like uh systems or like multi-six bridging between Roll-Ups just because there it's there it's like we'll be immediately available um and you did say when you said the execution layer as potentially a roll-up would that would you have a roll-up that acts as like the swap spot or something it could be yeah you could have like a DEX roll up yes or a bridge roll up yeah yeah so it could be um it wouldn't make sense to mix this with like a settlement Hub right like you haven't you have a market maker you have a decks and a settlement Hub I see so those are two different things the settlement Hub is just to like take note of what is out there yeah and then the but you do some sort of like Bridge roll up yeah but then you also mentioned like axelr like they have their own validator set do each of these Roll-Ups like are they supposed to have validator sets too the Roll-Ups they don't have to they could um it doesn't make sense for them to have like a huge validator set um with with doing its own consensus because you can you can use the Celestia one right but they could um I think the Roll-Ups most likely will be like a committee that is um but it is not trusted necessarily right like it could be uh trust minimized in the sense that that committee is not relied on for State validity do you notice that all these like there's all these ecosystems that seem to be conversion converging and I love it like as you describe this I think about the cosmos hubs move for like shared security I mean or ethereum and Roll-Ups but it's that idea that you start to like share the validator set at the bottom like in the center and that security that it can Garner is then used by these other like things applications or do you see it as quite different and if I said let's say it's quite different right like the validator set of Celestia does not need to have overlap with like the sequencers or validators of Roll-Ups right yeah um it's different than interchange security with this regard like what what like interchange security guarantees is more similar to what polkadot does in some sense because it like basically the validator set of the main chain is shared across other channels actually validating it yourself also the state like it has to execute the transactions right okay and that's quite different than Celestia because like here you just get the guarantee data has been uh ordered and published right like that's quite different and he guarantee that the execution is actually valid happens on the layer above again so then would you also say then like ethereum Cosmos Hub and polka dot are all sort of because they're all validating execution like they're validating those three things that we had talked about settlement well yeah right yeah I think I mean in ethereum it's more um it is a bit more lightweight in the sense that it can be used as a settlement layer and then the settlement layer only validates the proofs or certain like disputes it doesn't have to um it doesn't have to be the case that the validator the ethereum validator set has to validate actively the whole chain of uh the roll ups on top of ethereum which is the case in interchange security and somewhat the case in polkadot where it's only a subset right like they get like randomly randomly chosen to validate the power chain I want to talk a little bit about the Celestia validator world because I'm going to say it's physically validators the validator is going to be as validated on Celestia awesome um but yeah tell me a little bit about what that's like to put together I don't know how much you were part of that I know often there's like a team that's dedicated but yeah tell me a bit about bringing together that Community Who are the validators um to like bootstrap that Community we launch a lot of test Nets right like we're early from devnet the very I think it's like almost two years ago already the first um uh the first test Tesla devnet which we opened to the public um that was that started basically that early community and then I think what um what will direct the mainnet validator set will be the last one which is the incentivized testnet called block Space Race um so basically the winners of the block Space Race will be um the validators in the in the Genesis files which is the one that just happened yes um and then I mean it's it's it's a public network so it's unclear how it will develop um but that's the initial set cool cool okay I think we should kind of continue on that sort of thread of the road map and like what's coming so we've talked a bit about validators but there's probably so much more like what is it to launch Celestia what like what is the launch process because you're getting close yeah we're getting pretty close will it be 2023 yes okay I hope so okay I'm pretty sure we're doing this in July so you still have quite a few months but yeah yeah okay so tell me yeah what's what's ahead or what's like short term ahead what are the next steps you have the validator set somewhat defined what do you still need to do I mean there's still bug fixes like what we doing with the um so as this like separation of uh the consensus and that they tell the network as well right like that's also uh two teams working and um their software is also um two different repositories and one team is doing uh an internal audit as well as like an external audit so there's like bugs bubbling up and need to be fixed and um the node software itself um we're not doing an external audit but we're finishing because this has not been done before like there's no other project doing data availability assembling we're gonna launch like a minimal viable version of that basically right um it will have the availability something working block sync and bad encoding fraud proofs and block reconstruction so that is like we're basically finishing the last five percent of that wow um once that's ready um we're gonna launch basically okay yeah is this the first time you've launched a blockchain uh no I've been part of the team that launched the cosmos Hub cool and that was a I mean that was that was one of the first it wasn't the first but I know it was one of the first proof of stake networks and it was also one of the first to do and maybe it was the first to do the incentivized testnet model yes I think Zaki introduced that was called game of zones and then right um yeah it's very very uh it makes a lot of sense for me to to do like incentivized testnets and I think like what's been copied now in the whole Space so you do have some sense of what to expect yes in terms of like how things roll out yes but yeah tell me a little like are you still I um uh I would like to say because I was off uh it's all like I'm very calm and it's just exciting because it's like the thing is it has not been done before in that way right like I'm very confident and familiar with um um um the like the consensus layer because like it's it's just another tenement chain right but the whole um data layer and all the roll apps on top of it it's not been done before so it's of course it's very exciting but like yeah how do you launch them actually now that you mention it like so you start with just the L1 yes that and part you're not worried about no because I don't just be like yeah but it won't be connected to anything like there's no risk it's just sort of like doing it it'll but you have like empty blocks then yeah I mean um initially probably there will be activity in the sense that people will experiment with pay for blobs and also uh the whole proof of stake logic also will generate transactions and stuff okay and then what's next so then you you tap a few I think it's more like us that will do like the the ecosystem and the community will launch the the projects on top right like it's it's like only ethereum more or less where ethereum was launched and then people started writing smart contracts and deploying on top of your theme so it's more like that than us launching chains on top directly but do you have any Partners or any like groups that you already work with that you think like you know they're already building these things and they're sort of maybe I imagine you put out a little bit of a call for like we might need a settlement layer we might need these other things like yeah do you know any of those teams can you share who they are yeah I mean there's there's actually a lot already going on for a pre-launch project I'm quite a I'm quite like um it's quite amazing to see what like last module assembled it was everything was like still very early and there was like very few teams actually working uh on on very base layer infrastructure now nowadays actually applications and and there's like a few games there is a team that's building uh uh basically op stack and there's a team on top of that as like make it possible to deploy your roll up via one click solution um there's teams um like a bear chain that is launching uh um like an evm settlement layer and there's also Dimension that has the same so it's like the there's more and more like infrastructure but also applications like games and and uh D5 and and so on so forth I actually want to talk to you about that like the infrastructure period we're still in it this is infrastructure um we've spent the last five years at least working on this do you think we have a it's out of state and I'm not only talking about Celeste here I'm actually talking about like generally where the shift in like there may there maybe should be a shift in focus more towards those applications that users need I think yeah very leading question I just gave you I think I think we are not fully there yet to be honest I think there's still need for further infrastructure especially in like the Celestia case there still needs to be a few layers being built until application developers will have a very good time building and will will like the goal is that application developers can deploy their roll up or their own application chains like easier as it is today to deploy like a smart contract essentially right like that's that would be ideal and I think we we will get there but it will take a little bit of time okay again and then um I think yes I completely agree there should be a shift to um end user applications and end user usability and I think um before that though you need to to wrap up that infrastructure we need to focus on like uh developer usability as well before that right and then and then um in parallel or at the end like we we need to focus a lot more on on end user usability as well because it's still too difficult to use any of the stack in my opinion I have as you're describing this I'm wondering each of the Roll-Ups like in terms of language that a developer could use do you have to use a certain language within a roller could it be like so could you like what I feel like you can't put any language in there you can just write JavaScript you could I mean um is there like issues with that like you need a certain kind of language yeah you need um so it's it's less about the language but about the execution environment right like you need um if someone provides a VM that's uh supports like a subset of JavaScript or like this agoric for instance right like uh yeah exactly and I think this hardened JS you could um deploy that as a as a roll-up on top of Celestia and then people could deploy their smart contracts in JavaScript as well so it's like it's it's not really the language as long as you have a VM or like a framework like the cosmos SDK or something that can interact uh where you can have like a framework where you can build your application essentially very cool well I want to say thank you so much for this wonderful interview thank you uh for being uh for having me again and it's an honor that you're doing the modular radio yeah it's awesome thank you so yeah and thanks for watching thanks
