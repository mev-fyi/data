that's an interesting presentation as the founder of a Roll-Ups and Service Company to go afterwards uh also um if anyone saw that slide I am not the co-inventor of ZK sync just just to uh keep that clear um yeah I want to talk about uh Caldera our involvement with Celestia um how we're unleashing Roll-Ups with da networks and also just want to talk about some of the motivation behind application specific Roll-Ups why you might want to build them why we are personally still bullish on Ras and why we think it might make sense for some applications um so I'm just going to take you through a journey of some more thinking around this and then talk through our involvement with Celestia and our recent developments there um so yeah first of all Matt founder of Caldera caldera.xyz come check us out um we are the easiest way to launch a dedicated roll-up for your application project or ecosystem we're also the first as far as I know Rob's a service company uh to go multi-stack and so we you know really emphasize developer choice we support uh optimism op stack chains we also support arbitrum orbit chains with many more coming in the pipeline soon we also focus on being an infrastructure layer for modular chains so we know how hard it is for people to launch viable blockchains and that doesn't stop at just the sequencer so we aim to provide all sorts of different infrastructure and we're also a white glove service we are a Ras very nebulous uh definition um but we are one of a few companies that is defined that way um oh it looks like our emojis didn't didn't render that's all right imagine beautiful emojis there chosen by Chachi PT as well we do reliable sequencer hosting that's a huge component of it of course um you know having reliable rpcs making sure that sequencer doesn't go down uh making sure that archival data is available to users that's a major unlock and that's one of the more annoying things about you know for folks who are trying to launch their own roll up we also do all sorts of additional infra as I mentioned like block explorers rpcs interfaces for bridging like we've actually found that is in some sense like a lot of the value add that we provide um you know teams there are some teams that are able to get started with the roll-up sequencer but they still lean on us on all that additional infrastructure and value-added services that we provide as a cloud provider and as well dedicated support we found you know we are probably the top of funnel for most teams that are thinking about application specific chains or ecosystem specific chains and so we know best uh what people want what people need and and the problems that people are thinking through as they're you know making these decisions and so oftentimes when we're working with teams we're working with them as a thought partner as they think through these major decisions um so yeah I first wanted to motivate just why build with an app roll up and I want to start from the very beginning um in the beginning there is ethereum and ethereum was good but ethereum is also slow um whenever I talk about the speed of ethereum I always include this photo of the Altera 8800 I personally am too young to have ever actually used one but this is a personal computer from the mid-1970s and the thing about this computer it's probably the closest in terms of instructions per second it's the closest comparison comparable to ethereum mainnet so both this Altera 8800 and ethereum mainnet can process about 0.2 million instructions per second in total across their virtual machines now unlike the Altera 8800 which is a personal computer basically single threaded only running you know a single application at any time ethereum is probably the worst Cloud multi-tenant infrastructure ever where you have hundreds of thousands of applications that are all competing for scarce computational resources on top of them and so that leads to high fees this graph was a little bit cherry-picked you might notice it stops in 2021 but uh for those who are around there probably most of you you remember when fees really spiked and like as demand gets higher fees get super high and the most interesting applications get priced out of chains like ethereum um and another thing is ethereum is ossified or ethereum is in the process of ossifying ethereum as this like Global base layer computer for you know the world's new Financial system like ethereum cannot move fast and break things ethereum needs to be ultra-conservative and for anyone who has done anything in the EIP process you know this to be the case um it's basically impossible to make changes to ethereum and and especially breaking changes are impossible and this is like generally a very very good thing um for ethereum but if you're building certain types of applications you might want to make changes and that might motivate you to build your own chain as well this uh is true of most l2s that are being built on ethereum right now so if you've talked with anyone from these general purpose L2 chains whether it's optimism arbitrum or any of the ZK teams the Holy Grail is ethereum equivalence basically saying like we want our rollups to behave from a VM perspective in the same way ethereum does and that makes sense for them as well because they're motivated to produce chains that are effectively successors to ethereum's general purpose Mission um but that might not be what you want if you're building an application with specific requirements and so even if general purpose l2s are solving the first you know two problems of speed and cost they're still relatively ossified you know they're going to wait for ethereum to make changes to the VM before they make major breaking changes as well um and so that leads to why you want what you might want to launch a dedicated chain again Emoji not rendering but you have dedicated TPS you have a dedicated Lane to scale and that TPS is all yours again going back to that multi-tenancy point you're not having resource contention between uh all of you know a bunch of applications all in one chain you have either just the applications of your ecosystem or your own application on that chain you also have ultra low fees you can explore the trade-off space um where you settle where you post da Etc um to get the best fees for your application I mean in the last presentation there's a lot of calculation around fees that calculation is legitimate but all of those variables are configurable and so when you're building a dedicated chain you get to choose what the inputs are to that function and then find you know the outputs that make sense for you lastly there's latency I think latency is a really really underappreciated aspect when you're building web 3 applications I spent some time in the gaming industry when you're in the gaming industry if your application has like over 100 milliseconds of latency people like go into your DMs and your email like telling you to kill yourself blockchain that's not the case um you know you have relatively High block times users are used to that but if you're building on-chain social or you're building on-chain gaming like you might actually really want ultra low latency and being able to choose where you sit on that sequencer decentralization Spectrum might be really helpful for that uh also there's customization of the first order there's pre-compiles right A lot of these pre-compiles might be very useful they've also languished for quite some time um us specifically we worked with a team who was waiting for years on the BLS curve operations pre-compiled to get merged you can find their CTO has comments on that uh that EIP back from like four or five years ago they're waiting on it they they needed it they was what would have been most you know helpful for them to develop their application uh it's not getting merged into ethereum anytime soon it's pretty stale we're able to merge it into their roll up get that set up and then they were able to go live like a couple weeks after and so there's other a bunch of other really interesting ones too like the Poseidon hash function ZK friendly hash function but it's not just eips and it's not just custom pre-compiles you have basically full control over the state machine So eventually we're going to be able to support different VMS like the Solana VM the move VM you know whatever crazy VMS or custom State transition functions people might want to do uh there's also value capture um imagine a token Emoji over there you can use a custom token you can generate sequencer fees you can also run some like lightweight Mev and so you can choose how to monetize and especially right now where a lot of projects are thinking about how to make money this is a super important aspect a lot of teams are thinking more and more about this how can they take fees from their roll up how do they distribute that back to their Community how do they use that to fund development and they're going to be a lot of really really interesting models on this going forward lastly uh wanted to defend settled Roll-Ups a little bit we think that the roll-up space in the modular space in general is going to be a homecoming moment for a lot of these application chains to come back into the fold with ethereum via roll-up Stacks that's not to say that we're anti-sovereign roll-up we think makes sense for certain applications makes less sense for others but we're really into this idea of a hub and spoke Altus and l3s all eventually settled by and settling to and secured by ethereum and also having native composability with ethereum assets and access to liquidity on ethereum l1's ethereum L1 and other ethereum l2s and eventually l3s um so there's this wonderful quote from vitalik oppression is always back from 2021 um and this is we're really really aligned with this thesis we get a multi-roll-up feature for ethereum which is effectively the cosmos multi-chain Vision but it's on top of a shared base layer uh providing data availability and shared security that's what he said what you might notice on that data availability point is that we haven't fully gotten there yet um ethereum when we're using ethereum for D.A we're just posting data to ethereum call data that is not super efficient it's quite costly and it's leading some to some big limitations when it comes to roll-ups uh so yeah that's the major blocker um when you're running a roll-up on ethereum you have a bunch of costs and then you have d a uh as a major bottleneck you can split up costs into three buckets the off-chain infrastructure costs this is like your Cloud servers your hosting networking Etc that is relatively fixed and also something that can't really change that much you have on-chain fixed costs there's a little bit of cost and settlement there's also a fixed cost when it comes to Da so a lot of these roll-up Stacks they're posting a lot of data uh to ethereum just like empty blocks kind of like metadata for the chain even if there are no transactions being processed and that was talked about in the last presentation as well and it is a major blocker for people who are launching app chains where they might be trying to bootstrap a little bit of activity but you know that activity hasn't come yet they don't have guarantees that there will be people around to pay for fees and cover costs and so you know they are wondering how do they cover those costs and then there are their variable costs so posting transaction data that gets sent to the sequencer and then there's a major bottleneck which is data availability we can quickly go through them these costs are really killer they make it hard to get off the ground as I mentioned um when you're settling on ethereum you might pay a hundred thousand dollars per year in these fixed da like metadata costs that is based off of current calculations so if we have another Bull Run or gas prices get higher greater demand for Block space that number can go up um they also prevent Roll-Ups from being strictly like cost competitive or better on costs than altel ones um for like simple uh transactions sometimes uh there might be cost competitiveness depending on demand on all of these chains um but as you can see like generally for average transactions um a lot of these Alto ones are still slightly better uh than existing Roll-Ups and that's gonna you know harm adoption because users really they don't really care they don't really know the difference between a side chain and an L2 a lot of the times users and even application developers want to go wherever is cheapest wherever there's adoption Etc they're not super aligned with ethereum in general um and lastly and I think this is an underappreciated point about the current ethereum roll-up space and the status quo is that we do have a d8 bottleneck which limits the total throughput across all Roll-Ups that are currently built on top of ethereum these are some calculations kind of rough back of the napkin math from Calvin Victor who works at optimism he has a blog post called TPS is dumb this was a little bit of a sidebar on that blog post but basically you know even assuming like relatively uh you know reasonable assumptions around call data compression Etc like current ethereum d a only supports 360 transactions per second and that's if we're using all of the ethereum's network all of the gas throughput just for posting call data for l2s um and this is like based off of uh the current Network so pre 4844 pre-dink sharding but this is global across all rollups so even though uh for the compute we can horizontally scale ethereum right now via Roll-Ups eventually we're going to run into this bottleneck and so if you look at a lot of these limitations you'll find the thing that we keep going back to is d a right a lot of these on-chain fixed costs are actually d a which is uh surprising to some people because da is often thought as the variable cost but there's still a ton of metadata that needs to get posted to ethereum uh there are uh relatively High variable costs you're paying da when you're sending transactions and of course there is this bottleneck when it comes to Da limiting the total throughput of all ethereum Roll-Ups uh and so we have Our Saviors um all of whom I believe are sponsored of this event Celestia eigen and Avail basically projects that are focused on providing cheap data availability and at Caldera we were founded we're really you know even since founding like we're really excited about these we saw these uh projects as being the major uh unlocks for an ethereum-centric roll-up future and so we were one of the first teams to integrate all D.A into traditional ethereum roll-up Stacks um so with Celestia we launched the first test net of an OP stack plus Celestia roll-up and effectively you know at a very high level what it does is like we're posting data frames to Celestia now rather than ethereum natively um thus you know alt D.A and we're only posting references to those frames that are posted on Celestia to ethereum so that means that we're turning that variable cost which was uh sending all that data to ethereum D A into a fixed cost we're just sending a reference um this is a diagram from uh from vitalik's blog um just wanted to put this here to say we're not really changing much of the roll-up protocol at all you know we're still posting State routes to the Royal contract we're still posting batches the only thing that changes is I was told not to stray too far away from uh there but we'll live um is this part so these transactions that data is being sent to Celestia there's a little bit of of changes made in this logic to post references but effectively the robot protocol is still the same we're just referencing data on Celestia rather than ethereum um and it's live so if you guys want to be some of the first uh to launch something and play around with an Opie stack plus Celestia test net you can go to our bubstesnet.com or and we we're also really excited about this we recently launched a testnet with Manta Network and these guys are super early adopters yeah they're great there's Kenny in the back from Manta Network um they're as far as I know the earliest adopter of Celestia plus op stack for Roll-Ups on ethereum so they're going to allow their users to experience way lower transaction costs than any existent roll-up on ethereum plus they've also integrated a lot of ZK friendly uh application levels ZK functions and so if you're interested in developing on the first network to use Celestia for da go check them out go talk to them they've got a strong presence of this event so find them afterwards um and yeah thanks uh feel free to contact me at any time if you're thinking about launching a roll-up if you just want to talk about the design space always happy to chat um and yeah stay tuned I uh you're not rid of me yet we're doing a panel here uh on the Roll-Ups of service space which I'm told might get spicy so stay tuned thanks [Applause]
