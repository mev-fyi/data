[Music] let's begin exciting conversation um i'll start off with just why we do these calls these twitter spaces at celestia and it roots in a core belief of ours which is modularism not maximalism mustafa took the stage at the modular summit and outlined this pretty well but in short these these l1 wars have held us back and there's been this monolithic l1 loop these past 10 years with this zero sum mindset that's just frankly toxic with modularism we're more about a positive sum mindset and we're actively thinking about the next generation of blockchains and the requisite for success there is to loop in um all the stakeholders in the ecosystem uh to figure out how we want to blueprint this and so what we like to do is is just reach out to other folks and aztec in particular here to really and help us envision what the next five ten years are going to be like and our vision is around sovereign communities and part of that north star is privacy and who else to uh ask about privacy and help us think about the intersection of privacy and modularity than aztec um and so what we want to do is really go deep into this intersection uh of privacy meets modularity and we'll begin with uh the aztec side and uh ask like an open question here tell us about how you guys think about privacy especially anonymity and confidentiality uh explain those for us and then we'll go into where you see those two variables changing in the next five years given the modular sac yeah happy too so when it comes to like privacy on chain you're right it's kind of it's a bit of a nebulous concept so what do we really mean by that um we like to think of it as there are you can get well first of all just just to clarify um what i mean previously we mean uh like um observers cannot um spy on you and um kind of like reconstruct your transactions or what you've been doing so a lot of like the the very night there's there's a a lot of there's an impression um that things like bitcoin or ethereum are anonymous because your identity is just is a is an address and not a name but that's not really the case i mean if you the more the more economic activity that you move on chain um the more information about who you are what you're doing you're starting to reveal and so in a in a you know in a in a world in five ten years time when this technology matures and blockchain kind of really fulfills its original thesis of being used as a global settlements layer as a global transactions layer people aren't going to be okay with that if that means that for example all of their online purchases are visible to the entire world if their salaries are being streamed through a public ledger that people can observe and see things like that and so just to clarify um when we previously we've been on cryptographic ironclad privacy where um all of the data varying across the network is encrypted and only you as a user as an individual possess the decision keys for your own data um but within that within that wider context there are three forms of privacy there's there's more there's a this kind of says user privacy data privacy and code privacy user privacy is when the um the identity of the individual performing a transaction is hidden so for example i if you saw that somebody that you know like 15 dive was uh trade sent to an address or on chain but you didn't know the identities of the sender recipients that would be user privacy data privacy is when it's not just the identities of the of the transaction hidden but also the data be transferred so going back to that basic transfer of that 15 dive was encrypted so you you all you saw was that there was a cryptocurrency transfer from two encrypted addresses and the value was encrypted and then finally you have code privacy where the actual like transaction logic being executed is um not known uh by any observer so if i'm talking to for example like the make a dao smart contract on ethereum then nobody knows that all they see is that there was a transaction that occurred on here on ethereum it went it called a smart contract address um some value may of may have may not have been transfer transfer transformed preferred and the identities are hidden and so once you achieve um code privacy as well as user privacy data privacy that's when you have kind of a full confidentiality of your transaction and that's what we're aiming for at aztec i want to go into privacy in monolithic chains versus privacy in modular chains i'll kick the ball over to the celestia guys how do you you know mustafa let's start with you how do you see privacy changing given the modular stack um well the way i see it is i think like so first of all it seems to me that privacy is inherently more expensive in the monolithic chain because a lot of privacy constructions use cryptography that would that would high that would have high you know gas costs if you're deploying it on a chain that is not that does not have like native up codes for example for the operations you're trying to do and so like having a modular architecture where you separate the consensus and execution using roll-ups for example allows you to do um kind of computationally expensive things on the execution layer um without it being as expensive if you as if you were doing it on a monolithic l1 where you're sharing the same execution layer with certain limitations as everyone else i can i can uh add to that because because yeah you've hit that on the head and uh like our six journey as a company largely reflects that because originally when we got started we weren't a roll up we went to layer two what we we had a crypto cryptography protocol that enabled shielded transactions to to occur um where everything was verified inside a smart contract on ethereum so we were using the the ethereum as both the consensus and an execution layer but because the evm and the and the is not really it's not really designed to be optimized around advanced cryptography it meant that our transactions were extremely expensive because we were sharing this general purpose execution layer with with the entire ethereum ecosystem and so it meant that transactions like that shield the transactions going through that that system cost uh like tens of dollars um nowadays with modern gas prices it would be hundreds of dollars and so we had to um deliberately like separate out um our execution layer from that of the wider ethereum network by creating a layer to roll up just in order to enable us to achieve uh to enable cost-effective privacy on ethereum and so um a lot of the difficulties that we've been having with that is basically having to build out a lot of the infrastructure from scratch and so uh this is why um we're really excited about celestia and separating out the data availability layer from the from the um consensus and execution there because that means that it makes creating these modular architectures so much more easy to um easier to actually pull off without an event a ton of tech from scratch we'll kick the ball over to john john going deeper into the technical aspects of it maybe a question for you is what aspects of privacy does a roll-up enable that a layer one cannot and more broadly what are just some of your high level uh opinions as to where the puck is going yeah so i guess uh sorry there's some some feedback here maybe we can mute mustafa okay there we go sorry about that uh so i guess before diving into what it enables specifically i think it's uh interesting to draw some parallels here between uh what mustafa brought up around you know there being more resources and therefore you can do uh the potential to do new things and kind of the rise of machine learning uh because for for a long time you know there's no a lot of the techniques that are known in machine learning are really just math statistics stuff that have been known for like quite a long time but they were just computationally infeasible to do so you know people were looking for better techniques and so on and then and then at a certain point gpu just got so damn powerful that you could just literally just brute force you know training your machine learning models and it happens to work pretty good uh just literally just off of brute forcing it off of having access to more compute uh so i think we can see something along those lines uh uh could like something parallel to those lines could happen uh because modular blockchains enable so much more data throughput and so much more compute through optimized execution layers uh that simply having access to more resources could enable things that while technically possible were cost prohibitive before uh the exact extent to those things i'm sure that the aztec guys are much more familiar uh but now with respect to what roll-ups specifically available that you can't get out of a monolithic layer one i think one thing that's interesting is uh peer-to-peer privacy techniques uh if you're familiar with uh bitcoin there's a lot of concern around the privacy of light nodes and how they interact with full nodes and light client servers and so on and there's various techniques to anonymize or increase the privacy of transactions at the peer-to-peer layer so this means like not even like the the effects of the transaction but you know the actual blob that you send to the peer-to-peer network uh privacy on that so dandelion plus plus is one example i did use some interesting techniques to essentially obfuscate who the sender like who actually sent out a blob to the peer-to-peer network uh and i think that these kinds of things are potentially uh not necessarily more doable in this uh in a than a stack where you separate different layers that receive transactions uh but there's opportunities here if we're doing something different because if you have your data layer and then the execution layer on top users won't actually be interacting with the data layer they'll be interacting with the execution layer and then you can do various things like have more client server models instead of appear to pure network for various uh use cases like happy path for instance uh in ethereum flashbots is used quite heavily and they're essentially assuming you trust flash boss to anonymize your traffic they're they anonymize your traffic to anyone else that isn't flashbots so there's more opportunities here through this this separation uh because users don't have to interact with everyone they have to interact with a subset of that thanks john john two over to you why modular what intrigues you as you look across the aisle here and see modularity uh coming from the privacy point of view yeah i think we like to say that modularity allows us to focus on what we're best at it plays to our strengths and what we're best at is private execution so i think when we think about you know why do we you know there's a big question why build a roll up why not build an l1 or why you know potentially work with celestia and i think we're we're getting to a blockchain paradigm where everyone is becoming increasingly specialized and so what we're good at is ironclad privacy ironclad private execution and to add to what was said before you know we have a product coming out now called aztec connect that allows us to combine the best of public execution on ethereum and private execution on aztec and we're big believers that you know the public and private domains have to play together seamlessly if you think about these kind of like human coordination games that we play privacy is just one of the features so you know there are perfect information games like chess and checkers and backgammon there are plenty of games that we play that require privacy and so one of the big reasons to build on top of ethereum is to build on an ecosystem that is already the leader in public execution and to rely on them for security rather than completely rebuild our security model from the ground up and so i think really what it allows us to do is focus on what we're good at and rely on you know the settlement expertise and security expertise of ethereum and you know the data availability expertise of celestia and uh you know i think that a lot of the conversation right now is about the capital inefficiency of rebuilding everything uh repeatedly and that's kind of what the l1 wars are referring to right we're rebuilding everything from scratch continuously and you know what is the marginal difference it's some kind of like marginal consensus improvement and you know our philosophy is rather than try to innovate on that level we're going to innovate where we're most specialized there's this narrative that roll-ups are parasitic to ethereum true or false zach we'll go to you first on that so it very much depends on the architecture so um for some projects uh so one of the one of the well one of the reasons why um people claim that uh rollups are parasitic to ethereum is because the um the costs of moving into our super roll up are generally very expensive um which means that there is an enormous amount of pressure to recreate um the ethereum ecosystem of smart contracts within a roll-up so that if you have a um a layer to your roll-up that you know um you want you wanted to have a version of unison running on a roll-up or version of make a dao and all the main and all of the mainstream contracts that are running on ethereum you end up cloning them according to your rollup and then the effect of that is basically you've just you've created your um another liquidity mode you've split the liquidity theory of the user base ethereum um between your world and the um people using ethereum directly um and that that that that that there was there was logic i think there is it is valid to say that that that has a parasitic effect because it means that um you know you're you're taking what was one community and you're kind of splitting it up envelope is not parasitic to ethereum because we're taking a very different approach where what we focus on is privacy so we're not trying to recreate the ethereum ecosystem but cheaper um on a on an l2 we're trying to give people um uh control over their assets without reviewing their identities and what what i mean by that is that you deposit funds into xl2 and in doing so you shield your tokens because every user you deposit dastic acquires privacy by default because of our the way we've architected rzk roll up and then if you want to you and then um you can use our um effectively our aztec connect bridge to uh interact with layer one contract directly on ethereum um as if you were on one user um and we do that by transaction aggregation we use um xenons cryptography and zero snucks to basically make a batch of users um look like one user so if 10 people are doing a youtube trade on uniswap through aztec um aztec basically the the aztec roller will ping send it send an instruction to unisop um representing that batch of 10 people and the costs of that transaction get amortized across the all of the users in the batch and also the identities of all the participants is is um encrypted uh and i so um like generally like that that concepts are i think it's called uh like defy pooling um and i think it's going to become very uh popular um in the future because i think one of the effects we're going to get from these kind of these l2 wars is is a lot of fatigue effectively um where you get where those be where the lts that require ecosystem migrations are going to see very little genuine organic use um once you remove that kind of liquidity mining incentives and and that kind of you'll have users from that side of things but people actually using your network in order to engage like in order to form some kind of actual economic activity that's not going to be very common i think because people aren't going to be willing to split liquidity and my my suspicion is that the paradigm moving forward for lt's will be to largely use transaction pulling um uh whilst ensuring that the actual uh d5 protocols um remain on l1 uh and therefore like and therefore we preserve um preserve a single liquidity pool mustafa over to you same question this is a really pleased yeah i mean it's a really interesting question it's i think it's more it's very kind of social economic question more than a technical question i mean there's like three possibilities right uh either a roll-ups are parasitic ethereum or b ethereum is actually parasitic to roll-ups because roll-ups have to pay rent to ethereum when they could just be their own l1 or c it's a symbiotic relationship and there is no parasitism you know the truth probably lies in the third one to some extent because obviously that's where the balance lies uh there's some biotic relationship um but interestingly there's recently been like kind of like a more of an extremist part of the ethereum community which is well maybe not extremist but i mean there's part of the ethereum community that advocates for something called um enshrined roll-ups which is this idea of like it's basically execution shots right where um in the future there's this idea well we might have like a thing like a roll-up that's enshrined to the ethereum like governance in the sense that the ethereum validators are also the sequences for this roll-up and so i do kind of worry where i don't think this is like i don't think this is um the view of most people in ethereum but i do kind of worry where there's an extremist park that sees roll-ups um like our friendly throw-ups now but because roll-ups are using a kind of like diverging from ethereum in a sense like they have their own tokens that aren't using eth and they're kind of only friendly to them now because they help the skeleton but then they will but then after they will kind of push more to uh enshrined roll-ups because that's kind of more fundamentalist to the ethereum kind of token or narrative jonathan john number one will let you jump in first thanks i was about to ask uh so i i have some thoughts here i mean it can go either way and i think that it's important to kind of uh characterize well first of all parasitic is a very strong word right uh but you know paris parasites usually don't give back at all to their hosts uh but there could be the case where uh you know just because a roll up might syphon value off of the base layer it doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't also give a back value potentially equal or more uh so there's a bit of a bit of a nuance here parasitic is a bit of a strong word uh but with respect to whether or not a role siphons value off of the base layer i think it's important to distinguish between a base layer that has overlapping uh overlapping responsibilities or features with a rollup and one that does not uh for instance if you use celestia as a data layer uh celestia does not allow you to do any execution at a space layer so if you have an execution layer on top of that then they have completely non-overlapping features or resources that they provide to users because of that it is literally impossible for an execution layer to siphon value off of a pure data layer like celestia and in such a case it would be purely a positive sum game whether or not now a rollup will siphon value off of a base layer that also has execution that's a little bit more tricky because you know they both provide execution i do agree with mustafa though that it is much uh it is much more it's in my opinion at least it's uh more along the third option where it's a positive sum game and they reinforce each other so even though the roll-up may siphon off some some some users off of the layer one it also contributes back and it can contribute back more than it siphons off that guys do you guys disagree with mustafa and john on that third point i i think i just have a slightly different or maybe quite frankly dumber framework to think about it which is yeah what do we mean by parasitism right do we do we literally just mean the amount of demand for ethereum resources and block space is going to go down with roll ups and if we frame the question that way i have a very hard time believing that that's the case in fact i'm almost scared of the opposite that rollups make layer one ethereum uh nearly unusable for the typical retail user and if you think about kind of like the price elasticity within crypto right now right there's i think an argument to be made that it's hyper elastic if you cut cost dramatically throughput goes up by more than the proportion that you've cut costs or or pricing to users and so if i think about rollups getting to sub-penny transactions and uh being able to support massive throughput um the demand could be far greater than the reduction in cost and what that means is there should be a net uh increase in demand for ethereum block space and i know john adler's a really big fan of thinking about resource pricing i think potentially that allows ethereum to price resources more effectively to focus kind of their resource pricing on what they do best in service to roll ups as part of this scaling roadmap and so to make this even dumber and more like you know third grade you know i i personally think when i describe this to the lay lay person of ethereum as kind of like a highway and of roll-ups as kind of like buses right they're able to cram like way more transactions way more people traveling on the same highway into one vehicle so to speak and so now the question is we have a highway full of individual passenger vehicles and tomorrow we've introduced a bunch of bus operators does traffic on the highway go up or down my intuition here is that the traffic on the highway goes up that more people are going to be willing to pay way more because for each individual bus rider the cost is amortized over a large number of transactions and it doesn't do anything in my opinion to affect the type of person who wants to take private transportation if you're the type of person who wants the direct security and privacy not not literal privacy but the direct kind of like relationship with ethereum that you do from having a private vehicle aka interacting with layer one directly then you'll do that this doesn't detract from that demand it's purely incremental and that's kind of my like you know 101 third grader way of thinking about it zach would you like to jump in here yeah i guess it's interesting right because yeah i think i think um the difference here is that i think like so john john wu and and kind of in my opinion um looking at the like the the same ecosystem but in different different times because right now um roll-ups there is there is there is a public debate around like the like the roll-ups being in tension with um uh the base layer the base execution there right um ethereum does execution roll-ups to execution uh and so um uh is it parasitic for like for for roll-ups to um to siphon value out out of ethereum um uh you know is the using the ad worth like like uh in excess of it you know there's that there's that conflict but long term the fact that ethereum provides execution is going to become irrelevant because uh what people like because the thing about the ethereum's execution layer is is it is very very opinionated and restricted um because it has to be because it's a monolithic l1 um it can execute code but not very fast as then they can't it can't become like the number of cpu cycles you can you can you can execute in your in your in a block of transactions is right quite limited um uh in order to you know maintain consensus and so worlds can do execution so much better than ethereum um in the long term uh like especially when you use zero proofs so that um you know in theory you could have um uh you know you just post the results of like a million um evms ethereum style uh transactions on ethereum and then you just provide this distinct proof of knowledge that the transactions are correct and you know and this area has to do with basically no execution other than verifying the correctness of zero knowledge proofs um and ethereum based excuse me i just can't compete with that long term and so the yeah i guess my guess my my long term view is that this debate isn't going is isn't going to have a conclusion because it's going to get eaten by like this problem is going to get eaten by a larger problem or a larger issue which is that um ethereum as executioner will be uncompetitive with rolex long term before i move on to the next topic i'll let mustafa give his closing thoughts on on this one before we move on um i don't really have any any further thoughts as i said i laid out the three possible three possible conclusions either roll ups or passes dixie ethereum or ethereum is proactive with roll-ups or the symbiotic relationship and i think the truth is usually lies in the middle which is the third option there so john when we had the notes going back and forth there was this question i think i've seen it on twitter too is modularity a risk to ethereum and it's a fair question and i want to get the the aztec side here for this point of view so zach maybe we'll go with you first is do you think modularity is a risk to ethereum no i don't actually uh so i guess one of the reasons why modularity should be a risk is because it uh the barriers to entry get lowered um substantially so that if you have a if you have a modular ecosystem of blockchains where it's very easy to transfer funds between networks they for example imagine they all use a shared data layer um and so like cross like bridging transactions are very cheap then um one could argue like what's that ethereum loses a lot of the in like it's it's explicit value because which is which is in the form of liquidity notes um the reason why a lot of people want certain kind of ethereum is because that's where all the money is right so if you want to do things that require um like things like automated market makers or any kind of price setting mechanic you want to go where all the value is all the liquidities and that's ethereum right now however why did ethereum accrue that value in the first place it recruited because of the utility it offers um and i think that sorry i'm guessing i'm answering a different question really because i guess my my answer to like my thought is basically um i don't think i care if blocked if if modular blockchains are a threat to ethereum and i'm not sure anybody else should because what modular modular what a modular blockchain world means is that is that the blockchain ecosystem becomes far more competitive that a uh a certain layer one needs to justify its existence on its own merits it can it can't just take advantage of a first mover effect um and say well you know ethereum was first so all the money went to ethereum first for smart contracts and therefore a better platform that turns up can't compete well that kind of that barrier gets eroded in a modular world because because it becomes much more easier for um those two sovereign networks to communicate with one another and so that's a good thing and so there's i guess i guess yeah that's so winding into that um does that mean that ethereum is threatened well maybe it depends on whether ethereum's governance um mechanisms are robust enough that ethereum can iterate and innovate and and adapt so that um it does not lose its um like fundamental value proposition um to developers into users mustafa already um well i mean yeah i mean it's kind of it's kind of the same question really like what what kind of risks are we talking about and i think like probably the main risks that people talk about is if it reduces ethereum's moat um i think i guess like i echo zak's comments on that uh first of all it doesn't matter secondly um it's not a zero-sum game uh like a i think even if it reduces ethereum's mode a modular settlement layer which is what ethereum would be in a modular world which would have much more value than the melodic layer one because it's not a zero-sum game what is aztec's point of view and stance on data availability on dangerous well that's uh necessary um so the yes so so a lot of the things you're having in in web 3 largely the fact that like the first um uh like programmable blockchain that turned up ethereum uh conflated um you know consensus it's because this is like the executioner that you've available delay into one network um because you know back in 2015 there wasn't really any other way of doing it um you know it's easy it's easy to criticize uh with hindsight but you you have a much much more um uh it's it's much better for the ecosystem if there's if those layers are separated because you can you can price resources more effectively and um so like you network's neat like um like distributed magnesium there's a bunch of noise in the background oh sorry i'm sorry i'm rubbing my finger over the mic i didn't realize um so um for to make a private asset transaction you need to actually you need to position knowledge of the entire chain state um like the present chain states to make that transaction so um if you know you've even like said like you know a single byte of a transaction um is missing um then you basically hold to the network and so data availability is really really important for aztec um more more so than than a public chain where you have it like you have a reordering problem and double spending problems um you you just fundamentally break the the chain if you lose a single byte of data on aztec um and so we as a network we care very much about the ability and willing to pay highly for it um but the problem with ethereum is that the like data as a resource is priced you know in gas the same way as execution is a resource and the same way as um like um smart contracts like storage um data is priced um and like and a network latency is priced and all pricing gas which is this one that one one metric and so the um the resource bottleneck on ethereum right now isn't um data of ability uh but the effect of that is it means that data is very highly overpriced in my theory um and uh so that has a big effect a very detrimental effect on roll-ups and so um splitting out the data variability layer into its own network where the which is optimized around um uh around providing ability as a resource as as abundantly as cheap as possible is in my opinion like an extremely um good necessary and uh valuable move i want to move to the quantum gravity bridge john can you introduce that john one can you introduce the quantum gravity bridge and explain some of the synergy with something like aztec yeah so the quantum gravity bridge is a system sorry there's some feedback again do you think we can move mustafa ah there we go yeah so the quantum gravity bridge is a system that acts very similarly to uh relays uh if you're familiar with things like btc relay or systems like let's see rainbow bridge potentially or you know basically any of the side chain bridges that exist uh they're a relay to another blockchain ibc would also be a relay to another blockchain if you're familiar with the cosmos ecosystem uh so right it's essentially you're running a light client of another blockchain in the evm uh you verify block headers along with something about consensus of the chain so in the case of approve work relay would be proof of work difficulty and in the case of something like tendermint which is what celestia uses it would be has the block being signed off by two thirds of the validators at stake at that particular block height now unlike other relays the quantum gravity bridge has some special properties uh namely that it does not involve relaying assets most relays are used to be able to move an asset from one domain to another domain for instance btc relay allows you to lock up bitcoin on the bitcoin chain uh and then relay them over and get minted on the ethereum chain and then potentially back right uh there's also other more trusted relays that don't involve checking consensus if you want to call them relays things like rap btc or whatever right but it's essentially a way of moving assets around the quantum gravity bridge doesn't do that uh because there's not really any other assets on celestia other than the celestia token of course and there's no execution on celestia so there's not particularly a need for moving these assets around right there's no notion of tokens on celestia so essentially the quantum gravity bridge only relays data so the relay will attest to the fact that some data was available on the celestial chain through a merkle root of that data and it can bash them together et cetera there's a variety of uh very interesting optimizations we've made to the gravity bridge relay code which is what this is based off of uh to make it uh much cheaper to to relay attestations and essentially what you get on the on the ethereum side to the smart contract that says okay this merkle root uh is attested to by the celestial validator set and the data behind this merkle root is available under an honest majority assumption of the celestia validator set now you have this very compact cheap way for downstream contracts such as roll-up contracts that they exist today this includes things like fuel or aztec or starkware optimism or arbitrary or zk sync or anything you want that currently use ethereum for data availability or that use a data availability committee to essentially drop and replace that logic with the attestations that are relayed from the quantum gravity bridge they just like drop and replace it and they call a single function that says you know does this merkle root have an attestation on it uh returns true if it does returns false if it doesn't and then under an honest majority assumption of the celestia validator set that data is guaranteed to be available this has nice properties over a vanilla data availability committee and it also has nice properties over using ethereum itself as it currently exists for data with respect to a data availability committee the quantum gravity bridge gives you properties that one as a user you can verify that the data is available or unavailable very cheaply due to data availability sampling you can't do this currently with data availability committees you basically just have to trust them and if the bridge is broken if they lie you don't actually have any way of knowing that the bridge is broken which is all it's pretty bad that you don't even like the fact that you don't know that the system is broken is a pretty bad property to have right at least with data availability sampling you can cheaply verify that the system is functioning correctly up until before you start using it uh also the uh the fact that this is a blockchain validator set that is a testing to data as opposed to you know seven large corporations that are just signing something means that the users of that blockchain in this case celestia can penalize those validators if they do something malicious so if they try to relay an invalid attestation that two-thirds of the validator set that relay the invalid data station will get slashed you cannot slash a data availability committee that attests to the fact that some data is available when it's not all you can do is kind of shame them in on twitter that's not exactly a very large deterrent there's absolutely no financial disincentive for them to lie while the celestial validator set lies they can get slashed and that could potentially be a very very large penalty this also has the now moving on to the the second facet which is you know what are its advantages compared to using ethereum as a current that exists for data i mean we've talked about this quite quite a bit already uh in in in the spaces which is that ethereum as it exists today is a monolithic chain uh if you want to use ethereum today for data you need to compete with arbitrage bots and mav and nft drafts then you know aren't a few drops that took down solana so whatever they had six million transactions per second or something so that's what you have to compete with if you want to just use a theorem for data availability uh because ethereum is a monolithic chain this may change in the future for ethereum but currently today it is a monolithic chain and therefore it is very expensive to use it for data availability if you use the quantum gravity bridge in uh for data availability then at least initially and for the same throughput that ethereum currently supports uh this will be substantially cheaper as in like fees will be negligible effectively free obviously if uh if celestia is used very very substantially then there's nothing we can do to avoid a fee market happening but at least for the same usage feasibly fees will be negligible in this configuration as that guys do you see any concerns with the quantum gravity bridge and do you have any questions for mustafa and john in terms of making this practical yeah i think our stance today um as uh a protocol is to rely on ethereum um because something like celestia has not um you know gone through a long lindy effect period of being trusted but to just underscore the problem um you know if you take a we we are releasing a product called asset connect it's a private bridge to ethereum and allows you to do any d5 transaction privately and it relies on layer one for execution and so if you kind of break down the gas cost of a typical aztec connect transaction you'll see that um there's you know 10k gas for the l1 execution portion you know assuming there's a uniswap swap and you're splitting that with a bunch of users and so there's like a dramatic reduction in cost based on the size of the batch um we also have the viewing keys because we are a private roll-up and so that's another ak of gas and then in order to actually prove the validity of the transaction the share of the transaction is maybe 600 gas and then the remainder is about 8k of call data and so i know that was a lot of numbers i just threw at you but roughly the call data proportion of the total transaction is about 60 today so that tells you that it's already the majority of our of our expenses is ethereum l1 call data now in the future we're going to have off chain execution we're going to have off chain viewing keys and the as a result the vast majority of our costs are going to be l1 call data up to 93 percent and so uh yeah really just underscores the need um to have uh much much cheaper data availability and i think it's something that we've considered as well is this kind of what other companies call the volition approach where users can kind of choose where their data might be stored um but i can turn it over to zach for maybe more of the party line yeah zach over to you what are your thoughts on the quantum gravity bridge and its impact on the ecosystem in the time ahead uh yeah i mean i think um i'm just gonna so to echo john that uh the if it's uh the reason like the reason why we use ethereum is because as a data from databases because yeah like a bespoke data variability layer hasn't yet been kind of battle tested and proven once it is then it's going to be a complete game changer because the um monolithic chains won't really be able to compete when it comes to pricing data effectively uh and um it's going to open up an enormous amount of uh pretend like new kinds of use cases for blockchains that just currently can't uh price now priced out at the moment i mean it's also going to create well you know this much more modular world where you can have where it's going to be much easier to kind of transition um to transfer funds between different networks because the overall like the aggregate cost of a transaction is going to be um extremely small once you use a roll-up for your execution and then you use something like celestia and the quantum gravity approach for data then you can use something like a network like ethereum just for raw consensus and the price of that um uh can be extremely competitive when you're using a roll-up and so um i think it's going to create a very different kind of landscape to the one that we have at the moment where um what basically i think that the l1 walls so to speak are going to are going to kind of um if this if celestia fulfills its vision is going to not really be a thing anymore uh because the there's going to be so little to differentiate them all that the fundamental value proposition um of uh a different monolithic r1 is going to is going to be seen as is extremely marginal um and so uh uh yeah i mean i think uh i think it's going to well i yeah we're going to see a much more kind of diverse world where um a very large number of l ones are used in tender with one another we do want to take questions here oh god sorry just saw it in trouble i'm very sorry for this i'm going to have to actually jump off now because i'm sorry i have a i have a hard stop i've got a um some uh some uh um just uh uh medical related things i need to deal with now so i've got i've got to jump off now but uh it's been a lot of fun thank you for inviting me thanks zach thanks for attending cool cheers everyone thanks a lot jack so we do want to take questions from the audience so please raise your hand and uh you can ask mustafa john and john too any questions um mustafa over to you when it comes to the quantum gravity bridge and that synergy with aztec is there anything else that you want to add to what john said that you think is important um for us to know as it comes into practice so i think i think like the main challenge with the content with um like zk roll-ups using quantum gravity bridge right now is that celestia uses sha-256 as the hash function for the merkle tree which is not zk friendly and so like there's different approaches like we're trying to we're trying to kind of take there to solve that uh the first of which is like we don't wanna we wanna try to avoid having multiple hash functions or change the hash function because that's not really as much complexity to the system um so like one operation we're trying to take is like we might have a zk proving service that uh like proves that the celestial american retreat or the medical root matches some zk friendly version uh of the medical route like it could be like a pedestrian or poseidon a hash function michael root i said like zk raw ops would not have to do expensive 5.6 operations and could just use a sdk-friendly hash function got it any questions from the audience who would like to ask a question looking at the framework guys a priori yaz just entered ruby okay looks like we have a question here christian go ahead ask your question yes so i had a question for the aztec guys um so let's say there's a project launching on optimism arbitrary whatever name your rollup would you could you run a sort of a a an aztec batch through that type of um project or would the project need to be on ethereum layer one as well like uh for yeah for now we only have plans to deploy our aztec connect product to ethereum layer one um what it is is it's essentially a smart contract on layer one that allows users of aztec to use the roll-up contract as a proxy and so you can direct funds on layer one and it'll say you know aztec roll up deposited uh you know 30 into uniswap and got you know 100 000 dieback something like that um we can absolutely deploy to other l2s and this is something we've definitely talked about internally of creating you know uh implementing aztec as a private l3 we don't currently have plans to do so and part of the reason is because we still think the vast majority of the activity is on l1 and we have a bunch of cost improvements already in place due to batching so we think it's a very compelling product to have privacy and scale directly on top of layer one liquidity and the second reason is in the medium term we'll be moving to off chain execution regardless um and so that means having private smart contracts within our own ecosystem okay perfect thanks uh i have a second question that's okay of course so um what are your concerns about aztec sort of becoming a tax haven because as i see it you have a sort of ckck so you actually have the possibility if there are enough sort of transactions in a batch to make it um cheaper to to make a transaction through aztec than on ethereum layer one and so you could say that oh you might both sort of save the gas but you also are less prone to sort of have the authorities um checking your stuff because well they they can't really yeah i think this is a question for any privacy protocol now to date i think the data would show that we don't have that issue and we have a lot of internal debate as to why um quite frankly we don't want to be associated with illicit activity but our stance on uh you know audit and reporting to authorities is that it's up to the individual user and um our principle as a protocol is to provide ironclad privacy and then allow the user if they want to to attest to their transaction history and so i think that is speaking to a larger philosophical question about privacy you know as a society do we think that there's more utility in having privacy and discretion when there's you know undeniably some amount of potential wrongdoing that can go through the same protocol our goal is to just make sure that users who um obviously we all encouraged to abide by laws and regulations can do so um and you know to date i would say that that that has not been a concern of ours whatsoever our user set is predominantly um kind of small quantity users largely um uh yeah largely what we would consider to be real users um and not uh you know adversarial you know black hat type users we'll be filling more questions i see more folks coming in here jonathan lucian the next question will be from a priori go for it hey thank you for having me on um question i wanted to ask about sovereignty in terms of a settlement roll-up do you foresee the possibility that you would have other settlement roll-ups on top of a settlement roll-up in order to like let's say if you had multiple municipalities that wanted to share a settlement roll-up that then settled on a roll-up uh shared with some other sovereignty in order to not sacrifice on interoperability i mean that's basically like fractal scaling right or like l3's d mean exactly yeah i mean i think l threes and fractal scaling is a very interesting uh idea um i i like sparklers looking into it and there's various other other proposals the main kind of challenge with that is how you do cross-chain communication between the different roll-ups in the tree that like naively you would have to do multiple transactions to like move assets up to the root roll-up and then back down but this there's a there's various proposals to try to avoid that there's a proposal called slush which tries to have like transactions directly between different roll-ups in the tree which which is very interesting all right guys well um i think that was it i think that was like a good hour i know we're pressed for time on the aztec side um if there are no other thoughts we can conclude here and uh this is fun john uh thank you for joining appreciate the time guys enjoyed the software john appreciate it as well thanks [Music] you
