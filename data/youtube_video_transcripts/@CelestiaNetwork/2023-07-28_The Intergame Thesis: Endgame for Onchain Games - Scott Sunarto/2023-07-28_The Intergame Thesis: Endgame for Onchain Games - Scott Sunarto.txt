cool hello everyone so um today I want to talk about a little bit that I have been very passionate about and it is about thinking about the practical thesis for ancient games um for a long time we've talked about launching games from perspective of really kind of hobbyists right thinking about like what could the future be where like you know the role is on chain however we haven't really thought about how could businesses succeed in an environment of fully ancient games and this is what the intergame thesis is going about is going to be about so oops so just quickly introduce myself my name is Scott I'm the founder of Vargas previously I was co-creator of dark force the first fully on chain uh epimurtius game built using ZK snarks and before we kind of get on to what the intro game thesis actually is I think it's useful for us to have a quick of background of how ancient games have evolved in the past few years since the phase zero which is around 2020 when we started publishing dark force and creating the first fully on chain games so dark force as some of you might have already known is a fully like a fully Unchained space exploration mmrts game on ethereum powered by CK snarks back then not a lot of games really exist not even the current thing that people think about as crypto games and dark force became this Beacon of Hope for a consumer application on ethereum we use the blockchain not only as a way to host nfts or host in-game assets but to also as a way to like you know have users Journal content that directly ensure operates with a game state that again is fully Unchained as a result we had thousands of players who are playing the game within the first few weeks of launch and flooded a blockchain which back then was called xdi now known as ignosis chain with tons of thousands of transactions burning trillions of units of gas for like executing a game move so this became the big bang for um fully on chain games we created a realization that building an interoperable open and troubles system is powerful even outside of decentralized Finance consumer applications benefit from these open and tropical system by creating an open and user General content layer on top of their game by default but dark force people are able to build their own clients and players can also build platforms out of the game expanding the design space for things like Guild systems mercenary systems and so on and so forth for example in Dark Forest people created like like a bounty a bounty marketplace where you can basically pay people to kill another player in the game and they will get rewarded if that player is killed automatically on chain without the need of an off-chain platform a smart contracts are basically able to read directly from the game state to verify where not a certain player or certain planet have been killed and this became a really powerful realization for a lot of game developers in terms of Designing their game with that open and composibility in mind and the next phase became the Taurus world that right now we are living in um like After the Dark Forest had its success in 2020 a lot of people are continues to be perplexed by fully ancient games and this leads to the birth of the concept of autonomous world with companies like lattice who have been pushing uh like autonomous World libraries like mud and so on and so forth to make it easier for people to build their full yarn chain games content companies like primordium I was also building a fully on chain game that uses this autonomous World Concepts to create constraints of physics for this zero worlds and again there's also increasing number of people building uh libraries and Frameworks for people that are interested in building uh fully engine games autonomous world like things like mud dojo and some others built by companies like curio and so on and so forth so the key unlock with this this phase of on-chain games is digital physics it's a realization that that open doesn't necessarily mean it's loss it answers the question of how do we handle open and probability and composibility with a game when there is some constraint that is imposed to give you an example here is that you have to contrast uh an autonomous world or like kind of like a digital physics with client-side modding right if you play let's say I don't know GTA 5 with a mod you can make anyone look however you want you can like you know add cheat code that makes you have unlimited amount of money and this is the key thing that we need to kind of understand when we're building fully engine games is that just because you have an open system and you have an untroppable system that people can contribute to it doesn't mean that the player can do whatever it wants the player the Creator like kind of architect of the worlds are able to set constraints and create some level of digital physics that Define what a player can and cannot do when they are kind of building on top of these games and this is like how it manifests itself like through things like an OP craft and mud where a player agree upon a shared digital physical constraint and again open doesn't mean that the users can do whatever for example in opcraft you can't just like you know spawn a block from thin air you've got to get the block first you need to go to that location to place the block and so on and so forth doesn't mean that like you know be just because a smart contract or other like you know players can can operate with the game or build a client that interprets with the game that they can do uh whatever they want so that's digital physics the next phase is the intergame which us at Argus are presumably excited about so the inter game is is basically just a short for the intuitive games so far when we're thinking about interoperability and composibility in full yanchen games we're talking about it with it in context of like one game talking with like let's say a smart contract that is um like you know talking directly with a smart contract of the game these are kind of the most like rudimentary forms of like intropolitical and tropical and composibility that I that we saw exist in on-chain games however an open and an open system in games doesn't always like need to center around um the games itself as you can see right now like the game industry surprisingly is actually much more siled than our financial system like for example like if you are using like you know like you know again Banks you can still use like things like plaid to integrate um like your you know your banking data with let's say a fintech platform so right now banks are are more open uh in terms of like you know um API and interop then how you know um like a game like um like how a game would for example if you're using uh like you know playing a game using steam you can't even like use your epic account to play uh the game you can't use like you know you can't transfer your item out outside of the game if a game that you deploy a multiplayer multiple game that you Deploy on Steam um wants to migrate off to a different platform you can't carry over those data you would have to just basically have create a new slate of game items and this creates a lot of problem when you want to kind of basically build like a large scale fully engine games with kind of more complicated stakeholders in reality um like you know the game industry is not built only by this like you know independent Studios there are kind of other like you know people like you know in indie game Publishers there's also plot distribution platforms um there's like marketplaces there's is like first party marketplaces there's third-party marketplaces there are console companies and so this leads to the question of like how these different layers of the gaming stakeholders are able to support uh like and communicate with each other and again we have to understand that even though we want this intra open and tropical system that doesn't mean that we want to allow everyone to be able to do whatever in the same way let's say like you know with one game you can't just like want to allow another game to spawn millions and hundreds of dollars in your other game in in another another person's game so the concept of physics and like digital physics goes beyond than just a single game it is a constraint that needs to be imposed on like this different interoperability layer within like the game the game publisher and game publisher to like let's say another game publisher and so on and so forth and so this is about the internet of game is it's a realization that interoperably can go Way Beyond the games than just between games between users and content Beyond just working with smart contracts with within our smart contracts and last but not least of course the communication of games between games there's a lot of nuances when kind of like what we when people want to build this since the dawn of like nfts and like like 2018 when crypto crypto kitties have first came out people have always asked the question right like what does it look like when a game like half and probable game assets across different games a lot of people in the NFD crowd would come up with this idea that hey like you can bring your sword from World of Warcraft to like Counter-Strike which if you think about it it doesn't really make sense there needs to be some level of constraints and like how do you coordinate these transferable assets or even transferable data or transferable state or transferable identity and this is where like a protocol is needed to kind of resolve that there needs to be some some level of coordination and there's needs to be some level of like physics constraints across these different games for these kind of like cross you know stakeholder interoperability and composability to work and this is like what the world engine is the world engine is basically a shared substrate a shared agreement agreement between different Publishers between different games between different smart contracts to basically have like a like a seamless interoperability across them it's the same way to interpret identity the same way for also and understand assets the same way for us to add limitations over what kind of thing what kind of interoperability is allowed across these different systems and again at the end of the day we want to allow each developers each game Publishers and each you know game studios to have full power over their own game we want to allow them to be able to set this physics constraints the same way that they are able to deal with autonomous worlds and at the end of the day the end game for the world engine is to basically be the TCP for games I know that's a term that is abuse a lot in blockchain everyone wants to be the TCP of everything but that's basically kind of like how I would describe it so now again the world engine is what we're trying to do with it is to become a trojan horse for the inter game era we want to make it as easy as possible for people to build games that are default open right now if you want to build like an open game or you want to build an autonomous world you have to chew bullets it's very hard to coordinate it you have to like figure out how to deploy your own rollups how to configure your roll ups to be able to like you know bridge out to like other Roll-Ups and communicate with other games um and the world engine is designed to really abstract away all those problems from the lowest level which is like how do you do shared sequencing due to the like highest level to such as building your own game game engine runtime and so on and so forth the roller engine is designed to be contributor friendly so we are very open with uh like you know with kind of like the idea of people building their own game engine runtimes for example and it's again maximally extensible so that you can fit it to however you want to fit your game and it's also open source right now at Target slots um so like this is like a star game template if you guys are interested in building a game chart which is like our kind of game Run time that is designed to be open by default uh you can you can use this and by launching a game chart on top of the world engine sequencer you're allowing other game shards to be able to communicate with you through the shared sequencer system and yeah that's all for my talk and thank you for having me [Applause]
