okay uh today I'll be talking about capsule uh but the context of why this is such an important topic for uh modularity and The Summit in general uh is because as we increase the surface area of chains uh we actually end up with more problems and so this is where transaction signing infrastructure becomes really relevant uh next slide oh wait there's a slide before that no keep going back back there we go okay cool next Slide the perfect okay um so congratulations we did it turn to your neighbor and give them a pat on the back because hell yeah we're on our path to solve the scalability trilemma which was necessary to solve for so-called uh mainstream adoption so yay we're on the path there but because of this we've actually introduced a bunch of new problems that uh hinder uh potential mainstream adoption so that's kind of what I'm here to talk about today thank you um so here's what metamask looks like today uh managing a bunch of tokens managing a bunch of networks uh it's a very complex flow to sign transactions next slide assets are basically everywhere and essentially as chains the number of chains grow this problem gets uh much worse next slide and so uh yeah I've been thinking about blockchains in general since 2017 started my journey at consensus uh had a stint at the graph was recently on Celestia and then ended up joining nitya the founder of capsule to think about this problem because I it's kind of observing that there needed to be a better way to manage transactions across all these chains so more into that on the next slide so here's what we know about the path to mainstream adoption um of course there's more steps on this it should say one two three but um yeah it's fine um yeah there's probably more steps on here but for all of us the steps to mainstream adoption are one we know we have to separate out execution from the L1 to to just scale better two we have to create more compelling applications to bring people into crypto and then somewhere in the middle we need to profit hopefully next slide um and so if we think about this in the framework of uh three product categories applications wallets and chains we actually end up seeing something super interesting next slide yep perfect um there you go perfect uh We've successfully added more chains to the Spectrum and protocols uh because we've obviously been thinking about scalability a lot for the past three years to the point that we've created more and more block space and created more forms of execution like alt VMS ZK VMS Etc so this side of of the space is kind of teeming with activity next slide next there you go um also we know on the other side of the space applications we've seen a fair amount of activity there so uh we're somewhat there in terms of mainstream adoption with apps like Open Seas or a rabbit hole lens but frankly it's been a challenge to see a lot of mainstream people use these applications outside of things like airdrop farming and so what what gives next slide um oh yeah go back yeah the castle thesis is that uh solving for mainstream adoption is not just about creating more compelling applications I think this is a very prevalent narrative on Twitter today where people are like devs should be building better applications and use cases suck but we actually think that's a misguided take um and the problem is of course innovating more at the application layer but it's also managing the transacting experience across this wide surface area of block space we've created over the past three years um and so the key to that is the wallet layer next slide everyone should just like take a moment to cringe because I know like wallets are just like overdone and over talked about so like let's just take a moment to like accept that and yeah it's the reason why it's been so exhausting to talk about wallets is because we've thoroughly like just exhausted our mental space for wallets in general and I'll kind of explain why that is in the next slide there we go so uh the reason why is that over the past few years we've innovated a ton at the UI layer but not on the fundamental transacting layer so this is metamask Rainbow Phantom kind of represents like 2018 to 2019 2020 2021 you could see that the uis look pretty different but the actual experience of doing things on chain still stays relatively the same so you're still you still need a human in the loop you still need to switch a bunch of networks you still need to sign transactions or messages transact you also have to like inspect the transaction to make sure you're not signing anything Jank and so it's still very much the same as far as like third-party wallet applications go next slide there's also been a lot of innovation at the embedded wallet side of the space so this is like coinbase wallet Circle um magic link web3 auth there's a bunch of players I think engine as well is in the space but this like wallet as a service uh product category is also pretty exhausting and the reason why is you get this like clean experience of not having to deal with signing messages and signing transactions in the middle of your applications experience but as soon as you want to take your wallet and go elsewhere so Celestia talks a lot about this exiting with interoperability it's very very difficult so these are the steps you have to go through to actually take an asset from an embedded wallet and actually import that into metamask and then list that asset on openc for example there's a lot of steps and so that's also very confusing and exhausting and bad next slide the third uh We've exhausted ourselves is with third-party app building wallets so if you think about this it's like uniswap building a wallet or Robin Hood building a wallet um this is awesome and actually works a lot in favor for the application so the app now has full control over their end user experience they no longer have to go through like a metamask they can just go through uniswap wallet but it now requires Hayden and the team to fight the good fight with giants like apple on apps or policies and making sure the app doesn't get delayed and uh kind of growing their user base from zero which is a really tough thing to do next slide um and so you can see why we're kind of exhausted of of wallets and this this Market in general um and at a high level this is where these this this layout is kind of where all these products sit um it's it's crowded it's confusing it's it's not perfect um and there's an obvious gap of needing ways to transact that are embedded and don't require like leveraging a third-party app like a metamask in the middle um but also managing the signing um and switching networks and making sure that you can take your keys and kind of go elsewhere and take your assets elsewhere as well um and so the the crazy thing is that this is what this Market looks like for just a single chain so just within this like single chain Paradigm you have all these options and so as block space surface area increases Mo chains there we go um so yeah you guys you guys didn't say that um there we go yeah participate um take two um and so next slide oh yeah there we go so uh yeah so in a world where you know thanks to modularity and and better better scaling wallets as Standalone products are you know constant RPC endpoints uh always switching network uh in the middle of your flow and just shifting the user friction uh which was once on the infrastructure side of things down to applications which is is not good um and so next slide and so this gets keep clicking one two three four five there we go now we're done uh so this gets a thousand times worse so this is just a couple of examples of uh El tuser networks that have shipped recently so there's like the public goods Network Zora Network base Claris also also shipped recently and so as we keep increasing the number of chains we're transacting with you kind of need a better way to manage the transacting experience and the intention to transact in a clean way without making user experience really bad next slide and so our our core Insight is um you know forget the wallet uh I think wallet as Standalone products are really really tough and instead focus on the ability to natively transact so in a world with Mo chains no problems uh having a third party app like a wallet uh just adds to the confusion and so if you have a native Native way to transact within the application or the product you remove the ability the the need to kind of switch between signing things and also uh needing to kind of have a browser extension to to transact next slide yeah um so this is kind of how capsule thinks about it and we'll go through a demo as well um we basically add a notion of the the image is a little messed up but that's okay we add in a notion of permissions uh into this experience so by permissions we remove the discrete uh proposing signing and inspecting of transactions that need to happen in today's kind of transacting Paradigm and so how we do this is we take NPC uh mpc-based key management and we wrap it with a permissions engine so no more pop-ups switching networks but you also get the interoperability benefits of of wallets by being able to take your keys everywhere so functionally next slide yeah functionally what this looks like is a developer tool you can click again it changes color functionally yeah right functionally what this looks like is a developer tool with a single sign-on experience so this means theoretically a user could onboard onto an evm specific application and then one click on board into a cosmos wallet which removes the need for uh the cosmos wallet to acquire new users and also get the get users to bridge through the friction of going into a new ecosystem and so we think this design kind of drives Network Effects by not only simplifying the customer acquisition process but also the user's transacting experiences next slide and so this is a demo I'm not sure if it's going to work click again okay great so what we're doing here is again the single sign-on experience of creating a wallet we can do email phone number WhatsApp whatever you want um we verify that with a six digit code um oh does that work I guess we'll do it again okay that's fine next slide anyway the the point of the demo is you can log in with any form of auth Leverage Hardware enclaves to transact and also simplify the user's transacting experience with this this concept of permissions which the the demo should show you next slide no oh okay maybe that was not on me that's fine now go to just go to the last slide no previous yep okay so the takeaway um ideally posted demo which I can send to everyone here if you're interested is wallets aren't the problem our mental model of how data is written to the chain is the problem in a world where we have tons of chains users should not know ideally in my opinion and and won't know what chain they're transacting on and in order to to live in that world you probably need a new paradigm of writing data to the chain and transacting and ideally the last bullet uh this doesn't just create more and more silos and walled Gardens this is created in an interoperable way where you have a broader abstraction layer that can manage this transacting surface area next slide yeah so that's a little a bit about me if you want to get in touch and yeah feel free to reach out if you want to see the demo properly thank you so much foreign uh yeah any questions hello yes yes we're in the process of integrating with wall connect yeah wallet aggregators are key to how this interoperability works but generally you should be able to take your keys and going everywhere and so that's kind of how we think about it and we're in private beta right now I don't know if that was clear yeah this has come up a lot um we're actually working on this right now um the having the ability to eject and also go elsewhere is is extremely important and whether that's NPC to eoa or other things is kind of on our roadmap as well yeah foreign yes so I think we yeah phone number Apple WhatsApp whatever you want it's pretty trivial for us to add yes yes well idea ideally if you're able to manage all of this like intention to transact in a clean abstraction layer that doesn't involve the like vitalik's post of like my eth is all over the place and I have no way of like unifying the the networks that the youth is on that's the intention and and that's what capsule does um yeah cool hey all right I think we're done thank you ODT
