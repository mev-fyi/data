[Music] um well guys i will kick off the conversation here and there's just a lot to discuss so if you're in the audience and you're tuning in you're likely someone who has a sense of the underlying power behind blockchains at their core these things are social coordination tools there's a famous book called sapiens i'm sure you guys have read it where the author yuval harari posits that what separates human beings from other species is their ability to organize in large numbers to me that's just so cool to think about like this question around how blockchains will impact organizational behavior in the next 10 hundred thousand years now there's a key topic at the center of all this that topic is sovereignty my sense is that the look feel and meaning of what it means to be sovereign is about to completely change and i want to talk about this change the two projects that i believe take the idea of sovereignty the most seriously are cosmos and celestia and i also believe that our two guests here ethan and mustafa are two of the world's most foremost thinkers on this subject before we get into the conversation a few things for the audience there's two important reads you should note the first is written by ethan where in may he titled it the mind body and soul of cosmos we'll get into that and then the second mustafa recently just published this it's a blog post titled rollups of sovereign chains that's why he went out to biddle talked about it there the recording will be out later in the next few weeks um i'll structure this twitter space for about an hour we'll just dialogue and talk about it but there will be a q a so please write down any questions that you want to ask we'll we'll go around and you'll have an opportunity to ask these guys uh some important cues now i'll turn to ethan and mustafa this conversation it's taking place at such an interesting time the u.s sanctioned tornado cache sparking a debate on whether the ban compromises users ability to operate anonymously biology has published a network state this idea of a highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action modular blockchains are the new category attracting the boldest and most creative developers who are building an entirely different set of values compared to monolithic counterparts we're going to begin with the evolution of computing ismail dm'd me this video of a presentation that ethan was giving at hack adam and he was talking about the evolution of computing and he led up to this idea of the community computer ethan we'll start off with you can you introduce this idea of community computing and why did you call it a revolution cool uh sure yeah i mean thanks a lot for for the intro i don't know if i'm actually a foremost thinker on sovereignty though i appreciate you saying that it turns out the more i the more i study the problem the less uh it turns out i think i know about it but we can that's a i guess a later conversation the community computer idea i mean you know i reason a lot by history with by analogy with history you know history doesn't compete but it does rhyme um and so i think it's important to understand history and understand where where we're coming from and you know it has always struck me that blockchains have a place in the history of computing they're not some like thing that you know came out of nowhere even though you know people like to think about satoshi like that but you know in the in the same way that you know christ was jewish satoshi uh also had a past um in cryptography in in computing and so on and so the way i reasoned about it um you know and and the the talk i gave recently that that you were referencing i think ishmael for those slides so hopefully he's going out and uh pushing the community computer narrative too but the the framing i was using was that you know sometime in the 20th century we discovered a new substrate for computing that's the silicon microchip and and then the first thing we did with that was basically build these large mainframe computers um you know to handle the world's computing needs i mean that was that was what they were for everyone was going to have these computers in these in these you know basements of ibm or dell or wherever and that would be that and and people who thought oh computers could be smaller or more people could have computers or you know they could be more widespread or they didn't all need to be in ibm's basement like those people were ridiculed and uh you know it was thought that that didn't make any sense they wouldn't have the security they would you know it wouldn't it just wouldn't work right and of course the the mainframe isn't the type of computing that most of us are familiar with today um we had something that we call the personal computer revolution that transformed the relationship between the individual and and technology primarily by making the individual uh sovereign over their interactions their interface um their ownership of of the technology they use and these personal computers completely you know have transformed civilization over the last you know couple decades now we all have multiple of them we have them in our pockets i guess all of us here are on little baby ones um you know mobile devices and so the you know these personal computing devices really really made a big uh a big difference in our lives and but it wasn't just about the personal computer it was also about the technology that connected the different personal computers together that's the the internet essentially right and so you know reasoning by analogy i see very similar thing playing out in the world of blockchains the new substrate for computing that we've developed that's say our equivalent of the microprocessor is the consensus algorithm in some sense it's the you know blockchain uh consensus computing machinery we could say and the first thing we did with that new technology was we went out and built mainframes and we call them things like bitcoin and ethereum and and other you know global scale l1 world computing type um type networks that are you know that posit themselves as being able to support all the world's computing needs and in the same way that the mainframes of the past didn't actually serve us the way you know people might have thought the mainframes of blockchains today um you know probably also won't serve us in the way in the way people thought and what we need is the equivalent of the personal computing revolution but whereas the you know microprocessor is like a singular thing that anyone can hold in their hand and thereby you know have a personal computer built out of it the consensus processor uh is is not such an isolatable thing it's something that only comes together out of a out of a group of people or or a community and thus gives rise you know to what we're calling the community computer right and so you know reasoning by analogy the community computing revolution that stands before us on which we are you know which we're on the precipice of let's say uh stands to transform the relationship between communities and technology in the same way personal computers did between individuals and technology by giving communities more sovereignty ownership control over their technology uh and over the way that they interface with it and so you know that's that's the future we're we're building towards giving every community no matter how it's defined whether it's the community of the entire globe or the community you know that comes together for a particular you know series of twitter spaces whatever it might be um sovereignty over there over their computing machinery and that's what we call uh community computers that it's a you know it's a shared community hosted a device that represents the values of those communities and sort of gives them ownership over it mustafa over to you in the context of all this change this community competing revolution what will it mean to be sovereign how do you think about that and the evolution of that word yeah so the way i think about it is that sovereignty enables consenting groups of people or communities to enter into shared economic or contractual relationships with each other without the need for some third party or some institution to enforce the terms of those relationships now if you think about it you know throughout human history society has been pushed forward by kind of groups of people with shared goals that have assembled you know whether it's the pursuit of through the pursuit of grassroots activism or struggle or some shared innovation or culture society has been pushed forward by that uh and as you said is this what is what differentiates you know people and um from other species uh the ability to kind of assemble in large groups and um you know even this this freedom to peaceful assembly and association is you know it's a human right it's article 20 of the universal declaration of human rights but in order to fully realize that right of you know freedom of assembly and association you know groups of people need to be able to kind of create and enforce social agreements and contracts with each other that codify and enforce the rules of those relationships within the community and that's exactly what a community computer does you know you have to cut you have consensus um over over transactions uh and the validity of those transactions are determined by some predetermined set of rules that the community has agreed to agree to in a sovereign way and that allows communities to kind of have relationship relationships with each other whether it's an economic relationship or a social relationship without needing to rely on third parties like untrustworthy institutions or governments or corporations ethan do you see it the same way or do you have a different take yeah i think i i i see it quite similarly i mean i see there's there's an element of sovereignty that is about um continuity uh and you know about about being able to like constitute yourself and continue despite you know changes i mean thinking about a sovereign individual is a little a little bit different but as a community the ability for the community to define what it is and for that definition to persist uh over time despite you know internal changes by virtue of some aspect of the community that is um that is stable and in this case it could be you know the stable set of rules that define transaction execution validation et cetera that mustafa's just um referring to but you know it's also about the community being able to control that and change that over time you know i've seen a lot of the celestia writing these days talking about how fundamentally blockchains are about uh are about social consensus right and about the sovereignty of the society essentially um that is deciding on the rules that then decide on how they interact together right um and that's that's that's really the key to sovereignty that you have that kind of control and determination over over your destiny as a group rather than it being imposed on you from from outside mustafa has this saying groups of people with shared goals have an inalienable right to self-organize unburdened by the status quo and i want to go deeper on this like status quo and like the current reality i think for bitcoin the original evil uh were banks and that was the nucleus of of the energy that was antagonist and is that this is that still the the evil of today do you and you know the question to to both of you guys is what do you see as the the most prominent evil um against that dominates the status quo i'll start with ethan on this one first yeah hell yeah the banks are still evil that hasn't changed that's still important but i think i think we can go deeper um you know to frame it really simply i think about the three factors of production land labor and capital or money if you will um and i look at the institutions we have around those those three factors and and there's evil throughout all of them and in some sense they all need to be reformed um and and maybe at least the way you know i've sort of thought about it is you know we could start with money and work our way down through labor into land um but the way you know the way we've structured civil you know society around all three of those things the institutions we use to um to manage these these you know what we could call fictitious commodities none of these things are actually commodities but we treat them like they are uh you know when we empower certain institutions to govern them as if they were just commodities to be you know doled out on on the market um i think that is uh that's a profoundly evil thing to do because it's a it completely misrepresents what these things actually actually are right like land is not you know some commodity made for sale on the market it's like our inheritance of you know 15 billion years of evolution in the in the universe and what we've been granted to to live off of you know on this planet together and our labor again that's not a commodity for sale on the market that's our human life force and you know and similarly with money it's actually you know the the networks that enable us to trade and exchange and and produce and coordinate together that's also not a commodity but we treat it as such and so you know i think even with bitcoin it had a still has a quite um let's say immature conception of money and and the potential of money not not to downplay it's its importance um you know i'm i tend to be more bullish on on bitcoin than most in the sort of proof of stake world but um i think we do need to go we do need to go deeper on on the nature of money and also connect to these other issues in society it's not just about the banks so the banks are are a huge evil that we still need to reckon with but also our institutions around labor which is for instance why our company informal systems is structured as a workers cooperative right and it's a simple way to start to rebalance the the relationship between capital rule and labor and just re-empower label labor within your organizations right rather than being shareholder-based and and only representing the interests of capital sort of primarily in the structure of the company you can actually represent very directly the interests of the labor force that actually makes whatever you're doing possible and then and then from there we also need to address these problems of land i mean you know basically every case private property on land is downstream of violence or genocide right and so to kind of ignore that and and just pretend like oh yeah we can just you know inherit this this violent past uh and now just deal with everything on the market is um i think there's a deep evil there so you know i i think we still have to start at money in the banks and kind of work our way work our way down i'm not really sure how to go at the other problems kind of more more directly other than you know tweeting land value tax solves this uh everywhere i can on twitter but um yeah i'll stop there mustafa over to you the question is who or what is the evil now looks like we lost another i think we lost him here i just added him back okay miss selfie with us yeah so yeah did you did you catch the question uh yeah i think i skipped some of it because my internet was uh connection was lost um yeah so go ahead the the question is or the context is that for bitcoin the original e wall or banks who or what is the evil now yeah so i would say um this goal of sovereignty that when the cosmos and celestia envision and embody is a more is a generalization of bitcoin's goal in the sense that um i think like the like the you know the evil in this context um the evil of community the evil versus community computing is this idea of untrustworthy institutions you know institutions that have traditionally been slow you know bureaucratic untrustworthy are corrupt or prone to censorship and a bank um is an example of an untrustworthy institution but this kind of this vision of sovereign blockchains and community community community computing kind of broadens that scope to other types of untrustworthy institutions not just banks so it's kind of extending bitcoin's bitcoins uh philosophy in some to some extent ethan you've mentioned briefly in several tweets that the last couple of years about the internet and it's captured by web 2 giants like facebook and then there's this term that you brought up digital colonialism what is that give us examples of that and go just deep on on that yeah so this is this is the real evil uh is it's facebook i have i have suspicions that you know 100 years from now they're going to be teaching about uh you know history of corporations and they'll teach you about facebook the way we you know we talk about like the uh dutch east india company or any of these other like early colonialist companies um and and and this relates to uh this relates to you know the factors of production we don't go into that that whole analysis but i think the the digital colonialism i mean it's such a tragedy what's happened with with the internet because something that emerged you know to be uh you know to enable sovereignty and to empower individuals and this new relationship with with technology has just been like completely um transformed into this monster that has instead empowered a very small number of of you know unaccountable mega corps that now basically govern the internet and huge aspects of our lives and and facebook is probably the worst among these in the sense that the whole company is designed in a way to to hijack your nervous system um and and to basically for lack of a better word enslave your nervous system to their algorithms uh and that's a very that's a very evil thing um to do and you know facebook is is in some sense trying to coll you know colonializing uh digital spaces uh it's doing it a bit more literally in certain you know geographic areas where you know they're providing internet access but the only the only thing you can access is facebook related um facebook related services and so you know i see this as this um you know monopolization or colonialization of digital space happening in a very aggressive underhanded uh in in some cases even you know uh very directly evil way that they are are trying to conquer and build basically an empire in our um in our digital lands the way that you know previous colonies and colonial empires tried to conquer um you know physical lands and enslave people physically it's difficult to you know it's difficult to make analogies with like real human slavery because that's just the you know the most the most tragic of all possible uh oppressions probably but you know the facebook colonialization is so insiduous we don't even real you can't even necessarily detect it it's happening at a different spatial temporal scale but uh you know it's our people are already aware of the impact it's having on the minds of the younger generation uh you know they're being brought up with a completely different relationship with technology it's something they're not really sovereign over so something that you know was initially sovereignty their relationship with their you know the personal devices like you know hackers in the in the 90s or whatever has been has been morphed into this you know consumption based advertising based um economy that that really makes the individual a subject of of the mega corp and so uh you know there's a lot lots more to say on that i haven't really been studying the problem in detail recently but it's a very scary dangerous thing that facebook is up to um i'm hoping lena khan is just going to blow them up so that's um what's it called that organization in the department of ftc or something in the u.s that does like antitrust and stuff so it seems like that we're we're on the verge of a new era of antitrust in the u.s which is like one of the only seemingly good regulatory things i think that the us government might be up to in contrast to some of the other stuff we'll probably talk about with tornado cache and so on but um i find it a bit weird to find myself aligned with the us government on certain things but um you know i hope to see facebook broken up and uh that's like the one thing facebook was the one thing i was afraid of um for a long time the uh and their impact on the world and on on kids especially and what that'll do to the next generation's ability to you know to dialogue and discourse and you know maintain good relationships with one another and i think we're already seeing the impact of that huge negative impact of that so yeah my next question was how can we alleviate ourselves from digital colonialism i'll kick the that question over to mustafa but also mustafa if you want to build on top of what ethan just said go for it yeah so it's interesting because you know when the internet first came about and you know started to kind of first gain traction in the 90s and it was never like it was meant to be decentralized like it was never meant to be decentralized like in the 90s there wasn't these huge social media platforms of course people were just interacting on these you know bulletin boards there was lots of bulletin boards um and even in the early 2000s uh you know it was like people had their own blogs there was a lot there was all these little forums communities had all of these forums you know but if you remember back in the day um was never like this kind of like we had these massive social media you know corporations where but nowadays instead of everyone having you know their own community websites or blogs or forums um or like even with chat rooms internet relay chats which was like a distributed chat room system rather than just using things like facebook messenger or msn so and then in you know in the in the mid 2000s when there was like a whole spate of there's quite a lot of you know uh vc funding for you know web 2.0 type stuff you had this you had this pendulum swim pendulum swing from you know the decentralization of internet services in the 90s and early 2000s swang to a more centralized state with these massive corporations like you know facebook and twitter but now we're having the pendulum swing back the other way and thanks to web3 um you know with you know of course you have blocks yeah of course you know blockchain can help to solve this and now you have more distributed you know social media platfor uh logging platforms like mirror and so on and so forth so i think you know web3 is kind of like a natural reaction to the centralization that has occurred in web 2 and the pendulum is now swinging back in the other way to more decentralization and away from digital colonialism i want to shift topics but before i do ethan any comment on what mustafa said yeah i mean i i fully agree i would just caution us um to not take it for granted because we're going to see the same type of forces in in web 3 that you know are going to push for centralizing tendencies um that we saw in the internet and in in you know both cases it's it's downstream of perverse venture capital incentives so you know not to uh not to poop on them on the vcs too much but you know they're culpable for a lot of the for a lot of the issues here just from you know the lack of foresight i think in the sort of you know short-term i mean it's funny because vcs are considered like long-term thinkers like disrupting industries but um you know i don't think they've really thought through the like larger scale social consequences of those um of those disruptions and certainly web 2 has done a lot of damage uh and i think there's there's real risk of the same thing kind of happening you know there's a bit of like a decentralization theater going on and and we need to be careful that you know we don't get the same kinds of monopolistic uh you know winner take all kind of tendencies and and that's been a huge part of um of the drive behind cosmos and and the cosmos mission and rejection of like you know a singular rent-seeking token that everyone has to use otherwise they can't access the value we're producing because we want to push back about that and we want to actually empower communities on their own terms um and and you know that's uh that's a strange thing to sell as an investment thesis but you know i'm not here to make people rich we're here to you know we're here to change the world so yeah mustafa question for you why do you refer to blockchains as top level social contracts yeah so um you know before blockchains if you wanted to kind of like have a shared contract or some kind of organization among a large group of people let's say like hundreds of or thousands of people the only way you could really practically do that before blockchains is to you know start a company or organization or some kind of foundation or association under you know the law of a state or jurisdiction you know like for example if you start you know a company in the us that's that's governed by corporate law and the state that you're incorporating incorporating it in and so and then and then if you keep going up the stack you have to ask okay what gives what gives that organization authority that who enforces the rules in that organization like every organization or company you know has a statute statutes which got which which govern you know the rules of that company organization and this that company is given authority by the law and whether the law gets get its authority from it gets authorities authority from for example like parliament or congress and you know where does parliament or congress get authority its authority from um ultimately um it gets authority it's from the constitution or the people um if people tomorrow if everyone in the u.s or the uk or whatever country for example tonight tomorrow that all of a sudden um actually our our uh elected officials no longer have authority and we're not gonna we're not gonna follow uh the rules that they said there's nothing like there's nothing you can do about that that will happen and you know that's happened before in the form of revolutions for example and so in this case like in in the context of a jurisdiction uh like the uh a constitution of a country or the social contracts among its people are what i described as a top-level social contract so for example you could say like in the context of a country a top level the top-level social contract of a specific country is that congress has authority or parliament has authority to set to laws if no one like people have to agree that people like people have to agree to that otherwise it doesn't have it doesn't mean anything like congress just creates pieces of paper those pieces of paper have meaning because people agree it has meaning but blockchains for the first time allow you to create decentralized autonomous organizations or companies or organizations that for the first time um can have rules enforced without relying on uh on the social contracts of people in a nation-state instead uh because these the rules in the blockchain are enforced by a an international computer network and enforced by cryptography and crypto economics uh you can for the first time in history have um a decentralized autonomous organization and have you know a country some kind of economic or social contract with a large group of people without having that contract needing to be enforced by traditional law and that's the and what i mean by top level and and these blockchains only have value because people agree it has value the community of that blockchain has value um it's the same question as like what fork of ethereum is the real fork like what's what what actually which fork of ethereum gets the east turkey thicker like if i fork ethereum right now if no one cares about my fork then that's not the real ethereum that's just my fork epithelium uh so people agree that the current uh chain of ethereum where current fork ethereum has value because people agree that each token has value or the the the transactions on that chain are the real transactions that have that value and that is a that is a top-level social contract that this is that we that the the community of ethereum agrees this is the correct chain and this is what i mean by top-level social contract it's a social contract that does not derive its authority from any higher authority it's a top-level contract ethan any thoughts or a reaction to this idea of blockchains being a top-level social contract no i love it um i i love this idea of like you know uh an authority with no with no higher authority um because it reeks of like religious sentiment and you know religion and higher authorities have played a huge role in in uh you know in organizing large groups of people this unique uniquely human thing where we're talking about um you know it's a it's a it's a kind of binding agent you know religion actually the word religion comes from the word to bind um and and blockchains are another kind of binding agent right uh they they bind us together in these in these kind of new ways that allow us to collectively do things differently um and to follow our own authority and that's the that's the the sort of heart of of sovereignty right you're not uh you're not bowing to any any higher authority you're you're sovereign over yourself you're bound together under under your own terms uh and that you know the potential power of that is just is just incredible so um yeah if i may before we get a little into the technical part of the discussion i want to get a bit personal like why does sovereignty why is it such a big deal for you guys personally um if you can go a little bit deeper and and share like why it's like a personal matter uh ethan we'll start with you i know when i first talked to you like some of the the original stories of like how you thought in high school and and that really stuck out to me but the question is why is sovereignty such a big deal for you personally what's your response ethan yeah i mean i don't have like some personal story of oppression that i'm like you know rallying uh rallying back from and and so you know therefore therefore sovereignty it's it's a more um you know i guess intellectual or emotional um resonance with with the concept i think on a few fronts one you know uh so let's see there's there's let's say a historical a historical front for this a current front for this and then an intellectual front so we'll cover all three so that so the historical front it looks to me like you know historically uh humans have been sort of marching along this path of like greater representation um you know which which is another another way of saying greater greater sovereignty for certain groups of people right so moving from the work from a world of empires towards the world of nation states was very much about you know groups of people being able to declare and you know satisfy uh their sovereignty as you know the nation of france or the nation of you know germany rather than being part of some like larger um larger empire or or kingdom or so on so i think there is a a very real historical trajectory where um you know at some point the the the larger sovereign becomes you know uh fails to sufficiently represent the complexity of the underlying citizenry and so the citizens demand some greater you know improved representation and more sovereignty over their own lives it's not just coming down coming down from on high and i think we're on the cusp of another such you know transformation the last one you know maybe started some 200 years ago when when the sort of current nation states were were really being formulated in the legal structures of you know national labor markets and you know corporations and all this stuff was sort of put down in the early mid like 19th century i think we're on the cost of something similar except now instead of defining the nation state i think we're talking about defining network and city states and i think the the city-state component of it is is actually quite important because we are you know cities are where most people live and we are you know local biophysical human beings that need to like get food delivered to our mouths um at least for now you can't you can't feed yourself in the metaverse yet um you know i can't tell people are laughing at my stupid joke so i feel a little bit awkward when i can't when i can't hear the audience but i'll just uh just laugh to myself and hope that uh hope that covers for everyone but uh yeah so um so i think that the you know the city state this sort of historical trajectory i think is um is really important i see that as a you know uh evolution towards you know greater expression um of sovereignty so that's the sort of historical side then on the current side you know you just look around and you look at how little control people have over their over their lives and you know how little control communities have over their lives like across the world they're subject to all these like you know unfair terms of you know pretty much dictated by large multinational corporations and and governments that just plainly don't have their best interests at heart and it just like hurts to see that everywhere and so that you don't have this yearning desire to see communities be able to to take more responsibility for themselves and and that means more sovereignty and then and then lastly there's a you know there's an information theoretic or you could call it a thermodynamic argument um you know this is sort of for my background in in biophysics and trying to understand what does it mean to be a sustainable system in the universe that's always running down right so you have the second law of thermodynamics your coffee cup cools you know the the glass breaks like it's always entropy is always increasing so they say and yet we have these like emergent emergent systems you know human beings life organisms ecosystems forests that that spring up and sustain themselves despite the fact that they're in this like you know aggressive destructive uh universe and and why is that why are they able to do that and it has something to do with their ability to uh represent their environment locally uh and and the signals that drive them in in a local way and and sort of encode within themselves effectively information about about their world and about what's important to them to them essentially right and so i sort of take that up to a more uh geopolitical kind of level thinking about you know what does it mean for or socioeconomic level what does it mean for economies to be sustainable systems and to you know better represent uh the world and and you know the their social and biophysical reality internally in the um in the economic structure and that requires a greater degree of sovereignty so that you can have more local representation of of the world and so i actually see you know you know sovereign greater sovereignty is a sort of key to uh you know the sustainability of the species and the planet same question mustafa why is sovereignty such a personal matter yeah i wouldn't say like i have um some personal story of oppression either even though you know i was i was born in iraq and i i moved to the uk before the u.s invasion occurred and um when i was a teenager in 1516 i became involved with various hacking groups and hacktivism and uh you know we hacked into various you know corporations and governmental organizations and you know one of one of our one of the organizations that we had for example was this u.s military contractor called hp gray federal and you know from the from the emails we discovered i we discovered that um they had these contracts for the us government to do things like um like uh develop azure serving software to create lots of like fake social media accounts and develop malware and stuff like that so i kind of like beca i kind of like became aware from every early stage of the lack of transparency and the the power that these kind of like large monolithic institutions have like whether it's some like large untransparent nation state or or corporation there's a lot of like um non-transparent power that happens behind behind the scenes that can affect people uh ordinary people in a deep way and um you know when we were doing when we were hacking all these corporations and organizations um you know i was just you know a teenager and uh it's all public now i was arrested for it and stuff and i was as a teenager but you know all i had you know i was hacking into these organizations and all i had was you know cheap 300 laptop so so i kind of became aware that and and all and you know i was communicating to other hackers and people on these these distributed online chat rooms so then i can i kind of became uh aware of the power of like of grassroots movements or sovereign communities to be able to kind of organize against um like large institutions in a kind of like david vs goliath way they can kind of uh like transcend the bell curve of power and kind of distribute power back to themselves and i think um kind of crypto and blockchain uh very much embodies uh similar ideals because it allows you to allow people to transact and have relationships with each other without kind of being burdened by untrustworthy institutions or middlemen or third parties shifting gears here let's talk about tornado cash recently sanctioned by the us government due to its privacy capabilities the question that i want to ask is where does the need for privacy with blockchains fit in and how will it take place given this precedent and really i just want to get your guys's point of view on the whole situation ethan we'll start with you yeah i mean this is a pretty dangerous situation here um you know they sanctioned a piece of code there's a you know a guy's in jail for writing open source code i guess we still don't know all the all the details of that story but um it doesn't look good you know by private privacy is a human right i mean it's a pretty fundamental fundamental thing and you know there's a there's a you know free speech component of all of this that you know people are just you could print this code on a t-shirt you're going to arrest someone for making a t-shirt with you know some letters on it i mean this is we our our ancestors so to speak fought this war in the 90s you know the so-called um crypto war and they won on the surface and you know the state sort of went went behind everyone's back and went into you know the metadata and all this other other surveillance technology uh and and it looks like we're gonna have to fight this war again but it's but you know the privacy technologies is absolutely critical fundamental um defense against just you know authoritarianism and and oppression and it's it's completely critical and it's it's a little bit of a shame that it's not more fundamentally built into our um to our technology stack i think you know with what's happening there's going to be greater effort to do that it's coming there's been huge evolution obviously over the last few years in you know huge advancements in zero knowledge tech and um you know there's much more mature libraries now and stuff so i think we'll see it you know quite uh rapidly adopted into things i think it is um it is pretty critical that that it does be it does become sort of baseline default you know privacy by default in all of these systems mustafa over to you yeah i mean it's definitely a shame that's uh so far like crypto has been kind of the opposite of of privacy and it's you know it's kind of like it's a non-private version of cash in in a sense and you know that's something that people need to take more seriously uh because it's definitely the case like privacy could limit sovereignty to some extent if communities feel comfortable organized in a solving way if um you know for example like a state could sanction them for example before i move on any other thoughts on this ethan as it relates to tornado cache hey is there a message you want to get across around this yeah i mean i think the as far as i know the coin center team is doing great work on on actually going to bat for this one um and challenging you know these the the sanctions on on the address i don't know what they're going to be able to do about um you know arresting developers for open source code but we do need we do need to push back against this um i don't exactly know how i'm still sort of catching up on the you know the the state of um of this battle but it's uh it's an important one and you know this is just the first shot fired really i mean this is going to be this will be years um this fight so it's not just going to be about tornado cash but you know it's a much bigger um much bigger challenge ahead i mean the irs just hired what 87 000 enforcement agents like that's what and it's not like we're all here trying to evade taxes or something but you know the state's going to throw everything they've got at this thing just to just to uh preserve their sovereignty in a sense because they know it's being challenged from from the bottom and you know uh i uh i'd like to find ways to work with the existing states and and you know gracefully deleverage them is is is the term i use um you know so that so that we don't all have to go to war with each other physically but um yeah it's certainly dangerous uncertain times and so you know everyone needs to be extra careful and cautious but you know we also we also need to defend these you know basic rights mustafa any final thoughts on tornado cash before we move on yeah i mean one other thing i would add is um when people kind of learn about sovereignty and like one kind of natural criticism of it is that well like if um anyone can kind of solve anyone can create a kind of group any kind of group can stuff organize then you know what if bad groups of people self-organize you know how to deal with that and i think like my answer to that in general is um as i said like my kind of vision is groups of people should be able to self-organize without being burdened by the status quo and and the the without the status quo part is important because it means that uh if people self-organize you can't one group of people can't impose their status quo over someone else so like for example if you know if a violent or you know a terrorist group self organizes for example um they should not be able to um kind of impose their status quo over someone else because those people can also self-organize or have their own sovereign community and so my general philosophy is um the answer to oppression is not more oppression but more libertarian liberty and technologies technologies that liberate people let's get a little technical for those folks that are just learning about sovereign blockchains ethan can you tell us what the essence of a sovereign blockchain is and why it matters sure i mean it's it's the community computer right so it's um it has the same relationship to ethereum as your you know laptop does to the mainframe at you know the ibm headquarters um the crux of it is is the community that's building the application uh has end-to-end responsibility for the whole stack from the whole computing machinery right so that means they they assemble their own validator set they run the consensus themselves they have complete control end to end um over over the infrastructure and the application there and they're completely sovereign over it and over the terms on which they decide to interface and interconnect with you know all the other uh sovereign chains or other applications out there so it's really just about you know complete control end to end of the stack and and being able to you know customize it and use it to represent you know fully the values of that community without making any compromises that you know they don't they don't actively want to make right so it's really about um you know enabling a community to express their own values to the fullest extent within both the infrastructure and application that they're running mustafa what are sovereign roll-ups and how do they compare against sovereign l1 chains yeah so um a roll-up is just a blockchain without its own validated set and it's basically a role of just a blockchain that posts its blocks to a different blockchain and because it posts it's blocked to a different blockchain that other blockchain actually um can uh order its blocks and so that other blockchain gives it consensus over these blocks and because because of that um you can now you can create your own chain without any validator set because instead of having to have a valid set to order your order the transactions you just post the transactions or blocks to some um data layer like the celestia and that data layer will automatically undo those blocks and uh it's not it's it's sovereign because unlike ethereum roll-ups where ethereum roll-ups are basically like baby chains or l2s to ethereum that kind of enshrine ethereum as a settlement layer there's a smart contract on the ethereum which defines what the roll-up is a sovereign roll-up is not defined by the l1 instead the sovereign roll-up is defined by the communi the peer-to-peer network or the community of that of that roll-up not some smart contract on the layout one it's just using the data layer um as a data availability and consensus layer not as like an enshrined settlement layer and so what this allows you to do is it allows you to create um like sovereign independent blockchains without the overhead of having to bootstrap your own consensus network um or validate a set as as you would typically do if you were to deploy a cost monster now that does mean like the the the main trade-off there is um you don't get sovereignty over the ordering of your transactions uh well necessarily uh or blocks depending if you're rolling with a sequencer or not but you still get full sovereignty over the actual rules of of your roll-up or community computer and you also get um this idea of shared security is because you're you have um your role up is sharing or inheriting security from from the selection date later let's talk a bit about governance so sovereign blockchains are about providing communities with autonomy to make decisions common forms of governance include token voting and off chain social consensus what are the trade-offs between them and what are some of the other ways to set up governance around blockchains ethan your thoughts yeah um well there's so at the end of the day um you know off-chain consensus always rules um it is the you know like we've been saying the sort of highest authority in some sense um and and and it has it has a sort of power over over the network that you can never really encode because at the end of the day you know you can pull pull cables out of the wall and humans have to have to decide things for the for themselves um there is certainly within the blockchain space a drive for some form you know some level of government on chain governance minimization um which is you know positioned as a way to reduce the risk of capture which is a very you know very real very concerning thing that we see in political systems all around us um you know where money can just basically buy votes and that's and and that's a big concern and that exists that exists on chain as well so obviously you know bitcoin has and ethereum have both um resisted pretty heavily any any kind of push to have on chain governance they want to do it all completely off chain uh which which is you know very respectable and and appropriate at certain levels um you know we've taken another approach which is you know uh going back to these problems of sovereignty and representing stakeholders in the state machines that that organize them um of giving more direct uh say representation within the state machine itself so with on-chain on-chain voting to the stakeholders in in the base case that's just you know the coin holders and you know and what they have staked and and cosmos chains are somewhat famous in in blockchain um you know communities for having such active governance turnout and participation which is which is kind of amazing to see so you know on the one hand there are real risks of um you know uh being able to vote just based on based on your stake like that's not it doesn't necessarily make for the best form of governance but on the other hand there's a way for for anyone in the community to really actively you know express and and and participate and i think you know this is just sort of phase one of on-chain governance and there's a lot further to go in involving let's say the stakeholder representation because there are more stakeholders in the system than just you know represented by um out there to there to a validator or whatever and so you know i'm looking forward to seeing a lot more innovation in in representation in in the forms of voting used in setting up the houses or things like sort of optimism is doing um there's there's a lot of potential there and obviously there's a long history of you know human societies exploring different um governance procedures and and voting systems and so on and so you know i think we're sort of just beginning to beginning that in in the blockchain space mustafa your take yeah so i'll say this quote by uh david clarke uh like an early internet pioneer uh which says uh we we reject king's presidency on voting we believe in rough consensus and running code and that's something that i very much kind of buy into and i think you know uh own chain governance you know like by unj inverting is is kind of okay from a practical perspective for some like technical parameters you know things like maybe like um the block size or blocking double but for kind of like more major architectural changes in the blockchain uh it's better to refer to off-chain uh governance and this we've seen this has worked relatively kind of well for ethereum you know like no one is opposing the ethereum proof of stake upgrade for example and that's because you know since ethereum was created you know almost there less than 10 years ago um it's always been part of the ethereum roadmap that they will eventually drop proof of work and push to proof of stake and so that's kind of always been the kind of part the social consensus of ethereum that it was always going to switch to proof of stake and that's why now ethereum is switching from a mistake without any kind of without any significant controversy or pushback and it's a relatively non-controversial hard fork one other technical question and then we'll we'll make our way in toward towards the q a i got this question from john charbonneau at delphi can we compare and contrast sovereignty of a traditional l1 for example a cosmo zone to that of a sovereign roll-up including practical implications due to complexities around bridging introduced by sovereign roll-ups ethan your thoughts yes i haven't i haven't thought through uh in in too much detail all of you know the complexities of of sovereign roll-ups i think um mustafa touched on a few a few of the um a few of the trade-offs um i think they are there there's a lot of similarities but you know essentially like what a what a sovereign chain gives you is end-to-end integration of all of the pieces under one roof right and and with a sovereign roll up you are outsourcing you know some aspects of it in the case of celestia you could say that you know data availability and consensus um and it may make sense to outsource that and and it's not you know i get maybe it's not clear today what the consequences of doing that might might be it's certainly going to be a lot easier to bootstrap um and and get your thing off the ground and potentially transition if you need it to you know the let's say end-to-end sovereignty of a chain um you know further i don't i i don't know what what terminology to use to distinguish um you know solve and roll up from sovereign chain because because i know people also like to say rollups are just blockchains too um so we have to we have to work on our terminology there but um maybe mustafa has a more full answer here go for it mustafa yeah i mean um i think that's kind of like two sets of trade-offs the first of which as we already said uh a soviet roll-up does not have sovereignty over the transaction or block ordering um and and and so yeah the implications of that i think for most use cases there's no implications because i think uh for most kind of sovereign chains um they don't need something they're not really doing anything particularly sovereignty over their consensus uh they rather need sovereignty over the state machine or which is what their actual community computer is but for some use cases which i think is not the norm you might want to do something special like in in uh in the consensus algorithm um you know for example like us as moses does this this threshold encryption and decryption thing on a consensus level to prevent mev and but i would say like for most use cases uh sovereignty over the state machine is is kind of like the full sovereignty that they effectively need but uh the other trade-off is um with with with celestia yeah it depends on like how many valets you expecting to have so the kind of the overall version of celestia is to uh like it's envisioning a a a internet of blockchains or cosmos with potentially millions of cosmos students if you have a world with millions of cosmos zones it's just not secure for all of those zones to have their own fragmented validator set like imagine if a smaller community wanted to create a cosmos zone and there's just you know like three or four valley areas you can't you can't really have secure ibc connections between chains because uh because the fact that the valid assets are fragmented if a cosmos zone has very few validators that can easily that doesn't have much economic security they can easily be taken over that doesn't give you much um kind of economic security of secure bridging but if those chains share a data in the layer like celestia then you can have shared security among those chains because you don't need to rely on this committee or validator-based assumption for bridging instead you just need to rely on fraud troops or zk proofs to prove that the chain is correct rather than assuming that a honest majority of that chain is correct which might not be a sound assumption if that chain does not have a lot of economic value on it before i ask my final question ethan any final thoughts on this subject or this topic yeah i think that that's all it's all accurate i mean the only thing i'm starting to push for um is reasoning more in terms of political economic security rather than just economic security which is probably you know a blasphemous thing to say uh somewhat but i think it's um i think it's important to the future that we we think about these things not just entirely secured by by pure economics but there is you know there is a greater um sort of human and political element of of the security as well that's very difficult to reason about no doubt i'm not sure how we you know how we would formalize it but um it's a direction i'd like to see the whole space move in a little bit especially when we're talking about um what we're talking about these smaller uh smaller community computers where where there are these these kinds of concerns and and it could be that you know it maybe it doesn't make sense and the best thing for them is to use um celestia and a data availability layer that just sort of takes care of the problem in a kind of straightforward kind of amazing way um but i would still push for for people to you know expand just from pure economic reasoning to political reasoning because it's there anyway whether whether you like it or not the politics of each chain actually matters to reasoning about the security in a way that's not just captured by the economics so yeah we are about to go into q a so if you're in the audience please gather your questions we will conclude with vision uh for the dialogue celestia and cosmos how are their visions similar and then how are they dissimilar ethan we'll start with you yeah i mean i think they're uh extremely aligned projects i mean in some sense so if you think about you know the core values of cosmos were sovereignty and interoperability and you know uh that that basically boils down to app chains on the one hand and like ibc on the other and if you think about like the end game for both of the for each of those two things the end game for app chains is like have billions of them and make it as easy as possible to launch them and that's basically like what celestia is up to and then the end game of ibc at least one way i think about it is like be able to run tendermint itself over ibc like ibc be so powerful and generic and easy to use that you could actually implement a consensus protocol using ibc as the as the transport layer which is something no one's really working on just yet but you know we'd like to do in the future so um i think in some sense celestia is like a realization of the ultimate um you know and and end game of um of cosmos and actually i don't know how well this is known but one of the early iterations you know when we were iterating on on cosmos we had this idea of what we were calling supertanker at the time um which is very similar to what what celestia is now except we didn't have data availability proofs um so we didn't know how to solve that piece of the puzzle and so we moved on to you know the cosmos hub and spoke kind of um kind of architecture there but uh you know certainly glad celestia has come along and and solved that that big hole in the puzzle and is going to make app chains you know unbelievably easy to deploy before we go to mustafa obviously it seems like a lot of similarities but any dissimilarities that come to mind any dissimilarities um well i mean there's obviously a difference in emphasis between the um the sovereign chain and and you know the sovereign roll up but um the projects feel so so aligned i mean celestia is built using a lot of the you know the cosmos stack and is really sort of pushing the cosmos vision you know to a new frontier um you know i think there's there's there's differences in you know in roll-ups and and chains but i think we very much um you know very much acknowledge and and respect both sort of sides of that and celestia itself as a chain is sort of you know a cosmos based chain so i don't know if um you know per se there are differences or if it's just like you know we're filling in together we're filling in the spectrum of of possibilities that neither you know neither team could sort of do alone i guess um is maybe the way to frame it the sofa over to you finally similarities and dissimilarities between the visions of cosmos and celestia yeah that's totally accurate i don't really i don't really have much to add to that um i think like the high level versions are similar um yeah i definitely see celestia as a kind of extension uh to fully realize in the cosmos vision rather than like a juxtaposition position to it but as a result of extending that vision there's some technical dissimilarities and that mainly revolves around celestia has less of a kind of uh reliance on trying to rely on committee-based assumptions you know for example where ibc relies on uh honest majority of ballet assets uh to to for secure bridging uh celestial we want to kind of try to eliminate um as many community based or honest majority assumptions uh as possible for the safety of the system at minimum all right we are now taking questions so if you have a question uh please raise your hand and uh we'll go from there so our first question speaker barton i think you're connected go for it what's happening um i'm exploring the uses of uh ibc and uh critical infrastructure specifically around smart grid and coordination in energy markets and so there too is very sort of a political value pluralistic process i was wondering uh as one of the choices of communities uh to have a private permission chain let's say under a threat model of uh sort of adversaries attacking your energy grid have you seen any applications of celestia or cosmos to where some chains are completely private and there are genes that sort of connect the public ibc to allow for exchange or value to take place yeah i think you can i mean you can build a private chain i believe in either either case uh on celestia you're just you're just publishing the data but you get the data availability but maybe it maybe it's less relevant there than than running um a private sort of full chain i think we've definitely seen a number of um of folks i mean we don't even know who's running them we've heard a little bit about um private chains for these these kinds of applications so it certainly is certainly doable the question then with ibc and connecting to the rest of the network is a little bit more um a little bit more hairy depending on you know the assets and the kind of interactions you're expecting to have with the rest of the network but you know that would you'd really have to drill in on the on the use case well like by private here do you mean privacy preserving or do you just mean like this essential sequencer uh permissions and possibly having sort of its own validator set that's you know specific to uh operation in the field sort of let's say sort of data availability happening close to renewable resources uh yeah and basically the question also like is there anything fundamental about permissionless or like uh uh open uh chain for security purposes yeah i mean i guess if if it's a permission chain um yeah i mean it's kind of funny right because i remember a few years ago there was this kind of like big thing about like ibm trying to do enterprise chains uh using hyperledger and like finger for like supply chain management stuff like that but in a lot of use cases it's like who are the validators uh it doesn't really like there's no natural choice of who this value is should be in the chain so it's like you end up with like three valdez or something run by three different people uh in those kind of use cases like a roll up with a centralized sequencer makes more sense uh or centralized setup sequences makes more sense if you're trying to do a permission chain where there's like a some consortium or a sequencer decides um what gets included but you still get the transparency and safety of a roll-up because anyone can or can best because because of the fact that the chain has different ability anyone can audit it to see that the sequencer did its job correctly thank you for that a priority your turn hey thank you for having me on um just curious how both ethan and mustafa think about incentivizing building applications that are not necessarily related to defy or nfts just as we've seen with um the general public a lot of the shelling point for interest in cryptocurrencies is this financial component uh related to tokens and there have been some restrictions with scalability into building social applications but going forward a lot of these scalability restrictions will be removed as bottlenecks and so how do we think about incentivizing builders creators community members to start thinking about maybe social applications or other use cases for blockchains aside from just defy and nft trading i mean it's a difficult one um because the there's not that many successful non-financial applications of blockchains yet um like a lot of yeah i mean um fundamentally like a lot of applications on blockchains are economic because that's what blockchains allow you to do it allows you to create economic relationships to people because um it doesn't allow you to kind of like um enforce like physical physical kind of contracts yet but i mean i guess like some use case like i don't know if you would consider like ens for example a d5 application or not but it's still financial to some extent because like a um a domain name is an asset so i could definitely see like applications of blockchains that are based on assets but not necessarily defy based you know like domain names are an example of that or you could have like reputation reputation systems you know there's things like uh bitcoin passport for example and or proof of humanity which are interesting systems that kind of allow you to do things like proof of personhood uh kind of like a alternative identity identities identity systems independent of the state i guess those aren't financial and in more general more generally i can definitely see um blockchains being used but for by governance and not necessarily being financial like if you have an association or or company or or company or organization you can imagine like the the board meetings or the general meetings of the organization the decisions being inverted on transparently on a verifiable ledger or or a roll-up or a chain for example rather than in an unverifiable way i'll just go quickly i mean one way i think about blockchains is the sort of natural evolution of um fault tolerant databases from the single stakeholder to the multi-stakeholder domain so going from you know a fault tolerant database run by a single entity to a fault tolerant database run by multiple entities and then you're asking you know what are the what are the use cases of that and and ultimately they could be they could be anything obviously we're finding product market fit with um with you know finance i think i believe that one of the you know the pinnacles of multi-stakeholder applications is money itself and that money is actually the killer app um of blockchains but we haven't even begun to to really do that i mean i think like the monetary economics of blockchain people is still like very repressed and and the development has been arrested so i think there's there's still a lot of work to do there but i ultimately see it happening through um working with cities i mean if if we're serious about this sort of city-state revolution and municipal sovereignty and things like that i see you know cities adopt blockchains as sort of a major a major phase in its adoption curve and in evolution and and using them to do more participatory budgeting with with the citizens and and governance related things and ultimately issuing and managing their own um their own currencies um so that's that's kind of the direction i'm i'm pushing um at least ron your turn well guys thank you for having me on i should have a quick question i'm curious what what kind of communities do you believe are going to be like the low-hanging fruit for celestia uh that you think might be the ideal targets yeah so i think um like any kind of dao that's not necessarily a d5 protocol um could like naturally uh you slash there so for example you know there's various uh kind of like grassroots activism dials on uh juice box you know it was like you know things like constitution dial or assailants down you know for example like assange's job was a dial to kind of raise money for children's largest legal campaign that raised 50 million um i think her of those dials um could potentially be a better fit for celestia because they kind of embody this kind of grassroots kind of sovereign uh activism ideals but uh in a long time it's kind of like really hard to say what um like the mass adoption case or use cases could be because because there's so many potential uh use cases even like um i also think things like gaming and nfts are very natural fit for application specific roll-ups solvent roll-ups simply because like gaming applications or or gaming assets or nfts they don't require a high frequency of compressibility with other smart contracts unlike d5 for example um you don't need you don't need like a single settlement player to you know trade a fees for example like unlike you know d5 tokens which have which you have to interact with with dexes and stuff like that but in the long term um yes so i mentioned i just mentioned two potential use cases but in the long term as i said um there's divided by variety of use cases and in long term it could be the case that just like every kind of community or organization has its own you know slack server or discord server it's possible that every community organization has its own like dao or you know roll-up chain that kind of manages the members of the organization and attracts value and assets a few more questions and we'll wrap up steph your turn okay i'll try to keep this quick because i have one question and then just go kind of more as the as the conversation so the the well i have a question in a statement the what do you see as the multiple like the or the the i don't know the easiest barriers to adoption or what is the the friction right because cosmos isn't isn't isn't new not that people don't use it however celestia is is is new and the what i find a lot from the technical perspective is that there's a lot of talk about the what this unlocks what are the possibilities right however the people as the end users and facebook was one of the things that was talked about no one cares like they know it's bad right however it's a lot easier to just sign in with facebook signing with facebook give them all of my information now do they own that then yeah however it's still happening even you can sign in to twitter with facebook right so uh what do you see from that side and then i want to make a comment just on the colonialism and the land grab piece of it which uh yeah that's a that's a really touchy subject and probably why i don't get uh not able to talk in a lot of tech spaces because it's just it's so uncomfortable to hear right like as the descendants of at least just slaves in america that it is a a tough thing when we're talking about equating these two things as apples to apples and it's it's really just not that especially when we're talking about what are what are what are true evils so that's my question in my statement so can you uh repeat your first question again if i don't sign yeah my question yeah so yes it got lost in my statement so the question is about the friction and the barriers to entry because a lot of the when when the tech is presented it is these are this is what it unlocks right even the pictures are my chain right you know you can do this it's modular block chains right however once you say you grasp that concept then people don't really care they're still using facebook right so i mean from a purely category yeah from a purely kind of pragmatic perspective you're right the question is why should i create my own chain like so far we've we've been kind of talking about like the political or social political reasons why you might want to do that but like in the long term like most developers might not care about that so i kind of like um realize that you need good you need a good practical reason for why that's useful and in our case um we believe that if we make it as easy for people to deploy their own chain as it is to deploy a smart contract then deploying a your own chain is will be a superior technical solution to creating a decentralized application uh for several reasons uh the biggest of which is scalability and when you have your own roll-up you're not sharing the same execution resources as other applications so if you if you use ethereum right now and you're sharing gas you're sharing execution with every other application and that's why gas fees are so high and that's why people have to move through roll-ups so you know so roll-ups helped you to scale because you're basically sharding the you effectively have your own um kind of rot your chain with its own execution resources and the second thing is that kind of the reason why sovereignty is interesting from a technical perspective is that it gives developers you know freedom over their own execution environment and that's um fundamentally it potentially allows them to create a better product um both from a developer user experience perspective and a scalability perspective uh and um that's uh yeah just it's just like people most developers these days would rather create their own virtual machine on ec2 rather than using some shared web hosting provider like dream host for example because the ec2 instance you can install whatever you want on that and a software roll-up enables the same thing so it's just it's just a superior developer experience that allows you to create a better product thanks one final question oh sorry ethan go ahead well i just wanted to i i didn't catch the name of the previous question asking but there was a second part of her um of the uh question or there was a comment that i just i just want to appreciate you sharing that because i know that it's difficult and i should be more careful with the language so you know thanks for thanks for calling that out and um you know i'm not going to make any any excuses so just um i just want to thank you okay so we are near time here um we'll go to closing statements ethan thank you so much for you know hopping on here and just giving us your point of view is there any parting wisdom message anything that you want to share before we take off yeah just that this is the community computer revolution um you know and and what we do with it is on us and let's not make the same mistakes that we made um with personal computers and and the internet especially where we we ceded control to these you know mega corps um that now dominate our lives and so we have a a chance to do this again and to you know re-empower communities with technology um and and we should be very cautious about that it's very powerful stuff uh and you know with great power comes great responsibility so um i think we need to you know we need to be just just careful about about what we're doing and and deliberate and you know not just rush ahead with things that that sound fun or like they'll make us rich but um you know there's uh there there's a lot at stake on in this next in this next generation of tech and um you know that's that's very exciting but it also um you know we need to we need to think hard about it and um and and just be careful and you know not move fast and break things but you know maybe move slow and fix things kind of thing um yeah so that's my message mustafa you're closing remarks on the topic of sovereignty yeah i'll just end with the the three values of modular blockchains which is what we as foreign building um the first value is that users are first-class citizens of the network because they can run like clients and these like clients or nodes they allow them to kind of participate in the network um and help to directly contribute and validate the network and have a similar level of security to full nodes and that kind of like shifts power away from the validators to use back to users a second value is um modularism and maximalism this idea of like these l1 wars where every it's like it's kind of like football clubs where everyone is like a fan of specific l1 showing their their specific l1 i'm saying it's better than the other one and being l1 max he's uh kind of like uh in the past
