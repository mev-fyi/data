hello all you modulars out there welcome to another episode of Celestia spotlights where we hear from the people at the Forefront of the modular movement I'm Nick white CEO of Celestia labs and today my guest is lzrs He is building modular Cloud also known as Celestia scan and they're building a block Explorer but also cloud services for modular blockchains so he's going to tell us all about what they're building and then we're going to dissect and unpack all this really interesting content and the vision that he has for modular Cloud so lzrs welcome and take it away thanks so much Nick I'm glad to be here so what today what I want to talk to you guys about is what the implications are as blockchains move from monolithic architecture to a modular architecture and the thesis I want to put forward here is that we're going to have to not only re-architect our blockchains but we're also going to have to re-architect the tooling and basically everything in the ecosystem around these blockchains to accommodate this new architecture and while this might sound like a headache or a pain it's actually going to also unlock a bunch of capabilities that we previously didn't have and ultimately it's going to be a boon for Innovation and it's going to make everything a lot better so that's what I'm going to talk about today uh this is a presentation that I have given before and so this deck does have some information that's a little bit um old so uh we have already launched our block Explorer um with celestiascan.com you can go check it out the block Explorer for Celestia scan for Celestia we have dime scan for Dimension and we have explore.modular.cloud which is our main generic block Explorer um so go ahead and check that out um so today I want to focus on block explorers and a lot of people who are building in the modular space sometimes they'll ask me why why are you building a block Explorer why don't you we just use existing block explorers that are honestly really good and we can just use them in a modular context and so what I want to argue today is uh why it makes sense uh to actually have a special block Explorer for modular blockchains um so before I do that I just want to lay down some first principles just so everybody's up to speed on Celestia and therefore up to speed on how modular blockchains work and this will also show you how I think about all of these things and it'll all make sense in the end so uh you can kind of think of like Celestia kind of like a platform that Roll-Ups run on top of and so there's users and the users use Roll-Ups and Roll-Ups have sequencers so a user might send a transaction and then another user might send a transaction to a sequencer and the sequencer is going to package up these transactions and roll them up so to speak and put them into a block or a batch which is just a collection of blocks and that will go on to Celestia and Celestia has this Ledger and people can put data onto it and that's what sequencers do and so now let's say there's another user up top and this user does another transaction and this time it's to a different sequencer and each color represents a different roll-up so in this case this user is using a different roll up and this sequencer for this pinkish purple whatever color that is this roll up um it makes its own block and this block now goes into Celestia and as you can see now we have two blocks on Celestia from different Roll-Ups made by different sequencers and these are in a specific order and this process just goes on and on and Celestia keeps collecting data so if you and you can kind of conceptualize this like think of each block here as a piece of data put onto Celestia and each color is a different roll-up and inside each of these blocks is an ordered list of transactions and therefore what this makes is this is actually Celestia provides an ordered list of transactions across many different Roll-Ups so this first square has a bunch of transactions the second one has a bunch of transactions and this is all just ordered data so it's an ordered list of data and um what Celestia enables is it provides this thing called the namespace Merkle tree which allows you to look up certain data while ignoring other data and this is very efficient process and um so it's you could one way you can think about this is like a filter on an ordered list like a simple filter function on an ordered list so in this case Celestia is operating on this ordered list of the consensus data and it's filtering by namespace um and then if you want to think more about what a roll-up actually is you can conceptualize it like this a roll up is like a reducer on this list of filtered data on Celestia and so this is kind of a functional way of thinking about a roll-up and this is I think a very useful mental model so let's just run through a quick example so we have all this data on Celestia from different Roll-Ups now we filter out each color and these are each the namespaces for each roll up and now we run a reducer function on each of these lists each of these lists of data and we get some sort of State calculation and this is what a rule this is how a roll-up works um and so one cool thing about Celestia that I really like is that originally it was called lazy Ledger and the name Lacey ledger alludes to this thing called lazy evaluation so oops went ahead too um so lazy evaluation um is basically without going into too much detail that the normal way that you would do something is let's say you're creating a list of numbers you would go and you would add each one independently to the list and then you would go and access the one you want well in that's how it worked in Python 2 with the range function in a Python 3 that with a lazy evaluation where the range function returns a funk and then you can just resolve the third element whenever you need it and so this is actually a way quicker way because you don't have to calculate the entire list instead you just calculate the element that you want on demand it's called it's called lazy evaluation or you're lazy until you need to evaluate and so if you look here on the left this is an official Celestia graphic on how Celestia works there's the the base layer which is Celestia and then there's the execution layer and on top of that there's the there are these roll-ups um or the roles are the execution layer actually but um here I have this in 2D and you can Define each of these roll ups a b and c like this it's actually you can just represent it almost as a simple function and of course this is for how this would be a sovereign roll-up which doesn't have a settlement layer and when you bring a settlement layer into the mix it does get a little more complicated but you can still think of it this way and essentially the way I like to think about it is that this is a lazy Ledger with all of these Roll-Ups running on it and when you run a node for let's say roll up a you are actually forcing an evaluation on this function and similar with b and c so in a sense when you're on when you're using Celestia you're running all of the Roll-Ups all at the same time simultaneously and this includes all the like with one roll up four so you're actually running both Forks at the same time and any potential Fork you're also running that and um but it's just you're just not evaluating all of them because that would be ridiculous a ridiculous amount of compute so um this is a really cool system and um this brings us to the modular block Explorer and and we'll see how a modular block Explorer fits into this mental model really well so okay first let's talk about what is a block of square in general a block Explorer is in my in my opinion I like to Define it as a web user interface for a full node so you have here you have like a command that goes for a Bitcoin node and you can run this RPC command um but then this will return you the same data that's displayed on this Bitcoin block explorer that I have depicted below and so um look this is kind of how it works this is this is how I blocked I like to think about how a block Explorer works um you have consensus data which is just ones and zeros it's some some binary data and there's some protocol that goes and retrieves this data from peer-to-peer Network and you get this this ordered list of data but data by itself is meaningless it doesn't mean anything to humans humans can't understand it so what you need to do is you need to take the data and you need to decode it and you need to parse it into a into some structure that is human readable and human understandable and then if you have Smart contracts or applications running on a blockchain you then need to to execute those applications and calculate the state of the of the blockchain and so that's what a block Explorer does it takes this consensus data and it and it displays it in a way that's understandable in a structured way that's understandable and it gives relevant State and transaction information on the web and so a naive approach to making a block Explorer in a modular context would just be to take a normal block Explorer and you would just do one for each module so you would have Celestia would have its own block Explorer and then a roll up on Celestia would also have its own block Explorer and a settlement layer would also have a sunblock Explorer and that will be okay but I don't think that that is actually the best fit for this architecture so what I am setting out to build is something that looks more like this where the block Explorer actually takes into account all these different execution paths and what it does is it eagerly evaluates as many different useful um interpretations of the data as possible and also it can it can it is also a programmable so that it can execute and calculate any state that may not have already been cached and made available for the user so um and another way that you can kind of think about this is that you have all these different protocol calls that are all interconnected and this is going to get way more complex as the modular architecture matures but I would like to point out that this is similar to kind of like a micro Services architecture that people are use in web 2 and as people have shifted from a monolithic back end to a microservices backend this has unlocked a lot of capabilities in terms of scaling but has also required a lot of new tools so this is kind of analogous to what we're trying to do here is make new tools that enable this new form of scaling um so okay that's a lot of theory so let's just talk about the direct benefits of what something like this could provide so here is a trade-off curve and this is not a trilemma but this is something where people will often not be able to hit all three of these so let's say you want to build a block Explorer for your roll up um you could for example you could um use an off-the-shelf um block a sport for your role now the downside of this is it's going to be easy to set up it's going to be pretty good it'll have some really great features but maybe it will lack some features that will show you for example where your data is in the data availability layer or something like that but it's pretty powerful but the problem is it's not flexible because if you deviate from an architecture a common architecture like let's say you have a cosmos chain in it and you want to actually deviate from Cosmos standards then you I mean you can't do that you're going to lose compatibility and it's going to break things and you're going to have to adapt it so it what this basically going this approach is going to limit your ability to innovate so another option that you could do is you could actually just build your own block Explorer and so and and in this case you're going to have kind of two problems one is you can either build a simple block Explorer and that will be really easy and it can be flexible and even if you're Innovative you can still make it work and it'll be easy to do but the problem with that is uh that it's not going to have a lot of the capabilities that you would want it to it's not going to be very powerful um but you could then of course say well I'm going to make it powerful I'm going to do a great job I'm going to make it a really good block of sport that works for my new Innovative architecture that's different than anything else that's ever existed okay great idea the problem is that's hard so now you're diverting resources away from your Innovative project and you're putting it towards this so this is kind of a tricky situation that people um get into but um we do have a solution and it's to use a modular clock Explorer so this is how it works how can we do this let me let me show you so basically what we do is we have this network of Integrations and we are going to integrate with everyone um so when you are building a new piece of this modular blockchain stack you're going to be connecting to lots of different layers and lots of different modules and maybe you'll be providing a module that other people are using or maybe you're going to just be building an application that that's utilizing many choices from a menu of different modules and so we are going to already have all of these modules integrated into our system so it's just a matter of selecting what you're using and we will already know how to handle those components of what you're building so when you integrate with us you only need to show us how to integrate with the thing that you changed so that's a very simple that in many cases that's a very simple process I mean when we're working hard to make this very easy for for you so um like when you are normally building a blockchain and this includes tooling for blockchains and including block explorers you have to consider all of these things in the modular context what we want to allow you to do is just to focus on the Innovation you tell us what you change and we will know how to handle your how you're talking data availability how you're talking to settlement we'll be able to pull that data we'll be able to show the relationship between your roll up and the other protocols that it's connecting to so let's just go through one concrete real world example that's live right now Dimension Dimension you can go to dymscan.com Dime scan or you can use any of our explorers explore.modler.cloud and you uh can go and you can look at Dimension data and currently there is the dimension Hub which is the settlement layer and a roll app which is a roll-up and in the future people are going to be deploying their own roll apps and it's going to be a way that you can scale your blockchain based applications so if you want to create a new roll app using their toolkit and connecting to their settlement layer the good thing is we already have this integration so we will be able to make it effortless for you to just send us the you just sync your GitHub we'll clone the code we'll run it we already know how roll apps will work if you don't do anything extremely technically different we'll be able to do deploy this in one click and we'll be able to connect your data with all the data throughout the modular stack and as a result there's a lot of cool implications of that but um even if you decide to change how your will app works technically will also make it easy for you to provide the the a function that can Define the difference of your rollout and how we expect it to be so it'll be very easy to sync any sort of innovative protocol into this context and one of the other benefits so you're going to get a Blog score you'll have a roll up you'll instantly get a block Explorer as soon as you register with the Hub so your users can start understanding what's going on on your chain and developers can start working efficiently but we're also are deploying a cloud platform and that's why we're called modular Cloud so our block Explorer is free it's open source it always will be go ahead check it out on GitHub modulus Cloud slash Explorer and um the uh but what the way that we're making money is we are building a cloud platform so also when you integrate with with our platform not only will you get a free blocking score you're also going to get a whole Suite of apis and cloud services that your users and developers in your ecosystem can use from day one so you do a simple integration maybe you have an app that fits a formula it's instant deployment or you have something that where you're innovating on the technology side not on the application side you write a simple integration you get a block Explorer and you get apis and other services and we hope to have a huge a huge offering of services for you such that you can have Cloud parity with ethereum or Solana or any other major established ecosystem you are no longer going to be at a disadvantage by innovating and going Your Own Way starting your own chain or protocol you can start it you'll integrate with us easy and we can provide you everything you need for developers to start building on day one in your ecosystem at scale and yeah so go check us out at modular.cloud or you can follow us on Twitter at modular cloud1 thank you wow thank you lzrs that was incredible um there's so much to unpack there I first just want to say that I love the mental model of lazy evaluation for Celestia um and and how you you have all this data and you first filter out the data that's relevant for your roll-up or your application and then you run some kind of yeah evaluation over it and that's that gives you sort of like the output State um that's a really amazing mental model and I hope that that gets shared more broadly in the the modular ecosystem and uh the the vision I mean of I think modular blockchains in general Celestia being one piece is that people should be able to deploy their own blockchain in one click and you know there's a lot of different elements to that one is you need to have you know function function and consensus and data availability like Celestia you need to have some kind of roll up sequencer out of the box and you need all these tools but but another piece is like outside of the like we tend to think mostly just about the the protocol but outside of the protocol are tools that you just assume and you need for usability right of of the the protocol itself and and a block Explorer is one of the really really key ones and the vision of of a developer being able to deploy their roll up with one click but not just their roll up but all the associated infrastructure is really really important and and a beautiful vision and uh I I just I think this is going to be a very very important piece of infrastructure for the modular stack uh as a whole yeah I totally agree uh it's um I I think that we're just getting started in terms of what we're seeing in the developer experience it's so exciting to see people working so hard at making these roll-up tool kits and Roll-Ups as a service and it's going to be so easy to deploy a new decentralized application that has such high security guarantees and you're going to basically just get a whole bunch of tooling it's going to be amazing it's going to be effortless I think it's going to be as easy to deploy or roll up I mean you guys say as a smart contract I love that but I also think it's too hard to deploy a smart contract right now I think it's going to be as easy to deploy a roll of as is going to be a Lambda function on AWS or even one of those you know rappers around Lambda functions that some SAS companies provide where you just like something that like for sale for people who do front-end development you'll know Purcell is a very easy platform for deploying websites and you just you just save your cell now or they used to have a thing called design is right now and it just uploaded your website and it would be live and like with one command I I think we're heading towards a developer experience that is that easy I love that I found someone who's even more bullish on modular blockchains than me um so I have a question for you right which is um how standardized you think this will be or will it be super diverse because um you know one of the things that you said is like well now now that you're supporting Dimension right and you understand the sort of the Roll app model it'll be really easy for you to basically support anyone who deploys a new roll app because it kind of follows sort of the modules that you already understand and sort of the format that you already understand and and in that that one uh slide you had like here's like this like a basically a menu of someone like a developer who's deploying their thing like okay choose this execution model choose this data availability layer choose this you know settlement function or what have you um and so but that that depends on the fact that there are there's a sort of a finite set of those things and so like but also part of the modular vision is that this is customizable so like how do you see that that the balance between customizability and sort of standardization um in in the future of of infrastructure yeah that's a great question so basically the way one of the ways that we architect our software differently than other people in this space is that we are optimizing towards flexibility and so there's often a debate that Engineers will have about whether to build a system that's very in a very general way or to build a specific Solution that's that's easier to get out and probably works better for any given solution and this debate always happens whenever anyone's trying to decide how to build a new product and the reason there's no set answer is because it depends on the context and in this context uh we believe that the modular architecture is shifts things towards the need for tooling to be more flexible because there's going to be a huge diversity of different options so we are building our system in a way that is some might say over engineered for the case of n equals one but in the case of n equals many um it's going it makes it a lot we're focusing on building things in a general way that where you if you do something different you can plug into a general framework that will be able to work with the way that you do it so that's a huge Focus for us is the developer experience of syncing a completely new Innovative protocol and like for example we're working with Eclipse we're working with Dimension these are two very different projects eclipse is building a Solana virtual machine that runs as a roll-up on Celestia Dimension is building a cosmos based roll up and and they have a settlement layer and these are these are very different projects and we're also supporting you know Solana virtual machine ethereum virtual machine so we're we're already dealing with a good amount of diversity and so we want it to be very easy for people to self-service Integrations onto our platform for free that's a huge key piece because as you said people are going to be selecting from the menu of integration so we want to have every integration unlike other companies we don't want to charge for integrating with our platform we'll charge people who want to retrieve data from us or run computations on our Cloud platform and that onus is on us to provide really great tools that are useful for developers but we want to have that data set of Integrations where we have all the data from everyone we know all the state of every chain every transaction and we know how it all works and we have we have it all connected we have it all we understand the relationships between all these different entities and we think that's going to position us in a really great spot so that you can come along say I'm using these things I'm not using these things I have my own settlement layer I I have my own roll up and my own settlement layer we're going to do these parts differently but we're using Celestia so we can help you with that and then we make it easy for you to integrate your other things and you have the settlement layer maybe other people want to use that too and so now we're going to make it easy for anyone using your settlement layer to use your settlement layer so that's that's basically how it works love it and um the other cool thing that people might not be aware of is that in this new model of block explorers that you're building you can actually it's not just like one single blockchain like you let's say I was you know exploring the roll app on the dimension chain um it actually shows me okay it's settling to the dimension Hub and I can like click in and go go to the dimension Hub and that says oh well all this data is being posted to Celestia I can then kind of navigate to Celestia so what's really cool is that it's now kind of like this the connections Explorer like a multi-chain Explorer virtually you know like somewhere like you can actually see and see the connection between all these things and how they're fitting together um and so that kind of blew my mind just because I don't know I hadn't thought of that before of like what the next generation of block explorers will look like but that's exactly what it will be um it's like kind of like visualizing and mapping out this modular stack um so that's really cool so I have a question which is obviously you know block Explorer is the first product but the the name of the project is modular Cloud so give us a quick sort of overview of like the long-term Vision Beyond block explorers for modular cloud Yeah so basically there is a whole so there like Lincoln we can think about it in in several ways so there's a Proto there's these decentralized protocols and at the court that's I think the best most General way of talking about any of these applications is they're decentralized protocols and um they provide certain functionality um and sometimes there's other bits that are bundled in there with them so um for example um like let's just take Celestia as an example Celestia is a decentralized protocol and it there's a proof of stake mechanism that comes to consensus on data and it indexes data in a very circus very specific way and it has data availability sampling which enables Roll-Ups so this is a core functionality of what Celestia does and it does it really well now bundled in that is a few other things like for example there's an RPC endpoint uh that's bundled into that and what that is essentially another application that's completely separate there's this consensus mechanism that plugs into a peer-to-peer Network it downloads the data stores it in like level DB or something and that's on your disk and there's this other application that shares a lot of the same schemas and it's actually a web server in go that's running alongside at a different port and this is how people go and get data when they're making an application that interfaces with Celestia so this is one of those things where um this is necessary in order for people to be able to programmatically interact with Celestia but it's not an optimal tool for every type of case in which people would want to do something like this and so there's a lot of ways that you might want to access that data that are not supported by the API or maybe the performance characteristics are not good of it like for example if you put too many people trying to hit that endpoint it's going to crash the note so one thing one one class of of products that we are going to be offering is stuff around data retrieval and we're going to be offering a more robust infrastructure that will enable people to access the data that they want in a scalable way and in using the apis that they want um and and generally speaking like that that's a huge thing is taking stuff that already is possible but making it either changing the the apis to that in a way that's more suited for certain use cases or changing the performance characteristics like for example if you're deploying an IOS app or a web app a lot of protocols won't be able to support that through a peer-to-peer means and there's a lot of reasons why you actually can't connect to a peer-to-peer Network in the browser for example in a good way so or you need like a signaling server or there's still some centralized infrastructure so we can help people scale in that way and and that so that's one class of products and another class of products is stuff around just like compute so we have we're running on Amazon web services so we have access to this giant super data center that we can run Giant computations on that you just simply cannot run on your own machine and so what we there's a whole Suite of potential products that we can build that will allow people to run amazing computations or really complicated queries on this large data set that we're going to be acquiring as we integrate with every single blockchain so we'll know all the data from all the transactions all the blocks all the state of every chain and we have a giant giant data center that can do virtually unlimited compute whatever you can pay for you can get now if you know a useful thing you can do you can pay us we will make it easy for you to run those computations on that data set um and um I I think just the last component in in here is that we are these are centralized things and we are not setting out to replace anything that is decentralized what we would like to do is we would like to provide these types of centralized services and eventually we would like to offer that through a decentralized network if anyone's working on a decentralized network for accessing these type of services please let us know we would love to sell through your network if that is something that is economically sustainable um otherwise we'll eventually create our own decentralized access protocol got it so it sounds like in addition to the Explorer there's the RPC endpoints and also like indexing and lots of other stuff on that and I also really resonate with the vision for decentralizing it I think it's difficult I mean I know that there are you know teams that have been trying to build decentralized RPC obviously through centralized indexing it's a tough tough nut to crack but I do think eventually we will get there and um a last thing that I want to mention is at least for Celestia itself one of the things that we really believe in is people actually running light nodes themselves like in their wallet like in the browser or wherever their wallet is maybe on mobile so that they can actually they don't have to rely on an RPC endpoint to send transactions everything because because RPC endpoints are sort of a central point of failure like if you're only interfacing with the blockchain through an RPC you're not like it's not really decentralized you don't actually know for yourself what the state of the chain is you're kind of trusting someone um and you also yeah you know it's a it's a compromise essentially on the the real vision of of uh blockchains but at the same time but RPC endpoints are also like dedicated RPC standpoints are very useful for a whole host of other reasons and everyone should have the choice um that's that's awesome uh so I guess to wrap things up like um give us just a really short thing on the near-term roadmap any any thing that's like on the horizon for you I know you just announced your fundraise you launched dim scan and Celestia scan and everything so there's a lot of progress recently what's the next step and then as a last thing like where can people find out more or if someone's building a roll-up or a blockchain and they want to work with you um sort of what does that look like and how do they get in touch with you yeah so we are um yeah yeah we we are um we launched our Vlog explorers as you said and we have announced the fundraise and so next up we're basically doing three things one is we're making improvements this was the early launch there's a lot to improve so we're working hard to make this as great of a product as possible um we would love feedback so anyone who wants to go on our website and answer all right and suggest uh like check it out see see what they can suggest for us to do better please let us know um it's really really helpful um we want to have a lot more Integrations with a lot more protocols we're in a lot of we're in discussions with many teams we're really excited about this we're working on our self-serve integration so right now we're doing everything manually and we're optimizing to make it easy for ourselves to do it manually but we want to have this self-serve integration so when you have launched your protocol or roll up or something you can integrate with us very easily without having to have any conversations um uh and we're always also willing to help um so yeah if you but if you do have a protocol or um or a roll-up that you're launching soon or that you've already launched please get in contact with us we'd love to have an integration and we'd love to either support your application to your users give them visibility into their data on the web through our block Explorer or um help people if you're building a platform we can help that we can help people build on your platform by providing block explorers for people that are in your ecosystem fantastic lots to be excited about and uh so good to hear your vision for the modular stack and the tooling that will come along with it through modular Cloud uh Elizabeth thank you so much for coming on uh really appreciate it and uh thanks everyone for listening uh to this episode and stay tuned for more uh spotlights with really cool projects there's so much happening in the modular space it's actually hard to keep up but we're doing our best so stay tuned for the next episode thanks again lgrs yeah thank you so much
