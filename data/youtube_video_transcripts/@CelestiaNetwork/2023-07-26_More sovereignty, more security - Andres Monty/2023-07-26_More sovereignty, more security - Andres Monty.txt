hi everyone I'm Andres Monte co-founder of range and today we are going to talk about sovereignty and and security and also how app specific rollups can be the answer to the security problem in crypto so I have a couple of questions before I start talking and yeah here for you which is uh hook in the in the in the area in the room things that uh ethereum would Fork if there's taking deposit contract uh would get wiped out and all the Eid was stolen like raise your hands if you think would have another doubt for contentious work okay who thinks it wouldn't okay maybe we have like 75 percent that we would Fork uh who thinks here that if Lido all the TBL of Lido all they eat which I'm not sure if it's between 10 and 20 of this Supply got hacked uh who thinks here we would Fork as with the doubt Fork now one okay that's interesting so then like if all the TBL of maker Dao got hacked uh now will you hear things that we would Fork right okay that's interesting uh we will come back to to these questions later uh but yeah like let's start kind of a stepping back and and understanding what's the level of of security in crypto uh we are doing not fine uh in in 2022 more than three billion dollars were affected uh some of these were recouped but but definitely like we are not doing fine uh this is a huge number and I always try to make analogies uh with kind of more real world numbers so this is I think almost 20 percent like three billion dollars almost 20 percent of the annual defense budget of my home country in the European Union so we are talking about very very big numbers right and I think everyone in this room agrees that security is important I would go even farther I would say that uh I mean I'm biased but I think that is the key and solved problem in crypto for instance adoption uh it's great that we are working on solving scalability uh it's great that some people are looking for product Market fit but security like nothing of that matters if we don't solve security a good example is x infinity x infinity like was the product that kind of crossed the castle right like it was more like mainstream adopted like very adopted in Philippines but then at some point like the running Bridge was had hacked for more than half billion dollars and you know all the users all the mainstream users that were using like actually probably are not coming back because they got wrecked right uh answer I would like to ask you here uh if we are ready to build like secure modern blockchains and if we are ready for thousands of of roll ups or tens of thousands of prolapse kind of talking to each other uh yeah come from the security background so so I have like uh you know we have certainly some challenges what I call Modern nightmares so like modularity implies that there is uh more external dependencies so we have like a sort of like a supply chain risk for the counterparties that we are kind of integrating our model stack we also like using a Cutting Edge stack right like roll ups as your knowledge like this is like super cool technology but it's uh mostly not battle tested in production yet and then as well you know like this world of many many roll ups and blockchains implies that we are like bridges are not going anywhere and cross chain is not going anywhere and ambridges are are complex bridges are hard so I mean we should understand as well that not all bridges are created equal and I think like as a community and in particular this sector of of the crypto Community has done a lot of progress moving from centralized to trust minimize uh and translate Bridges so this is great uh but the reality is that most exploits that we've seen and we've seen in 2022 uh more than 2.5 billion dollars were actually due to implementation flaws so in this infographic you can see all the yellow bars correspond to like a design poor designs so that means like uh for example a case of ronin and Harmony yes key compromise or multi Bridges but all the green bars are actually implementation flows so the point here is doesn't matter how sound and robust your Bridge protocol is doesn't matter if you're using like a trustless bridge trust minimize like ABC or even like a canonical bridge between ethereum Mountain and an L2 there can always be an implementation flow so I think as a community and I think this is happens already in work too we need to internalize this statement there will be always yet another software back so we kind of need to work on controlling the blast radius of this incidents and particularly uh when we talk about bridges and Roll-Ups that are very complex over projects uh which you know like complexity means a larger attack surface and a more error-prone type of code basis but not everything is dark uh I think like modularity is kind of bringing a new paradigm with all these challenges that I've been talking about but also like a lot of opportunities and I think like the opportunity is definitely outweighed the challenges and I generally believe that app specific Sovereign Roll-Ups might be the only possible way actually to build truly secure blockchains and and this is not talking about like five years ten years from now right like the future is now like produce like Celestia are going to enabled very soon that you know there will be thousands or tens of thousands of prolapse Sovereign talking to each other and that every application is going to have its own roll up uh and also like kind of align with this beautiful vision of like Community computers where all the stakeholders are aligned so in this world uh sovereignty rules and and for this I always like to use this analogy of of seeing blockchains as countries and seeing Bridges as sort of like International treaties or International relationships between these countries or or blockchains we are going to talk about these three things in this context so blockchain jurisdictions uh borders and trade control and separation of powers who knows about like the BSC hack here so this is a very interesting exploit uh it was almost the biggest exploit in the history of crypto I think was around like half a billion dollars hacked but the most interesting thing about this is that um the binance validators let's say the binance validators were able to post the chain and hold the chain very quick to control the plus radio so like the hacker was only able to get only in quotes uh 100 million dollars out of the chain so I was able to bridge out 100 million dollars but all the 400 million dollars that remain within the blockchain jurisdiction which is the BSC chain were able to be recouped and recovered so this is a very very interesting example there is this another one which is this is not security related but it's also like a proof of of the power of of social consensus so the you know blockchain Community decided to confiscate uh tokens from from a whale address that had received more than the community thought was okay in an airdrop that was flawlessly designed and then this was through Community governance and and they actually confiscated the defense and of course the dough Fork which I would say is top three in terms of importance of events in the history of crypto uh this happened a long time ago like seven years which in crypto years is almost 50 years ago but that it's also like a kind of the importance of social consensus so also like regarding that I would also like to question ourselves how would this happen if ethereum back then was connected with different Bridges so like if the Dow hacker was able to breach out part of the or if there were stable coins that were already like in this primitive ethereum chain right so with these three examples what we see is the importance of social consensus and blockchain jurisdictions but also that the the power of these jurisdictions starts and ends in the bridge and this is specifically clear in the case of of the binance hack and these you know like the importance of the bridge bring us to this part some of these things are going to be a bit controversial but uh but yeah like it's I think it's worth it to explore them so the importance of the Border in blockchain context and trade control so I would say let's be the wall or at least let's explore if we should build a wall of course this is not a political statement but I think that we should explore how you know like breaching works right now breaching is binary right it's either we connect to a chain or we don't I think like this is very primitive and and we should explore ways to parameterize this to make this more granular with mechanisms like rate limits transaction delays like the world Hall Governor has implemented and as well like with transaction screening and blogging I'm not talking about Theory here like there are many applications Cosmos chains that already do this type of blocking with Blacklist there is thousands of D5 applications that do this as well but this is not explicit and that's why you know you need to pause the change and hold the change because you don't have this type of mechanisms in place I would also like to talk about ABC rate limits I think this is a super powerful primitive it's I think to what I what I think is that is the first governance configurable rate limited standard this is in production for uh bridging fundable tokens over IBC and this is super important because it doesn't only covers you if IBC implementation is actually exploited but it also protects you so protects you as a community as a chain or as a roll up if the search chain is exploited so in the case of binance if we had rate limits in place that this attacker wouldn't have been able to get 100 million dollars but maybe five or ten million dollars and also like the binance validator set wouldn't have been able to wouldn't have needed to pause and hold the chain and also more importantly it also protects if the destination chain is exploited so like it gives Community like shopping roll ups and blockchains as well sovereignty over how much you trust your counterparties so there might be the case that you want to bridge with a new uh fancy blockchain but you don't really trust their technology debt or their Economic Security so the rate limits enables you to parameterize this and kind of position yourself in this trade of space between security and liquidity and this is just the present I think ABC rate limits in the future are going to be like very different much more complex and much more Dynamic and Powerful for example a standing medium fungible token transfers but also like being able to dynamically adjust to events that happen on chain so something that would be very cool is that if real limits could be integrated with on chain events like upgrades so if a chain upgrades you can Define like a small rate limit because upgrades are normally error and then as you get more confidence on the new version you can gradually increase the rate limit and then the last one is separation of powers I think this ruling encapsulates very well like the the power of modularity the ability that you can kind of specialize every Ledger of the stack and build like customized mechanisms in our case build customized security mechanisms across all the layers of the stack something that I think can be super cool I know that other teams are working on this which are modular mempools this is something it's a concept that we've seen already in the wild Cosmos change like Terra Define like mempools that have prioritization for different transactions so for example Oracle transactions are going to be always at the beginning of the block and I think like this can be super powerful in the modular context a modular paradigm because we can really customize this uh combined like with app specifics or Roll-Ups and really make this super powerful combining with security mechanisms customized for the given application this is the case for example for circuit breakers so we could see a future where circuit breakers are totally adapted to like the app specific roll-up functionality and also have more priority in the mempool so then we can make sure that all security related transactions get put at the beginning of of every block and this is really like the future we are building at range so we are providing the tools uh to for for blockchains for software and Roll-Ups in both the cosmos and Celeste ecosystem to express uh their sovereignty and also the security and how are we doing this so we are integrating of chain monitoring systems and on chain mitigation techniques like rate limits uh circuit breakers and more and also we put a lot of focus on on Bridges as we discussed in the call we see Bridges as as the border and and this we should put a lot of security uh in the border right so we are building security mechanisms Security Management middleware around translates Bridges like IBC and yeah like as a little surprise we have integrated uh MoCA in the in Rage testnet so so yeah from tomorrow from the second day of the modern Summit you will be able to to Tinker with the star monitoring addresses transactions and messages in in mocha from the range uh Community app and and yeah that's that's all um join us at range.org I'm a small team Twitter and I'm always super down to discuss all these topics some of them are controversial some of theirs are less controversial but I'm always super super down to discuss this in Twitter and also in the conference I think that we have a bit of time for for Q a so if you guys have any question or if you would like to you know like come back to any of the slides also happy to do that thank you [Applause] so we have five minutes so if does anyone have a question no questions yeah that's a good one uh I yeah I definitely believe like if there's taking the positive contract is hacked I know they is wipe out we definitely Fork I think that if Lido gets hacked and all they eat uh gets wiped out I think we would probably Fork like I think like the room only like 25 of you said that or almost now one I I think it would uh it's a meaningful percentage of the supply of of it and there is a lot of yeah quite important stakeholders as well um so yeah I think like there is like uh more than 50 chance that it would with maker I don't think it would and that's if I were a maker though an application like that and kind of came back with the rest of the talk um you know you have a DBL of I don't know what maker that has interviewed but maybe like 10 billion dollars I'm not sure exactly but I should ask myself as a community that I have like a TPL of 10 billion dollars but then I don't have the ability and the power with social consensus to be able to to to do this type of decisions right so you are handling a lot of money but you don't even have like the power like to to decide these type of things and that's why you know Apple specific software and Roll-Ups are are so important and so like powerful in the future for security because its application imagine like this maker though app specific Sovereign roll-up would be definitely like able to to decide like a fork if all the you know like eth or older TBL uh were you know affected in the hack so that's kind of like really the connection and and why like teams like maker now and others should definitely like consider launching natural enrollable yeah all good all right thank you Andres give him one more hand [Applause]
