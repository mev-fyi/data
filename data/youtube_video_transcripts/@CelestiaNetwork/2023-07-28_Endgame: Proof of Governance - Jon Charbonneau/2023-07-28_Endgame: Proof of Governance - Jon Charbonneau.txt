okay cool I've had a lot of coffee and I have a lot of slides and I don't have a lot of time so I'm probably gonna be bouncing for this a bit um I'm going to be talking about why like proof of stake like kind of makes sense but like kind of maybe doesn't make sense um and particularly I'll be there we go um so this will be applicable to like pretty much any proof of stake type chain but in particular I'll have like a lens on Roll-Ups for this so I'm talking about it so we've all heard there's like a million different sequencer decentralization options shared sequencer you can run auctions proof of stake like all these different options in particular I'm going to be focusing on these last like kind of sub components of that which is applicable to a lot of places so that's proof of stake and proof of authority um and kind of like variations thereof and my goal kind of by the end of this talk is to convince you that those two are like actually kind of the same thing when you play out like how this rationally looks at the end of the day whether you have a proof of stake mechanism or you just like literally let your governance just say hey these are the people that we want to be our delegates and just don't even bother mistaking they kind of end up in the same place roughly so starting from really Basics what is proof of stake for it is not to slash people's money the like fundamental reason why you have proof of stake or proof of work or similar things it is fundamentally a civil resistance mechanism we need people to vote for us and if you just let any single person one person one vote you get simple attacks so we need to like meet her who can actually contribute into this system so the simple way to do that generally in any permissionless protocol is you tie it to some kind of real economic resource so proof of stake you put up stake proof of work you prove that you burned energy so you've submitted some real costs the other way around this is also you could just have basically like a permission setting noting that the difference between permissioned and permissionless is like actually kind of subjective and like how people Define it but you could just basically have some form of trusted set up really we say like hey these are the people who are voting for us we know who they are we trust who they are um so okay so looking at proof of stake how does it play out when you like actually look at what happens and where the uh incentives go so simple delegated proof of stake um if you don't do it in protocol it'll rise out of protocol but basically there's a clear separation between the people who have capital and people who like actually want to run the operation so you naturally need some form of Delegation like I might have Capital that I want to stake but I don't want to run this stuff so I delegate it to someone else that's super Capital inefficient among other issues so you end up with liquid staking tokens like this is what we see on ethereum this is why Lido popped up so this helps provide people liquidity do the auto protocol delegation for them hands people back like okay I don't want a stake so I get my Steve token and like someone else they go figure it out like how to manage that for me one of the problems with liquid staking that like people talk a lot now about is this like kind of inherent principal agent problem between someone like Lido and someone like ethereum or any other protocol is Lido may have like a profit incentive that is not aligned with like my values and my governance of my chain so this is why something like dual governance is like pretty much necessary in my mind for like any kind of liquid sticking to be viable in the long term it's like some way for that protocol to align itself with like the underlying protocol so in the case of like Lido what they're talking about is like okay what if we get instead of just letting you know ldo tokens decide everything we gives teeth holders of veto rights who are like presumably a subset of like this ethereum consensus that are aligned and will have like a different motive than necessarily the profit-seeking ldo holders which is helpful um so then I'll get to the next thing so proof of authority kind of like is like this like dirty word that like whenever I try to like say this the reaction is generally oh that's super centralized it's gonna be way less secure like this doesn't work um I'm gonna try to convince you by the end of this that I think like variation of this could be more secure and more decentralized than a proof of stake mechanism like very clearly um so proof of authority I think like I think that's a reasonable term when you're talking about like a truly like private permission type blockchain um potentially even like an rwa one where like Circle has like real control over this thing proof of governance uh I'm saying that like there's a clear incredible governance mechanism place to choose these delegates so it's like actually a bit reminiscent of the way that like Mustafa has described the difference between solvent ropes and smart contract rules and maybe more of like a social distinction more than like a very Concrete technical one but I do think it is important um so simple example would be like look at Roll-Ups like they'll presumably take into simple case like you have a smart contract bridge on ethereum that has like very powerful governance for this roll-up and for something like arbitrary to even see the initial form of this today we're like you can force inclusion of a transaction through the L1 and they could forcibly remove the sequencer if they should so choose and similarly they could just choose like hey here are the 10 delegates that we want to be our sequencer instead of the one so now I'll start to go through like concretely like what are the differences between all of them so one is permissionlessness so this is part of why like I'm targeting this specifically at Roll-Ups like I would say off the bat this is obviously not an ethereum uh like an ethereum type option and should be very obvious why like ethereum does not want to be like actively saying like hey here are the 30 people that like we trust to do this for us you want to let you know validator number one million join the validator set and like be non-opinionated about that which I think is like very different from Roll-Ups um and that's the point here is like that sounds like a downside but I don't think that if Roll-Ups are optimizing for the same thing that their base layers are optimizing for like they're already paying the base layer for that decentralized consensus in the first place like and that is why they don't they're not going to even from an economic perspective it's not even going to make sense for them to have validate and remember one million and no one's going to want to do that and it doesn't add anything really like it's particularly for that kind of Doomsday scenario that they're already paying the L1 for um and in addition like kind of going back to like Patty's talk before it's actually like very helpful in many cases to have permissioning because like you want them to do things things like enforce certain transaction ordering um okay and governance this is very related to the point before like ethereum does not want like active opinionated governance that's like saying hey we're picking all these people I think the Practical reality is that like for most Roll-Ups though they're probably going to have this like you look at the ones today and the simple examples like Optimum is an orbitrum they have this giant Bridge you're required to have some form like legible on chain governance that will be presumably powerful powerful unless you think that they're optimizing for this like very immutable type contract and governance which I tend to think is like rather unlikely for most of these but it does make a difference if you do so accountability this is like one of the things that everyone um kind of like Harps against here is like this is one of the big benefits of proof of stake it's like oh we could like slash the bad guys uh and like that is seen as one of the benefits um I like tend to disagree with that once you like actually play out what this looks like in the long run because the reality is the large majority if not all stake is going to be delegated like there's a natural economic incentive to separate capital from labor and we like see that play out very very clearly in every proof of stake system what I think is like the real advantage of proof of stake over for work is like it's not necessarily the slashing aspect I think it's more so particularly once you play out the economics it's the very targeted removal of who the malicious attacker is where in proof of work you like you nuke the hashing algorithm and you restart from scratch and you're kind of screwed so in proof of stake it's not so much the slashing part of it that I think is like necessarily the most important important part of it it's that you can very targeted remove okay these are the bad guys these are people we want to get rid of and you still keep the same thing here if you have your governance just electing them um so this is why like I think like Economic Security just gets like a little overhyped sometimes when you like look at the simple incentives like you could have one billion dollars or 100 billion dollars if the guy who's like the operator who's doing that like it's literally not his money this is not like an incentive compatible thing it is just a reputation game that you were like assuming that they don't want to light your money on fire which is fine but like they also don't want to like screw their business and like lose out on all future profits it's the same thing like it's an understanding this is reputation game and not like a cryptographic like crypto economic incentive compatibility design um so the so the other point is like so you realize okay so if it's not necessarily just as a punishment mechanism you realize but it is still important like okay if I'm gonna get slashed I'm going to pick my delegator wisely so it is an incentive mechanism for me to pick a delegate appropriately which does matter and so uh so moving on um so like this is uh from like a post that Nick Carter had a while back called it's the settlement insurance and stupid which is actually very good um so taking some pieces from it Ledger costliness you're talking about the amount paid to validators uh Slash transaction selectors per unit of time and like particularly in the proof of work context you can assume like reasonably closely like this reward paid is proportional to like very close to the amount of like energy and real cost that is spent to earn that um and a greater your salary to them means like a greater security because like it is more costly to reorg that chain if you're paying them more because that means it is a higher cost to do so um and then on the other side is uh like kind of badass quote from uh the prince that Josh sent me which is like kind of reminiscent of this like it reminds me of it a bit um where if you're basically relying on Mercenaries like when the day comes when they're like not necessarily aligned with you like you might kind of be screwed so you probably want to have people who are like are aligned with you and not just always like explicitly dollar for dollar profit seeking in a situation equation like this so talking about settlement insurance is broadly systems ability to Grant recipients confidence a transaction will not be reversed so Economic Security when we talk about it we're talking about like what is the cost to reorg the chain here so proof of work as I mentioned like very simply you know you have to pay some money to like literally mine the blocks to do this proof of stake it's Costless to simulate blocks so like when we're generally talking about the economic security we're talking about the slashing but like as I kind of just described that slashing is like not necessarily deterrent if you're delegating all the capital to that person so it's like it's not like the actual same protection there um so delegation does remove that and you start to realize it is more of a reputation game so if we play out that scenario where you do have that separation of capital and labor which is like where the natural economic incentives lead to what is proof of stake at the end of the day it is back to that thing that I said in the beginning is like the fundamental thing it is a civil resistance mechanism and a mechanism for us to delegate who are the people who care about our system and like those are the people we're going to delegate to vote for us it is not necessarily like a way for us to actually penalize them because there is an incentive for it to not be their money and like have that separation again so then the question is okay if this is a mechanism for us primarily just to like actually pick people who are very aligned with us and like have the right distribution of the validator set is this the best mechanism for us to pick them and like this is where I've uh rather strong opinion I do not think that it is because like it's a simple like tragedy of the commons if you take out like liquid staking protocols like I think dpos is like the worst with without them arguably because like it what is regular user you know like do in this scenario I go look for like who's the biggest validator the second biggest validator like I go delegate at the coinbase or wherever else like it's nice that you have a permissionless long tail but the Practical reality is the large majority of stake ends up going to like two or three people um versus proof of governance you're not like you're not putting like okay my dollars go to this person like I select that person we are voting as a collective for like what is the best distribution as a collective interest for all of us so we can go intentionally pick okay here are the 30 geographically distributed people that we like and we give them equal voting powder across system I think there's like significantly harder to corrupt and like potentially more decentralized and that's like actually what we see with like so like moving on here like this is the decentralization which like kind of follows on that um like what is decentralization it's like that it's that kind of that point that I was saying there of like is it validator number one million that makes you decentralized or is it like the composition of what do we care about like the top of the stake um and in particular like this is kind of like the like visual example of it like which of these is decentralization and particularly for a roll-up I would argue like the second one is actually the much more important one particularly because they're paying the L1 in this case like four is that doomsday type scenario of recoverability they are like very much optimizing for like what are the real-time short-term guarantees because like also their real cost is like being immediately reset once they like go back to the L1 so I think the second one is more important and the second one is actually like that is Lido's ethereum stake distribution like this is very intentionally what they do under the hood it is we pick these 29 delegates who are decentralized who are responsible and these are the people that we equally distribute votes to and like that is the kind of thing that you can basically just in-house to your protocol if you have the opinionated governance to do that so in terms of capital efficiency this should be intuitive tpus incredibly capital and efficient like it's not good if you're you know your type of like roll-up economy or whatever it is LST is significantly better but you are adding on like the additional risk of like these uh Financial derivatives discrepancy between like different types of holders on bonding periods Etc I would say proof of governance is like absolutely optimal and like kind of all of these Dimensions everything stays in the native base asset everyone has like an equal value capture to like whatever it is you decide you want to burn it go ahead like you want to send money to your treasury to allocate it based on whatever your subjective governance process is go ahead and like you just have this explicit agreement like the validators get paid X slash year of sequencers um and so like this is what it comes down to is like the alignment that I was like kind of touching out with the Dual governance before so like this is a section taken out of like Danny uh Ryan who's like very popular post on like the risks of LSD where he's talking about okay like lydo's doing this dual governance thing which is supposed to like okay that'll mitigate the principal agent problem but he's saying like Okay but Steve holder is an eth user who's like that's not the same thing it is still like a significantly lesser alignment um and then also had a post after that pointing out which I agree with is like this is not just like a Lido slash uh liquid taking thing this is just like an inherent problem with proof of stake like people who are staking in dpos they are also not the entire like superset of like roll up slash chain users slash those good census like there is a disparity there so what do you want to have do you want to have your roll-up token holders just like deciding by themselves like these are the people that we delegate to do you want to have an LST governance deciding it like completely for your chain so it's like maybe a little bit better because it like maybe it's more decentralized but it's also maybe worse because you're less aligned LST is able to go dual governance I would say is the best of those three because like you're letting a subjective governance process intentionally decentralized but like retaining power over it to like veto harmful actions and the last one is the cleanest one of just why don't you have your own chain designed um like again this doesn't make sense for something like ethereum because like they're not going to have that opinionated concrete governance process to be like selecting all these different validators but that is the exact opposite of what a lot of these Roll-Ups are doing and I don't think it's a coincidence it like happened to actually see it I think it was like a day or two ago optimism is to the first of my knowledge the first team to announce this in their governance post that they put out the other day that they intend to basically this is their plan at least initially for the sequencer it appears that their token house will be able to initially um choose like who are like the sequences that we want to whitelist and then their identity based citizens house would be able to veto those decisions like that is very different than just like a straight up token holders alt vote um and so like that is kind of the point here is like we all know that like token voting is like not necessarily the best and like this lets you bring in that more subjective governance process that you may want to be creative with even if it is just straight take on holder governance I would argue that the majority token holder governance as a collective would make a better decision than everyone doing it individually but when you also introduce something like this where you allow identity based governance to be able to have additional rights like that is a very clear advantage over these other ones where you're entirely subject to like okay what are the token holders decide [Music] um so this was like kind of related to that like who's the monopolist in the scenario um there are like short-term monopolist powers of like whoever is the sequencer slash whoever is the validator in these protocols I would argue like the much more important Monopoly power on like any rational time span is like whoever chooses those people so whether that's the token holders the governance like whatever your mechanism is and this is like a similar quote again out of like Danny Ryan's post which is like yeah like Lido could become in that position like that's an important reason for dual governance um but that is like that is a power that you want that you don't want to be handing over and like I don't think that is the power that the sequencer reasonably has like yes they can do things on a very short time Horizon then you can immediately remove them and they lose all of their future Revenue like I think that latter person is the person who's actually in control there clearly so that was a quick summary I mean like proof of stake like it makes sense for protocols that are permissionless they don't want opinionated government it's like that makes sense for ethereum but like clearly lsts will rise and they do help decentralize meaningfully in my mind like Lido adds to the decentralization of ethereum like very clearly I'm like just just look at the operators and distribution of like versus if everyone just gave that stake to coinbase like it's clearly significantly better so some form of dual government is also necessary in my mind proof of governance like I I think that too many Roll-Ups are just over indexing too like okay this is what ethereum did so we need to do the same thing but I think that they're just like they're fundamentally building for a different thing like ethereum is building four Roll-Ups Roll-Ups are building for users primarily and they're like optimizing for very different things because they're already paying their base layer for all of those types of assurances um so I do think that this is like very viable for them because they do have very different priorities and because sequences are fundamentally just like less powerful than like L1 validators in particular like as like they are getting this finality and like you immediately like that cost to reorg effectively goes back to zero when you're posting to the layer one like they are very short-term guarantees um this is like kind of the key I would say synthesis of the whole argument is like as a summary if we put things back together just like how does proof of stake end up playing out you do some form of simple dpos and okay Capital holders like they want some form of liquidity we want delegation of stake away liquid taking arises like that's very natural it's Capital efficient it's better but we have that principal agent problem so we introduce dual governance and what did we end up with at the end of the day is a total separation of capital and labor because that's where all the economic incentives are and we have a governance mechanism that is aligned with our chain that manages the delegate selection so the only questions at this point remaining are really do we want to let that delegation sit outside the protocol do we want to have this taking mechanism let you know Lido rocketball whoever decide that and then we like try to rein them in with like some sort of veto right slash have a market there or do we just like in-house that because we have our own governance we don't need to let them decide slash we don't need to leak value out to some other protocol that's going to like take you know a chunk of all the revenues and then why add these Financial derivatives like like I came from like a financial derivatives background before this and like I like I'm rather opposed to just like layering on a bunch of financial derivatives on top of the consensus layer if they're unnecessary like they tend to introduce a lot of hidden risks that we like don't particularly understand and like I don't think it's a Pandora's Box that needs to be opened for Roll-Ups necessarily and in particular if we realize that it's primarily a voting mechanism it's not like an incentive compatible like deterrent so we don't necessarily need it and I think that is a risk that is like better to avoid um so it's not even that like proof of God governance is like this like perfect thing I think that this is inevitably where you end up if you just play out the economics I think this is like this is the rational Market outcome of letting these economics play out is this is where you end up it is the governance it is the changes that is in control in the best case so why not just like enshrine that and put it in the best way um this is the reason that like I'm kind of like skeptical about it like governance is really hard I like do not doubt that um it's really really hard to do this like just saying like oh yeah go replicate everything that lydo does um but in particular for like chains like optimism like arbitrary Etc that have an octave that have a very involved governance so that is thoughtful and is able to decide like these are the delegates that are aligned for us I think that makes a lot of sense um this is PBS day and I didn't really talk about PBS um you could do PBS with all these and I think it like actually makes it easier because when you have a permission set um you've like the simplest example would be like you're kind of back to like the Mev gethi days uh more so where it's harder if you're trying to optimize for like boost like oh yeah we need validator number one million to be able to do this and like we can't trust them if you have like 10 people five people whatever it is that you can kind of trust them makes it a lot easier to like not have a lot of these censorship and sensorization problems like the sequencer can like add transactions in and you trust them kind of not to screw you um and that is all these are the slides thank you and I'm I have no idea where I am on time I'm assuming I'm over and that Tina is up next well in fact we're switching water a little bit but before we do that um one question from the audience anyone all right oh it's gonna be a tie hi um really enjoyed that thank you and it's in line with uh mostly aligned with most of that one question I do have is how do you think proof of governance affects liveness and the relationship between that and censorship resistance right because there does seem to be some use cases you know maybe it's a governance vote maybe it's uh D5 liquidation maybe it's sort of a you know a game that's being built on an L3 that requires very strong liveness guarantees and it strikes me there are a lot of instances where liveness failures can actually be censorship resistance failures so I'd be interested to get your perspective on how whoever or not proof of governance changes that and your thoughts in general yeah I mean it's definitely primarily like one of the largest reasons I think that you should at least decentralize the sequencer to some capacity even if you don't need to go to a meaningful extent it is the simple fact of like yeah servers go down like that is not a good thing for any application whether it's high value or low value I would say the like absolute minimum that I would want is even if you have a default centralized sequencer as governant votes of okay we have these like five backup hot like backup sequencers that okay if x number of blocks are missed like we just go to the next one we go to the next one just like down the list and then open it up after that so I do think it is like critical even if you want like a default centralized sequencer because it is super efficient just like have one person giving you these guarantees but be ready to go like these are the governance elected people that we trust to fill in for us similarly for censorship um I think it is like again it is easier in my mind to like do the PBS stuff when you don't have to trust like validator number one million you could say like hey we have 20 of them and like the Builder becomes less of a choke point now because like okay they can see the block they can add in the rest of the transactions like it looks more like I've got which is helpful and then also just the simple composition of like the sequencer set themselves is I think it is much easier to get like a graph that looks like the Lido distribution graph versus if you just like let staking economics play out it's like what you really care about here for censorship resistance there is like it's not like what are what's the composition of the last like five percent of validators how many are in there it's how many do you need to get to one third slash 51 slash two-thirds um and I think this is the clearest way to get like a very broad composition across that and then you could also add another mechanisms if you want like multiplicity Etc to help with that as well great question a great answer I'm really curious need of next question so I'm gonna let you ask away can you elaborate on why you think this is more appropriate for Roll-Ups rather than l1's I I remember on the slide you mentioned the permission list part of it which I I do agree with but can you elaborate more yeah so I I guess I would say oversimplifying there it's not necessarily just a layer one versus Layer Two like as kind of shown in like a lot of the screenshots there like one of the people who's been like starting to tweet about this lately is like a sunny and like I think this makes sense also for like plenty of Cosmos L ones where it's it's very similar to what I'm describing with the Roll-Ups of like okay we have a very clear tight-knit Community there's like a line on like what our values are we have an active governance process like we are able to manage this so it's more of a neutral slash permissionless bass layer is like what you're going for um that like would not want this like it's just not an option so ethereum is a perfect example of like obviously they cannot do what I'm describing like it would make no sense um and that is reasonable in my mind because particularly for the bass lawyer like that is generally the area that you're looking for like okay we want you to become completely credibly neutral like no subjective process even if like the free market economics are like kind of concerning in the long run I think it's also the place where like you have a best shot of like winning that battle I would say quote unquote where if the economic incentives are to like okay you know centralize all this like there has to be like some kind of soft pressure against that and I think like ethereum is a type of place where even if there's like a slight incentive to centralize it more like there is a very strong community and like a very strong push for decentralization I think that's like a winnable battle to like very intentionally keep it decentralized subjectively um so they're they're different optimizations for different chains so it's not necessarily just an L1 versus an L2 I think that just generally speaking broad brush Strokes like l2s tend to fall in that latter category of like more opinionated more active governance and are optimizing more for real-time guarantees as opposed to like neutrality and long-term uh like nuclear war type resistance all right thank you John thank you for your 2x speed um
