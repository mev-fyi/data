all right uh it's so nice to be around other people who are as passionate and also nerdy about modular blockchains as I am and as our team is um and it's also really humbling to have seen the growth of the modular ecosystem uh in the last year since the first modular Summit and it's all thanks to you guys out there in the audience the builders and the Believers who are turning the vision of modular blockchains into reality uh you know day by day by building all this stuff so um today my talk is going to be about light nodes so you know if you're on Twitter in the last few months you may have seen a bunch of these memes circulating people were joking about running Celestia light nodes in the club or on their covet test and there were just Twitter for like a few days was just filled with all these memes about Celestial light nodes and honestly it was hilarious it was awesome I was stoked I'm glad that the community was embracing light nodes but at the same time I I had a little fear that people were gonna miss the Deep significance behind light nodes what they represent light nodes are not just a meme they're actually a movement and they're crucial to the success of modular blockchains and therefore to crypto and also therefore to the future of mankind and to explain why I'm saying that we have to cover some some first principles and kind of get really high level for a second so I love this quote by you've all know Harari in the book sapiens he says that humans have the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers and this is something that you might not think about on a daily basis but if you were alone as a single human there's not much that you could do you wouldn't be you probably wouldn't even survive that long but when we get together in groups and we cooperate we're able to achieve some pretty incredible things and this is a feature of human beings that really sets us apart as a species and makes us as successful as we are today um one way to think about this a good analogy is the difference between a single celled bacterium and a multicellular organism like a human being itself so when cells in biology get together and cooperate they're able to build much more powerful complex things and the same is true for for human beings so in in nature human beings can't actually cooperate in group sizes above 150 which is the so-called Dunbar number and this brings us to a really important concept of what we're going to be talking about for the rest of this presentation which is this notion of social scalability So within any given system of cooperation there's a limit to the the maximum group size that it can support and one of the really cool uh sort of arcs of History has been that over time human beings have been able to transcend this Dunbar number and continuously uh you know find systems where they can cooperate in larger and larger groups and with each time that we're able to innovate and sort of take the step towards larger scale cooperation and coordination we have an increase in prosperity and all these big benefits to to everyone and so you know in ancient times or prehistory you know we would collaborate in the sizes of an order of magnitude of a few hundred people like tribes and then as things got more advanced and we had more systems of cooperation we could cooperate at the scale of city-states you know tens of thousands or maybe a hundred thousand people and in modern times we are cooperating at the scale of nation states so Millions tens of millions sometimes hundreds or even in in some cases a billion people within a nation and this has kind of been this Arc of progress for Humanity um and so now I want to talk a bit about like how have how does our current technology or systems of cooperation work so the way that they currently work uh is you know everyone starts out with a set of rules it's like laws it's like the Constitution or the Bill of Rights um or or the bylaws of a corporation you have a set of rules that everyone that's in the system is agreeing to follow right and this sort of sets the ground rules but unfortunately uh it doesn't end there because you can't just trust everyone else to actually follow the rules as they're written so you need some way of enforcing the rules so in lots of our current systems you have to empower a person or a group of people to be the rulers or you know they're given a special power that they get to enforce the rules on everyone else and this works but it comes with a really deep flaw and that flaw is summed up in this question who watches the Watchmen in other words you know who is actually uh enforcing the rules on the enforcers and the answer is that really no one is you're just trusting them and uh the problem with that is that they often have an incentive to cheat and that's what corruption is that's what uh you know fraud is is when the The Watchmen are not actually being watched and they they go off and do their own thing and so this is a really deep problem in our current systems of cooperation and we got a really timely reminder of that last year with what happened with FTX unfortunately and although a lot of people interpreted FDX as an example of why crypto is broken it's actually the exact opposite it's an example of why we need to build better systems cooperation and uh you know build blockchains and decentralize things and that is really core to this whole Space uh is this idea that trust doesn't scale or at least trust in other human beings to be honest is not a scalable form of cooperation and so that's why in blockchain space we use these words constantly trust minimized um trustless decentralized all these things are pointing towards the fact that the problem that blockchains are trying to solve is we're trying to remove trust from our systems of cooperation because they trust represents a vulnerability like a weak point that can be exploited and if we want to achieve a greater degree of social scalability we need to find something better and the answer is trusting in cryptography rather than other people and so how do blockchains work how are they different to our Legacy forms of cooperation well they start with a set of rules just like the previous example and oftentimes this is called like a social contract and but instead of having a particular group or individual who gets empowered uh to enforce the rules on everyone else it's actually the people the users of the blockchain that enforce the rules directly and so you'll notice that there isn't this sort of like power hierarchy uh it's it's kind of like a direct relationship between the people and the rules and this is really powerful and unfortunately a lot of people map the old mental model of cooperation onto blockchains and they assume that oh it's the validators who are given this privilege they get to enforce the rules they're like the the new rulers in this uh blockchain based world and that is not the case um and if it were the case then there would be nothing special about blockchains it'd just be a repeat of our old systems of cooperation and we could all like forget about that we're building them and go home and give up um so this is really really not how it works and I hope this is probably one of the most widespread misconceptions in the space um so how do users actually enforce the rules directly it sounds kind of weird or like confusing uh how it could possibly work well the way that users enforce the rules of the chain is that they run a node and a node is a computer program that has an understanding of what the rules of the blockchain are and then it constantly Audits and verifies the chain to make sure none of the rules are being broken and if the rules do get broken they stop them before they happen so running a node is how users enforce the rules of the chain and this gives blockchains their fundamental value proposition this superpower which is that blockchains enable rules without rulers so using blockchains we're able to dissolve this power hierarchy we're able to remove the need for this trusted power powerful entity in the system and that enables us now that we're rather than trusting in other human beings to be honest if we can just trust in cryptography all of a sudden we can scale our cooperation we can achieve a social scalability that extends to the entire planet because everyone can agree on entrusting in cryptography and in verifying cryptographic proofs um and now this sounds amazing but unfortunately there is a catch and that catches that even though blockchains achieve very high social scalability they don't achieve very high technical scalability um basically technical scalability is the fact that they can't really process that many transactions per unit time so they can't actually support that many users uh this is why for example ethereum is always congested um and to understand why the blockchains are not very technically scalable you have to understand what's actually happening under the hood inside of a node so when you're running a full node and you're verifying the chain you have to download and verify every single transaction that every other user sends so uh unfortunately users are just people right they're normal people like you and me they have a certain amount of bandwidth that they can download transaction data and they have a certain amount of computer power that they can use to verify these transactions and so that sets a finite limit an upper bound to the throughput of the chain if you exceed that then all of a sudden the users can't verify the chain anymore and you lose the property of social scalability so a lot of chains when they're quote scaling what they're doing is they're increasing the node requirements so if you create no requirements obviously you can run the chain faster and process more transactions but then end users like you and me average people get priced out of the ability to verify the chain and instead of running a full node they can run instead a light client and a light client is basically what it does is it assumes that the validators are honest it assumes that the validators are honestly enforcing the rules and even though it's very technically scalable to run a light client that's not very socially scalable because you're reintroducing this power Dynamic and the this trust vulnerability with by empowering the validators once again so um that's why blockchain scaling is so difficult is because you have this dilemma between social scalability and Technical scalability where you know you want to increase the throughput of the chain so you can support lots and lots of users but that's what we all want we all want Mass adoption we all want everyone to be able to use the same chain but the problem is that in this current Paradigm we can't do that without also sacrificing social scalability and social scalability is a whole reason we're building blockchains in the first place this is why you know when Bitcoin forked the the Bitcoin Fork that survived was the one that maintained social scalability um and it would seem like and that that's why basically we had this promise of hey we can rebuild this like a trust Network in cryptography that scales to the entire planet but then actually it turns out we can't really get there because we we need to achieve both Technical and social scalability at the same time to actually make that practical um and that's that's the sort of the state of things that's where things were up until 2018 and 19 when uh a Galaxy brain dude named Mustafa al-basam who was just up here published uh two papers that described an entirely new way of building blockchains uh which is called which are called modular blockchains and at their core modular blockchains defined a new way for people to verify blockchains in a way that can be both technically and socially scalable and the the way that it works is that unlike in a monolithic chain we have to download every transaction and verify every single one you just in a modular blockchain you just have to download a tiny sample of the transaction data and then you can verify a proof that the transactions are valid that they follow the rules of the chain so in doing this you're able to verify lots and lots and lots of transactions that the other users are sending but without having to do so much work and really importantly this technique scales sub-linearly to the uh Inc to an increase in transactions so it fundamentally solves this sort of dilemma and results in the whole uh you know purpose of this talk is this new type of node called a light node which has the security and decentralization properties of a full node but it has the technical scalability of a light client and and so light nodes are the core innovation of modular blockchains and there how we can actually have blockchains that scale both technically and socially at the same time and you can see this represented in the specs for a Celestia Knight light node as compared to nodes and other ecosystems in many cases as orders of magnitude less resources are required to verify the chain and that brings me to a really important value of the entire modular blockchain movement not just Celestia which is that we believe anyone anywhere should be able to verify the blockchain they should be able to run a light node and enforce the rules of the chain themselves oh and that's why we have targeted the specs of the celestial light node to be able to be run on a smartphone because a smartphone is the most widely adopted device in the world estimated 5.3 billion people worldwide own a smartphone so if we can if every one of those people can run a light node then we can achieve a maximum degree of social scalability all those 5.3 billion people could be connected together in a cryptographic network of trust and so we could with modular blockchains actually achieve this Holy Grail of of scaling cooperation to the entire planet um now again it's a really big vision and I firmly believe in it but I'm not going to lie to you there's still a lot of work that needs to be done so at the protocol level this is sort of a call to action to all the protocol engineers and Builders out there there's a ton of work that we still need to do to make light nodes actually technically possible I mean they are technically possible we have Celestial light nodes working on test Nets and soon on our main net when we launch but there's so many other layers to the stack we need better proof systems all these things listed here are going to be really crucial to be built out to make this Vision a reality so there's a lot of engineering still to be done and there's also a component of friction right we need to make it really really easy and simple for users to run light nodes and you know current status quo is that you have to open a terminal window and do command line and that is way too much friction for the average person as you know and so if if that remains that way we're not really going to get very far in terms of adoption but fortunately there's amazing people like Josh on our team who have been building you know desktop apps and hopefully in the future mobile apps so that it can be just a few clicks between uh you know starting up a light node and I think that's really where we need to start moving towards and and the last thing is I think we need to even embed light nodes into user-facing infrastructure like wallets and that way in the same way that we can have you know the Privacy Community has this notion of private by default in the modular blockchain Community we can have a notion and a value of verify by default and lastly we actually need to make light nodes into a meme so light nodes need to be embedded deeply within our culture as for those of us who believe in modular blockchains like running a light node should become a habit it should become a ritual even a rite of passage for being part of of what we're building and what we're doing and uh if you haven't yet run a light node we have a booth outside and we're also teaching a workshop tomorrow and so I invite you to to join and give it a try and and be baptized uh in the the modular movement so the amazing thing is that the meme is working as you guys have seen people are actually putting light node to use in practice running it in all different kinds of places in the world on planes on boats at the pyramids people have been running them on all kinds of devices Kindles uh gaming consoles and even in this instance on on their car and uh so it's cool there's a momentum that there's this cultural momentum that we have and we need to to keep it going and so I really hope that you guys do your part and participate now you might be wondering though okay this is really cool but like you know why why should I care um well the answer is that you and why should I care and why should I go through the effort of running a light node you know it is it's a busy world I only have so much time in my day why should I bother well the answer is you you should care and you should make an effort to run a light node because we're we're living in a world where our rights and our freedoms are being increasingly infringed upon by people in power and even if it's done with the best intentions it's it's really dangerous and it's something that we we shouldn't tolerate and so we need to run light nodes as a way to sort of stand up for our own rights and and build a system where we can't be taken advantage of and we've seen this all over the place we've seen you know in Canada the the financial system was used as a way to suppress protests by freezing people's bank accounts we've seen with Twitter files and a lot of recent news that Facebook and lots of social media companies have been censoring information because of government requests there's also widespread surveillance on the internet and I don't think it's a coincidence that trust in our institutions is at all-time lows um I think people are waking up to the realization that the people in power don't always have our best interests at heart and the amazing thing is that you know our ancestors when they had to defend their rights and their freedom they had to pick up weapons and go to war right they had to put their lives on the line and and fight for what they believed in and the beautiful thing is that with light nodes we we have a peaceful alternative we can build a new sort of like fabric of society and build our own rules and build our rights in a way that can't be compromised and we don't even have to like fight it's it's just software it's just code so and last but not least like it's not just about defending your rights running light nodes is an opportunity for us to take this next leap to large-scale cooperation and coordination and rebuild a network of cryptographic Trust on which we can build a more peaceful prosperous and Democratic Society and so um I actually happen to have a this is kind of complicated I happen to have a node on my phone right here running hopefully you guys can see that and so what I want all of you to do with me is if you could reach into your pocket or your bag and and pull out your phone and hold in the air with me let's go guys but I'm up I want you to hold up keep them raised I want you to realize that what you're holding in your hand is not just a phone or a camera or a computer it's the key to your rights it's the key to your freedom and it's the key to a better future for Humanity so thank you very much
