thank you very much always good to be introduced by an astronaut gives me some special um special status here thank you thank you great all right so today I'm going to talk about this new protocol that we just uh uh design in the past few months and currently building right now so yeah so Bitcoin sticking all right so let's first understand what's the problem we're trying to address here so okay the problem we're trying to address is the proof of stick security by definition proof of stick means that the security is sticked protected by capital and therefore Capital intensive so right now many of these chains are paying pretty high reward for staking ranging from five percent in ethereum to 20 40 on a cosmos chain so this is very expensive and right now this cost is paid by basic inflation of the coin so inflation is not good you don't want to inflate the current until it's necessary there's also a pretty big competition between the utility of the coin and the stick and the security and so we would like to reduce this tension and reduce the cost of capital in general okay so that's the problem trying to solved and the way we try to solve this problem is to recognize that outside is proof of thick World there is another world in the crypto land which is basically Bitcoin so proof of Stack has slightly less than 50 of the market cap Bitcoin has slightly more than 50 of the market cap so the observation here is that Bitcoin can be a source of capital for sticking so let's think about why it is a good source of capital for sticking okay everyone has some Bitcoins all right but most of them has next to zero yield so most of Bitcoin is actually idle so idle Bitcoin means that this Bitcoin or you are not competing like for example ethereum for yield for D5 for example so providing a stacking option for them is could be attractive all right number two is that the Bitcoin holders in general are quite decentralized at least more decentralized compared to many proof of stake chains so by providing Bitcoin as a stacking asset that would also help to decentralize your network three Bitcoin relatively is the least volatile asset within the crypto Market and we've done some study on that the volatility of Bitcoin is less than half of many assets so if you combine the three together you can think of Bitcoin is actually a pretty excellent staking asset sticking asset so our idea was to use this Bitcoin asset 600 billion worth of staking asset potentially to secure all the proof of stick chains in the world okay so all right let's think about this a little bit more right let's step back and think about this so Bitcoin from Bitcoin you provide security to approval select chain in return Bitcoin holders can get yield from these chains now these chains are already providing yield but they're providing very high yield to extract native token to have a large supply of Bitcoin and a relatively stable market value is a good source of capital for these chains so that is the um assumption that is the uh problem we're trying to solved okay all right so uh why is this not a trivial problem so okay so so far this is the setup of the problem our goal is to use Bitcoin to secure proof of stake chain so what do we call this concept so we are in some sense inventing A New Concept here and this New Concept we called Bitcoin stacking okay so if you look at this concept it's going to wear a constant weird name right because Bitcoin everyone associate with proof of work staking of course is a natural key Concept in previous Tech how can we put these two words together it doesn't make sense right but actually it does make sense because Bitcoin although is a proof of work chain it is still an asset it's a student asset it's still a crypto asset and we're saying we're using this very secure crypto asset secured by proof of work two secure approval section or to add security approval section so Bitcoin sticking okay so anyone have any question about this concept all right okay man I do sound like a Professor or something like that yes it's like habit it's hard to break habit oh there's a question all right thank you very much thank you very much okay it's just a money bond for you to not make mistakes yeah yeah yeah but of course it's a collateral right yeah yes maybe someone else can come up with that idea yeah what I'm trying to say but I just focused on bitcoin yeah that's fine I'm just saying um it's it's a pow uh coin right so if you use that to provide security to a POS chain yes um then um it's the same as any other asset to secure those POs change it's a crypto asset though yeah I think but it's also an asset in which a lot of people wants to hold that's true right so what we're saying is this right when we're thinking about the assistance suppose you're you're a um person and your choice is the following okay you want to buy some altcoin and earn Alcorn yield okay or this is now giving you an option you can buy Bitcoin and get outcome you okay so that's a pretty I think interesting concept right because then you can reduce the volatility of your principle but still get some upside on the yield okay so that's the setup good thank you very much yeah and more questions okay good yeah good thank you thank you see the the trick of a good professor is to get the student answer each other questions you know that's the challenge yeah okay thank you all right okay so now we shift a little bit more to the technology right so there's a problem we're trying to solve so why is it why is this problem challenging well it is basically a two-sided market right we have Bitcoin holders on the left hand side and proof of thick chains on the right hand side so on the left hand side we want to make sure that this is a very secure experience for them because Bitcoin holders are very conservative they don't want to lose the Bitcoin so this protocol should protect the BTC stickers holders very strongly okay on the other thing on the other hand for the proof of Stack chain they want to get security from the Bitcoin in particular they want it to be a true security so that in case there's anything bad happens then they can slash the Bitcoin stickers okay so the slashing therefore has to be very sharp it is only under bad behavior of Nevada where that slashing occur and not under any other circumstances okay all right so this is the problem that we solve so we came up with a protocol a Bitcoin sticking protocol which essentially solves this dual objective of protecting both sides of the market all right so um now the biggest challenge actually to achieve this is the fact that Bitcoin doesn't have a smart contract okay so I'll come back to this point a little bit later but the constraint is that there are no smart contract Bitcoin okay now what we can achieve is full security so food slashing through slashing so in other words value just do bad things we can slash the Bitcoin and number two is we can do trustless sticking which means that there is no bridging no bridging of the Bitcoin from the Bitcoin chain to the proof of stick chain through custodial or otherwise okay through a centralized custodial or otherwise okay so let's think about these two objectives are these two properties that we achieve um the first one is to provide full security to bitcoin chain right that's the right side of the market the second one is to provide food protection to the Bitcoin holders that's the second one now if you relax one of them for example if you bridge the Bitcoin from the Bitcoin chain to the proof of exchange through some rap asset like rap BTC then it's quite easy to achieve full security because now your token is as though it's sitting on the proof of stake chain your smart contract Improvement State chain you can do all the slashing you want okay now however we don't want to bridge to the Bitcoin stays on the Bitcoin chain but we don't have a smart contract and Bitcoin chain to do the slashing so thereby that's the challenge of the problem and in fact uh that is kind of coming to the heart of why so many Bitcoins are idle so many because either precisely because there is no smart contract no Intelligence on this market chain so it's very hard to securely Bridge the money away and get it back okay all right so what we're saying is that for this particular use case of providing security very important use case I think uh there's no bridging needed okay so how do we do this so let's run through um experience from a sticker so Alice has one Bitcoin what LS do is assigns the contract a stacking contract a sticking contract under Bitcoin chain uh Bitcoin doesn't have Smart contract but it does have a scripting language which allows you to write some very simple contract so in this simple contract there are two possibly we're spending this Bitcoin either Alice can withdraw this Bitcoin and claim back the Bitcoin in say three days okay this is a standard unbonding with some delay okay second Alice will burn the BTC into burn address okay so these are the only two ways of spending this Bitcoin both of which are controlled by Alice most of which are controlled by us so this is a self-custodial contract no third party yeah exactly exactly why would Alice burning his own money right her own money that doesn't make sense at all this option is needed though because we needed to have an option of slashing Alice this is where the second option is so let's yeah so wait one minute all right good question though all right so so Alice after um signing this contract can now validate a proof of stick chain okay so Alice to tie the two system together Alice will use the same key that control the address that controls the BTC addressed to assign blocks to assign blocks on the proof of section okay I'll tell you a little bit more about how the signing is done but right now we're using the same key and so in the happy path Alice will be behaving honestly honestly and will continue validating blocks and improve of stake chain and the money will stay on the Bitcoin chain until Alice wants to resign or wants to withdraw the money and after a few days Alice will claim back the stick and obtain the reward good this is a happy path now in the unhappy path in the unhappy path okay Alice will turn evil and now tries to do something bad on the proof of State chain the bad the worst thing you can do improve of State chain is to create a fork on The Proven stick chain okay now this is a slashable offense creating a fork in fact it's the one of the very few slashable offense to protect the safety of the chain so what we can do using cryptography is that using a special modification of Alice signature what we can do is to force Alice Key Alice private key to be leaked to be leaked this enables anybody to send a transaction back to the proof of stake chain to slash Alice okay to slash Alice now how do I go back do I go back here I don't know how to go back maybe here I don't know okay go back good okay all right okay so now anybody can activate can pretend to be Alice and activate the second path so this answers the question of why Alice will ever burn the PC because it has done something bad and that's something bad will force the review of the private key which will automatically enable anybody to slash this money okay so this allows flashing to happen very good so that's basically the key um design we have some extra additional complexities protocol for example we would like to allow a fast and bonding of the stake BDC to ensure that the Bitcoin holders can maintain High liquidity this is achieved by providing some kind of synchronization between the Bitcoin chain and a proof of selection like Cosmos in this like osmosis in this example so we need some cross chain synchronization and we already have a Time stamping protocol if you have heard my uh my talk at Cosmo verse for example last year we built a timestamping protocol which allows precisely the synchronization so that enables us to do fast and bonding and more importantly or in the context of this summit we're in a modular Summit okay so someone asked me what the hell your talk has to do with modularity and then very quickly I have to think about something uh it turns out that actually our protocol is very modular so we want to so our vision right in the first line is to be able to provide Bitcoin security through staking Bitcoin staking to as many previously change in the world okay so if our protocol has to adapt to change everybody's proof of stake protocol forget it nobody wants to change the protocol so how we designed it is we designed using a modular tool called fanatic Gadget okay so fanatic Gadget is a concept invented by vitalik many years ago six years ago around which essentially is a way to add a modular addition to the proof of stake chain to any previous stake chain to give you additional finality functioning and in this case the functionality we add is we can think of as BTC validated BTC value the finality okay so because the revealing of the private key requires some special signature that's why we have to add this vanity Gadget because the original protocol will not be using the signature in fact you could be using another signature like EDU ed1441519 something like that two five five one nine yes okay all right okay so this allows us to broaden the application to many different chains um okay so so modularity we use this constant for another Gadget already mentioned started in this paper cast for the Friendly Ghost friendly for another Gadget Casper FFG invented by vitalik and we had a paper uh two years ago which have a secure design of this finale Gadget so finale Gadget is a concept invented by vitalik but there's some security issues with the design we fixed that in this paper um okay so we applied similar concept here all right so here's the architecture of the whole system you can think of there's a data plane and there's a control plane so in the data plane the validators will be using these special signatures to provide BTC security to all these chains whatever change that was accepted as a BTC stake on the control plane Babylon will be running a timestamping protocol some kind of interface that allows the BTC to be synchronized with all these chains synchronous always change Babylon itself will also be BTC secured okay so that's the architecture that we have all right so we have built this architecture to some extent we already have a Time stamping test that so now there are 31 chains 31 Cosmos chains Cosmos SDK chains sitting on our test net synchronized with the Bitcoin chain synchronized with the Bitcoin chain uh you can visit the website okay all right so finally I think this is a pretty interesting use case for Bitcoin uh Bitcoin can't really leave the Bitcoin change securely but it can be used to secure proof of stake chain securely so security means two things here one security to the proof of stick chain two security to the sticker as well and through this we're hoping to provide some integration to the two economies thank you [Applause] [Music] what are the steps to mainnet and what progress with this 31 chains yeah the 31 changes on the timestamping test net the next step is we're going to evolve this test percentage of BTC sticking test net and invite all these 31 chains and more chance to join to do the BTC stacking and then we want to involve the main net to our Target is to launch the main app before the next halfing okay so can you give an example what kind of decision would the governance of any of these chains it will see let's say in a governance proposal right to vote if I'm a holder of uh any of the governance token on these genes what what it would be example of a we propose to enable X and Y like what will it say The Proposal okay we allow a certain percentage of our sticking market cap to be BT system okay think about it it's like an investment portfolio I allow instead of right now it's all stocks 5 or 30. I said hey I don't want all stocks I don't have authority I want some bonds I want 30 bonus in my portfolio 40 bonds that is decided by the government's proposal thank you thank you well then another question uh uh what are the main challenges that are yet to be resolved for this to to go live on mainnet and actually be usable by some of these consumer chains yeah the challenges were will be a is a two-sided market so the challenge will be to bring two sides onto the table we have to get some uh some BTC holders to stick and some change to accept the sticking through the governor's proposal and how would the other side the consumer side interact with with the protocol let's see okay right question is that so Dave for example he was a customer consensus we would add this fanatic gadget on top of the tournament and this will be a software upgrade so this will also be a software governance proposal change and it will this finality Gadget what would it do finalized okay man and then after it's finalized then we will assign an extra round of signatures to do a BTC finalization of the block and these signatures will be the special signatures for which give you double sign they will the private key will be leaked and how will this uh then get to that point of a private key of Alice being leaked like what will actually trigger the transaction where does dialysis private key is stored get some store anyway but just from the signatures on the two blocks that you double signing we can extract anyone who observed these two signatures will be able to extract the Privacy I see let's have that be the final question you guys could do further q a thank you thank you back there thank you David thank you excellent talk thank you thank you
