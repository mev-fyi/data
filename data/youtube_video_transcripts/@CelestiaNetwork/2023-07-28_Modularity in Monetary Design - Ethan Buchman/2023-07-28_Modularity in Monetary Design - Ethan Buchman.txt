all right thanks zucki thanks everyone so here we are about to talk about the future of France and all these losers just left the room so they're going to miss out but lucky for you guys uh so yeah so I'm I'm Ethan uh if you follow me or know anything about me you know I'm really into money monetary design trying to figure this stuff all out um when I told Nick so we've been excuse me we've been working on a new project that we call collaborative Finance or Kofi it's our response to defy when I told Nick I want to talk about Kofi he said well that's not really on topic you should talk about something else so I just changed the title to modularity and monetary design and of course he was then thrilled now the thing the thing Nick probably didn't even understand was that Kofi really is about a modular payment system design based on a system of intents over which we optimize with graph solvers that publish ZK proofs of Integrity so if that's not on topic then what is right all right you know I've long felt that money is the killer app uh it's the ultimate multi-stakeholder computational use case uh and yet we failed to have the impact we'd all like to have right so I believe what's on the next slide uh is a quote from me that says if home is where the heart is money is where the payments are uh because that's what I think money is for money is money is for payments and we can talk about the modular structure of money right everyone's familiar with the three functions of money uh the unit of account is for denominating debt the medium of exchange is for discharging debt here and now and the store value is for discharging debt elsewhere or later it's a very clear formulation it'd be great if we had such a clear uh statement of the modular functions of of blockchains what I'd like to point out is that I wish I had uh what I'd like to point out is that between these different modular functions are tensions right and and when we're when we're building modular systems modular designs part of what what they do is they allow us to focus in on the tensions between the different functions so it's not enough to just say okay these pieces are modular and so we've got this modular thing over here and and that over there there's real tensions between the functions that we need to tune to and so I call the tension between the unit of account the medium of exchange liquidity which is what much of what we're going to talk about um today and the other I'm writing a Blog series about all this so you can check it out uh but I won't go into it because I'm probably going to running out of time all right I believe the the next slide says something like okay armed with a unit of account we can denominate unlimited structures of liability right I can say you owe me you owe whoever right we can denominate all this debt but then the problem is how do we ensure that we can actually discharge it all right you go you create all this debt structure and then how are you going to discharge it all this is the this is the fundamental problem of the banking system of money of payments of finance that all this stuff is sort of sort of built on top of right and next slide um good thing I actually practice uh so we call this problem liquidity right the ability to ensure that you can actually discharge your debts that's what liquidity means liquidity is not how much slippage you're going to have when you trade one coin for another right it's not uh you know how many assets are available on some amm we call that liquidity because the purpose of trading is to acquire an asset so that you can discharge a debt right if all you're doing is trading just you know to trade monkey pictures or see your the value of your assets go up or you're not doing anything real in in the real world the whole point of exchange and everything we're building ultimately needs to be in service of discharging debt because that's where we that's where we ground ourselves in the real world and real trust relationships and and and and and so on right so we need to we need to keep that in mind now next slide uh the uh the way we solve or address the liquidity problem they're so pretty right here we go so we did this slide we did this slide just dwell on that meditate on this for a while okay this is this is this is pretty fundamental stuff yeah um we did this slide we are here okay so what's a payment system we defined a payment system as a set of obligations right these are the debts plus the liquidity Source we can use to discharge those obligations right now if you think about that definition for a minute you might be like well wait a minute all these things I call Payment Systems you know fintech banking blockchains all of them are just about the liquidity Source they're just about moving assets around none of them actually do anything to represent the obligations right so none of them are actually satisfying this definition of a payment system which is a problem because if we're going to build the next generation of payment systems we need to address this okay so let me let me briefly give you a critique of of existing payment system now we're working on a white paper for this Kofi stuff that's really what I'm presenting here um that'll be coming out in the next uh you know two weeks TM but uh you know so so first of all we'll cover this very very quickly none of these payment systems are designed from first principles they're all just like cobbled together over the years responding to you know various problems um it's all just about asset transfer and exchange but there's so much more to to the core problem of of payment and and finance and what we're doing then asset transfer in exchange we have to actually look at the underlying obligations now we're talking about exchange so much of exchange today both in in the banking system and in the real world uh uh sorry and in the banking system and in the blockchain world it's all about Market making and dealers that's that's what everyone's trying to do bring dealers on board you know amms liquidity all this stuff that is a new model that developed after the collapse of the banking system in the 16th century now I promised Tebow I wouldn't talk about the 16th century today so I'm not going to if you think that's great like oh great he's not going to talk about history your part of the problem because we all need to learn a little bit more history and fundamentally if we're responding to this issue of central banks we all think oh you know we're going after central banks central banks emerged in response to the collapse of a prior International banking system that ran in the 16th century that cleared all the Trade Credit in Europe without almost any money at all we need to understand that we need to understand what happened why it failed and how central banks emerged out of that chaos to lead us from a world of clearing to a world of liquidity providing right basically since then Society has been structurally short volatility all these dealers all these market makers they're short volatility that is not a way to set yourself up for sustainability it's a way to compound moral hazard at the heart of the system yeah so obviously they constantly fail because nature is not short volatility right and so at some point you blow up and what happens Central Bank shows up prints a bunch of money bails you out right so that leads us to the fourth problem which is or the fourth element of the critique which is the problem of issuance any payment system needs to Grapple with the problem of issues whether you're blockchain you know issuing to minors uh whether you're you know a new currency like like osmosis issuing to issuing to liquidity providers or whether you're a Central Bank in a banking system doing issuance when you make loans or when you when you bail out bail out the whole system and so what we want to do is try to understand issuance in terms of the underlying obligations right one way to think about it is that hey when a when a Bitcoin miner does some proof of work right they have shipped a service to the blockchain and now the blockchain owes them the blockchain has a debt to that minor which it then discharges by issuing new Bitcoin right and so by thinking that way it kind of opens up new possibilities for thinking about the problem of issuance we think that's important because fundamentally we're going after two questions here right one is how do we design a payment system to optimally discharge debt and two is who should have the right to issue and according to what principles right now a lot of people in the blockchain space are focused on on problem two and there's a lot of you know concern around tokenomics and issuance and how we do all this stuff but there's almost no concern at all with option one no one's talking about how we discharge debt right hopefully we can start to change that hopefully you don't walk out of here being like oh he's crazy none of that matters and you're like you know I need to focus on this debt discharging problem and issuance in that context because right now who controls the issuance in the world it's the banks when they make loans they issue new money and it's the central banks when they bail out the banks they issue you know the base money what we want to do is restore the capacity to issuance to individual communities right and we need in order to do that and do that responsibly and sustainably we need to ground it in the actual Network structure of debts okay this leads us to uh ultimately to what we're building which we call collaborative finance and collaborative Finance we think of as a sort of semi-permeable membrane between the real economy and the financial economies that is that layer in the middle the yellow mtcs is our is our core algorithm multilateral Trade Credit set off of course that's a that's a well-designed marketing term that users are going to love um but but the whole idea is that we can protect people in the real economy in the bottom layer by focusing on the on the structure of credit and obligations but we can still Connect into the larger capitalist system you know so we don't have to overthrow everything at once we can sort of you know do this iteratively we can build a platform that allows lenders and and capital providers liquidity providers you know lending protocols Etc to plug in but still do it in a way that that's responsible and takes care of the real economy right and and that's really what Kobe is all about and what we're building okay so let's uh let's actually talk about the design of the system this is the the background even though I didn't talk too much about history I'm gonna I'm gonna briefly just talk about the missing primitive right the main missing primitive is the obligation right the the debt okay and we're going to use value balance sheets here the world would be a better place if everyone spent a little bit more time learning accounting and thinking about balance sheets so we're going to do some very basic uh accounting here on stage so on the left We Have Allison Bob we have their balance sheets assets and liabilities right not very complicated this is a simple asset transfer right Alice has 20 in assets she transfers it to Bob now Bob has the assets there's no liabilities involved there's there's nothing happening this is this is what you do every time you send a payment to someone else right uh on the right we have what an obligation looks like right so now there's a liability involved Alice is declaring that she owes Bob right so she has a 20 liability to Bob and that corresponds on Bob's balance sheet to an asset right we might call this if you if you manage books at a company accounts payable accounts receivable very simple stuff right the reason I'm pointing this out is because we can we're going to build much more complicated structures that are networking these different obligations together but there's two things I want to I want to highlight here one is when you do an asset transfer between two parties right from Alice to Bob in general we can say that is in service of discharging a pre-existing debt right you're not I mean okay it might be a gift but almost almost every time Alice already owes Bob money and that's the reason she's going to send him the 20 right now we're not representing that liability here we don't represent it on our blockchains but that's exactly what we're missing right and that's the whole point of what we're trying to do to bring those obligations on chain so that we can do something more constructive with them the other thing I want to point out is that declaring an obligation what we're doing on the right in in Part B is really a permissionless action it's very much like sending money you know I can send Gary Gensler some  coins and there's nothing he can do about it if I have his address I can also declare that I owe him money and there's nothing he can do about it if I say I owe Gary money then who is he to stop me right so it's a sort of permissionless Declaration uh it is an intent if you will to pay okay so now we have these obligations we put them together into a larger Network and you get you know complicated structures you got single obligations chain Cycles if you've seen anything about Kofi if you're thinking about this to yourself you're like hey wait a minute if I can see the obligation and there's obligations in a cycle then we can clear any obligations that are in a cycle right and you can do that without any money at all I owe Gary and Gary owes I don't know Janet Yellen and Janet Yellen owes me and we can just get together and say hey we all owe each other let's just do set off right we don't need we don't need any money we can just do set off and that's what's possible when you start to open up the structure of the obligation Network and you look at the obligations you can actually save everyone cash flow liquidity you can clear more debt with less money that's what this is all about yeah okay so once you have all these obligations how do you actually discharge them and and generally speaking there are four ways to discharge or to settle obligations right almost all of modern Finance is built on the fourth one it's called Novation so when you actually change the structure of the payments graph right you do securitization or factoring or clearinghouses you you introduce intermediaries you sell your debt you factor your debt right all of this you know the economists claim this is all in service of like reducing risk and making things more efficient obviously all of that was uh was and we saw that very clearly in 2008 when when this whole you know house of cards came came tumbling down what we want to do is as much as possible as we can using the existing structure of the payments graph before we even consider Novation and it turns out there's quite a bit you can do you can do set off which we just talked about that's clearing right IOU you owe me let's just do set off or we can do it in Cycles arbitrary size there's assignment which is just normal transfer we just you know we'll use a fancier word because that's what we like to do you know I I transfer you money that's assignment it discharges the debt but then there's a very interesting thing you can do which we'll call overdraft right this is where you say draw on a credit line someone makes some credit line available to you and you can draw on that credit line to pay someone so one way you can think about this is assignment is what you can do if you have a positive balance right you have a positive balance of some asset you can assign some of those assets to someone else and use that to discharge debt overdraft is what you can do if you have access to a negative balance right someone says okay I will allow your balance to go negative and so your balance can go into negative territory you can draw on that to pay someone else this is what happens when you take out a credit line from a bank it's basically a negative balance it's what happens when you have a Mutual Credit system in both of those cases you actually have money creation happening right when you when you have a credit line from a bank and you draw down on it the bank is actually creating new money it's expanding its balance sheet and allowing you to use that that new money uh to make payments and banks are allowed to do that because they have licenses from the government but why should they get to have all the fun right we want to seize the means of of production of of money back from the banks uh for communities and figure out a way to do that responsibly and that's really what this is all about but we can also do overdraft without money creation right a pool of investors could come together and say okay we're going to pool our our Bitcoin and our osmo and our atoms into some pool here uh you know we'll do it over IBC we'll put it in this little Kofi chain and you know we will make it available to people to draw on to pay their bills right and we can do it because we're going to have access to this network structure of obligations we can do it in a much more intelligent uh and optimized and risk reduced way so it's important to keep these these different things in mind the last thing would be Novation we're not going to focus on Innovation because we want to avoid it we want to do as much as possible of set off assignment and overdraft before we hit Novation okay the last thing we need to put it all together is as as promised uh the system of intents okay so we already touched on obligations we sort of beat them to death obligations are an intent to pay that's kind of obvious yeah so then to really round this out we need tenders and acceptances so a tender is an intent to use some liquidity to discharge your obligation so I have access to some dollars or some Bitcoin or or some atoms I think I have set sunny here I didn't I didn't pop osmo enough so I have access to some osmo maybe he'll stay uh and and I say you know I'm willing to use my osmo to discharge my debts wouldn't that be great Sunday if people could use osmo to pay their bills um and uh and and and then an acceptance is the flip side of that it's saying I'm willing to accept some osmo I'm willing to accept some atom uh or Tia you know if you will right right Nick yeah uh I'm willing to accept some Tia to discharge that's owed to me right that'd be great I like Tia I like Nick I like what they're doing at the modular Summit uh and so I'm willing to accept them to you and and so you can start to collect all these different intents all the obligations the network structure the different tenders people are making which means the different kinds of liquidity they're willing to use to pay their bills the all the acceptances the different kinds of liquidity people are willing to accept in payment of their bills and we can put it all together into a graph structure and then we can run a solver over the whole graph right and we can run solvers that that draw on Decades of you know Advanced Theory and algorithms in graph Theory essentially to to find Optimal results so we can actually optimize to discharge the most amount of debt with the least amount of money while respecting everyone's references right solving over a system of intents you all love it all right so This Is What It ultimately looks like right so we represent we have our graph here we have a bunch of obligations um we have at the bottom this VB this is our liquidity Source right you can imagine it's it's uh it's osmo it's Tia atom whatever you like and we have the A on the left that's the assignment source and the O that's the overdraft Source right so those are positive and negative balances that people are able to draw on and then on the right we have repayment and deposit right that's where the money goes back to after it's uh it's sort of used it either needs to be repaid or or redeposited and basically we can use the same algorithm we use to find Cycles we can use the same algorithm with liquidity to find even more Cycles right so the addition of liquidity into the network even a little bit of liquidity a small amount of tenders or a small amount of acceptances allows us to essentially close more Loops right so more people can benefit from their debt being discharged okay there's a lot to digest in the slide you'll have to read the white paper uh we'll go into a little more detail here here we have two different liquidity sources we're going to put overdraft aside we'll just focus on assignment here right so we have aosbos e we have D O's b o c right so an obligation chain now we have access to Fiat we have access to crypto and we have b b doesn't want to use dirty Fiat he doesn't want to use coins he's only willing to settle in gold bars but he's happy to do set off right if if you owe him and he owes you he'll do set off with you but he doesn't want your dirty Fiat he doesn't want your shitty crypto he only wants gold now what's going to happen a has a tender that says well I'm willing to use Fiat to pay my debts and C has an acceptance saying I'm willing to use Fiat to to discharge my debts D is willing to use crypto and and so is e to accept crypto and what ends up happening is B benefits from both of these things so B is benefiting from A and C using Fiat and from d and e using crypto without even knowing about it D doesn't want anything to do with them he doesn't have to touch either of them all he's going to handle is a set off notice that says his debts are reduced right and his debts are being reduced because other people are using Fiat and other people are using crypto right this opens very profound new ways to bring crypto into the real economy where so long as there's a small number of people willing to Tender crypto and accept crypto others can benefit from that without having to touch it at all so long as they're willing to touch a set-off notice which is just an accounting entry okay so this offers you know really really new ways for crypto to impact the real world economy to be used in real world payments and to benefit real people without them even having to touch it which is I think a knot that we've we haven't been able to crack uh really until now this is another example um this one's a little bit more more complicated but but also quite profound where we were not able to close the loop within Fiat or within crypto we have to combine see on the previous slide you know we didn't need both liquidity sources right if we just had Fiat we'd close the loop ABC if we just had crypto we'd close the loop dbe right in this slide see uh in this slide we're we're not able to close either of those Loops we need to use both crypto and Fiat together and in this in this system because the difference here is basically uh in the previous one you know dob um you can see there's sort of that not there's not the same overlap right so here you actually need both sources of liquidity to be able to discharge everyone in the path and so you end up you're able to complete a new cycle over both sources and so the more liquidity sources you bring in even with a small amount of tenders and acceptances assuming you have a large obligation graph you're able to discharge way more debt which is very very very powerful so ultimately you put this all together you get something like this right so here's here's uh based on real data simulated it with three different liquidity sources we could say one of these is Fiat one of these is crypto one of these is Mutual Credit that's the Holy Grail Mutual Credit is communities being able to issue their own debt sorry their own currency to discharge their debt right and you get this this stunning visualization of of how everything flows in the network so that all the debt as much debt as possible can be cleared with the least amount of money while optimizing over and respecting everyone's preferences for which currencies they actually want to use uh with that I'm perfectly on time which is kind of amazing uh thank you so much I'm Buckmaster you can learn more kofi.informal.systems and check out the white paper when it's out [Applause]
