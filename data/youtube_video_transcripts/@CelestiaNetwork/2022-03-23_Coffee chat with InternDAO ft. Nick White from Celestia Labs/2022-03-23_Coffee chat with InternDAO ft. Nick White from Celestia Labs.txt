[Music] thanks everyone for joining the fourth installment of our intern dao interview series a little bit about ourselves right engine dao is a research dao and our mission ultimately is to have fun share alpha and build a decentralized future with friends so we're pleased to be hosting nick white from the celestia team today and with modularity and modular blockchains being a pretty hot topic as of recent we're excited to be able to chat with nick and learn more about celestia the first modular data availability layer and we also have hyperion from intern dao who will also be co-hosting cool so oh yeah thank you everyone for joining um nick do you want to go ahead and you know start with a quick background about yourself you know give a quick intro um you know when did you get into space when did you meet mustafa and the other guys on team um and you know when did you frankly decide to focus on celestia sure happy to so yeah i'm nick i um you got into crypto in 2018 i co-founded um another blockchain protocol called harmony which is a proof of stake and sharding blockchain and then um did that until late 2020 when i read the lazy ledger white paper and for those of you who are really in the know you know that celestia's original name was lazy ledger and basically when i read the white paper it just completely blew me away and i realized that um it was the future of watching infrastructure so i left harmony and joined the celestia labs team full time a ceo and the rest is history so uh celestia is is the first modular blockchain network and the key insight of celeste is that unlike monolithic blockchains which is pretty much every blockchain that's been built so far um we separate consensus from execution and so what that means is that like consensus is the process by which blockchains add new blocks to the chain it's where everyone agrees on what like the new transactions are and execution is where you determine what is the you know actual output or like the validity of those transactions and if you separate those two things you're able to have a more scalable system that is more decentralized more secure more flexible for developers and also solves key problems and interoperability so it enables like a true multi-chain future so that's like a really high level but i'm happy to like dig into i know more about my story or more about celestia yeah absolutely so um you know kind of going back to uh like one of the factors facts that you stated um you know as a co-founder of harmony um how do you think your background and experiences have helped shape the direction that celestia is going towards that's a really good question so i originally um was actually an electrical engineer um and i studied signal processing which is sort of like sort of like machine learning and like neural networks um and so when i fell into i got really interested in the blockchains i was lucky because a lot of what i learned in electrical engineering kind of translated over and so it's very easy for me to pick up a lot of the sort of like concepts behind cryptography and you know a lot of new concepts too like consensus algorithms and networking and all that kind of stuff but basically um the way that harmony kind of informs my informs my perspective on celestia is that um you know back if you rewind the clock to 2017 and 2018 everyone at that time there had been a lot of like hype around plasma but people kind of which is like layer twos essentially like and but people kind of realize that they all run into this problem like the data availability problem although i don't know if people were necessarily calling it that yet and so there was kind of people l2 sort of fell out of favor to some degree i would say and people were instead talking about charting which is basically how you parallelize uh blockchain execution by running multiple blockchains in in parallel but that share sort of like a a common sort of security framework um and so that was at the time the best answer that people had for scaling blockchains in a way that still that the chain would remain decentralized but a lot of there are actually a lot of drawbacks to sharding so the the first of them is that it's it's just a very complicated system to build and um you know even though for example harmony is on mainnet like you know a lot of the things like even just getting cross-shard transactions to work effectively is actually like a pretty difficult problem it's similar it has a lot of similar some challenges to just like interoperability for blockchain sort of like ibc um the other thing is it's very complex from like the perspective that you have to like rotate validators and you need some sort of like randomness to do this in a secure way and the validators can be corrupted if there's sort of like um a more advanced adversary like a lot of the security assumptions of sharding just are a little bit dubious and the amount of complexity in the system just makes it feel to me i always felt like it was a little bit shaky it was always on shaky ground i would say but it was but it was the best approach that people had come up with up to that point and so i was you know very committed to that because that was to me that the only answer to scaling launch into decentralized way and that was until i guess i learned about celestia and i realized that celestia essentially has um a lot of the benefits of sharding and then some and then some more new ones that make it even better while actually being more simple and elegant of a solution and and for that reason also like being more secure so that was kind of i i think it took like i kind of had to go through that whole journey of like building a starter blockchain and understanding watching scaling from that angle to really realize why a solution like celeste was was was necessary and was the future because you know back in that time and i think a lot of people are waking up to like like this whole narrative of modular blockchains but like you know back in 2020 when i first read read the lazy ledger white paper i don't think like it wasn't it wouldn't have been that obvious to the average person you had to be very very deep in sort of the research and actual implementations of these systems okay so so i mean there's a you know many other scaling solutions today right like you know ethereum down the line is you know going for 2.0 with you know things sharding avalanche you know has subnets polygon available um what would you i guess how would you compare selection the other you know both current as well as upcoming uh scaling solutions and are there any trade-offs in celestial design yeah that's a really good question so i think i would break those into two different categories so actually there's i would say like high level there's maybe there's like a few broad categories of scaling solutions out there right now and and i'll kind of explain where i see celestia fitting within that so the first and probably the easiest are just like the typical monolithic chains so chains like solana for example who their approach to scaling is essentially that they just want they just increase the node requirements so for those of you you listening in like every blockchain basically makes an implicit social contract with all the participants that says this is the sort of minimum resources that you need to run a full node and and to me running a full node is like basically how you can participate in the chain as a first class citizen because you get to verify everything yourself you don't have to delegate your trust to someone else so the reason why most blockchains don't increase node requirements is because that necessarily reduces the number of people who can be first-class citizens therefore it centralizes the network so solana is is one uh you know chain where they've made the explicit decision to basically to in my mind centralize uh as a way to to scale uh and that's fine that's that's that was that's their choice and and i think we'll see how those decisions play out long term then i would say there's there's a sort of different group and i put avalanche in this group where you know avalanche does have an interesting consensus algorithm consensus however in my opinion is not the bottleneck to scaling but the interesting thing about avalanche and and ecosystems like cosmos are doing is that they are building out toolkits to make it very easy for people to build new blockchains and connect those blockchains together so that would be like tendermint and the cosmos sdk and ibc is sort of like this software toolkit that enables people rather rather than trying to scale one single blockchain one single thread one single like execution space they make it possible to build separate blockchains side by side and connect them together so that that is one other sort of like major category um and then i would say like the last one uh and it's which is like very different is sort of the more modular approach in which you and i would put celestia in this category i would put um ethereum also in the spoiler like with bank sharding in this category and and also polygon avail where we are building a very scalable and simple uh layer one that only does data availability and consensus and then people deploy rather than deploying separate chains with separate consensus networks in separate sort of like security we enable people to deploy roll-ups on top of those this sort of like shared security based network this data availability network and um and that's i think to me like a much more optimal long-term a more optimal sort of like scaling approach for a lot of different reasons and then i am also happy to unpack like how does celestia differentiate from avail and dank sharding too if you guys are interested yeah no no that's a that's a really good um kind of summary and categorization of the current solutions as well as you know upcoming ones um so like and then uh can you explain how essentially our data availability works in the context of roll-ups right so like if i roll up post data um what does it entail to validate creating that state of data let's say a role concept ignore what is there to prevent someone from selecting with invalidation which ultimately would cause state growth yeah you you kind of cut in now but i think your question is about um yeah actually could you repeat the question a little bit yeah yeah definitely um is this better by the way yeah okay um yeah can you explain how data availability works uh in the context of row ups um so let's say you know roll up post data like what does it entail to validate when reading that state and and if there's any invalid data which the role can simply ignore what is there you know what does celestia provide in order to prevent someone from spamming uh with invalid data you know causing state blow yeah so um one important thing to notice or to note here is that um one of the problems that celestia solves in this design is exactly state float so in a monolithic chain every new application has you know has to have its own state right that gets that gets recorded on on layer one and so all the all the full nodes of that uh monolithic chain need to carry that state right so then the more users the more applications the bigger that state gets and that becomes problematic because it requires like bigger and bigger resources to run uh a node for that chain so what celestia does when you separate uh consensus and execution it means that celestia itself as the layer one doesn't actually know anything about the applications that are running on top of it so it doesn't even it doesn't none of the celestia nodes have to carry around the state for any of the roll-ups or applications running on top of celestia so like there is no such thing the only state that celestia as a layer one has is basically the information of who has what balance and what um and who is staking what like basically validator set uh state so celestia is actually very similar in a sense to bitcoin uh and no one and no one and that like the functionality of bitcoin is extremely limited and therefore you don't have a lot of these problems that you encounter in like these in in sort of chains like ethereum or solana like it's it's very limited on purpose because that limitation actually makes it more elegant and makes it more modular and composable for the applications want to go on top so i don't know if i i can get to your like spam question if if uh that's still i'm interested yeah yeah definitely um if you can address that yeah so um one of the interesting things about a paradigm where you you use a data availability layer to actually sort of create your own blockchain is that in a typical in a typical chain um you know there is a cost associated with proposing a new block so okay so let me let me back up a little bit so like if i'm if anyone can post data to celestia it is a completely permissionless protocol so as long as you pay the fee associated fee then you are allowed to post any data you want to select yeah so that's awesome because if i'm you know building a roll-up i'm a roll-up operator um you know rather than having to have my own consensus network where i have to like you know stake tokens to propose a block or let's say i'm doing proof of work i need to mine uh you know do proof of work mining to in order to have the right to post a block uh i don't need that anymore right i just i can just post blocks and pay like a small fee and then celestia takes care of the consensus and data availability part for me so that's that's like the whole value proposition of celestia but where that can be problematic is the fact that you know in uh in traditional blockchains that the fact that it's costly to propose a new block is is a good thing because either let's say it's proof of stake if i propose a block that's invalid like i will get slashed right um and so like obviously i don't i don't want to do that because i don't want to lose money or in proof of work it's like well i could propose an invalid block but i'd have to burn a lot of energy right to do that and so why would i waste my time if that block is just going to be rejected so in celestia the thing is that anyone can in theory like post data there and be trying to propose a new block for a roll up for a given roll up and so that does open up the possibility of for like people spamming like let's say the rollups on celestia build within a given name space it's sort of like an address for that roll up so if i wanted to sort of like i don't know mess around with a particular like application i would just spam that name space and say hey i'm posting new blocks and and and essentially the the people who are using that rule up would have to find some way of rejecting all those invalid blocks or invalid transactions fortunately there's actually like quite a few different schemes that you can use to to sort of avoid that situation so you can have leader selection like the the roll-up itself can have sort of like its own form of proof-of-stake essentially where like you can just um any block that is not coming from a address that is sort of like uh part of this sort of round robin leader selection you just like ignore off the bat um so there's like a there's like a myriad of different solutions but you are right that celestia is slightly different in that sense got it got it oh thank you um so this kind of shipped me back a bit uh you know more to you know what you're just speaking about in terms of um you know like in terms of stability celestia just stay blown like validators don't aren't required to um hold the entire uh you know state of the chain um and so like can you actually kind of touch upon how uh you know data availability sampling um works sure yeah so i think it's important for everyone who's listening to like understand what data availability is because it's uh it's a very poorly named uh concept that um i think leads to a lot of confusion and i remember even you know there was a lot like i remember first learning or hearing of the word data availability maybe in 2019 um and it took me a long time to get around to actually reading about it and learning what it meant but until that i was like oh well i don't know data availability is probably just something to do with like you know data i don't know like data being stored or or something you know just it seemed very vague and um and so it's important i think for people to understand so data availability is best thought of as a solution or a protection against a very specific kind of attack that block producers can can enact and that is a data withholding attack so um a data withholding attack is where a block producer tries to convince clients in the network that hey i'm gonna hit it post it mine's a new block it proposes a new block and it says hey just trust me like the the this state the new state of the chain is valid like don't look at don't look at the data behind don't look at the transaction data that i used to generate this new new like state just trust me that it's true right and the the the problem with that is basically that the clock producer can essentially you know we're used to things like you know people talk a lot about double spending attacks or um and things like that and in blockchains but really the most nefarious kind of attacks you can do are just straight up state transition violations where for example like every blockchain has rules like right like oh well i can only spend this bitcoin if i signed it with my private key right but if if a block producer does something like a date of holding attack they're able to basically break all the rules of the chain so they can just spend coins that aren't theirs they can mint coins out of thin air they can literally do anything they want so that brings us to date availability it is in order to prove prevent this kind of attack you need to make sure that all the transaction data behind a given block is published to the network so that everyone can see it and verify that it's valid that there's no like funny business going on essentially and so that's what the property of data availability is so this the naive solution to data availability i like to protect against data withholding is to have every full node in the network download the entire block right and so how do you make sure all the transactions data data is there you download all of it and then you make sure that it all checks out um the thing is that that doesn't scale because essentially what that means is that every time you want to increase the block size you have to also increase the bandwidth of like all the nodes in the network like they all have to be able to download let's say it's a you know one megabyte block if you want to make it 10 megabytes right to scale the block size by 10 times all of a sudden all the nodes need to have 10 times the number of resources right so this this clearly doesn't scale um and that's where this concept of data availabilities and by the way that's how every current monolithic chain works and that's partly why they're not scalable so um that's where this very clever scheme that um most of our our co-founder and and vitalik they devised this scheme that's like described in the paper fraud and data availability proofs anyone is really interested to get deep on this topic i suggest that they read that white paper but this scheme essentially describes a way that you can among a group of nodes like the lesser resource nodes you can all sample block data and then collectively basically ensure that all the data is available so you you individually you take the block data and you you use erasure coding which creates redundancy and it makes it such that a node in the network doesn't have to download the full block to make to know that the full block is available and what's even better than than that is that the amount of data that you need to sample to make sure that a block a given block is available only scales as the square root of the size of the block so if we go back to our original example let's say we had a one megabyte block right and i and then we wanted to scale that to let's say like a 64 megabyte block um you would only need to increase the node resources by uh by eight eight times to get a 64x increase does that make sense so like you like you you are able to scale the the throughput of the network um in a way that actually doesn't increase linearly the node requirements so it becomes like a like a very very scalable system got it so we know that you know in many other chains um people who want to run you know let's say um you know just not necessarily validate but also want to have uh you know some view of the state you know run kind of you know white clients right um in in the case of celestia if you can run a node without having downloaded all the data what use cases do you actually see for their you know for people running white clients like you know if there is any yeah so the whole point so the original name of the project was lazy ledger right and the reason for that name um is that celestia is a is a very lazy blockchain so um it doesn't and the reason for that is it doesn't do any transaction execution on the layer one but just as consensus and data availability and so for that reason also it's not there isn't really much inherent utility on the layer one itself celestia assumes that people will build roll-ups and layer two systems on top that leverage the sort of utility of consensus and data availability to do more interesting things like all the applications that we know and love like fi and nfts and dows and and all of that so um essentially like celestia like and and to get to your point about like light clients like what so what is the function of a light client or why would i run a celestial node if it doesn't do anything um the reason that you run a celestial light client is that in order so now if you're using a roll up or an application that's built on layer 2 on top of celestia then in order for you to be sure in order for you to verify basically the the roll-up that you're using to make sure that like everything is legit you also need to be verifying the celestia the data availability of the celestia main chain at the same time and so you would be running anyone who is so essentially if you're a client of any roll up on celestia you are also a client of the celestia main chain if that makes sense yeah yeah definitely um and then you know kind of kind of building off of that um you know we also saw kind of stop this tweet a while back you know several weeks ago where he was actually running you know light node on his uh you know android um can you envision a world where the entire you know sampling uh and you know just validating processes done entirely on a whole network of mobile phones is that possible or is that just kind of like a outlier education well that's a very good question um i think that the way that we see it is that um it'll be kind of a pretty heterogeneous network in the sense that there is going to be lots of different sort of tiers of nodes so what's really important though is that um what we believe is the most important thing for decentralization and also the way that we define scalability is end user verification right so like blockchains are all there there are these trust press machines right so the whole point of a blockchain is that you know i can verify that everything uh is following is behaving as it should myself directly right and and so what like and and if i can't then that means that by my necessity then i'm delegating trust to some like third party who's telling me like oh all this is legit you can trust it right but the whole point of launching is to eliminate that like like trust minimization really is the goal right so um that's why like having the ability for people to run a full node on their smartphone is such an important um you know design i think outcome right because everyone everyone has a smartphone not everyone can run a salon a validator right like they don't they don't have the hardware or even or the know-how um you know and that's also why for example ethereum they they target a full node for a laptop because that's sort of like a you know very con like most people have a laptop and they would be able to run a full node of ethereum on their laptop so anyway that's kind of a long-winded way of saying that um like having the ability for people to run full nodes on smartphones is important but long term there's no way that we're going to be able to build a network that is ultra scalable if all the only kind of know the only kind of hardware that we can use as a smartphone and so that's why one of the beauty the beautiful parts about celestia's design is that we can actually have very very high resourced block producing nodes and we expect that and we need that actually so like when uh the people who are proposing blocks and constructing blocks like the block builders um are gonna have to have like very high resources as we get into like bigger box sizes and whereas in solana that's a problem because you know by having really high resource nodes be the ones who are building blocks and also in solana's case the way that it's designed everyone has to have the same level of resources as the block builders to verify what's happening in celestia the block builders can have really high resources and be proposing massive blocks but the end users can still verify that everything is happening and is legit using a smartphone so anyway i guess what i'm trying to say is that there's going to be and there's going to be a full spectrum right you know people are going to be able to run run the equivalent of a full node on their smartphone but there's also going to be really high resource modes and there's going to be everything in between and the beauty of celestia is that you can also run a node that is just dialed into whatever sort of capacity you can bring to the network so like the more let's say rather than a smartphone you have a laptop you can also run a notary laptop and actually contribute more more security and scalability to the network that way by contributing more resources than just a smart product so that's kind of the way that that we see the network parts so it's sort of similar to like you know bittorrent right like you know there's some people who are really hardcore with bitcoin and they you know have uh they they like seed like you know i don't know maybe like terabytes of files or whatever um and then there's people who who don't really but they they have a little laptop and they just like see what they can it's like everyone kind of contributes what they're able what they're capable of contributing god i got it cool um and and kind of shifting over a bit to uh more on the you know composability side um there's something where that was actually spoken about in previous tourist spaces with i believe those mustafa um is that you know celestia offers shared security uh but would have actually you know limited composability across roll-ups when it comes to you know atomic transactions right so like you know if i have different applications on on different uh shards essentially um like currently it's it's not very you know like is this just a technical invitation today not being able to transact atomically across um essentially different roll-ups or can you see a future where transactions you know actually can be executed atomically that's a good question i tend to believe that atomic like cross-chain transactions are probably not possible um because you know the the transaction needs to be executed on one chain and then um that the fact that it was executed needs to be relayed to another chain and then the other chain needs to react to that um and and like let's say something that something happens on the you know the previous chain that forces that makes that transaction that they thought was finalized no longer finalized or no longer valid whatever uh like you have to sort of roll back everything so it's like um i think atomicity i would i would wager about that atomicity for cross-chain transactions is not uh maybe technically possible the thing is that i don't think i think that's not the worst outcome um and i think we're going to get like pretty good ux despite that and and even developer experience like despite that um and that's where like a lot of these bridging projects come into play um and even like if you if you've been using you know people out there using cosmos ibc like it's a very smooth experience and it's it's not that bad um and i don't think and the cool thing is that like the way that i see celestia's ecosystem sort of growing up is that if there are there will probably be roll-ups dedicated to d5 or nfts or like different kind of like application verticals where composability uh between those applications is very important and those applications will live within the same execution space but like if if if there's an application that doesn't need to it can live on its own sovereign separate execution spaces with its own sort of fee model and be isolated and that's like i think there's just gonna be like this big uh sort of like spectrum of design trade-offs where it's like well how badly do i need composability do i need it this badly okay then i'm definitely gonna build the same chain the same roll up as these little applications or you know i really don't need it that bad so i'm fine with being on a separate roll-up and just having cross-chain communication to facilitate whatever it is i need to do um so i think it like it is um obviously if we could have everything live if it were possible if the vision of a world computer were possible and were scalable then you know i wouldn't see very many drawbacks to that except for the fact that everyone had to live in the same execution environment um like everyone had to live within the evm let's say but aside from that i don't uh like i think that this this sort of outcome of like a multi-chain future that everyone's embracing is actually going to be just fine got it cool so nick would you classify celestia as a layer one or a layer zero you know i actually think everyone needs to stop using terminology like layer one layer two also the term layer zero makes no sense i don't even know i mean i've seen polka dot marketing like you know putting that out there and honestly it's kind of a joke to me um like what is a layer zero i don't know what that even means um i think in some sense it does you could consider it as a layer zero and that it does less than a typical layer one but basically what i would like i would appeal to everyone to like the terminology i would feel everyone to start using it is more like things like data availability layer or execution layer or settlement layer like something uh a word that is descriptive of what that layer is doing in the stack like that's as we move into a modular blockchain world like that's really what's going to differentiate between different blockchains it's like oh well i'm a rollup okay i'm an executioner oh i'm a i'm a data availability layer then like that's that's sort of like the lane that you're in right and i think people there's going to be like a you know a myriad of different um approaches to solving and optimizing each one of these layers all right so there's going to be a bunch of different approaches to data availability layers there's a different bunch of different approaches to execution layers and settlement layers uh and we're all going to sort of like recompose and recombine all these different pieces and i think yes basically layer layer one layer zero layer two is kind of like um it doesn't help in my mind to explain what's really going on underneath the hood yeah that makes a lot of sense um so celestia being a first of its kind data availability platform what kind of applications um or blockchains you see built on celestia that wasn't previously possible uh really good question so well one of the things are really i think it's less oh yeah there there are a few things that will say that celestia enables that um previous blockchain designs do not um the first of that first of them is this idea of flexibility which i mentioned in the beginning so if you if you kind of take a step back and this is more like modular this modular paradigm as a whole not just celestia but um if you think about what was so important about ethereum was that before ethereum if you wanted to try out a new decentralized application you had to create a new blockchain right you had to like you couldn't just run mastercoin on top of bitcoin you had to actually create a whole new network right so the the the beauty of ethereum was that it created this very this general purpose blockchain on which any decentralized application could be run without having to launch a new consensus network so that and and we're reaping the fruits of that like very fundamental sort of like innovation in in blockchain even to this day right like we wouldn't be where we are without that now celestia takes it a step and like module blockchains take it a step further in that in the monolithic paradigm if you wanted to experiment with a new execution environment um you had to also create a new chain right so like you know if i'm if i'm building what i'm trying to say is if i'm building on any given layer one i am stuck within their like execution framework right like i'm stuck within the evm or i'm stuck within you know um substrate or sea level or what what have you right yeah i don't have the ability as a developer to say hey actually i want to try running in a different environment it's like oh well in order to like experiment with this new environment i actually need to build an entirely new blockchain so in my mind in the same way that the experimentation around the design space for the decentralized applications was extremely limited before ethereum i think the experimentation in the design space around execution environments has been similarly limited because of the fact that everything has been built monolithic and so um what what module blockchains allow for is for people to build new kinds of execution environments experiment with them and deploy them like rapidly and with like very low cost and low repercussions so that's one of the use cases i'm really excited about to see emerge on top of celestia and there's like a few different teams already that are like experimenting with this which really really excites me can you explain some of these or share some of these examples of other genes that are experimenting with this yeah um i mean i don't want to leak any alpha but basically um you know there there's one project and and these are all very very early stage by the way um but we have this idea for sovereign roll-ups so um you know the concept of a roll-up came out from the necessity to scale ethereum and a scale like basically execution that was happening on a layer one and sort of offload some of that off chain but fundamentally if you think about what a roll-up is it is actually an independent blockchain like it's not just a scaling solution or band-aid to like help augment a layer one monolithic chain it is actually a completely separate chain that just piggybacks off the consensus and data availability of another chain so in our mind roll-ups can be completely sovereign they don't have to like they're not baby chains and so and and but the thing is that this most of the ethereum roll-ups have been designed and built so far operate under the assumption that like oh well we're just scaling ethereum and we are sort of a baby chain to ethereum and we settle we have a built-in bridge to ethereum and we settle our state updates to the ethereum main chain but that comes with a lot of different drawbacks one of them is that when you want to fork or upgrade like make changes to like the the roll-up that you're operating it actually requires coordination with the ethereum main chain and so you kind of like you end up kind of being bound within the ethereum community the ethereum social consensus and so the the the evm at the base layer and it kind of limits you right it kind of like it it it forces you to sort of like play within that sort of sandbox um and like sovereign roll-ups is essentially this idea that you can build a rollup that doesn't settle to any other chain that settles on the peer-to-peer network level so rather than posting your like fraud proofs your validity proofs to another execution layer or a settlement layer you just post those proofs to the clients of the rollup directly and that basically frees you up to be like a standalone blockchain but a stand-alone blockchain that doesn't actually have um doesn't have to run its own consensus so that's that's one of the exciting projects that um there's a there's a team that's still very early but they're they're wanting to build like the first sovereign roll-ups on top of celeste yeah that's that's one example oh that's interesting um changing gears a little bit uh john adler at his uh denver talk stated uh celestions take the best of the worlds celestia and ethereum and bring them together synergistically a celestium is an ethereum l2 chain that uses celestia for data availability but uses ethereum for settlement and dispute resolution so can you show more about celestium for sure so um first i just want to give a shout out to paulinea who was the person who turned us on to this idea back in maybe november or last year or maybe even september um but essentially you know the it's funny because originally we never had this the idea to pursue an idea like celestiums um but basically with the um there's kind of two things that that kind of emerged that made this made us realize that this is a real use case um so first of all like roll-ups are a really promising scanning solution but the thing is that even like roll-ups right now if they post all their data to ethereum it's very costly because gas on the ethereum network is is very expensive and so what this means is that even though roll-ups do scale ethereum they they're still like decently high transaction costs like i don't know maybe like a dollar for a transfer and a couple dollars for a swap or something uh and that and and with ethereum sort of base layer still being limited in its current current design like as that if demand for roll-up roll-up usage increases that also will affect all of the roll-ups and make it more expensive so we realized that actually there's kind of a need within the ethereum roll-up ecosystem for a cheap but secure solution for off-chain data availability so we are building a bridge from celestia to ethereum that will allow roll-up uh roll-ups on ethereum to post their data to celestia rather than to the ethereum base layer so also they can cut out all of the gas fees associated with posting their transaction data to ethereum and um still settle to the ethereum blockchain so basically there is a compromise on security um in that like you know the the data availability is now being guaranteed by the celestia validators rather than the ethereum base chain but we think that that is a fine compromise for the scale additional scaling benefits so yeah um i can i can go into more detail there but basically celestium is a solution for scaling ethereum roll-ups and like i want to also say here that like we're really you know a lot of the team are uh you know very heavily sort of like aligned we're very aligned as a project as a team with the ethereum community overall and um you know we see celestia as being like uh you know very synergistic with ethereum and we would really love to support the ethereum ecosystem to scale um in this way awesome thanks do you have anyone from the ethereum foundation that's you know working with celestia at all or is this you know a bit just with celestia being synergistic with ethereum so we um we talk with them quite a bit actually so we share notes um on things like data availability schemes and just general road map stuff um you know denver and lisbon and all that um but we're not there i wouldn't say there's any like direct collaboration between the teams we're mostly on the celestion's idea right now we're mostly collaborating with the ethereum roll-up teams awesome so we'll move into q and a pretty shortly here um but before we move to that just wanted to ask avi if you had any other points you wanted to to speak on obvi get in here baby yo yo honestly you just keep asking amazing questions i don't wanna i don't wanna take away from your from your role you've done such a good job and nick as always well articulated and making me more bullish on celestia which i didn't think was even a possibility at this point come on man you gotta have at least one question um yeah i'm honestly i think you guys asked a lot of the a lot of the good technical questions so maybe i'll ask a little bit more of a of a qualitative question but sure how do you expect to attract like what's it what's your plan for attracting people to the actual to the actual ecosystem and getting and getting people to build on it and you know building building a good dev community while also building a good you know user community that's a really good question so um i have to some to some extent i know how hard it is to build a developer community and just like bootstrap an ecosystem uh partially from my time at harmony um and so like i i do feel like that is generally the hardest problem or the hardest thing to tackle when building a new layer one um i would say first one of the things that's we really benefit from is actually like a first mover advantage which is like we're lucky that we're at least so far the first and kind of only uh modular blockchain in town and so i think that has its own advantages and that like all the all these new unique things that you can kind of only do with a modular blockchain design um i think they'll be experimented with first and we'll have kind of the ability to build the first sort of developer community around a lot of these applications and and i've actually been pleasantly surprised with the number of like talented teams who have been getting in touch with us who are interested in building stuff with us already even though we're still so far out from mainnet um but beyond that um you know so we we're not just stopping at building the core protocol itself because frankly like even more so than than the monolithic chain like the core protocol alone without developers or without like people is completely useless right like it's a lazy ledger that has no function other than like you know the the functionality that people build on top and so we're very actively building out tooling to make it as easy as possible for developers to deploy new rollups on top of celestia so that's for example one example is the sevmos which is a settlement layer that we're building that emulates it basically um emulates the same kind of uh architecture that people have come to expect with uh if for ethereum based rolex so that will make it possible for people to for example take um let's say arbitrum or zk sync or any of the ethereum based rollups and deploy them on celestia with basically as few modifications as possible so it's sort of like it's kind of equivalent it's kind of like you know evm compatibility which is like the big thing for like um you know monolithic layer ones it's it's kind of equivalent of that but for roll-ups where it's like we are we will with sevmos we'll have like edm com edm roll-up compatibility so to speak um but obviously doesn't stop there so we also have optimum which is going to be a tool that enables people to deploy cosmos sdk based um chains as well on celestia so like building what i'm trying to say is we're building out like a suite of different sort of like uh software and tools that will make it as easy as possible for people to deploy different kinds of rollups and execution environments how to get users beyond that i think is still tbd it's probably a little bit early i think there are definitely playbooks out there like liquidity mining incentives and things like that but it's way too early to to really like comment on that fair enough great great answer hyperion i don't know if you had uh you had anything on your end that you wanted to end with yeah that's it for me so i mean let's actually go to uh you know with any you know any speaker if you want to come up and have some questions yeah so for anyone in the audience if you want to request um to speak you can do so and then we'll go through a couple rounds of q a let's do it i know we actually had some before but it looks like they dropped out well nick looks like your um responses and answers were so thorough that everyone now understands celestia well for those of us who are too shy to ask questions um can you tell us you know where we can find out more about celestia where we can learn about updates and and follow along with the developments yeah for sure so um i would say the best place to go to learn more about celestia is celestia.org that's our website there's a faq section there's a resources page um there's a blog you can read up a lot there there's also been an increasing amount of like community content and i've been meaning to aggregate all that into one place for people to read because some of the best content has actually just come from all of you guys out there writing and explaining what celestia is in your own words um i'd also say you should follow the follow us on twitter so celestia.org is our uh twitter account and you know there's there's a lot of educational threads that come out of there there's a lot of like project updates that come out um yeah that's really the high level awesome thanks we're really excited about celestia as well and want it oh go ahead i was also going to say like uh join our discord and our our telegram channels you'll find the links on our website awesome yeah we're really excited about celestia as well here at internedau so thank you nick so much for coming on and chatting with us today um we'll have this spaces recorded right so we'll publish that um here and on youtube as well and if anyone's interested in being an intern our pinned tweet has information there as well so thank you so much everyone for joining in today so well before we go i have my description actually which is um all right when uh when celestia intern when celestia in turn turned out you're leaking some alpha right here do you have the stake like in turn down tokens the manifest the celestia intern we'll connect with you offline all right sounds good everyone thank you so much everyone see ya all right you guys thanks for hosting [Music]
