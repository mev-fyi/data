thanks everyone for staying for the entire morning plus an entire day that started at 2PM um just a few closing remarks they're supposed to be slides and if they don't appear I'll still say the same things so um basically the reason why we had um but not this PBS day journey is to seek out an answer that I wanted to know me as a community member take off my flashbots hat um what can I do to contribute to the PBS research that is critical to um fight against essentially the centralizing force of Meb and so this is something that I wanted to have as a call to action which is to build as a community a open r d map for the ecosystem on the topic on the problem space of PBS and so of course I stole a few slides from every speaker today this is one version of the end game thanks to vitalik and the weather you do believe in again game of approved Singularity or not the question really is where are we now and of course understanding that there are a lot of ecosystems different um uh like participants and contributors sitting here so this may be just one of the many examples or one of the many road maps that you're familiar with the one on the right was I believe at the end of last year uh vitalik posted the um ethereum road map that is quite modular and so where was PBS back then it was right there with a couple components it looks like we're 25 there and today we got a zoomed in version of a heart-shaped roadmap from Mark neuter and there is still a lot of uncertainties to be figured out in terms of actually how do we actually um get rid of certain um intermediaries that is currently not quite accounted for in the protocol as well as many other technical challenges so I started to ask myself okay as a non-ef non-core researcher non-core developer what can I do to actually understand how big what is the lay of the land and what can we do individually or as part of our project so I went on a rabbit hole of Mind mapping so of course we're um we have already on ethereum Med boost ecosystem that's in operations that flashbacks many of my teammates are working on along with many of the EF and the community members contributing to it and it's up and running there's also a healthy ecosystem that's beyond just the map boost ecosystem that is doing a lot more of the r d work so after I actually interviewed around 10 or 20 researchers who are actually working in a space working on PBS I realized that I really can't recognize much on this mind map anymore because it has expanded so huge and I realize there's a lot more problems then I realized there was and ultimately these questions are very hard auction design problems very hard consensus design problems and there may not be a right answer and when I look through from the farther away research research problems zooming into the development and finally the operational problems I realized that the reason why I have a lot less branches there is because there's a lot more to be done by the community but yet we kind of just relied on hey the EF is going to take care of it not my problem but that shouldn't be the case there is so much we can do just in terms of figuring out in today's up and running out of protocol PBS um map boost ecosystem how do we keep relays um economically sustainable that's a research question how do we actually have data transparency such that we could um enable us to keep the ecosystem in check and how do we actually contribute to the prototyping the economic audits the security audits of all of the early research work that is going to production before they turn into an EIP those are just open-ended questions unaccounted for so is a call to action and this doesn't just um applies to R1 today we heard I think for the for many uh of you here probably for the first time um for me probably but a second time because I interviewed every single speaker um what what PBS on L2 look like and this may be just a starting point so I'll end right here with essentially the theme of today let's turn Zero Sum gaming to positive sum let's keep crypto decentralized thank you [Applause]
