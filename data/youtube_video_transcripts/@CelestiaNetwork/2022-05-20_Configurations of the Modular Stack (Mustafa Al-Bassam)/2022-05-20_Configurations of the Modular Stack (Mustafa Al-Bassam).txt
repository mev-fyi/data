as i mentioned there's these four components data availability consensus settlement and execution so you have one you have monolithic blockchains um like bitcoin or ethereum as it is you know traditionally where you basically have a like a general purpose smart contract environment and the validators and the full nodes handle all of those four components then you have roll ups and in roll ups um the l1 handles the first three components data availability consensus and settlement but but not execution and the roll-up itself handles execution of chain and then you have validiums and validiums are basically roll-ups or but they do not have on-chain data availability or they do not use um like the same layer one as the settlement or consensus for their availability and therefore they are not roll-ups but more like side chains um or by lydiums as their turned so this is kind of like the kind of modular design in the ethereum space that has been kind of like discussed so far but then there's also a more of a celestia-centric modular design or configurations of the stack so in celestia we're quite interested in this idea of sovereign roll-ups and in a sovereign roll-up um the sovereign roll-up uses the l1 only for data availability and consensus but it does not um have an enshrined settlement layer instead it does its own settlement and the reason why it's sovereign is because it can hard fork and it can upgrade without permission from the cell from a higher execution layer so for example if you have an ethereum roll-up your roll-up is effectively like a baby chain to the ethereum settlement execution layer and you can't really hard fork it without you know requesting without convincing the ethereum kind of social consensus to do so but with a sovereign role roll-up because it does its own settlement it's effectively like a its own layout one chain it's effectively like deploying your own layer one you can hard fork it and it can have its own social consensus you've also got this idea of settlement roll-ups and a starter metro roll-up is basically you know like a standard roll-up except that it only is only optimized not for general smart contracts or computation but for um settle for but for settling other roll-ups on top of it and i think yuri is going to give a talk about this today with this idea of l ones and l twos and l threes so like for example you can have an l2 that has l3s um but the l2 might only be up might only be supposed to be used for settlement for other roll-ups but you're not supposed to like post like um host actual like applications on that roll up and then you've also finally got this idea of a celestion which is basically a validium that uses celestia for data availability it's it has similar on paper has similar security tradeoffs as a validium except that it has slightly higher crypto economic guarantees because of celestia's data availability sampling and slashing
