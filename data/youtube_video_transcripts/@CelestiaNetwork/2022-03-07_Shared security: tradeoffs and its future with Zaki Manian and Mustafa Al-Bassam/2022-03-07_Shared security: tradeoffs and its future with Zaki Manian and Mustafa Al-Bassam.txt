[Music] zaki welcome i think we have our folks here zaki how are you uh happy to be here dude we're so happy to you joined um so everyone welcome i think we can get started uh i'm going to lay the stage for the conversation and introduce our speakers and then uh so just bear with me and then i'm gonna shut up and and let the dialogue just flow we are all convening at an interesting time shared security is one of the hottest topics of the moment right now for those unfamiliar at a really high level shared security is this idea of multiple chains that inherits some security from a common source there are different methods by which shared security can be delivered hence there's just a lot of activity consequently buzz at the forefront of this concept so just a lot of news cosmos it will be introducing interchain security uh which we'll definitely be talking about uh and polka dot i think we've all seen uh has introduced para chains with share security uh of the relay chain so the world is clearly moving in a direction of shared security for better for worse and thus at the center of the movement is a growing and intensifying debate there are proponents that disagree with the idea of shared security claiming that it introduces security risks and trade-offs that outweigh the benefits and on the other hand there are staunch supporters of shared security who believe that it is necessary for chains to communicate more secure securely in a multi-chain landscape to help us make sense of it all we have three of the brightest technical minds in web 3 who all have pretty strong opinions on this topic and hence we brought them all together we have mustafa john and zaki we'll real quickly go through introductions for those uh who are joining who don't know these folks we have zaki monyen co-founder of some of the a and inclusion and someone who has contributed significantly to cosmos we have mustafa albassam previously co-founded chainspace acquired by facebook now meta and is now the co-founder and ceo of celestia which is quickly becoming known as the first modular blockchain network and we have john adler creator of optimistic roll-ups previously at consensus and now a co-founder of celestian field labs gentlemen welcome how we all doing can you guys all hear me are your mics good i think we kicked john out of the speaker set but uh okay let's get him back in here real quick but uh yeah i know everything's real good this is a fun topic um i don't think people really realize that this is not a new topic this is basically been like the central topic of blockchain protocol design for like since like 2015. um it just seems that like the like number of people who are interested in talking about it like has suddenly exploded um uh yeah i feel like in many ways i think the other you know the two things that have changed since 2016 is one is like um is like these systems are much less hypothetical than they were in 2016. um and like so we have like real systems and now we have real users interacting with those real systems so we're starting to get some imperial because like a lot of this these questions about shared security i think are just uh are our like hypotheses around how like users and markets will form on top of blockchains um and like we're certainly not in a in an end state yet but like we at least have like users and markets that have formed so we can start to ask questions about that okay so let's get into it zaki why don't we start off with you uh there's a lot of non-technical folks here and like i've gotten scores of dms about uh just the the overall or high arching idea of it can you quickly uh introduce the topic of shared security further uh okay i'm gonna try i'm gonna try my my non my extremely non-technical uh uh uh um uh vision explanation of uh of shared security and see if it works and also see if uh mustafa murders me um for getting for explaining it wrong um we'll see um okay so here's what here's my like central point of view is like so like the whole question of blockchain security really comes down to this question of who can rug you like who in the system is like actually has the ability to like to rug you to like for your money to disappear into nothing for them to steal your funds all you know for them to like you know um and for anyone who's been like interest in interacting with with the d5 or nft ecosystems like you're starting to get a visceral sense of the rug like of like what a rug feels like it's like oops my money's gone right um and the basic question that shirts so like in any blockchain system there's a lot of there's a lot of information asymmetries about like how and where can you get rubbed there can be a bug in the system like the software developers um could make a mistake in like the the base layers protocol um you could get uh the smart contract author um can like either intentionally backdoor the system or have vulnerability in the system um the team can use you know governance tokens or a multi-sig to like you know screw over the project there's a lot of ways in which a project can get rugged but one of the like the central question that uh uh um that is like at the heart of of shared security especially as we sort of have transitioned into proof of uh of of of stake is can the validators rug you and how many validators have to work together to rug you um is basically the question of shared security and for um the question of shared security is basically in the shared security vision and every time people try to build shared security what they're basically aiming for is a system in which the number of validators that have to collude to rug you on any sort of scalable blockchain system is equivalent to the number of validities you have to conclude for the for like the layer for like a major way or one to fail um like and so trying to make a scalable system in which the same groups of people have to collude drug or the same validators have to collude uh to rug you and the people who are trying to build who are who have built non-shared security systems that are scalable and interoperable um i've been willing to say hey like it would be okay if part of the system fails because like this set of validators rugged like over here and it wasn't and it does and you know and like the whole system as a whole uh continued marching along so like you know is it okay you know is it acceptable to live in a world in which like the polygon bridge operators or the uh or the polygon validator set can essentially like steal all of the funds that are bridged over the ethereum polygon bridge is that an acceptable world or a completely unacceptable world um and that really is the central question of like shared security mustafa let's kick the ball over to you please share your level thoughts and your general point of view on shared security yeah i think that's a good overview um i would contextualize it within a kind of multi-chain ecosystem and so to get into more of the details of what shared security means in practice um effectively this is very applicable to systems where there's multiple blockchains that each have their own state machine so you know if you've got ethereum right now for example um ethereum the main chain is like it's just one chain with one state machine that executes everyone's contracts but recently people have realized you actually have to have a multi-change ecosystem where there's multiple blockchains because you just you just can't scale web3 with a single state machine that processes everyone's transactions so you effectively have to shard execution and to charge execution or to split execution across different nodes or different chains you basically need to multiply multi-chain ecosystem multi-chain ecosystems come in different forms um like you know a few years ago there was kind of diagnosed like two main kinds of multi-chain ecosystems there was this ethereum 2.0 sharding uh back when ethereum had execution charts where each chart was was its own chain and then you have you know more cosmos style systems where um it's similar to sharding except that there isn't a predefined set of shards it's more like anyone can create a shot and in in in multifacetion ecosystems it's important um to have composibility or interoperability between those chains so let's say you have chain a and chain b and let's say chain a sends funds to chain b or a user transfers funds between those two chains and if one of those chains happens to be insecure or has a validator set that can start to you know put invalid transactions into that into their chain then they could potentially steal these funds um that have been transferred into that chain from other chains and that kind of potentially creates a systemic risk to the ecosystem so what shared security says is effectively if you have let's say two chains or three chains how can we make it so that in order to break one of those chains you have to break all three chains so that's effectively like from a high level what i consider shared security to be in its kind of most basic form i suppose thanks guys that concept of the central question is is really interesting zaki do you how do you comment on what mustafa just said do you agree with him are there any parts that you disagree build on top of it yeah no i i very much agree with mustafa's framing uh uh i have tried that framing myself and sometimes it seems to work for people and some people sometimes it it doesn't um i would also say that basically until celestia came along uh and like so we and you know uh i've been following i've been following mustafa's work on this problem before celestia the company was founded um the idea of a thick of a very scalable system of multiple chains with shared security um was extremely hard um and one of the sort of uh things i uh sort of so like when i started working on on this problem in like 2015 um i was like you know there were a lot of people who had basically been wiped okay i want to build a multi-chain ecosystem where which which has this property um and you know this was this this was a central topic of conversations in the early days of ethereum 2.0 polkadot um uh polka dot dfinity all of these things all were enormous amounts of effort were put into how do i build a system where you have multiple chains but if you break one you have to break all three and really what was sort of different about cosmos was that cosmos was really about building a system in which you can break one chain and like the the cascading failures um are in some ways understandable and limited um by the other parts of the architecture of the system um but it's you know people will still definitely get hurt um the uh and so then celestia came along and celestia was okay like here's a system that is plausibly as scalable as cosmos um but actually has um can actually have this property of um of where you can't have a sort of state machine failure where the where the interoperability layer um basically gets broken um and the and uh and sort of tests and sort of cascading economic effects uh sort of propagate out of it i mean we all got to see this um very v vividly in um in the wormhole uh hack that just happened um where you know the where but it you know again this is the these are the interesting pieces of trying to to describe these things it was a smart contract flaw and not a failure of the validator set but you end up with you know 120 000 forged eth bridged over um by subverting a piece of the bridge system um and then cascading economic disruption sort of emerging from that and like saved only because you know a a single investor jump was willing to step in uh and like mitigate the loss of funds right um this is the kind of economic disaster that shared security proponents um uh envision happening in a world of interoperable non-shared security blockchains where you have these like essentially economic crises that emerge when uh when there is when a single bridge or a single blockchain fails and the dream of shared security is a very scalable infrastructure in which those kinds of attacks are sort of mitigated john welcome back hi can you guys hear me yeah we can so we were discussing uh our point of views on shared security and the central question that underpins it uh how do you see shared security what's your point of view and what do you think is the underlying question yeah so i generally agree with what mustafa said to no surprise uh i did want to point out a few interesting things one of them is that while it may be true that for instance the wormhole hack wasn't the result of a failure in the you know validator set if you want to call it that of the you know the selena for example and it's pretty rare to see cases of blockchain to blockchain bridges that are compromised due to valid intercepts being compromised as opposed to smart contract books there are many cases of blockchain to centralized exchange bridges if you want to call them that being compromised by a compromise in the blockchains either validator set or minor set uh ethereum classic is a pretty big one from the past few years i think they had maybe three or four you know very large reworks and from the perspective of the bridge the fact that the other side of the bridge is a centralized exchange instead of another blockchain is essentially irrelevant it's an implementation detail this is like a very clear example that block producers of a blockchain can and will attack a bridge it was not trust minimized it happened with ethereum classic and it will happen eventually improve stake chains if it hasn't happened already on some smaller chains and we should see it only happen in larger chance i've been waiting for this to happen for so many years i'm very excited to see it happen as far as i know it hasn't i've tried to pay people during game stakes and game zones to do these attacks but to no avail uh but i i i look forward to them happening so i think like the more actual scenario of this happening like more likely than the vale they are said fading or like being acting purposeful perfect stream sorry purposefully malicious um i think the more likely scenario where this might happen is more in a network upgrade that the continuity is not agreed on um so like let's say for example there's some popular chain and i don't know let's say like a terrorist group uses the chain um the community might advocate for blocking or freezing or potentially reassigning the funds in that chain and um that would require a hard fork because that would potentially that would potentially violate the stage transition function of that chain and so effectively uh but because the bridge itself doesn't actually but rather verify that it stretches state transition function it will just follow what the validators say so if the validator issues a hard fork they will do so um even if it's like a potentially controversial network upgrade so i think like long term or even short term that is more likely the kind of attack or failure scenario effectively a network upgrade that like the most of the community might not agree on but the validators have been compelled to do let's say by i don't know law enforcement for example or other parties zaki can you please comment on what musa just said i think what he said was interesting but curious how you see it i definitely um think of this as stuff that i'm like somewhat excited to see starting to play out in the real world um like you will definitely i you know i'm very like i'm very excited for the world in which uh uh a cosmos chain like one like one of the biggest questions i think um or okay so there are a bunch of layers to this question that this makes me think of um one is we still don't really know what a controversial fork looks like on top of a chain that has has like a significant amount of defy on it um because defy has resulted in a world in which there's a lot more like infrastructure players including stable coin issuers and um and like oracles and all these other places that are like um sort of big parts of this question of like how does a fork happen how would an invalid state transition be be processed how would it be be viewed how would i get controversial hard fork um we i we have yet to see a controversial hard fork on top of a chain that has defy on top of it so there's like a certain amount of like sort of like mega unknowns um about this and i think this is a little bit of a why um why celestia may is like such an important contributor in this world where like i also think cosmos ibc like the cosmos interop model has a lot of virtues um which is it may be that like the risk of a controversial hard fork to an ecosystem with d5 on top of it is so great that it's like intolerable um to not have like further assurance that an invalid state transition won't happen um we're talking a lot about celestia real quickly mustafa can for the i'm seeing a lot of chatter on twitter uh some folks don't know about celestia can you quickly uh introduce celestia and tell us about it so celestia is what is described as a kind of well the first modular blockchain network but what it is what the core product is is a pluggable data availability layer so you can think of celestia as basically a very simple blockchain or a very simple layer one that only does the core things that lay one should do and those things are number one and ordering messages on number two making the data of those messages available and if you have those two core primitives and those are the two those are the two core primitives required to have shared security across to across two different chains um as long as those chains are using the same data availability layer then they can benefit from shared security awesome going back to what zaki said about mega unknowns mustafa john any comments on this do you guys see any mega unknowns as it relates uh in the context of shared security what do you what does it what do we mean by mega unknowns that if we play this out from the near term to the long term any variables that you think could derail the shared security vision so i think um like there's two kind of there's two different narratives for shared security or why shared security is needed and more generally why roll-ups are needed and so like recently like the ethereum narrative for why roll-ups are needed is security uh or shared security uh in the sense that you need you that you should use a roll up even though a roll up is even a roll of actually quite expensive on ethereum because ethereum data is quite expensive um you know like if you use it like it's still like a few like a few dollars per transaction if you use a rollup and depending on what roll up you use you should still use a roller because it's more secure because it's quite trust minimized bridge to ethereum as opposed to using some of the chain like i don't know like polygon or that supports evm and having one set transactions so the risk i see there is that like in practice users don't actually care that much about the trust minimization of the bridge they care mostly about transaction fees except especially when the transaction fees on different chains are 100x cheaper and then it's almost a no-brainer for users to take that risk of the bridge fading because they're getting 100 x cheaper transaction fees i think like if we really want to kind of have a shared security um ecosystem uh the actual narrative we should be pushing is that you should use roll-ups because um it's easier to deploy new blockchains as roll-ups than deploying your own blockchain with its own validator set and um deploying your own blockchain for your application is giving you better benefits than just using a smart contract on the same blockchain as everyone else so for example in the future i could see potentially like gaming like you know like apps app specific blockchains or specific roll-ups for let's say like some d5 game or some nfc game might have its own roll-up and does all the execution there just specific for that game because the game doesn't need to compose that much with other smart contracts i think that's more of a i think the usability narrative um is like is more likely to win than the shared security relative given that users mainly care about cheaper transactions okay yeah i wanted to so there's a really interesting question here and the question is is does do roll-ups are roll-ups a useful tool primarily to users or are roll-ups a useful tool primarily to developers um and i think this is represents like sort of the interesting question here and i think like we're currently on a very interesting moment in this in this history and story um when you build um so you know the initial sort of generation of roll-ups that sort of started to get deployed this year um they were all targeting the evm as their as their um as their virtual machine um and sort of implicit in the idea of i'm targeting the evm is very much uh i'm targeting users and not developers um uh or users in the broadest set like smart contracts and apps and stuff like that but i'm certainly not targeting like anyone who wants to build a custom uh a custom blockchain or you know the cosmos sdk style of of of application specific blockchains and like you know we built the cosmos sdk um with this in mind we're like hey like we think that there's a substantial number of developers who will want to build their own blockchain at some point um and the and there needs to be a toolkit for them and so we built a toolkit for them um but right now they're in so now there's a question of okay is that i think one of the big questions that we're just starting to see the glimpses of the potential of is like a cosmos sdk kind of thing for rollups um and now that canon has been like open sourced which is um optimism sort of next generation mips based which is like a sort of general microprocessor targeted environment you've started to see like the first base layer of what could become the cosmos sdk for for blockchains um and arbitrarium when nitro comes out is another alternative um which is webassembly based for building a cosmos sdk um uh for rollups um and more of as more stuff in the zero knowledge world where uh uh gets open sourced we're going to start seeing the capacity to build a cosmos sdk for roll-ups and i think that possibility that that that evolution to me seems as significant as when we were developing the cosmos sdk back in like 2018. let's talk about cosmos hub interchange staking model how does that compare to celestia's model of shared security mustafa zaki whoever wants to go first please um i mean i think exactly and i agree on this but we've discussed it before but like in the interchange thinking module i see the interchange thinking module and celestia security model having different purposes and so i guess to recap the console sub interchange taking module the way it effectively works right now or at least it works the way it works in the v1 is that you can set up a chain where the validators of the cosmos hub are also the values of your chain so effectively you know the cosmos hub violators are also violating other chains so they're valid validating multiple chains and they're also executing the transactions in the machines and processing the transactions so this is quite similar to some extent to the political dot uh shared security model where there's power chains and the relay chain takes an interest in the validity of those paradigms um so the problem with this model is that it doesn't scale to let's say like thousands or millions of chains it scales to like an order of magnitude of maybe like 100 chains uh which is like you know political dot has you know it has to auction off um like power chain slots there's a hundred power chain slots and they have to auction it off because obviously the validators in relay chain can't validate every single chain in the world now celestia like our aim is like we see a world with millions of blockchains so we're kind of catering towards the kind of tail end of blockchains like imagine you can just deploy a blockchain uh like maybe you want to maybe your store a small project and recruiting the cosmos hub validate i said it's too expensive for you and then you can just like you know deploy on celestia and use celestia as data availability the advantage of that is um like and one interesting part of that is like if your roll up does not initially have a lot of activity then it's not as if you have to post blocks on that chain like every single epoch so you can just post blocks as long as you need to so it's like you pay as you go data they're building ordering and um something that i echo exactly what zac i said before i think the interchange thinking module and it's kind of useful for like uh as a value according mechanism for the atom token so like let's say the cosmos hub um wants you to kind of like acquire or deploy new chains that are like uh in the same vertical as the gospel top so for example in the future i see like a world a potential potential where the cosmos hub might want to deploy or launch its own settlement layer for roll-ups and like the using cosm like using cosmos in for example you know a community might decide they don't want to actually you know deploy like actually integrate cosmos into the hub itself so like they might deploy a custom was one specific hub and then there's two chains in parallel but their interchange stick with each other so it's kind of like a way for the hub to have a suite of chains zaki same question to you please well i agree with everything mustafa has just said um and i think that i think the the biggest way of thinking about it is is it's like um cosmos shared security is a sort of expensive solution to the deployer of a chain that hopefully gets them a business benefit which is like this tight partnership with adam holders a value like a solid value accrual mechanism for this like tight partnership with between this like new chain and atom holders um and hopefully this gets is is an opportunity to create value and it coexists in an ecosystem where you know uh you can you know start a validator set with three machines on aws and just go for that um like you know the cosmos net model is permissionless in iraq um and so shared security is this like very specific point solution um i think one of the other things that is sort of worth sort of exploring a little bit more is or like is that like my expectation over the next few years is like there's going to be like the celestium sdk or i don't know how we're going to brand this but there's going to be this like roll up sdk um that emerges out of the atomic components of um of some of the like zero knowledge of like the zero knowledge proof work and the uh uh mips work on canon and the what wasn't work on uh nitro and there's going to be this like emergence of a new developer toolkit um and my expectation is is that there is going to be sort of parallel optimization of both the like cosmos and cosmos like stack of like next generation uh uh uh interoperable blockchains um and parallel optimization to the um modular architecture change where both the celestia base layer becomes much like evolves in a much more scalable direction but also these sdks for building like fraud provable state machines or validity provable state machines start to proliferate um and i expect these things to like happen in parallel for quite some time interesting forecasting mustafa do you also see the same do you also expect the same as what zaki is alluding to or do you see it differently yeah i mean this idea of um optimistic roll-ups that can do fraud proofs on any arbitrary computation and is really powerful and the idea of interactive verification games in general that you can deploy you can potentially deploy any kind of computer program you like um you know to mips if we're using the canon example um and you can prove that and and that's that's like a that's a very like you know this will take a little this will take time some time to fully mature uh but this is very powerful because it means that it's like one thing i want to try and figure out how to do is like deploy like you know deploy cosmos sdk zones for example using canon's um mips photographing system so i've already managed to compile you know cosmos sdk app to mips um but there's still modifications that have to be made you know to get the oracle working but the idea is if you can actually deploy a cosmos sdk zone which is like the gopro you know the go code so you can forward through that and then that's very powerful because you can actually anyone can be able to deploy a cosmos sdk zone and instantly have a trust minimized bridge with a settlement layer you know like cell moss or ethereum for example without having to worry about creating their own validation thanks let's talk about data availability the question to both of you why is data availability essential to shared security zaki why don't we start with you so um the um sort of root of the of the data availability question comes in which is um if you build a system which is only secure so so there are a couple of things in which uh data availability is like designed to solve the problem for you so what's what's cause what's what i i typically like to explain this in terms of like the optimistic roll-up model and the um and the the optimistic roll-up model and the um uh and the um so and the and the sort of validium zero knowledge zk roll up model but like one of the most important things about um uh uh about these um systems is who can propose a block and who can verify the state so in a in a in an optimistic roll-up model you need to have both a broad set of people who can uh uh you need to have a as broad a set of people who can um uh you can who can uh propose who can verify the state um because you are you need people to detect if there is an invalid state transition and then in play the interactive verification game um and then the second uh uh in the zero knowledge world the zero knowledge proof provides uh proof that like every state transition is valid but you need data availability to enable other people to propose blocks um otherwise you have like a you end up in a situation where a single centralized party can censor so really the the core properties of a of a blockchain censorship resistance um and uh uh auditability are like entirely dependent on this actual property which is data availability if you want to operate in like this sort of hyper scaled million blockchain world and that's why data availability is like the fundamental problem of blockchains go for it mustafa yeah so i mean it's an interesting question because like it sounds very counterintuitive and that data availability is like the core primitive that blockchain provides like we've seen like you know tweets from ava you know and like uh on their team saying that you know data availability is just some random problem it's like they don't understand they don't understand why it's even relevant in the first place and so it's very constantly intuitive to understand why if you're if if you've been looking at blockchains in the old model uh that has where bitcoin has that bitcoin has introduced um where consensus and execution are coupled together effectively but where you have a model where consensus where the consensus nodes don't execute your transaction then it starts to become clear why you know this availability is important and so like like before celestia was created or before it was called celestia it was originally called lazy ledger and the reason why it was called lazy ledger was because i was trying to figure out like what is the most minimal minimum viable like blockchain you can make um or in other words what is the least what is the least amount of work that a consensus nerd could do for that chain and how much like if you talk to an extreme think how much you know computation and work could you actually push to the end user like clients and make it so that the consensus knows not how to do it themselves and the conclusion i came to you was if you wanted to take this in the stream you basically like let's say you wanted to build a version of bitcoin you know with this you would basically just need a chain um where you can dump arbitrary data on it and every single transaction is allowed so imagine a version of bitcoin for example where invalid transactions are allowed to be posted on chain like you can store people's money on chain like how would that be secure it would still be secure because you just insert a a rule on the user's notes to say we will simply ignore invalid transactions that have been purchased on the chain and in the case let's say like there's two transactions that are trying to do a double spend and those two transactions are trying to spend the same coins and then obviously you just ignore the second one but in order to know which one came first uh like you can actually conflicting transactions like in order to know which one came first not only do you need ordering over the transactions you also need data availability because obviously you need to know you know the complete set of transactions that have ever been posted in order to know which one has is the first transaction with a specific property like for example which is the first transaction that spent the ctxo so this is kind of intuitively why but if you look at it from first principles by data availability it's kind of a core primitive of blockchains and this isn't anything new by the way but even back in 2014 before ethereum you know bitcoin developers were kind of arguing about this and discussing this and when one developer is a there's a mailing list post where peter todd argues with gregory maxwell um about what blockchain fundamentally is and peter thought was the first person to realize that you know blockchain is fundamentally a data availability layer and he refers to it as a proof of publication system effectively you're proving this to people that you've published data i want to pull on the the rope of data availability more zaki back to you any other strong opinions on data availability tell us more about how you see its role okay so two things that are worth mentioning so one of the things that i think is um uh most sort of um sort of uh uh uh under-appreciated about nakamoto consensus in proof-of-work um is that it actually has like really strong it economically incentivizes publishing blocks as long as the concentration of mining power is below the like selfish mining is profitable limit um and so like one of the things that i think that satoshi really got at some fundamental level in designing like the original bitcoin consensus is that i needed to provide it economic incentives um where the where because if you if you basically like mine a bunch of blocks um but don't publish them widely um you the likelihood of people building on top of those blocks is low and you never get the block rewards for this box those block rewards are in you know are on invalid for are not on the longest fork until you lose your block reward so you know you create this like economic incentive system for miners to push their blocks out to the rest of the mining pool to other mining pools and to make their box available at the lowest possible latency to the point where now we have like the fiber network and the bitcoin network almost never forks because you know there's both infrastructure and economic incentives for miners to make their blocks available uh like super fast and super efficiently um and i think it is like one of the things that like in you know pre-blockchain like bft research like just like did not understand this problem did not understand why it was important to solve it and like failed to produce a solution to these uh things uh and satoshi sort of somehow intuited um that there was this like missing idea in in like sort of open network public consensus which was like you must publish your data otherwise you lose money um which i think has been uh is sort of like the deeper insight that like is frequently lost on um sort of classical bft researchers um so that's uh that's that's one digression into the i think the other thing that is um is is sort of important to understand is that like the limit of computation that we all current that we experience is is that like so like most people who are like thinking about computers and stuff like that like are used to limitations on their computers like um how many cores does my computer have um how fast is the cpu but really what is our limitation on like how many transactions a blockchain can can process um is the i o bounds like how much memory does it read how much memory does it write um how much uh uh disc does it read how much disc does it write this comes down you know you frequently hear about this in the context of like ethereum scaling that even if we made ethereum consensus super fast we would still have this limit of of io and by decoupling data availability from uh uh from the from the from this process where you're publishing and and uh uh making transactions available but not actually running the i o that is required um to uh uh to process the transaction this is the only plausible way in which like we can truly achieve like the sort of like we are going to produce petabytes of block space we're only the we're like only a minority of the node operators for any given state transition any given blockchain are actually processing those transactions because they care about it but the underlying transaction data is available to the entire world that's like how we get it's like the only plausible path to like petabytes of secure block space as a strategy mustafa can we get your thoughts on the two points that zaki just made yeah i i genuinely agree um in general i think you know bitcoin got a lot of things right that you know previous academic research has hasn't kind of realized and in general i find that um like traditional there should be existing pieces that are often kind of there's a lot of there's a lot lost lost on them uh when they look at blockchains because it's a completely different model and they often they try to apply it they often try to apply traditional distributed systems and concepts on blockchains which most of the time works and is necessary but sometimes um it does not work mainly for the main reason like traditional distributed systems uh have a kind of state machine replication model where they see my honest major honest major is the assumption for for the correctness of the state so like traditional bfd systems they just assume like you know two sets of the operators or the validators in the bfc consensus you know are you know being honest uh but actually the the threat model for bitcoin is much more harsh than that uh you know the bitcoin threat model does not assume that the miners are honest uh because it assumes that you know users are running full notes or there should be like clients that support fraud proofs which is which is referred to alerts in the original bitcoin white paper let's transition i received a significant amount of questions around ibc um question to you both what role do you see ibc playing in a multi multi-chain world and general thoughts uh about ibc and and and as it relates to shared security zaki why don't we start with you so i think it's important to sort of always like to recognize okay so there is um there's ibc as it exists as a concrete piece of uh uh um um uh uh uh um ibc exists as a concrete piece of software um uh uh um uh i ibc existed sorry i got distracted um ibc uh exists as a concrete piece of software which is you know a tendermint like client a set of application protocols that live on top of it and this is the exp this like mutually communicating tendermint like client world now ibc is a framework in which you can build lots of stuff on top of it and so you know you could build a version of ibc that like has data availability proofs in it um and a challenge period or requires a validity proof um these are all the uh um these are all the the uh sort of underwater these are the underlying elements of uh um of uh um of uh uh uh like these things can be included into the ibc model um so i think it's going to be it sort of represents like an interesting question as to like which direction ibc evolves does it stay out of sort of these like state machine verification components or does the technology of roll-ups start to actually start migrating into the ibc world yeah so after that um like we have been looking at you know adding four proofs um or zk proves to ibc before so where this becomes relevant is um like okay like first of all it's a common misconception that roll-ups must post four proofs specifically groups on chain and that's only if like you've got an enshrined brick like roll-ups work like works weren't that way because ethereum roll-ups have an enshrined bridge between the roll-up and the and the ethereum chain um and they just like posted the serial main chain because they implement a slight client for that role as a smart contract in solidarity um but there's different ways you can do that like instead of posting default proof to some chain you can actually just distribute it on the php network assuming that the chain you're merging to has already embedded the light client for your roll up like natively as part of its as part of its code and so this is kind of like more in line with how ibc works so like with ibc um it supports different types of light clients you know so like the cellular machine for example or you know there's a multi you know multi-sig type like multi-violator type and validation like light science but you could potentially introduce a new type of light fly into ibc specifically for your roll-up or for a up that in addition to checking that your roll-up chain has the correct signatures by the correct operators it also listens out for fraud proofs for your chain but it listens out for you for the short proofs on the php layer um so like think of mina for example like mina is a blockchain that has a vk proof for all of its blocks but where does the decay proof get posted you know it doesn't get posted to unchain like a roll-up it just gets distributed on the php layer um and you can do the exact same thing with waterproofs uh it's it's it's you know it's easy with single waterfall proofs but it gets a bit more complicated with um you know interactive interactive food proofs uh but it's still you know it's still theoretically possible and there's you know i know if researchers um have schemes for it so we're going to transition to audience q a here very shortly but before we do um zaki just summarize the trade-offs and your higher level message for the audience on on shared security is there anything you want to leave us with before we go into q a okay so there there's one thing i would say that i is a is a is a meaningful trade-off which is all of these like fraud and validity provable state machines that um that um and like all of the machinery around verifying them and generating them and performing computations inside of them are all like extremely new extremely cutting edge extremely exciting computer science um but on the other hand we have tendermint which exists um and like generally the the space of like blockchain bft consensus um which is um and so one thing that i think sometimes gets a little bit lost in the conversation is that like the non-shared security model has the advantage of using fairly mature technology um as its underlying like interop layer that has like been developed over the last like seven years um whereas all of this stuff that is enabling shared security is very much so like it's interesting that i sometimes i like i sometimes see like the perception that like shared security is safer now um on the current software that's running on um than you know ibc is now and i think the theoretical limit of safety of shared security is much safer than ibc um but the uh the in the sort of you know permit like client model but the like actual practical applied security of these systems is in favor of the ibc model today but it won't be it presumably won't be like you know at some point when these when these like fraud when these like fraud provable state machines are like fully mature and before q a and mustafa please leave us with your sort of final take on unsure security and and your stance yeah i i don't disagree with that um com for i come to shared security like my part like to me the the best use case of shared security is not so much trust minimization in bridges or transformations even though that's actually very you know very important uh to me it's about you know the ease of deploying your own blockchain um like it's easier to deploy your blockchain as a roll-up because you don't have to worry about having your own validate then as opposed to having to bootstrap you know a secure and decentralized validate um and so that's why i kind of that's why i'm not opposed to you know i agree with exactly that and you know i'm not i'm not a i'm not a trust minimized bridge maximalist um i think like people should do whatever is reasonable for their use case and whatever is the easiest way for them to deploy their own blockchain as long as that chain has you know uh the threshold of security that they require okay so i think we had a pretty good discussion and it's time to go into q a with the audience we've been roughly going for an hour uh let's field some questions i've been seeing things on twitter um so please raise your hands but i'll start off with one question that we got a decent amount of likes on uh many and here's the question many applications on ethereum such as maker and compound already trust governance tokens for safety they might as well use them for consensus too scoping governance token permissions is a similar problem to designing application specific chains opinion what's your guys's take i guess like there's several things i'll think of that um yeah i mean that could potentially make this make sense for compound like maybe they have decided like they could very well decide that um they have a sufficient decentralized they have a sufficient distribution among their government certainty that it could you know be a validator network um although i don't think that's likely because i think for runway correctly uh 50 of the governor's tokens are owned by two or three uh entities um one of which being is being um a16z or all of these oh i might be getting that next top with with maker uh but that's that's you know that's my free collection um but the point i'm making here is what is what the token distribution for governance token is not necessarily the ideal token distribution for validator set or station distribution um that's the first thing i would say um so like it might like that might be appropriate for compound but it might not necessarily be appropriate for all chains and the second thing i would say is um not all like not all applications might be in favor of unchained governance and even if they are in favor of in favor of on-chain governance they might not be in favor of unchained governance to arbitrarily change the state's machine or code of that smart contract um like there might be they might only be for off-chain on-chain governance for changing specific parameters of that protocol not necessarily for changing the entire state's machine or transition function for that protocol and the last thing i would say is like like my vision for you know blockchains in general is i see blockchains as you know like sovereign communities or more generally uh social coordination platforms um so like let's say like to be the most powerful thing about blockchain is you know if a group of people wanted to organize something and was wanting to get together for a common purpose you know they could create a dow for example um on ethereum they could you know they choose to create a dialogue in ethereum but like creating it down in ethereum is kind of like incorporating a company in a specific country uh like by creating it down in theory you're incorporating an entity like in ethereum and so you're bound effectively uh by the social contract of ethereum and you know let's say like your dow gets hacked then you have to convince ethereum to hard fork or let's say like or another case might be like if there might hard fork to introduce evm of codes or resource pricing that makes your that's unfavorable to your dao application uh so like the the in for the feature model for blockchains i see is where each application gets its own chain and so and like each chain is a community of people that have you know shared you know interest or shared beliefs and in that model i see heart for walks as a feature like hard forks are effectively a social recourse mechanism uh the smaller like the smaller a chain is or it's more like less applications that chain serves the more likely the community over that chain is to agree with each other on upgrades and changes and so you can kind of have like a community a chain um or like use your chain as a social coordination platform to implement decisions made by by your community and you might not want to use you know um please accuracy like whoever earns the most tokens as your governance mechanism and i think that's like one thing that's the most powerful about this like multi-chain application specific blockchain paradigm zaki we'll kick it over to you before you speak folks uh we are fielding questions here so if anyone does want to ask a question uh you know please do raise your hand um zaki go for it i know mustafa just dropped a lot for us please comment i mean i don't know what to do with it other than how like joyous it is when you hear mustafa or anyone else just like recite the cosmos thesis back to you um five years later you know it's uh like this is this like block like i think there is this enormous like logic towards application specific blockchains um and i think that there is um there are always going to be sort of mega application blockchains that are in some sense is going to be application specific they may be centered around a particular set of like d5 primitives um or like a particular dow or something like that there will always be big blockchains in this world but i i've always i i really fundamentally believe um that enabling this like power law distribution of blockchains um where there are small super secure community settlement engines um is is the mission of this space and so uh you know and i think celestia is you know there are a lot of like specific software development things but like celestia is fundamentally an enormous step forward in the very long term vision of cosmos um and you know we have cosmos is a very long game um that uh that like is has made enormous strides forwards this year um and it is it is really exciting to see like you know 37 interoperating cosmos chains like live in the world um and i expect that to be in the hundreds or the thousands um and then someday we want to be able to go to the millions and that is the infrastructure that celestia is building we got a pretty specific question i think from ansem what is the difference in the security of bridges from l1 to l1 l1 to l2 l1 to side chains versus ibc and house versus ibc and how significant are the trade-offs there mustafa thoughts um yeah so like i have a blog post about this called clusters that kind of catholic uh categorizes bridges into two types um trust what i call trust minimize bridges and what i call committee-based bridges it's like uh the bridge uh between between l1 and the roll-up um is considered to be a trust minimized bridge and what that means is that even if the roll-up operator misbehaves the roll-up operator cannot steal your funds and on the other hand you know a bridge between l1 and a side chain is very similar to a bridge between two cosmos zones using ibc and it's what i would refer to as a committee-based bridge where you have to kind of put your trust in the committee which might be the validators of that chain or operators of a bridge like like wormhole bridge uh to effectively attest to the state of that chain and to make sure that only the correct only only blocks to have valid transactions are relayed across the chains and therefore your funds in order for your funds not to be stolen you have to kind of trust this committee zaki you care about it um all i would say is i do think that there is a big difference between um so there's there's one thing that matters which is um is there a plausible way in which like there's like one sort of subtle difference um between various kinds of committee-based chains and one is the question is do you have to do business development with the committee uh in order to interact with the blockchain um and if you look at like committee-based blockchains that are like um uh that you know that are not ibc like the wormholes of the world you know you have to go to a bunch of meetings and like convince a bunch of validators um to and like to to uh to connect to your chain um if you want to join the uh the wormhole network for instance or uh you know any no any of the any of these like enormous number of other uh committee-based bridges um right now we live in a world where there's if we're like the ratio of like there's extremely large number of bridge projects of committee-based bridge projects and a relatively small number of blockchains so like for any given blockchain someone will probably be willing to bridge you um but that stops making sense as the number of blockchains starts to grow um and ibc is very special in the way that it does not require business development um with the committee or the validator set um uh in order for two blockchains to speak ibc to uh to connect with each other and i think that's like one of the more uh important properties of ibc and and one thing i would add to that is like i'm not uh i'm not i'm not inherently against committee-based um bridging like i think we need both um and i actually like that there's this potential world where um like roll ups themselves like you might deploy a like a sovereign native roll-up on celestia that it solved as a committee-based bridge operated by like a bridge provider to other chains and if you think about it that's like that's basically what ethereum is and if you kind of like you know turn it upside down turn your view upside down in a sense like if you look at the v of ethereum uh from polygon like the polygon ethereum is technically just a wormhole type bridge for all the roll-ups on ethereum um like it's very secure wormhole type bridge because obviously secured by the entire ethereum validator set uh but it's still a committee-based bridge and so there's definitely a potential for like roll-ups themselves also to utilize committee-based bridges as well as thrust minimized bridges because ultimately we will have an ecosystem where there's multiple chains that use a mixture of committee-based bridges and trust minimizer bridges and as i said before like to be the main interesting thing about roll-ups is the ease of deploying your own chain um without and that can be secure itself without having to kind of bootstrap your own validate mustafa to keep you uh on the mic here there was a significant amount of inbound on really defining modular uh it's a nathan space there's tons of talk about it but i know you have some strong opinions here can you build on top of sort of your modular thesis how do you define this budding world uh well i guess like different people define it differently um i originally used the word module blockchain in a blog post in 2019 to introduce lazy ledger to mean the separation of consensus and data so separation of consensus and execution uh in a blockchain um like different projects have used it in different ways and so that's why i think there's some confusion there and like for example ava has used it to mean um like modularizing the software stack itself i mean in the sense like like you have like the software stack itself might like it might be modular uh like the sentiment itself is actually modular uh from a software perspective uh because it separates the state machine and the consensus like you can plug in your own state you can plug in like your own like you know state machine using you know avci this sentiment and that's basically how how the cosmos sdk and tenement interact with each other but in the context of like um the cryptosphere module blockchain generally means separating you know consensus and execution and that's effectively how roll-ups work because they do they do execution of chain but post data on change i think we have a question here we'll add this guy as a speaker while he's connecting we'll actually have welcome uh care to ask your question okay looks like he's not can you hear me yes we can yes um thank you so uh i i've been following on and i'm really impressed with everything i just had a question so mustafa said um polka dot basically can scale to a hundred chains and he didn't really speak on um the power threads that they have where you can play block by block so i was wondering if you could just speak on that and to see the difference between um celestia and polkadot and that variance in the sense that even though you have 100 chains with the power threads you can scale even multiple and further than the 100. so is this like a new thing they've added to the roadmap where you can pay like instead of paying for execution slots on that basis yeah so i think that is interesting uh but it's still fundamentally different because um you're paying for execution but you're paying like when you're paying even if you're paying per block on a political side model uh you're paying the red day chain to verify the execution of your chain uh or take it well at minimum take an interest in the validity of the application in your chain in the celestial model you're only paying the celestial main chain to make for data availability uh but not execution uh so like you're not bottlenecked by execution effectively because you're using because the main chain does not have to execute your staff uh because yours because your chain uses waterproofs or zk proofs to prove their verification to prove their execution to other people so thank you very much okay let me try and explain it in uh in sort of mustafa's framework which is polka dot is a system in which there's a built-in bridge and the bridge assumes the validity of the state transition from that like the state transition function is honestly executed by all uh uh uh uh like um uh para threads and parachutes um so because of the way in which the built-in bridge works in polka dot the polka dot relay chain has to take an interest in the validity of the state transition function for any chain in which it is executing the state transition because it's it has this other function of being a bridge and that bridge function requires so you can sort of flip polka dot over and think of polka dot as a committee-based bridge in which the committee basically says okay for this straight transition that we want to bridge um you are going to spin up a validator set and check like some number of blocks whether or not that number of blocks is one or more um which is the parachain model more as the pear-shaped model one is the parachain thread in order for our bridge to function um i i think sometimes polka dot almost kind of makes more sense if you think of it primarily as a bridge that has this property um as being like a very interesting committee-based bridge thanks zaki we have another person here who'd like to ask a question chad go for it yeah my question is uh do you guys think it's possible to have shared security amongst a non-instant finality chains or do you think shared security can only occur amongst instant finality i think it's actually going to answer that better but i don't i don't see any inherent reason why you can't have security against do they defend altitudes like people just like you just have you just have to yeah yeah i mean you get into these like there is this there is this weird coupling that you start to see and roll up centric ethereum where you're like okay like i push my like i publish my um uh my uh uh i publish my like zero knowledge proof to a chain then it's gonna take 15 minutes to finalize um where like the zero knowledge proof chain is sort of waiting for its own state transition function to be finalized um and you get these like weird couplings between the bridges that happen in these like non-instant finality environments um you know i i think that there are there's like the design space of everything you can do in like low latency bridging environments in non-instant finality change is not fully explored i have some ideas that have not uh actually like i haven't really written about yet um but i you know there is um there is that the other thing the other question is whether or not the roll-up itself could be non-instant finality um and i think in the celestia model like it's very easy for you to imagine a roll-up that is not uh instant finality um where there are multiple parties that have the authority to extend the chain and there is some fork choice rule i know that like mustafa and i have like talked about this in the past in in previous private conversations thanks for your question chad i'm going to call out some folks here uh who i think should be asking some questions eric wall ali atiyah coney daddy uh don't be shy jump in uh while you guys do um we did get a specific question around celestia um how does celestia empower like clients mustafa please uh select celestia is built from the ground up with light clients in mind um like if it wasn't designed for light finance in mind then we would have like released mainnet maybe a year ago um but it might seem insignificant but when you actually think about it like like clients is effectively have like core to you know you know blockchain scalability um like because scalability is defined so blockchain credibility is defined as equal to the throughput of your chain divided by the cost for end users to validate that chain and that's the fundamental reason why you know ethereum doesn't just want to increase the the gas size limit and the fundamental reason why like kind of solana's strategy is somewhat controversial because there's very high kind of resource requirements surrounding those there and but no one can actually validate the chain you know using a laptop for example it's like how can you actually be sure like like from your problem the user perspective like it's not different to you know a web 2 database because you can't actually verify the chain and the most important aspect of web three uh one of the most important is that you have to rely on you know trusted third parties or middlemen um kind of follows for the state valuability of your application um so it's like it's very easy to scale a chain if you don't care about you know end user validity like you know you just fork bitcoin or ethereum and increase the gas size a little bit you know job done and but you know the whole like roll-ups are kind of a more long-term approach because roll-ups try to check you know scale chains and using ford and zk proofs we allow end users to which doesn't increase execution requirements of that chain so in celestia and what we've done is it's kind of two components to light science and we've implemented data availability sampling like clients which means that like any user could verify the entire data availability of the entire celestia chain without having to download the entire chain uh instead they only have downloaded a very small piece of every block and with that they can actually get assurances that are almost equivalent to running a validator node or a full node we have diesel fight here ready to ask a question uh go for it man hey thanks for bringing me on um i just wanted to ask mustafa a little bit about the difference between like optima and uh celestine using f most of the execution layer and also like what the final product would look like for someone trying to start their own dow or chain without a bootstrapping validator set yeah so sevmos is like one of the first products that is being built on top of celestia and sevmos in a nutshell is basically like a settlement chain for for evm based roll-ups um so what so what that does that mean um like that basically means instead of deploying you know your evm chain on top of ethereum you could deploy on this other settlement layer called sevmos and the reason why you would do that is because we're designing cell moles from the ground up in such a way that the resources would be priced and the chain will be structured such that roll-ups are first-class citizens in the sense that we want we want to discourage people from deploying smart contracts or applications directly on the settlement layer but pushing them to roll-ups which do offshore execution i think that's it that's really important because um ethereum has this kind of like first of all chicken and egg problem um where like on the grand scale of things roll ups using a roll up on ethereum does not save you that much fees uh like maybe maybe saves you like you know 75 percent of the fee if you use optimistic roll up because call data is still so expensive but for most people that's not really compelling reason these into the roll-up unless they truly care about uh you know shared security when they can just you know get one cent transactions you know on polygon or you know avalanche teaching um so and you know like in a significant chunk of diseases of ethereum are just you know like uh well-resourced like you know whales or you know people that have a lot of eats i don't mind paying 50 transaction fees um so i think there's some value in creating a chain that's optimized solely for roll-ups um not just like arbitrarily but also in terms of resource pricing and what like one thing that we're looking at is you know making the making making the cost to write on read state um too expensive for people to deploy smart contracts directly on the settlement layer so that they will be forced uh to use roll-ups um so if i think this could even encourage you know strongly financially incentivize people these roll-ups and this is something this is kind of something that the guest team is actually trying to avoid and like they're trying to do the opposite of this uh if you look at eip for what it's called but it was the eip where you know the cost that was supposing the core data costs to be reduced like the guessing the guest team main concern about this was actually um that these favors roll up so much and that would make you know normal applications too expensive that i'm not using roll-ups so we'll be concluding shortly here so if anyone has any final questions please raise your hand uh zaki we did get a question for you somewhat of a more on the personal side of things when and how did zaki realize that data availability is a fundamental part of the blockchain scalability so i think one of the people i remember talking most um compellingly about data availability a long time ago is joseph poon uh from like the original lightning paper and handshake um and talking about like how the data availability incentives work in um in bitcoin and why data availability is sort of a little bit of the is like sort of the fundamental problem i think the other thing that like was is just like when you try to work through committee rotations in a charted blockchain like and you're like okay like how will this committee rotation fail um and you fun and you typically run into this problem of hey the way the committee rotation will like you know the the um you know sharded blockchains are all well and good until a committee rotation fails um and then there's like basically what happens is you get like one of the shards is not live um and then how do you ever recover um it's kind of an interesting is sort of the the the root problem to trying to figure out um how a sharded blockchain um can be secure um and all of those things sort of kept landing me back at data availability problems um and sort of um you know looking in the world for um solutions and you know that uh that caused me to pay attention to what mustafa was working on helpful uh there's an actually there's another problem that isn't um that is sort of related to data availability that i have a lot of experience with this which is why is there a 21 day unbonding period um on the cosmos sdk um the sort of default cosmos uh on bonding period comes from this like notion of wanting to make sure that there is that there's enough time for data on consensus attacks um against the ibcy clients to become available and if we had some sort of magical data availability solution uh of which i've been interested in several different flavors of um you could go you know you could substantially reduce that unbonding period thank you zachy um we are getting this on twitter mustafa when you mention sovereign uh rollups or sovereign communities uh can you please expand on that and tell us more about your vision as it relates to that term um yeah so the way i see it and this is kind of echoing something like ethan uh bookman said which is that you know the the invention of personal computing allowed individuals to be sovereign sorry individuals to be sovereign um but the the invention of you know blockchains allowed communities to be sovereign um in the sense that for the first time you can actually have like a shared community space where you can have you know a group of shared people can kind of can get together and organize uh like independently of the status quo in a sense that you can have a you know a community yeah you know with it with with with self-agreed rules that are completely voluntary that are enforced without you know requiring a third party like a court system or the police to enforce those rules and you know this this only works in a limited kind of setting specifically with resource allocation in a financial setting but i think that's that's very powerful um and in particular because it allows um kind of like it's very you know internet native in the sense that it allows anyone with an internet connection to join a movement or community and decide how resources within that community is allocated and but at the moment that's just currently done using dallas and smart contract um but i think it would be very powerful if you could actually create like your own chain like community can create its own chain that is not that does not necessarily derive its authority from some higher chain um like in the sense like if you deploy a syriac dao or roll up um that your chain is bound by the social consensus of the ethereum community uh yeah but maybe not necessarily like maybe you want to diverge from the same community you don't necessarily agree you know on the politics of the same community and it's like you don't really have many options to have your own effectively state machine with rules um unless you just create your own chain with a weak valid data set which isn't great but celestia actually allows you to create what's called sovereign roll-ups and so you can create a roll-up that does not settle to any other chain like it does not like for example like ethereum roll-ups are effectively baby chains ethereum and like they kind of like they derive the authority from the exterior mainstream uh but like similarly like have you have you have a github fork that's connected to like the master you know you know master git reaper like but what if he actually disconnects that link once it connects you know like you can get like in a github you can like disconnect that from the network um and so that's like with a sovereign roll up you can actually have like a rollup that does not necessarily post or like have like have an enshrined bridge to some other master chain but you can have a completely independent chain and bend it roll up um and you can hard fold that roll up at your own will but the community can half that it's rolled up you know it's in its own uh if it decides to without having to ask for permission from the chain as in trying bridgewood i think that's yeah okay so we're at time here zaki we'd like to thank you for just you know taking the 90 minutes here to to be with us any parting words for us before we go um i mean i think that this is where i think uh roll-ups data availability the modular blockchain hypothesis is just like one of the most it's kind of it's been a very exciting thing it's kind of time is is now i think that there's like a this is this is kind of the the moment where it kind of all starts to come together and so it was very exciting to be here with you guys thank you mustafa any parting words for us yeah likewise very exciting times and um if you wanna if you're interested in learning more about slasher then go to celestia org and there's various resources there that you can learn more about but also we're also building out like a section of the website and for a lot of people to learn about module box in general that should be hopefully kind of coming this year there you have it if you want to learn more about modular go to celestia.org everyone thank you so much zaki thank you mustafa thank you we'll see you guys offline
