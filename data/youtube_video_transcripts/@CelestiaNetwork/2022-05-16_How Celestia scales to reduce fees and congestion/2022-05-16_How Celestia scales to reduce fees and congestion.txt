[Music] what if there is one application that is so popular that it just you know the it drives the fees up on celestia to five dollars per transaction like is this a is this uh a catastrophic scenario for celestia or is that still viewed as a positive outcome mustafa please yeah so yeah i'll respond to that but i also want uh johnson i'm sure john also has lots of opinions about this uh so so the short answer is um yes like uh like first of all like no blockchain can guarantee cheap fees if any blockchain you know guaranteed you know cheap fees then it would be vulnerable to denial of service attacks because like someone could just spam it with free transactions um so like in celestia and and which includes it in celestia and every other blockchain that you know is not vulnerable to enough service attacks there is a block size limit um and that's intellectually there will be a block size limit now the question is you know what is that block size limit uh well there's several questions here so first of all like what is that blockchain system and how do you how do we pick that box limit and how does it scale and um secondly like what is the maximum potential size uh for that block size limit compared to like a monolithic you know blockchain like lana for example so first of all and so one thing i've said before is like we define scalability as equal to the number of transactions or the throughput that transact that blockchain can handle divided by the cost and for an end user or like client to validate the correctness of that chain um and this is the fundamental reason why for example ethereum or bitcoin would not just you know increase the block size to something insanely high because like end users would not be able to you know run the full node to check that the chain is correct now this is this is kind of contrary to slander for example where solana have taken the approach where they don't care about end user verification and they just want to scale you know throughput um as high as possible on the monolithic chain so for the bottom part of the equation um which is the cost for end user to verify the chain uh the the property in celestia is such that um because we use a primitive called data the example the more users that are in the chain the more life lines there are on the chain doing data availability cycling then the higher the block size because we can we can increase it to like safely without compromising the ability for end users to verify the correctness of that chain or in other words to check that the chain data is fully available um and that's because with data availability sampling any and any like client can verify that the chain is fully available by only downloading a very small piece of that chain um so that's one side of the equation which is that we can scale with number of users or like any blockchain including you know when ethereum 2.0 adopts it any blockchain that supports states availability sampling can scale end user verification uh with number of users but then the next question is um so like scaling end user verification is all you know well and good but how about like actually increasing the throughput of the chain or the block production of the chain so uh because that's that's the the other end of the equation which is like how many how much like data how big block how how big of the blocks can um like the actual miners or the validators or the stickers in the chain actually scalably produce so in celestia i would argue that would be fundamentally higher than other systems like solana and the core reason for that is because the validators on the solicitor chain they don't do execution of of the user's transactions and they just do the data availability and so which is a very bandwidth heavy uh resource requirement but not computation or kind of memory heavy uh requirement and the fundamental difference here is that um like including like just providing data availability is a stateless operation which means that you don't have to like remember any user state so like for example in solana you have to have a huge amount of memory i think it was like 256 gigabytes of memory to run a validator because you have to remember a huge amount of state for example user balances to actually validate blocks but in celestia because we decouple data availability and execution the actual violators of the chain they don't have to maintain state they just have to put they just have to have the bandwidth to you know receive transactions and put them in blocks and that fundamentally allows you to increase block production to much higher then if the validate is all has also had to do execution um and all and computational transactions
