how's everyone doing today hopefully everyone's doing well um would uh love to kind of start this panel with some great people that I've come to know in research for a little bit and so uh the first kind of question I'd love to for y'all to do is do a quick intro talk about yourselves uh what you do and how you got into gaming hello um nice to meet you all and thanks for coming my name is Morris um I'm the co-founder of primodium which is uh currently a fully on chain game that you can play it's live uh before promoting them I built a crypto product called uh Critters which was basically a play to earned version of Minecraft unfortunately Microsoft decided to pull the plug on it so we moved to building fully on June games afterwards I'm also figured out a bunch of Theses along the way of building that before building stuff in crypto I was your typical B2B SAS startup founder we went through YC in summer 2019 and have been building our company since then and uh yeah that's about my career background my name is David I run a venture fund called duneventures we invest at the intersection of gaming and Technology we do everything from web3 to VR to Ai and all the above we've been investing for the last three years and yeah awesome thanks for the introductions y'all um so I think today's panel will be a really quick chat about uh things from about online gaming both from the builders and the investors perspective and hopefully we'll have like a casual conversation with some hot takes sprinkled throughout um so yeah I'd love to first start off with kind of the general kind of questions we're thinking about um I think the first question is just are on-chain games even made for normal gamers uh for the time being I don't think so and I don't think it'll be for a very well for quite a while at the very least the reason why is just because if you want to get people to play well the main reason in my view to build an on-chain game is because when you have decentralized scarcity well when you have decentralized uh consensus for every in-game action and every in-game asset all of these in-game assets and so on have real value um and and this is something that people in crypto specifically are happy to ascribe real value too so kind of like Bitcoin and nfts and so on um such that normal players while they can understand that it will take a lot longer to rock and so you know you can launch a game put it on like Reddit or put it on steam or something like that a lot of people will try it but like pretty much nobody will bother sticking whereas if you give that to a crypto audience a lot more people will stick and so it's like well at this point if you're trying to launch to a normal audience then and like 99.9 of them churn then you know it's a bit of a Fool's errand at the moment to focus fully on that yeah I think the short answer is is no um but I think the more interesting question is what is a gamer um I think if we look back 15 years ago I think if you had shown mobile games or Candy Crush 2 uh a World of Warcraft Dev he would have told you that's not a game and so the question is how do we Define what a gamer is and does crypto gaming and crypto gaming audience just change or expand the audience definition I think that's that's the more interesting question so I think the short answer is no I think crypto games will be an entirely new audience sounds good and so kind of extrapolating from that kind of crypto Gamers being a new audience I think we also you've talked a little about like normal Gamers as well that's kind of how they like the framed the initial for question would love to kind of see what y'all think like in the next Advent of like when online gaming will become a trend or will become some kind of uh category within gaming how will the normal no more gamer ever find an on-chain game will it be through do you think do you think traditional platforms will Embrace this kind of bunch of game narrative or will be like entirely new avenues well right now the primary methods of user acquisition for on-chain games and the like is uh Twitter right um and Twitter has normal people on it that's not involved in critter sorry that's not involved in uh in crypto and so at that point yeah I think that the traditional channels would be would be that but then again the focus is that do you really need to focus on traditional as in like non-crypto native people to be playing your game and I would argue the answer isn't is is no because um if you look at D5 for example like there's there's clearly enough of a market size of people familiar with uh with crypto participating in it rather than needing to really onboard whoever else that that aren't already familiar um yeah I don't have much data I think um the interesting thing about crypto is you have entirely new viral uh distribution mechanisms you can use right which is like gabelin uses this term like uh free to own I think it is and basically using tokens as a way to onboard users and so I think there's a lot of really novel ways we don't we don't understand today that we'll we'll use to acquire players awesome yeah that makes a lot of sense so kind of moving on I think here's kind of the first kind of question that could lead to some discussion think a little bit about like ugc like user gender content and stuff like that how do you solve the Dilemma that auction games aim to thrive through composability but players mostly create ugc or use gender content if the game is already thriving such as Minecraft or Roblox yeah so that's that's actually one of the main reasons why I I don't focus on composability for the time being uh like it's something there it's something people can do um we're built on top of mud so people can just add more systems and components if they'd like but that's not the main focus of like why people should play the game so I think I think there are a couple of games out there that like they primarily focus on the part that like oh you can you can play this aspect of the game a little bit differently just because like now you can write specific rule sets between players and so on um but as you said that's not something that players are going to bother doing until like the play the game is much more Advanced uh if you will um and so that's why as I was going back to it you have to really figure out well aside from composability then what kind of features does an on-chain game provide um as as to a in terms of like entertainment for players like what kind of features does it provide to players uh such that they can't get anywhere else so they would come play your on-chain game in my view it's uh it's basically an in-game economy that is real uh so realize in the sense that they are denominated in real value uh like ethereum or usdc or whatever else and that the game is completely decentralized such that the economy isn't really owned by anybody and some something that's very similar to Eve except everything is of real value this aspect of building an in-game economy is a lot harder to build if the game wasn't on chain because of regulatory problems for one we can dig more into that and also uh the other side is um oracles are uh are pretty uh are pretty insecure and so like when you have an entire game entire Logic on chain uh then you can have a much more secure game economy that isn't really uh as vulnerable nothing out okay sounds good yeah I think we could dig into the regulatory side a little bit from both the Builder and the investor perspective you kind of mentioned a little bit about that um what are some of the kind of regulatory kind of insights that you have both as a game builder yeah also maybe as an investor um so I'm not a lawyer uh this is not legal advice but this is to the best of my understanding uh as somebody building the space so um the main reason why most games today don't have don't allow you to cash out uh like for example if you have a sword or something and you get like 40 coins out of it they don't let you convert that 40 coins into like forty dollars is because of a thing called money transmission rules uh so basically if if the company is the one that's like you know if your currency in-game has real value and the company is the one that's helping facilitate the transactions of people getting stuff to one another this is only pertaining to the us as well France but as a U.S company so yeah so so you you have this money transmission problem that like if your currency is of real value and you're and you're transferring money from one player to another you'd be considered a money transmitter um the thing about on-chain games is that even if people are transferring assets of real value to players um you are not actually The Entity that's that's that's doing that for them the ethereum network is um so you what you are as a game company is more of a peer-to-peer service provider that you link up you know two people that want to send stuff to one another as opposed to you as a company that's facilitating that now that's not to say that like you you do that and everything's all fine now obviously if there are money laundering that's happening on your platform it doesn't matter if you're not a money transmitter you don't have to register as one but yeah that that just means that like compared to a normal game um in terms of regulatory stuff there is less there's there's a different architecture that you can do um in terms of building the game such that it doesn't touch on uh these roles as as much um there's a there's a very good article written by Amy Madison um who is talking about web3 gaming regulatory stuff uh I would recommend you guys look it up um and read through that yeah I don't have much to add I think uh the shortest we just don't know um you know money in games is very complicated legal topic um things like skill skill based gaming Etc have different regulatory regimes depending on which U.S state you're in you need different licenses and opinions uh you know some traditional gaming companies we work with have to get opinions from 50 plus companies 50 plus States and uh and that's just the US and you know doesn't even include massive countries like China and India so um yeah the tldr is that it's gonna be very complicated we don't know what it's going to look like um so we're very early I'll also I'm talking primarily in terms of money transmission because that that's what um pertains most to the type of game that we want to build in terms of having an economy and having people uh trade with one another but there are other considerations like tokens whether or not their Securities and so on and so forth that uh fortunately for us we don't have to think about that too much in terms of the way we're designing our product but uh that is also a big topic that isn't covered here yet absolutely yeah thanks for sharing that kind of perspective I think we can probably move on to a little bit more of a builder perspective I think um and obviously if there's any kind of investor takes on it as well I think the first question is what is the hook for on-chain gaming as a challenge it can you like can you phrase in a way that does not exist inside the traditional gaming Market yeah so that's going back to what I was uh kind of hammering on again which was just that it's uh it's the fact that okay so the analogy that I like to give is and Matt Levine and Satoshi has kind of written about this in in better terms than I can put but basically if you have Bitcoin running on one person's computer uh it's saying that you know I've got one Bitcoin you've got three Bitcoin and so on it's just one person's computer nobody's gonna bother ascribing real value to that Bitcoin there but as soon as you put it on a network and as soon as there is decentralized consensus now there's there's provable scarcity of that one Bitcoin and three Bitcoin and so on such that people are happy to ascribe real value to it now whether that real value should be a dollar or thirty thousand dollars is up to debate but the point is because of this product architecture now all of a sudden people are happy you ascribe real alley to it and and that in my view is the main product Market fit of crypto as a product if you will um and so when you kind of push that out to a bit of a logical extreme you can build and you build a game entirely um on chain in this case basically you get to create a world a story and so on around these numbers that are running on chain so you can build a story around ethereum you can build a story around Bitcoin obviously those already have its own myths and so on that have been built but when you build an online game you get to do that entirely from scratch with your own Resources with your own tokens and so on such a people are happy to describe Rio Valley to everything that goes on in there and that is in my view a very different way of looking at it from like you know your traditional games such as if I made a carrot farming app today and it was spawning 10 carats a day and so on nobody would bother ascribing real value to that 10 carats just because it's not on chain it's not on it's not crypto it's not real um and that is the way that people feel it um and so if you kind of looking on chain games like that's the that is the the different feeling that people get uh from from playing something that that is on Chain versus playing something that isn't um we actually see that today then like when we have a test net version of the game um sure it's live and it's a game it's a game that you can play it's just the same as like any other web flash games that you can play from like anywhere else it's just the same but it's not live it's not real because it's not on Main net and it's not like you know the assets aren't real and so that that's my view of like what the difference is are from like auction games and on chain games um if you will yeah I think the only thing I have to yeah I think that's right I think um is the the addition of values is going to be at least the the initial hook to why people play games right I think value has existed in games for for a long time uh but tends to happen in sort of great markets uh or dark markets uh when you think about like yield farming on on World of Warcraft or job or whatever it is um those things happen value is transacted but it's very very difficult um Publishers don't like it for things like Regulatory and legal reasons uh they don't want to get money transmitter licenses and so the idea hopefully is that blockchains make it much easier to transmit value across games because the value exists it's a question of unlocking it awesome yeah thanks I think a quick like kind of follow-up there I think there's is like taking the ad like the devil's advocator again the opposite perspective of like do we really need to put everything on chain for example there's some people who say like computationally intensive things don't need to put on chain or um only certain assets especially within like play to earn or game five it's only the tokens or the assets not the actual gameplay yeah in my in my view it's a it's a security uh concern not Securities but security uh in terms of um vulnerabilities and so on and so uh in our case when we were running our previous project basically we had this in-game economy uh this was this is basically it was a Minecraft server um that had tokens that are in there that people can buy and sell different items and it's your typical Minecraft gaming economy sorry Minecraft server economy where Minecraft has a lot of items people buy and sell to one another so there is a way that you can do it on you can do it off chain which yes it's computation and also it's Minecraft which is not watching game right so uh so everything was was computed off chain and then there's an oracle that gives them give them like gives token back to gives tokens back to them based on kind of how uh how how how they've transacted and so on and how much time they played it as a player and implementation so how much you played Minecraft and so on you would not believe well maybe you could but people were spending a lot of effort and a lot of time every single day just just trying to break the Oracle and then if they do you know they'd start by salami slicing a little bit and then afterwards they like come through and then now they're exploiting like 50 ethereum like at a time that was happening a lot well we were catching most of it but it's like you know even one time it's it's a lot uh and so you know when you have an oracle for for an off-chain compute no I I think we can talk we could talk about ZK um Roll-Ups which is probably a little bit different but I'm not um enough of an expert on that as of yet so um but either way like when we were doing an oracle there um is is extremely insecure and people were trying to break it all the time and it's just like well if you can try to duplicate a Minecraft diamond like twice you could just try to sell it like so you know if a diamond is like 10 cents now you'll just try to like exploit that uh to get like 500 000 diamonds and yeah so that would be the main reason why I would think most stuff happened to be on chain but obviously there's some breakthroughs here that are making it to that Security will be less of an issue there yeah I I just think of it as like a design space I think some people will do like web 2.5 where it's only nfts on chain and some people will do everything on chain and they'll have different benefits and trade-offs um some will be more massive peel the lesson chain probably the more Mass Appeal at least in the short term um but maybe more value you have in more Vibrant Community you have if more things are Unchained so I think it's just a question of the person who's building the game and the design trade-offs absolutely um so yeah now I'm digging kind of like the future of launching games or games in general do you all feel like the web can become a solid platform for games again I know primordium is built on web for now and I think kind of for context for the for the audience like parallel trading card game like they have a downloadable like on Windows oh baby which is a upcoming games has like a desktop client launcher and alluvium also has a downloadable like what are y'all's thoughts so this this may be maybe a bit of a naivete from my end but I think most people have metamasks only in their browser and don't want to bother figuring out like if they download a thing like just how do they connect a web3 wallet to it then maybe you'd have like I don't know email sign up that so on and so forth um for one uh I personally actually like web games a lot but I know I'm definitely in the minority for two these are just client like to pull to put the game on on the web like these are just clients um you can you can build it in unity and then it'd be cross-platform like instantly so well maybe not instantly but either way uh the point is like I think the web is like web is a client is good just because that's where most people do their crypto stuff and so if they have their metamask wallet there it's just it's just the easiest way of doing it in my view and uh yeah if if there is a need to have it be cross-platform then there are pretty easy ways to like port a game from the browser to to an app and so on yeah I think there's been a lot of development on the browser side from a technical perspective that now enables you to have sort of near native performance in terms of games or 3D graphics on a web browser uh like Chrome and so it's it's no it used to be a technical question I think in terms of can you build performance games on browser and the answer was usually no at least on the higher end um I think that's changing quite quickly and so maybe we'll see a Renaissance of a browser I'm a little bit skeptical but I think it's it's definitely a possibility yeah there's also phaser that's that's quite good for uh for browser-based games it improved our game performance by a lot awesome well I think that kind of wraps up the Builder side of things I think we're going to dive into the more investor focused um we'll start off with a heater um within the on-chain game Space it says uh we wrote like most people and teams working on on-chain games right now have never had much or any experience in making games are investors supposed to assume they can just learn about game making through trial and error oh I mean I I I I I can comment a thing or two but I'm not an investor so I'll take it then um yeah I I I think um I differ from most investors in the in the sense that I'm actually quite uninterested in backing insiders um I think if you have game development experience it might be even a negative you have too many biases just like you wouldn't want an Activision Blizzard developer building a mobile game they just wouldn't get it you want some some dude in Finland to build the game uh who had never built games before you need an entirely new kind of open design space to think about on Gene games I think it's been true for most of the history of technology that you want Outsiders for almost anything big I think it's definitely been true in in media and games it's always net new players non-existing players and so um I think it'll tend to be true for launching games where the majority of the really big companies will come from from Outsiders it'll it'll come from probably College dropouts or something like that Tim Sweeney you know built built uh you know a lot of the the architecture for 3D graphics and and now obviously fortnite um and and it's true for mobile games and it's been true for almost every big shift in games so like I'm I'm sort of not uninterested in investing in Insiders yeah my view is the main main thing about younger Founders uh based on all the folks that I know around me um is that by definition if you have two college kids working in the dorm room um by definition it's it's not a defensible product but it is uh especially when they have a new insight that people who didn't live with the technology or so on like just don't understand it nearly as much and so uh when you have when you have a new design space like what David said here I think that's where people that don't otherwise have existing exposure or existing biases would probably shine better than uh than people that have been just been in the space been trying it out much more yeah and you see it in the decisions they make right I think if you look at the web 2.5 space where it's heavily traditional games with nfts added to it with little Innovation it's mostly existing developers that have built games at previous companies if you look at people building on-chain games like primordium or Argus it's it's net new Founders that have never built games before and are learning um I'd say it's really hard to build games obviously they're the most complex form of media but um it's happened many times before most of the big games that you play were built by modders or by Outsiders and so um yeah I'm sort of not concerned awesome yeah thanks for those answers um here's a kind of a point on investing I think what's the point in investing in infrastructure that powers games or the games themselves ninety percent of the of the value of the market accrues to content always or IP however you want to describe it um but we're at an interesting phase in the market where there's no essentially core infrastructure scalability and so um the question is do you focus on content do you focus on infrastructure I think that that's actually a psyop I think the right answer is actually both you want to build both core infrastructure while you build content it's the hardest fattest startup you can build but it's actually probably the right startup the most important companies in Media or games tend to build both if you look at sort of epic games they build 3D architecture they build Unreal Engine and then they're also built you know Unreal Tournament and they also built obviously fortnite and so um you look at that same in kind of niant tech building AR games they build core AR infrastructure and they obviously build Pokemon go um and so I think it's going to continue to rhyme true that the best companies are full stock they build core infrastructure world engines or whatever and then they also build content on top of it and the content doc Foods the infrastructure and so it's actually a very important two-way parallel Street where you have a deep understanding of what's enabled by the technology and then you're also building and iterating it through content so you want to own the most valuable part of the stack which is content but you also want to have a deep understanding of our underlying infrastructure which can be a massive amount or loss leader yeah I don't I don't have too much comments here because I'm not again I'm not investing but uh we as a we as a company uh we are dedicating resources to uh to contributing to open source infra essay well also you're kind of supposed to do that as yeah awesome yeah that's awesome um I think that I do think that kind of Open Source ecosystem is really really powerful and really uh net beneficial for everyone and so here's a question for both of y'all I think this is a little uh pretty pretty broad question I said is on chain gaming a different platform such as mobile or VR Gaming or is it a different means of development composability Etc um yeah I I think um I think that the interesting question is um is is on chain gaming mostly a monetization Innovation or is it a platform Innovation or distribution Innovation right I think we look at uh I think a good way to think about it is like mobile mobile was a platform Innovation new ways of Distributing to a billion plus users but it was also a monetization innovation in the sense that the apps are created free to play gaming at scale which wasn't really a thing before um and so I I think crypto will end up being both where you you obviously have a monetization Innovation using using on-chain payments um but you also maybe have a platform Innovation um and so it'll be interesting I think the monetization Innovation is a very obvious pathway that a lot of people are taking both in web 2.5 and on-chain games I think um it's more unclear like the more pure on-chain games like what the value ad is there we're we're also seeing um building an on-chain game is also a back-end Innovation uh just architecture-wise and so yeah that's that's the way that we're looking at it awesome um so I think we can probably start wrapping up I think the final question that I have is really kind of for both of y'all I was thinking how can we better align as an on-chain game Community to innovate and Advance more effectively but from the investors and Builders perspective uh what do you mean by alignment and this just like like moving like net benefit moving forward open sourcing things that we can do um ways that we can contribute so so far I think uh the the community's been been pretty uh nice to everybody uh and so I I'm I'm not quite sure if there's a an issue with alignment for the time being like all the investors are very happily trying out everything um and also giving feedback uh the open source contributors are obviously looking for everybody to develop on their thing and also um trying to get more people on board and so there's hackathons there's there's Community meetups there's so on and I think I think all of that is uh is coming together quite quite nicely for the time being yeah I'm actually leaving Paris I'm quite optimistic about Beyond chain games Community I think if you contrast it with like the web 2.5 space it's very like rugs are probably the right word to use like it's it's very like nft Drop heavy uh feel like I'm getting scammed out of anything and no value being added um and then you look at the on-chain game Space I was at Hacker House on Wednesday and I'd say four or five of the top builders in on-chain gaming we're all together in the same room collab collaborating even though they're all making decisions different decisions around architecture and design and all this stuff they're all collaborating all open source um all trying to push forward um what we can do technically on the on-chain game Space and so it makes me very very optimistic about where we're headed awesome well thank you all so much this is a great conversation and uh yeah we should be good thanks for coming thank you David and David
