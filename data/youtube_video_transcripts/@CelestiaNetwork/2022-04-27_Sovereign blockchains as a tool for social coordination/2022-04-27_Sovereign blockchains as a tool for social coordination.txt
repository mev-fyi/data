[Music] yeah so the way i see it and this is kind of echoing something like ethan uh bachmann said which is that you know the the invention of personal computing allowed individuals to be sovereign sorry individuals to be sovereign um but the the invention of you know blockchains allowed communities to be sovereign um in the sense that for the first time you can actually have like a shared community space where you can have you know a group of shared people can kind of can get together and organize and like independently of the status quo in a sense that you can have a you know a community you know with an it that with with self-agreed rules that are completely voluntary that are enforced without you know requiring a third party like a court system or the police to enforce those rules and you know this this only works in a limited kind of setting specifically with resource allocation in the financial setting but i think that's that's very powerful um and in particular because it allows um kind of like it's very you know internet native in the sense that it allows anyone with an internet connection to join a movement or community and decide how resources within that community is allocated and but at the moment that's just currently done using dallas and smart contract and but i think it would be very powerful if you could actually create your own chain like community could create its own chain that is not that does not necessarily derive its authority from some higher chain and like in the sense like if you deploy a city of dao or roll up um that your chain is bound by the social consensus of the ethereum community uh yeah but maybe not necessarily like maybe you want to diverge from ethereum community you don't necessarily agree you know on on the politics of the same community and it's like you don't really have many options to have your own effectively state machine with rules um unless you just create your own chain with a weak valid data set which isn't great uh but celestia actually allows you to create what's called sovereign roll-ups um so you can create a roll-up that does not settle to any other chain like it does not like for example like ethereum roll-ups are effectively baby chains ethereum and like they kind of like they derive the authority from the ethereum mainstream uh but like similarly like you have a github fork that's connected to like the master you know you know master gate reaper like but what if you actually disconnect that link once it connects you know like you can get like in github you can like disconnect that from the network um and so that's like with a sovereign roll up you can actually have like a roll up that does not necessarily post or like have like have an enshrined bridge to some other master chain but you can have a completely independent chain and spend it roll up um and you can hard fork that roll up at your own will but the community could hardly it's all it's roll up you know it's in its own if it decides to without having to ask for permission from the chain as in trying to bridge bridgewood
