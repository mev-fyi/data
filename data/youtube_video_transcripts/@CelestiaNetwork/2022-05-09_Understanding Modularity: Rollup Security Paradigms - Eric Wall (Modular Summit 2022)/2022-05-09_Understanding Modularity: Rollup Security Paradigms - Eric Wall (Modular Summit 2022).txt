thank you nick thank you so much hello everyone um my name is eric erica combination of those i'm a swedish crypto fund manager slash blogger slash vc uh but i'm also uh recovering bitcoin maximalist and i've been recovering for about three years now and i to i want to tell a story like um i think this is a story of why i'm here on and on on this stage and the story of how um i grew out of bitcoin maximalism and why i think this is one of the most important things that is happening in the blockchain space right now and why i couldn't think of any more crucial place to be so i want to congratulate all of you guys that are here and i want to share my story with you with how i came to that conclusion so like nick said i used to be called the old coin slayer in this picture you see some of the coins that i supposedly killed they're still out there i mean it's really hard to kill coins but um supposedly i i killed iota neo header hashgraph um and in this journey of killing altcoins i always had this belief in from the beginning that bitcoin was going to be the currency that was going to the network that was going to power everything else in the blockchain ecosystem and the rationale for that is that if you go back we're gonna go way back in town now we're gonna we're gonna go all the way back to 2014 when the company block stream was found so if you read the vision statement of why block stream was created it is actually kind of beautiful it's a beautiful story so it reads that the altcoin the altcoin approach of creating a new cryptocurrency just to introduce new features creates uncertainty for everyone looking at cryptocurrencies from the outside there seems to be no natural stopping point each fork can be forked again at infinitum this creates both market and development fragmentation we think that for cryptocurrencies to be successful as a whole we must build network effect not fragmentation we believe everyone should enjoy enjoy freedom to innovate too without seeking permission from us or anyone we needed a different way to get there than by attempting to to disrupt our own success it's kind of beautiful to accomplish this we propose technology to enable new cryptocurrency networks that do not need new cryptocurrencies delivering on this vision will require continued investment and in cooperation with the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole along with the full-time support of many people with broad and specialized backgrounds we felt that in the bitcoin ecosystem and in the world at large there's there is a shortage of companies working on trustless cryptographic infrastructure that's why we along with our other co-founders who share our vision came together to establish blockstream so this this was the picture that they shared like their vision for how the blockchain ecosystem would grow and i like this picture so much this used to be the banner picture of my linkedin profile this was i was so um hyped up about that vision uh for for for blockchains and for side chains to to interact with each other and these sidechains are they're not your they weren't originally proposed as you know what we see today where there's uh proof of authority chain with a bunch of validators like these were supposed to be merge mind side chains reusing the proof of work strength of bitcoin to secure the transaction order so and you have the developers here speaking like yeah merge mining is an option uh you could also have proof of stake and proof of authority but merge mind side chains that you reuse the hashing power of bitcoin to secure these side chains were a crucial element for this vision and you couldn't even go back and you see greg maxwell are talking about using snarks to interpret the programs running outside inside of side chains which is basically what what we have today with with zk roll ups so this was already envisioned back in 2014 by the blocks and block stream developers what was the purpose of of being able to run a snark to interpret other programs like what was the vision well it was division the vision already then to build things like dexas to build trustless peer-to-peer marketplaces options contracts all those things that we see blossoming in d5 were already the vision back then and in 2015 they said you know we're in the coming weeks we're gonna publish a proposal for a fully decentralized two-way peg the peg is how you transfer an asset from the main chain into the side chain and back that would be completely decentralized and the sidechain itself would be merge mined but it never materialized but in 2018 i still believe that this was the vision for bitcoin that we would see this ecosystem of side chains emerging around bitcoin that would be trustless merge mind so i would go around writing these twitter threads saying like the mo in architecture it is a no-brainer that every structure of importance that we build whether it be religious monuments skyscrapers pyramids with the establishment of a rock solid foundation to persist through the tests of time and with the billionaires to come so i was really in this vision that bitcoin asked the strongest most solid consensus engine would power everything else and around that point in time we were thinking in terms of drive chains drive chains were the latest iteration of how to build these hashrate-backed sidechains to bitcoin um and this is a pretty funny quote here um so i believe that the only way to compete with bitcoin is by figuring out how to make a more decentralized robust consensus engine and the problem that i had with all coins what was that all of them were competing in bitcoin in the exact opposite way so they were trading away their core robustness and simplicity for smarter contracts and this is before i understood the concept of modularity because if you think about celestia celestia really is an even more simple base layer than bitcoin is bitcoin bundles settlement execution data availability together in one monolithic piece celestia is that piece that abstracts the uh set the the data availability and the consensus away and focuses on just that most simple piece but this was before such constructions existed so anyway i was really hyped up about drive chains i wanted to drop everything that i was doing at the time to build a drive chain and even the bitcoin core developers saw a lot of them were on board with this vision they wanted to also see drive chains come into fruition they thought it was a good idea but something happened this is just one year later just one year later something changed and i think it was the block size wars that got so intense uh and what a lot of bitcoiners realized is that the miners are not our friends the miners uh had previously been involved in every upgrade in bitcoin using their hash rate their sig they signaled their support for upgrades and the miners were working together with the community but during the block size wars we kind of realized that miners weren't our friends and we wouldn't want to give because in a merged mind side chain the problem is that the miners can always steal the coins from the side chain because everything is relying on the hash rate um so something changed in the in the uh in the sort of conversation around drive chains we wouldn't we didn't want to give more control to the miners and one thing that happens when you have a merge mine side chain is that um if you are not validating these merge mine side chains you're not uh you're not mining those side chains you don't get the fees from those side chains so if they have a lot of mev only the miners that have very high capacity bandwidth are able to extract those revenues so something changed and and even even peter todd is also one of the core contributors the bitcoin said that merged mind side chains were gregory maxwell's biggest biggest mistake so 2019 kind of realized that it wasn't going to happen with bitcoin bitcoin was not going to become this piece that powers all of block of the blockchain ecosystem and then rollups entered the scene and the the the powerful thing with roll ups the the really intelligent part is that the roll-up uh the miners who and the validators that process the base layer they don't need to to validate the roll-up they don't need to val they don't need to process the transactions they can only look at the fraud proofs and the validity proofs to make sure that those systems are safe so this in if you are a bitcoiner and you're thinking that the only only problem that we have with drive chains is that the they cause centralization around mining rollups are that exact mechanism that you need to get away from that problem so i sort of wanted to bring this to the bitcoin community and say hey look at the ethereum researchers look at what they have come up with that actually solves that core piece that we've been looking for all along this is should be a very interesting interesting architectural design for how to build blockchains that can scale that can have different execution environments that does not call uh calls centralization for the validator set so i try to convince other bitcoiners like look at this look at look at the architecture of this thing just look at the construction if we can just learn from this mechanism we can integrate something similar into bitcoin and then we would be able to realize that vision that was the what the uh block stream company was built on that core vision was now within reach it didn't go that way so i tried to bring it to the uh to the bitcoin community and i asked like i'm i'm reading this stuff on on the ethereum research page i'm reading on vitalik's blog post i'm finding new uh ways that we could reach that goal and what does that make me and i got told that it makes me potentially dangerous um and a lot of this is this is also a block stream employee um so i i basically fell out of favor with the bitcoin community just for having the idea that maybe there's something interesting going on in the ethereum community that we should learn from so people were starting to make bets around how long i would last in the bitcoin community and this vision that was originally proposed about how bitcoin would power these side chains all of what it all came down to at the end was just this the only side chain that block stream ever created was a single proof of authority chain that had no crypto economic guarantees that was the culmination of half a decade of research that blockstream was supposed to deliver to bitcoiners so eric the altcoin slayer turned into eric the potentially dangerous coiner and i was feeling miserable at this time i i started to write my own eulogy i was it was kind of a sad time where i didn't know what what to do because you know i had been building up my reputation and my community my friends within the bitcoin community for for seven for seven years um and and this is what it all came to but i found new life in the roll-up design space there's so many things that you can do with roll-ups you can experiment with completely new vms you can experiment with the sequencing logic the fee logic the mev you can you can make combinations of zk roll-ups and optimistic roll-ups it opens a whole new paradigm for innovation experimentation one of my favorite roll-up constructions uh is the zkopro construction which allows you to make z cash style private payments inside of an optimistic roll-up so you can get almost perfect privacy within an optimistic roll-up just by leveraging the fraud proof system on the base layer of ethereum another thing that i think is usually interesting is the the idea that if you have a roll-up and you have perhaps a more centralized sequencing mechanism that creates an opportunity for mev to be generated in a more centralized way and you can do things with that mav for example one of the one of the biggest problems that we've had in bitcoin is that how do we fund developers to keep contributing infrastructure to bitcoin how do we fund developers how do we fund public goods so this idea by optimism that we could use the mev in a chain that the sequence service extracts to fund public goods is an incredibly interesting idea and following along that path if you have the ability to create an entirely new vm just by because if you if you're running a rollup uh by using the fraudproof mechanism you don't actually need to be able to interpret all the internal logic within the roll-up itself all you need to be able to do is validate a fraud proof or validate a validity a validity proof those things allows you to create entirely new vms so inside of fuel which is one of my favorite roll-ups you can you can you can you can run smart contracts using a utxo data model and that allows for parallelized parallelizability so you can parallelize transactions and get basically slanotype efficiency inside the roll-up so that's a whole new paradigm of of an execution environment that is enabled through the separation between the main chain and roll-ups using fraud proofs or validity proofs so i want to talk a little bit about what does this mean for security so there is a difference between roll ups and side chains even the merge bind side chains that we had roll ups are superior because like i said the role in the roll up paradigm what you can do is you don't need hash rate to secure a side chain because the fraud proofs that get posted to the mainnet and the validity proofs that's the only thing that you actually need to validate for the validators or the miners to do their job so roll ups present a way more attractive security model inherently than side chains were ever ever able to produce but they still come with some drawbacks there are some people who say well you know roll ups they're layer two and the layer two in her inherits the security of the layer one that is you know roughly accurate it's not 100 accurate because there are of course some things that there are some there's some level of complexity that comes with a rollup uh that creates security risk so it's not it's not like one-to-one perfect uh equivalency between the security of the of the layer one and the layer two there are some differences there and i think that you know it's good to perhaps get a grip of what those differences are so i mean the most obvious one is that of course you're going to run into some implementation risk the roll-up the roll-up has a roll-up note that roll-up note has its own software there can be bugs in that software it's just no way to get around that if the roll-up isn't implemented properly even the on the contracts under layer 1 a bug can arise like if you look at the most of the hacks that have happened to side chains only a few of them actually happen because someone compromised the keys in many cases there are simple implementation bugs that can cause complete failures for the roll-up system uh for for for a sidechain system for any type of system so every time that you use an external software component that can have an implementation bug and and you can you can lose your money by us by using a rule up this way there's no way to get around that the nice thing is that we can theoretically move away further and further away from that risk by improving our systems with a sidechain for example you can never get away at the inherent risk that either the miner steals the coins or in a proof of authority side chain you can never get away the risk that the well that the validators steal the coins in the side chain but you can get away from that risk if you design a roll up really really well you also have a sequencer risk in roll up so roll up doesn't use the same validators they don't use the same block producers as the as the layer one does they have their own set of sequencers that produce the roll-up blocks and there are some some risk that like the the most common risk that you speak about is well what if the sequencers start to censor transactions on the roll-up now for optimistic roll-ups like arbitrarium and and optimism there's a way around that there's you can post transactions directly to the layer one track to delay one contract on the on the base layer and that makes the roll-up process those transactions so you can get away that centers that's censorship it's not as easy on on start net for example i haven't seen a design that allows transactions to be posted on the layer 1 that will automatically be included into the start net roll up you also have mev risk i actually prefer to think of the the mev difference here as an advantage like i showed with optimism that you can actually use the fact that you have a different set of sequencers that can be permissioned or have priority and they can generate mav and you can you can they can decide that this mav is going to go to benefit the overall system uh but there there are still differences in how mav works inside of a roll-up compared to the to the uh layer one chain so that's also a risk that you to think about another thing that i think that people don't talk that frequently about is something that i call state access risk so a lot of people believe that well in a roll up all the transactions data are posted to the layer 1 and because you have all you have full data availability provided by the layer 1 system that means that you're never going to have a problem to access the state and you need to be able to access the state if you want to be able to withdraw your funds from a rollup you need to have access to not only the raw data itself you need access to the full state and the risk here is that okay well what if there aren't any nodes who are providing me with this state uh the risk then is that you and if you haven't produced that state for yourself if you're not running a roll upload node which in a rollup the their execution environments are designed to be more performant so it's going to be more resource intense to run your own roll up node versus running a layer one node so if you're not doing that which most people won't do and for some reason there is no other node that is providing you with what the state looks like then you can run into a situation where you actually have to generate that state yourself and if the state takes a very long time to uh to to be computed then let's say for example you're getting liquidated in another roll rollup and now you got to withdraw your funds from that roll up into the other roll up and that takes time now you got to regenerate the state the time that it takes to to generate the state is a risk it can cause you to get liquidated it can cause you not to access your funds in time maybe those funds lose value like maybe there's something happening in the cryptocurrency space and your your assets are losing value you need to be able to get those house and sell those if that takes time well then then that's that's a risk i'm coloring these in yellow because these are not like catastrophic risks they're more like medium mediocre risks and then you only in in most of these rollups the reason that these two are white is because these problems are not inherent to roll-ups themselves but it's something that we're likely to see with most roll-ups so most roll-ups in the beginning are going to have admin keys the ability to make emergency upgrades that of course is a risk the idea is that we will move away from those uh training wheels with time and we won't really have these admin keys that can change the entire roll-up system once these systems are mature but they're probably going to be with us for a couple of years these types of admin case and a lot of these rollups are also planning to add governance tokens and governance tokens also provide a an attack vector like if the governance tokens has the ability to vote on something crucial for the system then uh if someone is able to acquire a large amount of those governance tokens well they get control over part of the roll-up so that's also a risk the most secure roll-up would probably be a roll-up that doesn't use like if we had no implementation bugs then the most secure role would probably be a type of rollup that has had as little as possible of these types of admin case or governance tokens or at least limit their ability to do anything material to the system at all so those are some inescapable things that you sort of get with rollups that make the security different from the layer one the layer one itself so then there are also differences between zk roll-ups and optimistic roll-ups i'm not going to go too to get too bogged down into this but it's good to have at least the the basics of it i think that most people in this audience probably do know the the basic security assumptions that trade-offs that you make between a zika roll-up and an optimistic roll-up the zk roll-up of course uses starks or snarks those have a significantly higher complexity and a lot fewer people that actually understand those systems in detail to be able to audit them to a level where we have an assurance that the system is going to work as intended so they are more complex the the probability that they have implementations bugs are significantly higher even though in a system like arbitrary for example the arbitrary virtual machine is also quite complex there's also an added risk of complexity there but i don't think it's fair to say that these risks are comparable i think it's probably fair to say that the zk roll ups do add a more material layer of risk but in the optimistic rollup you have the assumption that someone is watching the chain that someone if the if the sequencers post an invalid merkle root than a merkle root commitment then someone needs to be able to to produce a fraud proof and invalidate that update so roll up has this other uh trust assumption that you need to trust that someone is watching the chain either that has to be you or that has to be someone else and zk roll-ups don't really have that this assumption and then if you are using another system or another component to provide data availability then you're always exposed to the underlying risk of that system we used to say that uh validiums for instance uh avalidium is a zika robot that does not actually post the data on the layer one um it uses another another entity or a federation of entities to guarantee that that data is there we used to say that uh that these validiums had a lower risk profile because the only thing that they could do is freeze the funds they could freeze the system but they couldn't uh steal the funds but we've sort of come to the conclusion that you know uh if you're able to freeze the if you're able to freeze a rollup it's very easy to turn this into a random situation where you're ransoming the funds and uh and even if you have emergency keys which allows you to roll back the state of the of the validation that opens up another attack vector which allows the attacker to double spend their funds because when you roll back the attack then no one can then the attacker can just do that attack again so you create a double spend risk um so no matter how you want to wrap the burrito if you're using other data availability systems you're always going to run into this issue that you sort of have to trust that those components are functioning correctly so i also have this picture i saw that mustafa had this one earlier i want to make a joke about this this is the modular conference so we're outsourcing other people's uh diagram skills to the ones that are most suitable to create those so that's my excuse for for using other people's diagrams in this in this talk um so we sort of we sort of covered covered everything except these two so far we're talking very very broad stokes but i don't think that you're going to be able to to learn everything about every single trust assumption between different roll-ups in in a 30-minute talk but let's talk about the broad strokes here so if you're running a roll-up on celestia there is a difference between sovereign roll-ups and settlement roll-ups so the sovereign roll-up has its own settlement and execution environment so that allows for a lot of flexibility because you can hard fork or soft fork the roll-up itself and change the rules of that roll-up without having to depend on any other community celestia is not going to stop you for changing the execution environment of your roll up so if you want to change something of index inside the execution environment you can in a sovereign roll-up that gives you flexibility that that's that's why they're called sovereign roll-ups uh but that does mean that uh the roll-up can change if as long as the roll-up community decides that the roll-up should change and that means that you know if it's a small community if it's a small roll-up and they are malicious they could hard fork and perhaps you know steal your funds from that from that roll-up so you you have this different risk profile in a sovereign roll-up versus a settlement roll-up the the benefit of a settlement roll-up is where you share an execution environment where many different types of roll-ups can settle their fraud proofs and validity proofs and if they are all batched together in one layer then one roll up can't go rogue and hard fork their system because that makes them incompatible with all those other roll-ups that they have enjoyed the ability to to to interact with so if you're bridging if you're using a settlement roll up for the the uh compatibility with other roll-ups now you if you can't hard fork one of those so it sort of ties all of those roll-ups into that specific settlement layer so using a settlement roll up with many rollups sort of batches their security together um in a different way um last thing i wanted to steal another diagram here from from maven rain and coffee made this excellent chart i think that shows a little bit easier how these different roll-ups interact with the celestia system so on celestia you can have these you can have a sovereign optimistic roll-up you can have a sovereign zk roll up and then you can have these restrict restricted settlement layers for roll-ups uh like sevmos but you can also have other other other settlement roll-ups like that on on which you can build other rollups um that sort of gives you a better picture of what the ecosystem looks like i think and uh if you want to get really bogged down into the very nitty-gritty differences between an optimistic roll up and a valet validium or a zk roll up i think that matter labs did a quite good deep dive into the nitty-gritty differences in terms of security but also performance usability and other aspects that you can look at so i would recommend to read from this website it's not 100 perfect you got to realize that matter labs they have a zk roll up themselves so they might be a little bit more biased towards zk roll ups with that that was the nmr presentation thank you very much great to see you guys so many of you here
