hello uh I in fact will not be talking about Mexican yeah we're talking about some other stuff but it'll show off a little bit and at the end I think I've just been sending mesh security as the title for all the talks that I haven't come up with a talk for yet and you know they just they're like oh yeah that sounds good um no but I'm going to be today thank you guys for coming uh my name is sunny I work on I'm one of the co-founders of a project called osmosis and uh we're gonna be talking a little bit about how osmosis will be interacting with the uh modular ecosystem uh so a little bit of background for anyone who's not familiar with what osmosis is oh yeah that's better uh anyone who's not familiar with what osmosis is um we are a DEX uh built on the cosmos SDK we have all sorts of you know we just launched we just launched uh you know we have liquidity swapping ability we launched a contrary to liquidity very recently uh you can do all sorts of um have assets from over 50 different blockchains uh on the on the osmosis blockchain we have over 100 million dollars in liquidity um we have all sorts of like Pro trading tools like uh basically the most advanced developed decks in the cosmos ecosystem and uh yeah you know liquidity from all different places both from within Cosmos and outside of Cosmos out of all of the assets you know like four out of five or biggest pools are from non-cosmos native chains right um and along with just the decks itself we have this ecosystem of applications uh really meant to build this like full unified defy experience on top so you know beyond just your basic spot trading you have your margin trading you have your perps you have your launch pads you have your Fiat on-ramps you have lending protocols so basically a full integrated D5 experience everything you know the goal here is you go to binance.com you have all these trading tools you have all this like things in one unified experience osmosis is going to provide that in a decentralized way so um and you know as by being this like liquidity center for the cosmos ecosystem we are are sort of the center of IBC traffic today so if you look at you know on any metric by users or by IBC traffic uh by volume uh osmosis is sort of the center of that and has found itself uh as this like IBC Hub and liquidity Hub of the cosmos ecosystem and so now uh very soon hopefully uh we will have a new entrant to the cosmos ecosystem right the Celestia blockchain will be launching and as part of the Celestia blockchain launch you know the goal of the Celestia blockchain uh node in node implementation is to be as simple as possible Right like you know obviously we need this thing to you know no sorry uh you know with Celestia we're going to have like this beginning of all sorts of like new modular chains and Roll-Ups building on top of the cosmos ecosystem and you know there seems to be this like thing about like oh app chains versus modular and like I think this is like some weird dichotomy because really the whole point of app chains is this idea of modularity right it's saying like hey we don't need to put everything into one blockchain we can you know break out what you need you know osmosis we're trying to be a DEX we can like say like hey we don't want to deal with bridging we are going to completely Outsource that we are that's not our not our problem we're gonna go find someone else to work with we're gonna go work with the axillar team or the Wormhole team right we're going to go Outsource bridging completely this is part of the modular idea right or you know if it comes to things like data availability or like you know if we need a base money it's like okay we're not building that we're going to Outsource this this is all you know it's all modular so um so what I was saying was yeah so you know the goal of the celestial blockchain is to act as this app chain and to be as simple as possible because obviously you know we gotta run it on our Kindles and we're going to keep the keep the nodes as as light as possible and because of that the Celestia code base is actually like very very minimalistic you'll see that it actually Imports very few modules you know Ishmael just talked about how like you know what how can we avoid adding a general purpose VM or anything to this chain um so the one module that it does have though one of the few one of the few modules that it does have obviously is the IBC module which is great right and so this is this decentralized uh you know this permissionless bridging protocol that allows you to send tokens data assets anything between any IBC enabled blockchain and so IBC is uh growing it is uh you know built on the causeless SDK there's other chains as well now now we finally have it on polka dot we have it on uh the penumbra and a Noma stack so you know IBC is uh slowly growing but with Celestia now and this ecosystem modular ecosystem that's being built on top we have a whole bunch of new Frameworks being built right you have like uh the op stack now right you have roll kit you have the Sovereign SDK you have eclipse and it's like it is going to take us time to go and build out IBC for every single one of these because the goal of IBC is to really like build in uh your bridging protocol at the same security level as your consensus system it uses like client proofs and it will take time for us to get there obviously you know the goal is we want IBC everywhere but and there are people working on this right like polymer is working on adding IBC like uh like ZK IBC to uh all of these sort of different Stacks but it'll take us some time to get there and so right now uh how do we how do we do this we're going to have to rely on other Bridges right and so this is kind of where so the question is how will all these Roll-Ups uh and you know chains and Sovereign Roll-Ups and everything on all these different Stacks access liquidity especially TL liquidity right because they need that Tia to pay for their data availability how are they going to get that Tia to to there well this is where osmosis comes in so osmosis is you know really expanding on its bridging support so obviously we support IDC today we work very closely with the axelar team uh Wormhole just announced yesterday at osmocon that they're launching worm chain which is going to be a cosmos SDK based chain and then the important one here is hyperlane right so hyperlane seems uh poised to be the you know Bridging the first Bridge that's available to a lot of these different Stacks because of the way that it's been designed as this you know very op modular bridging system where you can have you can choose what kind of security system you want and so we are working on adding hyperlane to the osmosis uh chain uh and be and you know because of its app defined security model we can write it as a cosmosum contract and with this we're going to be able to use osmosis as the connector between hyperlane and and IBC so now you have this flow where finally you can say Hey how do you get uh Tia from Celestia onto something like eclipse or onto an eclipse based roll-up well you can IBC from Celestia to osmosis and then hyperlane from osmosis to eclipse and and you know this will be and the idea here is that we're going to use hyperlane to connect to all of these sort of different uh Roll-Ups and get Tia onto them now well what do you do when you're at the center point of uh you know Transportation routes right well you build a trading center right you build you build Constantinople right you're you're at the crossroads you build you build a training center there that's what that's what we're building with osmosis so we want to be the place where we build up as much Tia liquidity and liquidity for the entire modular ecosystem and provide these uh services and like product that we've been building for the cosmos ecosystem but expand uh just beyond that um and so one of the things that I'm really interested in is like protocol owned Tia because you know if anyone remembers a couple of months ago like the arbitrum chain basically came to a halt because like some Dev account didn't have enough eth in it to pay it's like data availability and stuff right so we should be moving to a world where no you shouldn't be relying on some like Foundation or some Dev team to be like paying for your uh submission proofs to your da to Celestia right you should be actually moving towards a system of protocol owned TL and so you know there's a bunch of different ways that we can do this so one we have this protocol called stream swap which is basically a auction system built on top of the osmosis chain and I think a lot of the new uh projects that are launching should can to can do these stream swaps you know it gives you this initial distribution but you can do it for Tia so that way you have this initial distribution of your token but now your protocol owns Tia in its community pool or Treasury and it can pay for its own D.A without directly from it from it from itself um we also have built this thing for the causes ecosystem called V abstraction and what fee abstraction is is it's meant for transaction fees so what you can do is you can you can take a chain like stargaze right uh stargaze is an nft platform built on Cosmos people can start paying their transaction fees in stars but they can also pay their transaction fees in any token the campaign usdc they can pay in osmo they can pay in Bitcoin and what we've done with this fee abstraction module is the stargaze can accept these fees and all these different tokens but what the chain will do by itself is it will send all the tokens to osmosis swap them to its own native token and then send them back to the stargaze chain so that way they can be distributed SBS or burnt or whatever they want to do so this module is available it's you know available on our GitHub you can go to github.com osmosis lab slash fee abstraction you can import it into your Cosmos chain today and any Cosmos chain can start acceptance fees in any token okay what's the next step the next thing that we're going to build with this is Da fee abstraction how do you let all of these Roll-Ups pay you know let's say they don't want their own protocol owned Tia in their treasury but what you can instead do is say hey a chain like Manta can say oh we are going to hold our own native token Manta but we need to pay our D.A they can send it to a hyperlink into osmosis it will automatically swap it to Tia and send it to the Celestia chain in order to pay for the D.A and so uh we have we are working with some teams to actually build this out in production now um another way that uh you know beyond just for fee abstraction with you know this whole modular idea a lot of these chain you know we we work very closely with the Argus team you know we we can build this idea of outposts where they don't have to build their own Dex infrastructure for their own chain they can actually provide things like swaps and everything over IBC so let's see if this works this is a demo that we built of the uh Cosmo swap which is basically this is a swap on the Juno chain you're swapping Juno for sorry osmo adreno for osmo you make a single transaction on the Juno chain but what it's doing is it's actually sending the tokens to osmosis swapping them to uh the the osmo and then sending them back to the Juno chain so basically Juno doesn't need its own native decks all any that let's say you have a dow on Juno or whatever you're trying to do you can tap into osmosis is far deeper liquidity and so uh the evmos team has also built a similar version the same similar concept for the evm uh the skip team has you know you saw them present a couple like an hour ago about ibc.fun you can basically swap from any chain to any any chain on any token on any chain to any token on any other chain over IBC and we'll be working on like integrating hyperlane into the system as well um yeah all through osmosis um so these are some of the ways that osmosis is like you know planning on uh integrating more deeply into the whole modular ecosystem one of the other things I'm actually really interested in is you know I will bring obviously I do have to talk about mesh security and how we want to incorporate data availability into Mass security so uh you know the con the premise of Cosmos and I think a lot of the module the thesis and a lot of the modular ecosystem is this idea that every chain is the L1 for its own internal State and a L2 for its foreign state right this is sort of the whole idea behind these Sovereign Roll-Ups and so you know osmosis is the settlement for you know the osmo token but it acts like an execution environment for any axle that is bridged IBC to osmosis and so as part of IBC today you know we do these sort of like client proofs where like two chains are going along you send an IBC packet that includes some sort of like client proof but what we want to do is eventually make IBC uh you know the security model between these chains better than just like client proof we want to start to incorporate things like fraud proofs and finally now thanks to things like roll kit we actually have Optima fraud proofs for the cosmos SDK now the thing is fraud proofs uh have this huge uh time delay to them right you have to wait the entire challenge period and the ux that people have come to expect in Cosmos is like very fast bridging right you can IDC between two chains uh in a matter of seconds and that's sort of one of the things that people really love about it and so we don't want to build in this uh you know fraud proof window into the IBC bridging protocol because it'll just massively deteriorate the ux but how we can use fraud proofs is in mesh security so mesh security is this idea of restaking where you can say like hey validators are going to uh give certain guarantees about the uh you know they're going to be restaking their osmo to yeah okay so and as part of this what we've done is you know the the initial version of mesh security is mostly about tendermen frog proofs so it'll be able to detect hey okay this validator does something malicious and like the consensus protocol we're gonna slash them but the way mesh security is implemented is actually as it has this interface called a slasher contract and you can write arbitrary slasher contracts right you can do it for things like oh um we're gonna do uh mesh security restaking for an oracle protocol and if you're if one validate is Oracle price is too far away from everyone else that is a valid slashing condition what we can also do is build uh roll kit fraud proofs as a slashing condition right and so I think that eventually every Cosmos chain will start to use roll kick style fraud proofs right and so that's great but then how do you make sure that you have these fraud proofs the idea is that like okay we're not going to block IBC bridging on it but if a Byzantine State machine uh sends an invalid packet in the future they will be slashable for it but to make them slashable for it we need to make sure there's data availability so this is what we can block for we can at least block on data availability before accepting IBC package so let's say chain one or chain two wants to send to some assets to chain one what it can do is generate a transaction it will post the data onto something like Celestia or any da system and the validators of chain one will be running a data availability sampling like clients of Celestia so in the validator software we should be having this uh dos like like client built into the software and what they will do is when IBC data is sent from chain two to chain one the validators will basically use a vote extension to approve whether or not that they actually got the the they'll validate that the data is available so they're not going to actually validate the fraud proof itself they're just going to validate the data as available so that someone in the future can submit a fraud proof to the max security slasher contract if needed um anyway so thank you guys so much for listening and I hope you learned a little bit about osmosis and uh my security and what we're building thank you
