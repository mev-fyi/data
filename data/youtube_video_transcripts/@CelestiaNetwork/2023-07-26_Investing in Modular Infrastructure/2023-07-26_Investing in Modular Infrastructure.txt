hello hello I think this is on uh great to be here everyone appreciate everyone attending and uh a big shout out to Celestia and Maven 11 for putting this on had the privilege of attending uh last year as well and uh by far one of my favorite events I've had the the privilege of join in so I'm excited to lead this panel today about uh really some great perspectives uh about investing in the modular ecosystem so I want to throw it down the line but first my name is Joe I invest in the space and yeah happy to let these guys introduce themselves yeah I'm Mathias I'm one of the partners of Maven 11. um I think we were the first investor or Becker of Celestia and I hope therefore we help the modular movement uh move forward a little bit that works yeah I'm Yuri um I think together with Maven actually were the first investor like the first second I guess right after you guys um we're a little bit different I guess as obviously so maybe have a different perspective here because uh we look at the production space not specifically as blockchain but we have like a broad perspective on a better internet let's say so hope you get a different perspective here between the more uh crypto VCS that's great okay hey guys yeah Calvin here uh investment associate Spartan um I guess we're the third investors last year after you guys um so yeah we've been investing since uh 2017 um and looking into more uh larger space um starting in 2019 and uh yeah we've been fairly involved uh really pretty recently as well that's great guys um I think how I like setting this conversation last year when I had the privilege of moderating is uh kind of getting some context into your guys history in the space I know you shared a little bit about it but maybe quickly like what was maybe the first project you kind of recall uh giving you some some of the inklings of kind of where the modular narrative is today and like maybe what's one of the more recent ones as well yeah I think the first one Easy Shot there is Celestia but I think maybe the sort of plasma or even lighting Network on bitcoin You could argue that it moves execution of gen um currently the most recent one I won't skip I won't name any portfolio company but I think eclipse is doing pretty cool I think it's cool to see that they bring the Solana VM to like I don't know ecosystem which sort of shows the power of moving that execution of Jane totally agree Yuri yeah I'm I mean we went with uh Celestia as the first time we saw something really really different from after like Bitcoin and ethereum and it became clearer that there's something happening where you have to actually motorize or split certain functions and we're kind of moving slow in the direction so we're looking now at what's happening out there so with all the central sequencer with intent-based architectures with rollups obviously and then rollers with the services and just looking at from a tech perspective like okay when's the next time something something comes up that's so big that splits again in a way right uh where you need to really uh modularized in such a way that it scales up again what's maybe like a recent project you've heard of that kind of maybe fits into some of those narratives one that you're following I'll follow a couple of projects that I talked yesterday for Australia guys as well I'm kind of interested really in this centralized sequences not because they're right now interesting to us but I think they're going a big thing once robots become a little bit more thriving right once you have this happening around more there will actually be a thing where you say okay what is the next bottle next we have to let my break and that might be one of those things cool I'm excited to chat some more about that in a little bit and Calvin what about yourself yeah so let's stuff the uh uh one of the first projects I actually picked my interest in the module space as well um so yeah back in 2021 you're gonna start looking into it um uh it's interesting how such a minimalistic design chain could um align so well with the ethos of you know sensory resistant uh blockchain um so yeah so this is definitely one of the uh first um that that's a Pioneer in the space as well um for for a more recent project I've been um you know like you just mentioned you know with the proliferation of roll-up uh Roll-Ups in the space um I've been thinking more into the permissionless uh mess of you know moving liquidity across across these Roll-Ups right so um an example that uh project that we involved in is called catalyst so essentially you can it's a liquidity layer across all these roll-ups that allows use to you know transfer value natively um across these um yeah it'll definitely be an interesting challenge I think that we'll probably get into a little bit during this conversation as well when it comes to maybe some of the trade-offs and modularity as well um yeah I think I I would also just love to kind of understand like we kind of hinted at it a little bit there as far as some of the recent projects that you guys are are following but you know when we think back to you know maybe 12 or 14 months ago in Amsterdam um what are some of the things that are like top of Mind as far as like what has changed specifically in that period of time yeah I think back then it was sort of like okay da and Roll-Ups that's all there is to the modular ecosystem and since then a few big trends uh optimism arbitrum obviously taking off in a big way um also get interaction on the application Level which I think is very key and we'll talk about infrastructure here all day but it does actually matter that we have users using these things um I think that's sort of validation of the teachers that Roll-Ups will scale more um and then obviously on the more technical or experimental side you have things like modular Mev show crosstrain Mev intent based architectures Aditi just talked about that um and I think developments like Sovereign Labs is obviously working on are also like in that bucket of new experimental ideas that we love to see what about maybe Calvin will go to you and then to urine sorry could you repeat the question yeah maybe trends that you've seen over the last 12 to 14 months specifically that have like very much piqued your interest in the modular space absolutely so I think uh Ras sarova's service um so similar to one of the times just mentioned as well um we've seen a lot of these getting competitive in space um different different ways solving the same problems as well um I think um da is also something that's interesting um so a cyber Celestia we're seeing obviously other Data Solutions in the in the market uh whether it's uh fail or eigen da good and Yuri maybe anything out of that before we move on yeah I agree with you guys also Russ is kind of the easy way to think about once you think of that there might be many Roll-Ups right you need somebody to deploy them so there's a service that's kind of an easy idea let's say not easy to to actually realize but it's an easy idea to think about maybe they added that a little bit I'd love for you to maybe dig in on like if you have any opinions on maybe some of the economics that exist at that layer I know I've heard maybe a variety of perspectives on how sufficiently those businesses or protocols can kind of bootstrap the economic considerations around where they sit in the stack so free to anyone to answer but I'm just curious opinions on this one uh you want to go first or shall I shouldn't go ahead I I think one sort of thing we hear a lot now is abundant block space um so all these DEA solutions that we hear about are like oh there will be so much blog space that it won't really be valuable anymore whereas I think there is a big difference in the quality of block space whether that's liquidity on that verifiability of the block space which obviously light clients play a big role in um so that's something where the value accrue will definitely happen in my opinion on the most valuable blog space that the user can easily verify there's a lot of liquidity on it or MVP extractable on it which could be interchangeable and that you can easily deploy different Roll-Ups on and that's I think also interesting that on ethereum you yeah still often deploy evm rollups whereas on Celestia you'll probably see a proliferation of different virtual machines a little bit of a bias for other execution of course you're anything out of that yeah um I think the biggest gravity at the moment maybe it's the bear Market with liquidity it's fun to see if you even look at how to beat and you think a tlv for example of the Roll-Ups it's strange why for example Optimus doesn't have more of it and all of it especially after the breakdown last year moved again to mainnet maybe this is the quality right of the of the block space and you have more security or more battle testedness of the maintenance right you just trusted more I'm not sure but it seems to be like why isn't going more up right why isn't going more to the to the Roll-Ups to do something because Urban units of all of this is there right so the basic stuff basically we're using I think we discussed this one earlier or sometimes if I leave my assets somewhere for 10 years I'm not going to do it on the road up right now I will just use ethereum mainnet or Bitcoin exactly so so how do you how do you solve that and then I thought about a certain degree maybe you need some sort of well two are a company protocol that's only existing role like GMX for example an orbital Nava launch right and around that it's slowly go built around ecosystem and then only it becomes as trustable uh as not as real um as a minute yeah maybe it's a kind of like add to that and maybe pose another question to you guys I think it actually might be like one of the trade-offs that probably is under discussed in this space specifically which is uh you know to what degree with some of these like new implementations with these new configurations and blockchains can you know institutions or potentially like more advanced like larger liquidity holders actually underwrite the risk associated with these architectures so maybe we can pose that question to you guys like how do you as investors kind of like underwrite that process kind of the activation energy or like potentially some people would use the word lendiness that has to develop in order to accrue or attract that liquidity yeah I think for us as stranger Investments we can Venture investors we can underwrite that because we sort of do need to take a lot of risk to get the returns we aim for um but as like an Institutional I don't know debt fund allocating in D5 or something yeah I understand that they see more risk and like experimental projects that are now going live in the modular space Etc and they would maybe rather stick with a more mature defy uh stack on ethereum so I think there you just need to prove yourself over time um that you are there to stay and that they can allocate so it's about sort of the risk yeah appetite of the investor anything from you guys as far as like I don't know maybe how you as investors kind of at least attempt to underwrite uh some of the risks that like you know these more modular configurable systems or architectures can introduce yeah for sure um so when it comes to assessing different projects um I can actually use um perhaps like da layer um so there are several ways we can assess this right so um uh obviously you know the Asus function of um costs as well as transaction count so you can do certain um projections right um given how how much um I guess Revenue the The Da layer could actually make and then you you add on a premium to it and you can actually um you know have thinking like how how they could actually monetize on top of it right so you think of it for more of maybe an economic security perspective or kind of where you're going with that as far as sorry could you think of it more in relation to like the economic security perspective of like that sort of a thing would help an investor like maybe like a liquid fund better underwrite the risk of like a modular architecture yeah I think that certainly will help yeah all right um Matthias I think one thing we had chatted a lot about is kind of like some of the different like founder types that we see specifically in the modular space would love to maybe throw it to you guys as far as like are there things that stand out about like the types of individuals that you've you've had the privilege to to support and invest in that are building in this space Maybe unique characteristics maybe bad things who knows yeah I'm happy to take so much we've backed quite a few uh Founders in this domain I I think right now what you see is it's usually quite Tech heavy people and they like to be sort of nerd sniped uh so they like to think about ideas that are complex and that easily change as they move along so they also need to be flexible in the architecture um I think that's sort of the current founder type you see in the space I do expect that to sort of change over the next three to four years to also more consumer facing more commercial business-minded people who just want to build an end product for users what do you think that shift will be like a byproduct ever like what do you think will cause that like I think just maturity of the tech stack right so that they don't yeah I think to some degree so that they don't need to worry about like the trade-off of Mev prevention or an intent or not right I think somebody who just wants to build a good user app doesn't want to care about what sort of transaction type there is um maybe I I pivot this question to you guys as well when it comes to you know I think everyone kind of agrees on this kind of like this kind of opinion in the Zeitgeist that like everyone is focusing on him for other there's probably not enough people focusing on applications um what are some of the things maybe that you guys are are impressed by when it comes to like making some of these Stacks more accessible like we have mentioned some of the Roll-Ups as a service providers but I think you know whether it's like net new execution environments opening up the doors for uh developers from other ecosystems that come into web 3 like is there maybe a specific highlight of those categories that you think like make this technology more approachable um for you know the application and like potentially consumer developers as well you know what I think actually what's really cool about the modular let's say mindset is it's not that you build modular but the way that you're not logged in into an ecosystem especially through a token right so I I try to to run around Berlin and talk to people at WISE and people collaborating more together there are a bunch of different accesses in there and somebody mentioned to me well you know when you when you develop something in your ecosystem the incentive is really still like developed in your ecosystem because you develop it outside well their profit from it right so and unintentionally the token provides a barrier for collaboration certainly because of being so big already the model already doesn't have that because you can collaborate very rather easily there's everything is more aligned so the the room for experimentation the whole environment is a bit better so what you what you have is really that there's a lot of people building really cool stuff out there and they're just trying to figure out how to combine it recombine and so on but one that's a coming a lot of great ideas coming out of that and one of these great ideas is that you for example can abstract away the token right I think I think Nick mentioned that uh two days ago on the ZK day that you can actually build directly uh something on Celestia don't have a token this is a good thing because doesn't have to be Financial anymore they can just like start building which are really cool from the application users in the end right so those kind of thinking is is way more free and running more free and doing more experiments in the modern space it's also about the founders who are really mind to it like that I don't know we might have some people start sweating in the room when we start hearing no tokens but um another thing I'd like to post to you guys I'm like quite curious uh specifically maybe on like Calvin and matthias's perspective on like what are you bearish about in the modular ecosystem are there like specific things that you think are are like currently discussed or like a lot of people are excited about that like maybe specifically as an investor you aren't that interested in or you know maybe even like intellectually or like from a product Market fit perspective you think like doesn't have it doesn't have a chance or you're not as excited about yeah so I guess I can just quickly take this um yeah so that's a very good question I think uh you know moving forward um there's going to be a challenge when it comes to um justifying valuation so um I feel like during the bear Market a lot of people are looking into infrastructure that squeeze up all the evaluation um and in order to justify these evaluations depending on what you build you know um fees might eventually compress in the future so you'll have to find other ways to accrue value to what you're building right so um perhaps owning you know a more vertical stack you know that's how you accrue more value also bearish on high valuations but Matthias I'm curious to hear your thoughts yeah I I don't know if I agree with the feast points I think sort of fees will compress per user but the sum of fees that we collect unlike the infrastructure as a whole I hope will increase as we onboard more users um sort of the bare case for modular crypto I think is either the complexity that you add by sort of incorporating all these different systems together so if one of them breaks that might not be good um and overall maybe but that's a larger bearcatine crypto that people just don't really care about and use verification so a large part of you know building a modular blockchain with data availability sampling is that everybody can run a light note very easily I mean we see the people from Celestia especially do it everywhere um but ultimately the Assumption error there is that people do run around a light note and verify this thing themselves whereas maybe well they just don't do that do you think people want to run like clients yeah I think all devices shouldn't be encrypt though but it's sort of why you built on the blockchain right you want to be able to verify it otherwise you can just use your Excel sheet but it reminds me of like the accessibility point that we mentioned earlier maybe earlier we were talking about the accessibility for developers with like external skill sets from crypto but when you think about from a retail perspective maybe what some of the purists who have like grown up in this industry like really like kind of like prioritizes is really ensuring that these networks can be robust and a huge part of that is ensuring that you have like a culture that exists around these these blockchains of of of verifying State and and having individuals capable of doing that but uh maybe one thing I would pose to the group is I'm kind of convinced that we have to and in the same way we have to build uh you know like modular execution environments et cetera to make it more accessible to developers I think if we want people to care about you know verifiability we have to make it almost as like you know easy as like wearing like a wristwatch to tell the time in order to actually see like wide adoption so maybe counter that if you guys deal man that perspective even as like a value and I I do think people care about it so that's sort of in your question like will that I fundamentally do things because the most valuable sort of crypto networks also have that culture of running their own full notes right Bitcoin is go math if you make it slightly harder to run a Bitcoin full mode um it's sort of the whole block size debate was about that um and ethereum also puts in a lot of work uh into making it easy and accessible for everybody like all over the world with not a lot of money for Hardware to run a full mouth and obviously you have trade-offs but I do think that's what matters so that's why I'm pretty bullish unlike being able to verify it yourself quite easily maybe a question in the room like how many of you guys have like ever run like a full node on a network or maybe you're even like have tried or attempted to run a like they're gonna counter my points kudos to all of you everyone else homework at least give it a try I really encourage everyone to to give it a try um I think don't maybe there's a there's a difference in how you phrase like if you especially if you go outside the the blockchain space General blockchain space where everybody's kind of excited about the tech what does it mean to care about running a lifetime for example right I think people do care about a lot of things but they have like a let's say I care about two seconds right if you give it two seconds to me and I'm able to do it in two seconds I do care if it takes me 10 seconds I will not care right so there's a there's a kind of a resource allocation problem here where you say okay how can we do can we make you care about that within that time frame right and that's what you have basically in the website right you can website there's a green button saying okay it's check done right cool so I care for a second that's it but fine as long as you can establish that root of trust in your green SSL checkbox into your browser um I think we've seen a lot of like kind of like thought and probably innovation in the past 12 or 14 months on some of these like more Sovereign constructs that we've started to see um getting constructed do you guys like have maybe some thoughts on like the economic kind of implications of those sorts of constructs when you like really remove kind of the application and execution layer from maybe some of the underlying economics that you know a network might be inheriting from a from a from an alternative L1 despite maintaining that sovereignty I know I I'm happy to go um I think that especially in like Sovereign app change or app specific Roll-Ups whatever you want to call it I think the value capture is way more easy right because it's inherent to the application um so probably valuable accrued to the application of the crypto stack and to the sort of bottom layer which in my case should be a d a layer or whatnot um and I think if you have an app specific chain then it's quite easy to capture value by just extracting a fee for offering the application um so I think yeah the features in unit shop is famous but if they had an app specific chain it would be quite easy to make it valuable because every time somebody uses uni swap the blogspace gets used and validators captures some of that value any thoughts from you guys on kind of sovereign constructs and like how they could potentially like modify or alter some of the economics for application Developers yeah so um I agree with uh just said as well I feel like um you know app specific chains will probably have a better chance of creating more value um in some way I actually feel like modularity um it does make um certain layer twos like struggle to accrue sufficient value that's this is why we're starting to see Layer Three is getting built out right that's how you try to find other ways to to accrue them oh sorry uh yeah onto onto your your layer so so yeah moving forward I think um we'll continue to see more more layer three spilling on top and yeah I continue to scale that way yeah I don't see a difference happening and and there's a normal let's say traditional word well quantization means that you will less and less accrue value and everything on top of that will occur more value it's just that within the net within the Innovation cycle I like to say that every infrastructure was application once right you started out of that like an email even like an email protocol was an application once you started signing emails and then more and more people built on that it compressed basically down what Matthew said before that was that the fees per user might go down but the fees and total might go up right so it depends like what do you mean by by really accrue value but in general as a sum it might be that noise at some point will be a duplication but once the system is really thriving like we have now in the web 2 world do you think unit swaps an application or infrastructure which version no yes sir we argue about this at the office like are you investing applications infrastructure and you're also alluding to this right and I I do think that encrypto is often both um because uniswrap for a sort of penaltic as an example they're building options using Unity liquidity so for them uniswrap is the infrastructure and then you sort of have an infra layer again that captures value it's probably like why the conversation like I guess like that's probably part of the reason that that's like become such a maybe like a common theme or like something that a lot of people are chatting about is because there's probably like alternate definitions of those things as well and they probably like convolute over each other a little bit um coming towards to be an aggregator so they're moving toward the application now and then kind of letting go the protocol ones um maybe something I would like to maybe ask you guys from like a more kind of like personal and investor perspective I know early reach out about like maybe some special things that we like see modular Founders those sorts of things are there like explicit things that you guys like really uh enjoy seeing out of like maybe the founders or even like the technical teams that you have the privilege of supporting uh that you would wish to see uh from from others are there like highlights there that like you would like to share like lessons learned from some of these portfolio companies in the modular space that you guys are that you think is worth sharing oh sure uh I guess uh yeah when you're building like laundry infrastructure the founder should be I guess really agile as well so you can module in that sense but but yeah um yeah some of the backers that we've uh um some some of the uh Founders that we backed um yeah uh we actually um would like to back you know Founders that has previously built in um you know whether it's like a monolithic environment or a modular environment um so Founders actually know how to appreciate you know the the amount of um the the module the modularity nature of of you know blockchain right so um they're agile and that they actually understand you know um you know what's the benefit of having modular uh infrastructure yeah what about you your amateurs anything spicy as far as like things you want to see from more from from Founders or what I like about working with our Founders in the motor spaces I'm often the dumbest guy in the room right so they're all smarter than me and I'm learning from them as well that's the sign of a good investor if you're going to say that at the same time I mean it's not that different right they do need to be smart and sort of flexible or agile as you shed um but they also struggle with the same things every other company struggles with uh hiring uh Team Building you know just building a company is hard whatever you do um I think that's sort of it's yeah I think that summarize it yeah there might be a balance as well probably in this space I've found um at least during my time as an investor that the majority of of kind of the core founding team was quite Technical and oftentimes they do need kind of uh more I guess kind of like kosher traditional support from investors when it comes to the types of it like things you can actually do to to help them win yeah I mean these guys don't need me to tell them how to write code I I have no sure right but maybe helping with my first hire Etc that's more where they need to sort of be alleviated um so they have their core muscle their core strength and we try to work sort of around that yeah interesting um I want to kind of like go into some maybe potentially spicy topics now um that I think are again like quite uh quite quite timely when it comes to many of the ideas that are getting discussed over the course of the next two days here um what are some of your opinions on kind of like like rehypothecation of like proof of stake assets um specifically do you think there's like unknown dangers that investors or Founders or application Builders are not considering are there like externalities that you think long and hard about or potentially keep you up at night like I do yeah so I mean we have a company in our portfolio for example it's a pure Bitcoin company and they don't like it at all right but there's a Bitcoin maximalism involved here so I understand that right you're talking about uh kind of uh storage right values um but generally what I find more complicated with the infrastructure now is that you add to the financial complexity technical complexity and to the technical complexity you need to add scalability complexity so you might think that well if something breaks down I can all like execute my contacts and it goes down this way but all of a sudden boom it doesn't work out because everybody runs through the same Gateway and so you have this all complexity even getting bigger and it's really hard to evaluate that how big is that actually it's a lot of unknown unknowns and that makes I would I would I'll go slightly right really really careful about that and see how far you can go with this because at some point we just break and then you realize what it is so maybe just do that experimentally with small sums just to trigger and figure it out a little bit but doing it on a big scale as we saw so last year that might be a problematic thing yes definitely as we were with this last year advertise you have any spicy takes on this yeah I mean I I like to experimentation with it in general I like experimentation and trying out stuff and maybe breaking um on this specifically I think the economics behind it are still quite hard right so it's hard to quantify the risk of like real publication of assets as quantifying risk in crypto is hard anyway um and then there's also not that much fees collected right now that you can sort of give enough yields to on all two yeah yeah funnel to incentivize people to take that risk and that's I think sort of the big question here like okay maybe there's a small group of people who will do this but to incentivize a lot of people you need a lot of fees and that's just no there right now I think I would broadly agree with that um I maybe want to post like a question of the audience like I like opening these up to see if anyone has anything to add to the conversation or maybe things that you disagree with like is there anything that anyone here would like to raise their hand and potentially ask the panel I'm happy to to walk up and give you the mic I see a Spartan shirt over there any spicy takes for your colleague he can't put Calvin on the spot like that yes uh well I guess one spicy take that uh we we kind of you know touched on was uh you know module blockchain might at some point you know bring us back to maximalism because going back to a point right like my previous point if if you're trying to accrue value to a specific layer you'll start to find other ways to accrue more value right so for example just um thing out loud here so a d layer if you're trying to like um fees do compress in the future and you find perhaps you're trying to own another layer instead maybe execution layers that you're starting to see you know we're going back to the cycle where it's like we're trying to own more of the stack so you know um that's perhaps like one one spicy ticket yeah so dance Celeste I would at some point be like hey that settlement layer on top of us is also quite valuable why don't we sort of enshrine it into our stack yeah yeah that's that's that's a good bad guys yeah do you hear any other bear cases in regards to that that spicy take I think my biggest war with uh with the whole ecosystem generally is that are we actually building something completely different and new or we just build rebuilding the stuff that's already out there in a little bit slightly different way and we're just not seeing it because it's not convert it's not so new you haven't converged yet but in the end you just end up with the same system the same centralized Parts like a Bellator is validator is so big you just controls about extra stuff right and maybe it's something so big it controls a bunch of stuff you have like a bunch of operators that are just Grand and and you haven't seen coming but the economic gravity of that just made it happen right that's fair um another pivot maybe in the conversation um are there like certain types of of applications that you guys believe are like specifically empowered by by modular infrastructure I know we've kind of chatted about like oh you know like these concepts of of kind of turning specific applications into kind of their own like Sovereign execution like layers Etc across the stack but um when you think about kind of like the second order effects maybe you know this time next year or in two years um what type of applications do you think will have most benefited um from this sort of architecture yeah I think yeah sort of the the downside of building a modular blockchain is I think interoperability and as a result of that applications that don't need too much interoperability are going to be I think very interesting to begin with a good example of this could indeed be gaming so a gaming specific chain for just one game and I play like FIFA and I want to sell my coins or something on there I don't need to interact with somebody playing World of Warcraft right I have no need for that ration D5 that's very important that you can plug these different Lego blocks into each other so I think the first wave maybe and we saw Argus presented earlier will probably be gaming specific chains so that's I think something modularity enables and then indeed the different execution environments right stuff like the Solana VM the fuel VM move VM Etc maybe order book type of decentralized exchanges will be enabled by that although it remains to be seen how me Vivo player there but these type of products as well you maybe want to chat on that as far as like some of your like cross domain Mev perspective uh when it comes to like how that conceptually alters or or is modified by like modular architectures yeah I mean we're we're talking about a lot one thing we are currently still may be debating and I haven't I don't have my Minds made up yet it's where do you want the Mev to sort of land right so One Vision is you want the a layer to capture the Mev because then it will accrue more value and you'll have more Economic Security on the other side you maybe want the Mev to sort of be isolated in a separate execution environment because then if like one game gets extremely attractive and a lot of people play it it doesn't trickle down to the other roll ups so it's a trade-off right do you want it to go down a lot and it's I think where the leader selection happens is where it will go to and I don't know what the model session is I think there's still very much an open question the first thing it makes me think of is if uh and maybe I could be ignorant to this but whether people have thought about Dynamic systems that would be able to like maybe like modify or like point where that Mev could go but between two layers like that I don't know if that's been explored or if that's the dumbest idea that's been set here today but I also don't know honestly but I would be down to sort of look into that more I think that's one of the more interesting areas that indeed we talked about these modular Founders if you want to come like that are sort of and I'm sort of happy to tag along with them yeah on doing so yeah as we kind of like get a little bit closer towards the end of this conversation maybe open it up to all of you you have an audience here that are quite modular pilled are there like specific types of things that you want to see both kind of requests for startups or any concepts that you think are like rather unexplored or that you wish you had more looks at as far as different ideas so when I was reading up I I just started really recently reading about the about the intent based systems and I found it's a really cool way of thinking about what how it actually should act and we have a a company that's kind of in a similar space but it's an agent-based space and so intents and agents are a similar thing but in the end if you talk about if you look at how an app is built for example right it's it's not possible to have an app built on just smart contracts you need some sort of in-between like agents to trigger certain functions such that the person can just like have a phone in the pocket and just notification arrives right something like that so you need all those things and you need to cross them the chain barrier to this will be blockchain and on chain so I'm not excited about this stuff experimenting more of this kind of things to really figure out okay where does blockchain fit into the bigger it's a world solving problem space than just really running around the small pieces of the blockchain access themselves because I think we've crossed the barrier already a couple of years ago where blockchain was just a really kind of a big space we could put all your hope in and it was not concretely there which is part of Hope and you can just really think about oh that's the potential but now it's getting more crit and it also shows you more things that breaks that works that can solve and cannot solve right and it becomes really hard to have the Hope um and so you have to really think about now okay what does it actually can achieve what where does it go and how can we go there and I think this is kind of this it's intent based thing together with the agent base I'm not sure how how different they are actually from each other as a kind of a conversation a different conversation um is kind of a really nice way to explore it Calvin Mathias any requests for startups are areas that you wish were maybe ideas that you saw more of as Venture investors oh yeah I'm about to take it um I think one okay this is going to be a bit boring and someone's got sharing out D5 it's not very sexy anymore right especially amongst Venture investors um I do think the whole real world assets thing is actually quite cool um that we have like close to a billion of bonds being on the ethereum Chain right now is I think very interesting to see um so in that regard stuff like noble that aims to bring usdc onto these Celestia chains I think it's very interesting so deep these type of products that actually connect to the sort of real world or web 2 world or whatever you want to call it um are quite interesting I would love to see that more moving forward as we grow more into that adoption uh part of the tech sector usdc the quintessential real world asset I mean I've been arguing here about end user verification now I'm the usdc bull but yeah that's all fair and also privacy Tech but that's more generic stuff like penumbra um anoma nymtech I think that's sort of where my sort of more crypto native heart lies um and I would love to more of that maybe dig into that a little bit because I actually feel quite naive as far as like maybe some of the privacy considerations that are empowered maybe uniquely by modular infrastructure is there any like thing that you would add to that or like things you've seen recently that excited you specifically with like privacy type applications or privacy-based architectures I haven't seen a little privacy deck like on the modular ecosystem like a roll up that's only privacy or f-specific tornado cache uh would be quite cool I'm not sure if they're sort of and then on five change you have sort of two layers of Rights I think a lot of financial institutions want privacy on their orders and don't care if like regulates can see it and then you have more the crypto anarchistic privacy which are maybe dark fine where sort of everything has to be private they're very purest about that um in the Mojo ecosystem I don't know you can make a lot of design trade-offs you can maybe encrypt a member which for financial institutions would be enough privacy right um so yeah looking forward to seeing these uh Founders try out stuff there yeah it's another one I don't want to bore people with because I feel like it can be quite cliche but like uh I'm curious if you guys have any perspectives specifically on you know like maybe like non-web three native use cases for some of these modular architectures I think I could probably speak for everyone in the room in the sense that like they like like Enterprise blockchain Etc has has failed in the majority of its capacity but I'm curious if we feel that there's any inkling of of feel that the modular infrastructure could maybe help Empower that in some way I I um had this conversation yesterday about like how do you build a social network a new social network and I find this as a mistake most people think about social networks in terms of Facebook and Instagram and YouTubes uh as kind of there's a graph because I think in the new way if you have blockchain you have this new technology you can rethink that and I think in the center of that is the feat and the feed can be for example um modular right you can you can actually do and choose your own feed how you want to like it and the feed procuration connects to people right not anymore through kind of a social granted a girl existed and you just walled it in it really is about like the resenter piece where people are creating stuff and that flows all into the feed and that connects to people right and this has an emerging quality of a network then all of a sudden you have a sort of network without wanting it just like it has before but it's a new way of thinking and I think that's what blockchain enables is a new way of thinking the old stuff all the things that we have already we can have it back but we have it in a new way and build it in a different way and only then it works I actually like to build on the like last point that you made um is there anything like very specifically that you guys feel like maybe getting modular pills whatever we want to call it or just like becoming more aware of how people are thinking in the modular kind of infrastructure space are there explicit like explicit things that has changed around how you think that could be I don't know from like a ethical philosophical perspective it also also be from a technical perspective as well I do I could take it back to the Enterprise question if you know um I I don't think we'll see a lot of Enterprises starting to build on these systems earlier right you asked like how do you underwrite the risk of it being quite experimental take especially Enterprises are scared of that um I do think that sort of rollup itself is very interesting for them because they can sort of keep a level of control that maybe they feel like they miss on like an permissionless L1 or maybe a certain regulatory uh yeah exactly so I I do see a lot of like experimentation happening there but I do think it's way further out than yeah next year or something I should ask right I don't think they'll be like oh we have to deploy a roll up uh no I think they're more likely to be at the to look at more established Networks cool well I know we have probably maybe two or so minutes left just to to finalize this conversation but um what do you guys hope we are like uh you know if we return here in a year and and have the privilege of of meeting at the next modular Summit um what is it that you hope you're you're seeing become successful what are some of like maybe the the next Milestones that you hope you see uh the space achieve in order to kind of get us to the next stage I mean Celestia launching is a good first one right it's launching the marionette successfully um second I think I'll show more CK Roll-Ups going live like in full I know sheike is short of life but that ecosystem returning to a similar sort of level as maybe the arbiterm ecosystem is because I know we're here at like much of something we're talking about session but a lot of Roll-Ups also have like the largest ecosystems by far on ethereum um eip4844 going live successfully would be pretty cool I think as it makes block space more accessible for these Roll-Ups um and maybe the first cell phone roll up on Celestia more app specific Roll-Ups going live hopefully some acceleration isn't around restaking as well maybe yeah fast experience but experiments but small ones hopefully what about you guys yeah so uh yeah aside from those um I think uh we want to see more more of the tap layer development as well so I actually want to touch on orange gaming as well so I feel like watching gaming can actually um take advantage of what you know module blockchain could actually offer um so bringing the entire game logic as well as game economy on chain could actually bring about like Silo different type of economies on the side right so for example strategy game you're trying to like attack someone right let's say it's a and then someone can like front run you know that action you know it will be like a priority it will create like different new Dynamics right so so I feel like um you know that that's some place that we can perhaps no I've definitely heard Scott from Argus talk a lot about what excites him building like modular infrastructure specifically for like game designers is like attempting to create something that can create like very emergent like net new like player behaviors because I think that's one of the things that actually makes games exciting or like when good games become exciting is when it's like something you haven't done before I remember like like reselling and game assets for the first time that's like actually what got me into crypto in 2012. um I think seeing more experiments around that will be pretty exciting as well awesome guys I think we're just at time so really appreciate the attention from everyone and everyone supporting uh the whole gang here at Celestia and Maven appreciate you guys having us and yeah enjoy the rest of your time at Paris everyone thanks thanks a lot
