all right uh so welcome everyone to the first celestia community call we're really excited to have you here we have a really awesome agenda for today um yeah so let's get started um the first thing we want to talk about and cover is the road to the incentivized testnet and in order to do that we have ismail the cpr celestia lab who will go give an overview of the incentivized testing uh yeah we yeah yeah hey there you go can you guys hear me well yeah nice so first of all i wanted to cover the test net not the incentivized test net because that's more tangible and also fairly soon um so i don't want to set like a very specific date but it's weeks not months so like expect updates on the test net very very soon um so just to give an overview what the testnet is it's basically in iteration of the current test net that we already have running i mean that we have testnet running since i think like november last year when we had offsite in berlin and [Music] that testnet was basically meant as a as a first iteration and meant as a first experiment also for the team to learn how to launch a chain and for the first community to evolve around uh running validators and everything right but this test net which is called devnet did not we did not add any features yet but we were heads down um implementing features and doing bug fixes and all this so the test net and we launched fairly soon will be an upgrade or the next iteration of that same devnet that it's worth saying that that test net will also not be incentivized it's just a community run test net so the main changes there uh that you can expect from the testnet is that developers should have a slightly better time to interacting with the test net itself right like the uh yaz is doing an awesome job and putting docs together it's still very early and but it's still not the same developer friendliness that we expect for the incentivized test or we expect that launch but there's an api that the node team put together and the stock side and my hope is that we will update the the docs and the api and also tell potentially interested developers about this while the test net is running and um this testnet will be uh like it will be updated right like it won't upgrade it won't be uh static as the last one where we for the last one as i said for the devnet we only updated the node software once um or twice like they were bug fixes they were fixed so it runs smoothly but like the core validator software was not updated at all because there was like little features added there and also it was like it was more important to get this feature in the code instead of like life of that devnet so this this test net will be different in the sense that we hope to do an upgrade or two maybe for that purpose to have easier time coordinating we'll add back the governance module or actually we already added it back and the code is just not deployed yet and we will make use of the upgrade module as well so what kind of upgrades can you expect most likely um we also have like people from the qgb team on the call but most likely we want to deploy the quantum gravity bridge code the part of the state machine um on that test net once it's ready um and before the incentivized test net most likely um what you can expect from that is that you have this like one-way registry ethereum maybe we'll talk a little bit later about the quantum very good glitch and and what what it is and what it does in more detail uh but like roughly it's a one-way bridge to theme such that ethereum roll-ups can use uh celestia as a data availability layer instead of what currently most these chains do is like they do use a closed set of data availability committee so expect that to be deployed on test net as well as smart contracts on some ethereum testnet also we might upgrade to new uh tenement and sdk versions as they come as a mature and bug fixes so um for instance currently we're working towards upgrading to tandem zero 35 and the cosmos sdk 46 which isn't fully released it's just a better release we will work towards that depending if you're ready at the launch of testnet um or afterwards um depends uh we might upgrade or we might upgrade to like uh patch releases of that um and also um yeah i mean the node software can be upgraded fairly easy and we we expect uh there will be there will be a fair chunks of like bug fixes as well um another change to the test to the last devnet is that we will increase the validator set to 150 active validator slots uh last time as i said the davner was mostly an internal exercise that turned into a public test net and that public test net gained a lot of traction right there was uh the the 100 active validator slots that we had which is the default in the cosmos sdk very quickly filled up after we announced that it is public now and um we have thousands i don't know how many it is now but like last time i checked we had like over 2500 uh inactive validators so it's like it gained a lot of traction so that's why we um anticipate to to increase the validator slots a bit we will coordinate to a few validators from the devnet to be part of the genesis ceremony and expect probably will have a faucet as well as last time to fill up the remaining valley data slots to summarize again it's not an incentivized test net but it's the next iteration of our devnet expect some upgrades and expect it to be a bit more developer friendly the next iteration after that will be the incentivized effect the timeline for that is a bit more later this year i guess like q4 this year roughly expected but mid end of q4 uh we'll announce that ahead of time but like our current focus will be launching that test that will be in like a few weeks from now um well for the incentivized test that you can expect like relatively um straightforward regular tasks that you expect from like any incentivized test net and validators will be incentivized obviously but additionally to that we also will want to incentivize uh running light nodes and celestia full storage nodes um and maybe you can expect some like attacks that are specific to uh the celestia data availability layer um most likely will be like a dashboard and a leader board according to different phases that the incentivized test net will entail um yeah i think that's all i wanted to say about the uh incentivized test net and the test net well i can also summarize a little bit on the engineering efforts um but i'd like if if team members from the different teams are present i'd like to add to this as they as they want so i think um the main changes in core and app is that we adopted a a subset of abc i plus plus um this might the i don't know how familiar people are on this call of like tenement and abci but um we need basically what we needed was uh a method to maniate the transactions from the mempool before a block is proposed we had that functionality long before every abc if tesla started to be worked on in tenement um but what we didn't have was a second uh method that is after the proposal like after the proposer proposes a block all the other validators need to check on that block and basically repeat that validation and check check if it's valid um in that sense and um we started doing this on our own but then the tenement team also picked up working on abc plus plus so they added a second uh method and we basically what we did is removed our own thing and adopted um the first phase and the second phase pre prepare proposal and process proposal is for the for the ones familiar with abc updates plus these are the methods that we adopted um and there was like a lot of smaller bug fixes and a lot of uh uh um improvements there was like a denominator like a token denomination bug and um yeah i think that if evan is on the call if you want to add something please do but i think most of the things are a bit too detailed or too too technical most likely i don't know oh i think you covered everything perfectly okay thanks um for for the node software the celestia node software um just to explain briefly that's the that's the software that actually serves um data availability sampling requests and where you you perform data availability sampling on is uh we use tenement for the consensus but we also use a separate almost separate peer-to-peer layer there's based on the p2p and bitswap where you perform data availability sampling and there's a bridge node that bridges between both worlds essentially or both like peer-to-peer networks so there again a lot of bug fixes optimizations uh one thing that didn't work uh during devnet was the sampling for past tenders uh only for like current headers but this is like uh been fixed and since a while now i think a big feature that we added is bad encoding fraud proofs um only recently um so that's that's a fraud proof type that enables um not like basically light nodes not to trust the the majority of validators to do the erasure coding correctly this is important for rollups such that um roll ups build on top of celestia do not have to trust the validator set for that for that property also there is like a public api now in the node software um it's slowly coming together it's not final yet but we have like a very uh first version of that where celestia node will more and more become the entry point for developers to use to build rollups on top and everything currently what's done is you use a mix of interacting with the core and app software and then you also interact with something called bulk but like moving forward and more and more during the test net you'll just interact with the node software um anyone once add something from the node team um let me unmute the node team in case they wanna i mean they can raise their hand as well oh yeah yeah yeah please wait your hand if you wanna speak so we can unmute you okay doesn't look like it okay how do i raise my hand just a neutron a i'll find winner [Music] hello hey um yeah so for like uh with the recent updates you'll be able to use celestino directly you don't need to use dlc anymore because you can submit and retrieve you can submit pay for data messages via celestia node very easily and you can also retrieve shares by namespace so you won't need dalc anymore you'll just interact directly with the node yeah yeah basically what i said like more and more the celestia node software will be the single like entry point for developers to use um it'll be refactored a lot in the next coming months uh how we will do it specifically but for now we have an rpc endpoint um that should make it quite easy yeah it's pretty cool i hope we'll see some of the like interested developers to start playing around with with the node software uh during this test net um a lot of stuff also happened around like not directly in the core software but like in the quantum gravity bridge evan do you want to speak to this yeah i can so with the quantum gravity bridge um it's basically a light client relay to ethereum and we've made a lot of progress over the designing it and kind of iterating over that design um i think that's about it i think we're aiming to upgrade like ishmael said earlier we're aiming for it to be one of the upgrades for testnet and um that should be a lot of fun yeah so there's like components to the state machine that will be up like part of that upgrade and then as i said will also be smart contracts that will be deployed on some like ethereum test net um and a lot a lot of things also happened around another component which is like the the uh optimum or slash execution environment team we have in germany they're working heavily towards uh state fraud proofs for the cosmos sdk with a focus on like uh ethereum and so to say um if josh is on the car i want to speak to this um but i can i can only summarize that there's like a lot of design documents and um um we expect um sorry uh josh is here yeah let him speak if you want is this working um yeah so not to cover like too much here but we're working on you know essentially um a sequencer component so so optimum and this is essentially just a first implementation of a client to talk to celestia and how you would then build these rollups on top of celestia the the concept of a sovereign roll-up um so we're making good progress there we've integrated that with etherman um and so we actually do have some examples of you can deploy you know a basic ethereum smart contract and it pushes the blocks all the way down we're still pretty early stage on this and we started properly working on getting fraud proof implemented in the cosmos sdk um but not a lot to cover right now hopefully more um in the next month or so all right well thank you yeah um i think that's from my side and trying to involving team i think we took a lot of time i know that was really great um like it's a lot of exciting development happening and everyone should stay tuned uh as we get closer to both the public testing and the incentivized test net next up uh yeah thanks for smile thank you to the engineering team um next up yeah we wanna stay around for questions yeah please um next up we have we wanna do a recap of the modular summit and on the call we have a d2 who did a phenomenal job on one of the best summits i've ever seen both in crypto and outside of crypto and less a new adidas uh can hear me yeah cool okay i'll keep this quick uh and and thanks for the intro yes um as a lot of you are aware the modular summit took place on april 21st in amsterdam during devconnect um the event was the blueprinting of the next generation of blockchains where we embrace modularity and we're able to hear from a variety of teams including roll-up teams bridges l-ones and more we had over 600 attendees in person we heard from mustafa al-bassam zakimanyan uri kolodny eric wall terun chitra anatoly akovenko and many others including our community members and researchers who are able to present as well we covered a bunch of topics including defining the modular layers l1 l2 l3s mev on modular blockchains the data availability landscape and of course monolithic versus modular all talks are available on our youtube channel uh the link is here um yeah and and that's basically it for uh the summit updates i'm sure a lot of you were able to catch it either in person or uh via the live stream but if you didn't check it out i highly urge you to do so because the content was great well thank you aditi um yeah it's like a lot of great content it was uh great venue and everything um and i look forward to the next one now we want to take it uh to community uh questions so now is your opportunity to ask uh to celeste team anything and yeah um so in order to do that um because everyone's muted because we have a lot of people on the call we just you just have to raise your hand or you can ask and we'll unmute you or you can ask the question in the chat um and it looks like we already have a question in the chat how long will the devnet process state and what are your plans for the next phase um who want to take that question uh ismail oh sorry can you repeat the question yeah the question the question in the chat is how long will the devnet process state and what oh and what's next or the devnet um i'm not sure if you're talking about the devnet or the testnet but in the chat it specifically says yeah well i guess that so i mean as as we think of like the testament as the next iteration of the devnet um the testnet will last at least a few months till most likely till the incentivized test net which will be as i said end of q4 or something so it will be it will be a long running test net with like multiple iterations sounds good uh uh well um so before we uh also tackle the rest of the chat question there's also been questions on the agenda and the github ticket so i'm going to read them out for the team uh what stage of development are we of the quantum gravity bridge i think evan wanted to answer this yeah all right evan now you should be unmuted yeah yeah so with the qgb the current stage of development is that we have like a very hacky working version but we're uh very quickly iterating to make it a lot less hacky and a lot more useful um one of the things that we added recently was we added a sub command in the celestia app to launch the contracts yourself so if you wanted to you can launch the contracts to any evm platform and relay yourself if you feel like doing that but there's still like um to to finish answering the question um i think we kind of mentioned this on the call a few times but we're aiming to be an upgrade for testnet so we're aiming for the finished useful version to be finished probably in like a month maybe a month and a half but that's like very rough goals but yeah thank you evan um the other question is how's the sevenmost settlement layer development going maybe josh ganassada or josh can you raise their hand alrighty yeah you should be on you okay um so it's going pretty well we have at least an initial example of like this this working at like a minimal you can deploy an evm contract using you know uh hard hat or um foundry to the evm it's it's not full um compatibility there's there's some things um in in the evm that aren't like test calls but generally we are seeing um blocks be able to be submitted on the cephmos layer and pushed all the way down to celestia with communication coming back up um so so that's that's where we're at um we'll certainly have something deployed i think on on this next um devnet test net um which you want to call it um but for right now it's going to be like centralized sequencers um for this but there should be something that will be usable for people to at least deploy evm contracts on it thank you josh all right the other question is has celestia received any response from teams planning or considering to build sovereign roll-ups on celestia uh who wants to take that one please raise your hand anybody did we get anything yeah all right yes can you repeat the question um did we get the celestine get any um or responses or interest for from team who are planning to build sovereign well up on top of celestia um yeah thank you okay cool uh yes we did actually josh josh is also a part of this effort and and fields a lot of these questions um we do get a lot of interest and actively work closely with teams that express that kind of interest to answer questions um and uh offer advice on on how to structure their their stack and so if you do have such questions or you know of teams that are interested please feel free to intro them to us either uh yeah via discord or um our twitter accounts thank you aditi um all right so we're gonna go through the next uh the rest of the question that are from the chat um so one question is will americans be allowed to participate in the incentivized test net um so currently we're still determining how to structure the incentivized testnet and who will be able to participate um and we'll be able to update the community as we get closer to launch next question is can multiple evm bridges be used for testnet and i mean yeah technically a smile you want to take that one i'm sure um i mean theoretically yes but um so what we what we will deploy on the like test that as i said is is most likely only the qgb which is like a one-way bridge and probably not what the person who asked meant by this um i am honestly not sure um that we i don't think we should on test that and maybe not even on main net should deploy like a proper two-way bridge on the um from and to the main chain and instead use like bridges from chains um um like um either like custodial bridges or rather bridges on chains that like uh we have an ivc connection to like for instance osmosis will have evm like not evm bridges like bridges to ethereum and um yeah roughly you could call these evm bridges if you want to but like we will rather leverage these bridges with like one hop through through osmosis right or maybe the cosmos hub or um other cosmos zones so to say but it won't be theoretically yes you could use whatever bridge is there but like we won't deploy any state machine logic directly on the main chain because we want to keep it as minimal as possible and the qgb is like relatively lightweight yeah i think it answered the question thank you so much all right the next question is what will determine eligibility for the incentivized test net i think um it depends on you how do you want to participate in the incentivized test net if you want to participate as a validator there will be a form that you would have to fill out um um like an intake form to see like have you validated in the past and stuff in order to be eligible but there's also going to be applications if you want to become a just a regular node operator like running a light node a bridge node a full node and also if you want to be a builder like if you want to build your own uh roll-up on top of the incentive by testner or you want to deploy your app specific chain um you're also like unable to do that within the incentivic test as well um and then let's move on to the next question what can we expect from the test.net launcher is there a focus on network stability or can we already expect building that functionality um i'm not sure if it's specifically about the public test net or for the incentivized testnet um the smile do you want to answer that one sure i think just like as i said i think like in the in the intro you will be able even on the public test net not the incentivized system you will be able to experiment and play around and build dabs to some extent um the the developer experience certainly will be more uh like nicer or like the developer friendlier on the incentivized test net um so yes in both cases you will be able but like it's just more it will be more ready the software and the documentation will be more ready during the incentivized system but we definitely if you if you want to play around with it already we encourage you highly to try it out during the test net already which will be like yeah as i said like few weeks from now thank you mr smile um what's the next question uh okay so here's a question in light of celestia's unique modular approach what a few main use cases for celestia i think that's an open question for everyone on the team please raise your hand if you want to answer that question um so i think like i mean i can happily answer what a few main use cases so you can think about you know celestia your data availability layer so if you want to deploy like uh scalable roll-ups um that either rely on a settlement layer or your own sovereign roll-up um celestia provides that data availability layer that allows you to scale over time um at the block size uh increases and that way you can you know keep transaction costs low um over time and you can then deploy like an app like an app specific train or like um like a generic uh roll up that you know settled on either ethereum or sapmos or or any other settlement layer that you'd like uh it to settle on um uh so i see taha raising your hand i'm guessing you want to ask a question i'm just going to unmute you now so you can answer your ask a question okay we'll circle back to taha later so another question is have node operator uh do node operators who run a brit node have the option to participate in consensus by becoming a validator uh yes so if you're running a bridge node um you also have the option to become a validator um at the same time you can at the same time you can actually run a bird note without participating in consensus um and you can currently try to do that within devnet um and like for the upcoming public testing and you know participating and the incentivized test net where you run a brick node and allow you to participate in consensus obviously there's also this part about you know using a faucet on devnet to you know delegate and you know then become a validator and participate in consensus okay so here's an interesting one um what are the biggest challenges you're solving right now and how can the validator community help over the next few months with those challengers um maybe a smile or stuff i want to answer this um i i'd say um the most challenging part is still always the networking layer um all the peer-to-peer uh stuff is just hard um but it's not like it's not that we trying to like i think we solve this and we have an architecture that works um but there's like a lot of improvements that can be made and a lot of um especially in terms of like data storage like we we could optimize this a lot in general um let me think what are the what are the biggest challenges um honestly i think documenting uh like coming up with proper um um apis and documenting those um to attract developers and to make it easier for developers to onboard themselves i think is one of the like more urgent challenges um thinking about the validated community i am not sure i think i think what you can do is just like for the validator community um if there's like any dashboards um that you could like think of for the uh celestia node software uh or dashboards for um the core software itself is like basically cosmos sdk chains right if you can think of like combining these both worlds somehow or coming up with ideas how to to measure um uh not to measure like how to visualize the the the other peer-to-peer network in some way or the other i think that would be cool but it's purely optional it's like not one of the bigger like it won't contribute to like the big challenges we have because they are mostly i think engineering challenges i'd say um but it would still be very cool thanks to smile i think also uh you wanna you raise your hand you wanna answer as well uh let me understand so clip also mentioned something and chat i think yeah okay so yeah um ishmael mentions uh the complexity and like the challenges on the pdp network and i can albert here because that's uh like uh backbone of all the things we are building data ability layer with uh all those reliability samplings which are solely based on pdp network and uh one of the biggest like complex cases that we are trying to achieve and test is uh ability for full nodes to reconstruct data from sub sets of light nodes you can think over several full nodes that each of them have their own subnet of light nodes and all of them cannot reconstruct the block with their own sub-networks but if they connect to each other they can collectively reconstruct the block from all the light nodes and such cases and such limitations are pretty challenging to do and this is what we are working on right now to answer the question all the challenges thank you um i think also uh josh wants to answer the question um i'm gonna unmute you josh yeah sorry so i i wasn't specifically trying to answer this question i just wanted to tackle some of the questions on like roll-ups and what we mean when we say roll-ups okay so we mean um there's kind of there's kind of a layered approach here right if you're familiar with the the celestia concept or not right so let's just providing this data availability layer and as ismail mentioned right we're not going to have kind of a state function in the celestia base layer so the the celestia ledger can be thought of as like a dirty ledger um where it's just a list of kind of unencoded uh or undecoded um transactions just blobs of bytes so you actually need to roll up to interpret those bytes and and kind of give them state transition functions and this is very similar to what you see roll-ups doing on top of ethereum where they're using ethereum as call data and so for this you know to actually make celestia super like usable um you need to have this other chain on top um to to actually interpret the the data you're writing to celestia so that's what we mean when we say rollups some interesting options that celestia gives in this kind of sovereign roll-up space is that you can have this reliance on consensus and ordering of blocks on the base layer um the celestial layer and that allows you to have these trust minimized light clients where you can have light clients that approach essentially the full security of a full node because they're guaranteed to be able to access blocks um when they need it on the base layer and so you can implement fraud proofs on a layer above celestia while having data availability guarantees by the base layer i'm happy to take any other kind of more more specific questions on on this or feel free to kind of ping me a dts you put my twitter link somewhere in the chat yes please um the next question is what about an ambassador program so the good news is we're currently scoping an ambassador program with our community managers it's still the early stage but we'll we're trying to design it and we'll have more updates on an ambassador program in the next few weeks hopefully um the other question maybe josh if you want to answer it um how do you keep the ledger small enough to be able to run celestia on a mobile phone when all transactions will be accepted like valid and invalid oh let me unmute you josh sorry so i probably actually want to punt this to to lib or or renee on this oh yeah um but if if you want to write music that's probably the celestiano team right yeah um let me let me get mustafa unmuted yeah sorry hello could you hear me yes sorry can you quickly repeat that question yeah um so the question is how do you keep the ledger small enough to be able to run celestia on a mobile phone when all the transactions will be accepted whether they're valid or invalid um well i mean that client doesn't process the state of the cedar app it just process like it just downloads the headers so it wouldn't like it doesn't store any say at all thank you mr stuffer that answered the question um uh let's see what's the other question okay are there any plans for research called either in the style of like vega fortnightly office hours or celestia advocating talks like at the research track at the modular summit i mean i could answer it to some extent for research proposals and research calls um we would have like i think like or like within the like um this year like an rfes or like any kind of proposals like related to research and development um but we it was still kind of early in scoping it out but um we'll have more information soon um and if anyone else wants to talk about this um feel free to raise your hand otherwise i'm going to move on to the next questions um so the next question is what are the requirements to host celestia nodes um so i mean i can answer it to some degree um in order to host the celestia node uh you can host it on a bare metal you can you can host it in the cloud if you want to but it kind of centralizes the system um you can try to use it with a co-location model rather than a cloud model um if you want to do it on a data center you can probably run those at home but you would want to maintain high uptime and like you know uninterrupted like uh internet bandwidth because otherwise if your internet goes down for a little bit or your power goes out you can get slashed so there's different ways that you can go about it when you want to run a celestia node and so can the second the next question is can testnet participant count to be included in into the mainnet validator list um so the program is still being designed but it depends on the participant's performance in the incentivized testing right so if you're if you're if you're a good validator with a high up gun score and can do all the challenges and the incentivized test that then obviously you know that kind of quality qualified you better than if you're a bad validator that's getting slashed all the time on the test app okay will will it be in any limitation of participant in the incentivized test net what can community members do now if that's not for them isn't there yet any activities before quarterboard testnet um so for the inter pretty you know participant in the incentivized president um the validator set there's a limit but there's also a lot of options if you can't get into the valve data set like with light node you can run your own light node you can run full nodes you can run bridge nodes so there's other option and that would you know um there are you know challenges when you're when you're running it within the tesla that you can participate in um and obviously you can also be a contributor um there's also also contributor challenges like you know creating content creating documentation supporting your fellow community members um during the incentivized test net and what kind of things you can do before incentivizing steps that happen well there's a public testing that's gonna be spun off um uh soonish and you can participate by building on top of it you know like you know application specific um projects on top of the public testnet you can also contribute to the documentation or you can write let's say you built your own node um you set up a celestia node on a raspberry pi or some other kind of project that you find interesting and you can you know write a blog post about it um you can you can contribute to the code you know decoded open source um there's a lot of tickets you can participate in that you can you know get assigned a ticket we're always monitoring we'd love uh public contributors who want to participate and we're happy to give you like issues if you want to participate in the code base as well um so i'm going to read this question but let me just see it um there are a lot of monolithic bc chains uh these days and i see many proposals being manipulated and not functioning by the early bc um especially in terms of governance uh what makers selected taking to avoid being like this um i'm not really sure understand the question be honest um let me see if there is the testing going to be um so let me let let me go to the one on the chat because i think there's a lot of people asking the chat is the test net going to be open for everyone or will be a private customer so i think like yeah the incentive like tesla is going to be open you can apply there will be a form that you can you know apply for um and then that allows you to participate um depending on what put what what you're trying to do and yeah so what do you let's see if there's any um let's see if there's more okay yeah so that's the question at the end does anyone want to answer that if the latest question in the chat okay uh josh uh i just requested that you unmute yourself go for it sorry can you can you can you point out the question the vc question oh the bc question uh so did you repeat the should i repeat the question it says there's a lot of monolithic vc chains and i see that proposals being manipulated and not functioning uh in terms of governance uh well i mean so like my like our general philosophy is like we want to be a community like even though we have you know vcs as investors obviously and like part of the reason for that is um like part of like it's very it's not really legally possible these days to do a public ico um and that's why like early investor investing investors are needed but we also recognize that we're trying to build a community that uh project especially in terms of governance um so in terms of governance we kind of don't see like we see governance as a kind of off-chain topic rather than the on-chain topic um in the sense that the kind of stakeholders of the ecosystem are more than just like who owns the most tokens or something like that rather than it being a hypocrisy and so kind of like you know ethereum governance it's not like it's not like the people who have all the most tokens in ethereum get to decide what happens um like we want to have a similar kind of community-led you know atmosphere here if that makes sense thank you miss sucker um another question is will there be anything for adam's stickers so we're still ironing out um participation criteria we'll follow up with community as soon we have more details there there's another question what would be the high level system requirements to participate in testing or incentivized testing so the good news is we do have a documentation page that i can share with you now here on the screen i'm hoping everyone can see the screen on the dock page but basically to get an idea of like the highest level system requirement we do have a hardware requirements section here that i'm going to link to you right here in the chat so that should be able to give you an idea on the hardware requirement for participating in the test what are the best way to contribute technically for now um you can participate in in like the github repository by you know there's a lot of open tickets that you can participate in um you can like you know for some ticket that you find better beginner-friendly just comment there and like you know ask to be assigned we're happy to assign it to you we're already seeing a lot of participants um contributing to pull requests um writing tickets and yeah like jacques is saying good first issues um tag that way like please you know if you want to participate that way um and also like you know within devnet and soon within the public testing being able to um you know uh build your own projects um would be really cool and by then we'll also have more documentation for how do you you know how are you able to contribute and build on top of like the public testing and after that the be incentivized all righty um wow the question keep on coming folks uh let's see uh good question no it is early about how difficult would it be for an existing octane data availability scaling solution like starkx validium medicine construction to switch from their internal um dac to something like celestia i think josh won't be answer that one go for yeah i it cover this one and then um if evan's still on the call he might have a little bit more to um note on this on on how it relates like qgb um but generally i mean it it's it's kind of up to oh god the question moved um i'm sorry it's kind of up to these um these roll-ups on how they want to move right but they should theoretically depending on their interfaces right if they just have a thing where they're essentially expecting to write data and then read data and expect kind of consensus guarantees on them then they should be able to just integrate with celestia's api by having um a light node or a light client and then making sure the rpcs and kind of the interface connect so technically it shouldn't be a whole lot of work it's obviously going to be somewhat dependent on the assumptions they've made from like a withdrawal window or a timing or when they're checking how often they're writing kind of various parameters there but technically it's not particularly difficult i don't think um yeah so what about number two question number two can you describe again how light noise requirements scale with block size um proportional to square root of block size correct and how celeste is scaled with raw number full light node um i'm going to unmute your jack because your hand is raised yeah so so i so i think this is actually probably a better question for mustafa or a dt um you might have info on this and we might have um blog posts on the site i know you've looked into kind of the scaling question here a little bit um and i think one of mustafa's earlier papers will have kind of a charts on exactly what this is looking like a deterio mustafa do one of you guys want to handle this uh which question was that uh how light node requirements scale with block size proportional to square root of the block size um how does celestia scale with the raw number of full nodes um or light nodes involved in the data availability sampling yeah light nodes square will describe the light nodes scale proportional to the square root of the block size so it's like if you have n data you take the square root of that and that's how much and and that's basically how the like clients requirements increase this is about the how many row and column routes are in the two-dimensional data availability square got it um aditi you wanted to answer the other question as well let me on mute yeah no worries uh sorry i think uh i think we were like the chat was moving so you probably didn't see uh that i raised my hand but josh mostly addressed the questions on uh the the dac point we're actively chatting with teams like star queer and arbitrary and especially stark where we're scoping out how we can work together and plug in as a as a da solution so it is early but those discussions are actively ongoing and once we have a sense we are we're definitely going to put out documentation about it as well as um demoral guides on on how to do this okay um evan you're raising your hand i'm gonna mute you but just to keep in mind we're four minutes before the call ends so like whatever okay i was just going to clarify that there's only one function to interact with for the qgb contracts so if you wanted to switch from a dac to using the qgb there's basically one function and you just ask it is this data actually part of the commitment that the celestia validator is committed to and that's it so you do however you incorporate that into your contracts it'll vary depending on the roll-up but that's it alrighty well thank you um yeah folks so we're nearing the four-minute mark um before the call ends and like we had an amazing turnout today like 100 people were waiting um i think for like what it taught us for the next community call we gonna increase the limit we had no idea it's gonna be this pack but would love to see how we love to seeing how excited everyone is about the first call a lot of amazing questions being asked we're going to have a lot more updates for everyone um as we get closer to the public test net and after that to the incentive testing on the road to mainnet after that and so yeah um keep always stay on the lookout for more celestic community call be sure to join our discord um be sure to uh follow us on twitter um ask as many questions um you know and we have a like the github repo which has all the different um uh agendas for the future community calls we're gonna have a lot more information moving forward and yeah we want to thank you all for attending this has been really exciting and i'm happy that everyone's super excited about celestia i want to thank the celestia core team our community manager for all the help and support they provided us to make a very successful first community call so thank you so much everyone all right i'm gonna stop recording right now
