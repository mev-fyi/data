thank you guys for joining um let's kick things off uh as everyone's probably aware uh you know last week John published a new article one of his another one of his masterpieces um that kind of kicked off or reignited an old debate about Roll-Ups sovereignty bridging a lot of things that run to the very core of you know blockchains and uh you know Kelvin was a co-author on that post and also he wrote a follow-up post earlier this week which I thought was also a masterpiece John wrote a follow post there's a lot of debates on Twitter I think Togo was uh you know one of the the more like Salient coherent critics of of uh some of the positions that were you know made in in those posts and so we just wanted to get people together to talk about this topic and go deeper and kind of um unravel and get to the bottom of this conversation so that's why we're here and I wanted to start with just a round of intros for our guests and for people who do not already know them I I'm Nick CEO at Celestial Labs by the way um but yeah why don't we do a round of intros Kelvin why don't you start sure okay hi um I'm Kelvin hope people can hear me properly yet seems like it's working um Calvin also smart contracts on various different platforms and um been been working on player two stuff for a long time now originally with plasma and then obviously with optimistic Roll-Ups um in the optimism sphere um yeah originally did a lot of engineering now moving into more sort of Deborah Lee stuff so a lot of fun cool John togro hey everyone I'm John I'm one of the co-founders over at DBA um primarily infrastructure broadly focused research and investing uh mostly spend my time writing about Roll-Ups and posting names about them hello my name is tall girl I do research at scroll I mostly focused on the protocol sides of the bridge design incentive decentralization stuff like that I you probably can see me posting on Twitter quite a lot that's what I mostly do at my job awesome um yeah a lot a lot of posting uh that's what this group is is really uh that's the the true full-time job um so to start things off I wanted to just frame the debate and get everyone's sort of like Baseline like position and and like establish the context for for the audience so uh what is this we'll do Roll-Ups equal Bridges debate about can someone kind of summarize it assuming that people have some baseline knowledge of the various like components so we don't have to like Define everything from scratch does someone want to take a stab sure I can I can take a stab at this um I mean I think everyone kind of has a different perspective on like what even the debate is and so I think that's part of part of what we need what we kind of need to figure out here um I think from from the perspective that John and I have been coming at this it's essentially looking at the way that that people think about Roll-Ups today and acknowledging that there are certain Dynamics Within that structure that aren't typically talked about right that we kind of we kind of ignore we kind of say our our you know we kind of uh hand wave away a little bit by saying that that they're not particularly important and you know and and we have this sort of concept of The Sovereign roll-up and the roll-up roll-up and and I think that there's uh there is a little bit of confusion about what these things are and how they differ and and I think the stance uh that the sort of roll up does not equal Bridge uh side takes is that there's this sort of there is this spectrum on which these systems operate and the delineation is not as as clean as maybe we we sort of historically would have thought um and and that a lot of that perspective comes from the history of how these systems were built and which systems came first and all these different things but now you know we're kind of looking at this we're trying to look at this in a little bit of a deeper sense and say well what are the actual Dynamics happening under the hood like what could happen what is happening how do we expect these systems to work in the future John hello do you guys have anything to add yeah second that um yeah like the kind of what a lot of it comes down to um is like we think of today's smart contract Roll-Ups versus like the extreme other end of sovereign Roll-Ups is these like completely distinct far ends of the spectrum and it's like it's one or the other um and they have like completely different properties and while that like makes sense in the practical sense because like we're used to thinking about solving Roll-Ups as this like complete other end of the spectrum kind of like idea that doesn't even really exist yet um as opposed to Smart contract roles where they are very much today on like that very far end of the spectrum where it's like honestly a pretty good description to say that like the bridge defines the roll-up and like at least in the practical sense of like when we're looking at the two biggest Roll-Ups today like yeah the bridge is basically all that matters um because without the bridge uh like those roles today are completely reliant on it um but trying to like actually pull that apart because the reality is like it's a lot Messier um and there is very much a spectrum between those two things and like I think the very practical reality is that um in the not so distant future it's not going to be okay you're on this one at far end of the spectrum or the other far end of the spectrum um like we have to understand like the interplay of those different things because like I think a lot of us have a general idea of like a general notion of what Roll-Ups give us what this inheriting security trust minimizing bridging and so on um but like a lot of our understandings of like fundamentally where those things come from is like often Incorrect and like honestly hard to kind of pin down um so understanding where they actually come from um as we think about designing these going forward when the system as well just from a practical perspective potential audit is very important I feel like uh if we remove the social consensus out of the question the delineation between what I call Classic Roll-Ups and software and Roll-Ups because it becomes much more clear the problem is that we don't really have a concrete definition of what social consensus is you can use multiple different versions Define it in multiple ways and so I don't like involving social consensus in the definite in the concrete definitions of things because if you involve social consensus you can always say that nothing that we we're using right now is actually concrete because everything can be changed based on the social consensus and so basically the entire field that we have spent the last 15 years building all the knowledge that we've been building is worth nothing because at the end of the day it's all social consensus okay so I'm hearing a lot of different things one is that the delineation or definition between Sovereign Roll-Ups and what we call Smart contract Roll-Ups is not quite as clear as like we we once thought and maybe there's that maybe the the boundaries like really fuzzy um and then John is also saying that the like Roll-Ups today are very dependent on the bridge potentially but that doesn't mean that it will always be the case uh and I think there's a lot to unpack there in terms of like what does it mean to be dependent on a bridge like what does that enshrined contract like provide or not provide and then Togo's getting to the aspect of like you know social consensus and and forking as as one of the mechanisms that defines sovereignty but then when you define like that's that's something that is like itself so just like inherent that like maybe that's not like using that to food make a definition doesn't really is not useful um so I think that's at least kind of what I'm taking away from what you guys are saying so far and we'll definitely dig in a little bit more but I'm curious why you guys think this debate debate matters like why are people so uh I don't know like triggered by this and like well why do you guys care so much about like debating it like what what is that stake in this conversation I mean from from my perspective this has always been you know I'm I'm coming at this from the perspective of someone building one of these systems and for me it's just about understanding more deeply you know what what these systems are and how they might behave um yeah I think I you know I think there's an argument to be made about how how this um how this impacts sort of the user's ability to make decisions Within These systems um but but in a lot of ways it's kind of for me and for other system designers where I want people to you know we we want to be realistic about the Practical reality but we also want to be sort of rigorous about the the fundamental reality and you know those those abstractions those practical abstractions are very important um but we you know we can't ignore the more fundamental reality so I mean John also feels strongly about this from a user perspective so I'll I'll give it to John for that yeah it's definitely a mix of a lot of things I mean like a lot of the pushback from people understandably it's like oh this is semantics um to which my reply is probably uh it kind of is semantics but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing um quite frankly like if like we're fumbling around at kind of what these things even fundamentally are and like where exactly a lot of these properties come from that we're talking about like where does the security come from like where like where is the social consensus in this thing like where does it matter um like that has a lot of very practical implications for what we're building and how people end up interacting with them um like I I think of a lot of what we need to just kind of level set on it's like there's you know a handful of 50 to 100 people who say like oh like all of this is intuitive um so like I like I don't need a betterment model and like for those 50 to 100 people who are building these systems like yeah I mean like most of them are not going to understand Roll-Ups better by reading at like a technical level like anything that I wrote um a lot of it is just like fundamentally rethinking though like what are the important things here and like how do we communicate them and how do we build in reflection of that and like even amongst the like quote-unquote experts like it's impossible to keep up with this how constantly and changing it is I mean like the simple example being like this new kind of definition of sovereign like not something I redefined it as just like the way that we initially thought of stop and rollups was like okay there's no interim bridge and like that means you know that like you can Fork it whenever you but you can't have a trust metabized Bridge like once you have a trust metamide it's bridged with another chain like it's not sovereign anymore um but as we've seen for example like with like the great posts like Sovereign Labs has had I was like there's kind of these different Notions of sovereignty um the like technical like more like source of Truth kind of notion of sovereignty versus like this practical like social ability um to Fork the chain like those are very different like rapidly evolving things that like even when I talk to people who are building roles today we're like are not aware of that delineation um and like that does have meaningful implications I'm like a very practical and Technical level of like how do we build these things like does the user source of Truth need to be just like I write an ethereum full node and I look at the bridge or is it reasonable to distribute P2P first and like they can perceive faster find out even from a Litecoin perspective um and then the bridge can just finalize it later like that is like a very meaningful Technical and practical different way to build the system and reflection of the fact that like we're understanding that the bridge is not the only like source of Truth in the world um so like that fundamental just framing is like very important on like a very direct and practical level um and a lot of it is also just what I was saying of like none of this is intuitive and I think all of us can get a lot better at like just explaining to the other 99.9 of people how this stuff works because like that is very practical user implications I mean like the simple example being of like one that I wrote about on like usdc which like I think a lot of people understandably like get confused on um and like bartek had a poll on it like had a bunch of amazing threads that like described it very well um but I also I mean like similarly in that pain like it is confusing like I talked to a number of other people who are like experts who are building infrastructure projects in crypto and like ask them out of curiosity like what do you think is safer uh like native usdc um on a roll-up or the bridged version from the L1 and get a variety of different answers and confusion on that and like it's not intuitive like what happens if I have a native asset on the L2 that like you know I burn it there or I lock it like I meant it somewhere else like the none of that stuff is intuitive and like when we frame everything through this notion of the bridge like it gives very clear implications to people who don't understand these things well um understandably that like we're going to come up with like incorrect oceans like one of the very simple examples is um if like we keep saying that like the bridge is basically this like source of truth that's the only way that you've got security like the implications from that that I very commonly see is that people often still don't understand that like Sovereign Roll-Ups are like they can absolutely be secure and like I very frequently see like oh like the operator can just take all of your money because there's no Bridge contracts that like enforces things which is just fundamentally not true um so like it's a mix of for ourselves from the designer perspective of like fundamentally understanding them and then also a mix of like how do we communicate these things better because I think a lot of this is very confusing the way that we're describing it yeah I strongly agree I mean I think that uh to both of you guys points as people who are building in the modular stack uh it's important that we have the right mental models to know how these systems behave as Kelvin said and that informs the way that we will like the kind of things that we'll build and we'll build for um and uh and then also kind of to your point John like the the broader perception of how Roll-Ups work uh you know is is may not be accurate because it kind of started From A like sort of a different perspective in light of sort of like the new way that we're viewing things users need to be more informed uh basically of the security or the trade-offs are like what what can actually happen or how roles really work October I'm curious to hear your perspective on why this debate matters for me it matters because of the preciseness of the terminology like we've been throwing all of us have been throwing around a lot of words like trustless decentralized trust minimized whatever and I I can bet if you put 20 roll-up researchers in one room and ask them for a definition of roll up what a roll-up is none of them will agree on the definition and that's how basically we don't even agree on the fundamentals so alone on like specific details of how things are implemented Etc and so it's difficult for a user to understand what the security properties of a certain protocol is or or a family of protocols where when even the people who are working on it can't agree on what the security properties are and so this debate is important for us to understand that so we can standardize what we communicate and then it's much easier for the user to see oh yeah it's a roll up with this this this assumptions or like oh this is uh validium that uses these assumptions for this particular property and stuff like that yeah it's it's kind of frustrating when the definitions of things keep changing uh out from under us and uh it definitely seemed for Sovereign Roll-Ups that's something that has been sort of Shifting over time um so John you mentioned something about the difference between technical sovereignty and social sovereignty um and I know that that you mentioned that in your post I mean that that sort of like idea originally sort of with like Mustafa and and probably Preston from Sovereign Labs but I think you articulated well I I think that's a really important point to get across because it kind of delineates between this idea of like social consensus versus like the the source of Truth for how people are actually able to get the latest like secure state from the roll up so could you maybe explain a bit about that yeah happy too and and this is part of the reason why for what it's worth I like I'm doubtful of us having these like canonical definitions that are going to stick is because of this is the perfect example of like our understanding of these systems is fundamentally just constantly changing and we're coming up with new ideas and new constructs that will just fundamentally change like how we think about these systems um so the simple example of that is like what I was starting to describe a little bit before is like um there's different these different kind of Notions of what solvent d means so there's this delineation kind of now between like technical sovereignty and social sovereignty where the technical sovereignty is referring more to like where do users get the quote-unquote like source of truth of like what is the canonical chain is this valid Etc um and the expectation today in ethereum Roll-Ups is that okay if you know take a CK roll-up um we're posting ZK proofs and we post them to the bridge so the assumption is like if I'm running an ethereum full node like embedded within that is a Lifeline of the roll-up which is the bridge it checks that proof so now I know I've implicitly like I have verified um the roll-up and you know this bridge is checking the four Choice rule it's enforcing censorship resistance like I could send my transaction to the arbitrum inbox contracts and like it will enforce that I get included if I'm getting censored Etc um but you can get the source of Truth in a different manner so the example of like what Sovereign Labs has been posting like that they're thinking about doing is okay like it's expensive to post these proofs and verify them on chain so why don't we just like generate them in real time and distribute them P2P to like clients and now the like the source of Truth is no longer the bridge for um these role of users I can run a roll-up light client get a proof and I'm good to go um and like it fundamentally changes how you have to build these things because like usually the bridge is also it's enforcing the four Choice rule it's enforcing the censorship resistance in the way that like as I mentioned with arbitrim's inbox contract like we're you know we're showing that hey like this this transaction was submitted we're going to force to include it even if the sequencer didn't want to um so they're going to have their BK Bruce built in a different manner here such that like okay we're proving that we scanned the da layer and like we looked for transactions that are eligible to force include and we're proving that like we've included this and therefore like we follow the four Choice room like we Implement that and prove it directly within the proof so I don't need the bridge anymore but at the same time we can still have a bridge contract and then like we'll post proofs later and batch the interview once in a while when we need to settle to the bridge in the bridge also gets finality um but that's as I mentioned expensive to do that on chain so we only do that periodically if you're changing is like fundamentally we can still have this bridge but you know there's a different source of Truth to the users and we built the proofs in like a different manner to reflect that um the more traditional notion of like sovereignty that we think about is this like ability to fork and that's the kind of like social sovereignty um and the thing here is like this is also kind of like a practical Spectrum again where we think of it as like okay if this roll-up has an official Bridge well that means you're not sovereign if you don't have this bridge that means you're Sovereign and you can socially Fork whenever you want um but again the reality of that is like very practical and fuzzy um you could take the simple example of like I've given like a social media application of like let's say there's like barely any money in the bridge and like all the valuable state is user data um in that case like you probably can Fork away from the bridge if like the governance token holders are getting greedy and they're extracting right and all the users say like screw this we're gonna make another roll-up you know we read over the data there's barely any money in the bridge we don't care about it we force the thrall so like they have that social ability to fork in that case um even though they have the bridge well on the other side you could have a sovereign like quote unquote in the traditional definition where like there is no official bridge but what if there's a bunch of usdc on the Chain that's natively deployed and usdc doesn't want to go along with work that they go along with well that's you're imposing the same cost on that of like if we Fork away from this and the majority of our value is native USBC like obviously your practical social sovereignty has gone down so is this like quote unquote Sovereign role more Sovereign than the smart contract role I just described because it doesn't have a bridge uh like I I would certainly argue no because like you're clearly imposing like a much higher practical cost to socially fork and as a result like it's completely infeasible to do so most likely um so understanding that like there are these very different Notions and they're very much a spectrum and like it's not this always clear black and white between like what is Sovereign and what isn't particularly from the social perspective um and then also on the like the technical sovereignty perspective again like that has very direct Technical and practical implications of how we build these systems in light of thinking about like what does the bridge actually provide us um so all of that is looking very fundamentally important to understand yeah I mean it's it seems like there's a very clean like technical definition of sovereignty like a sovereign World versus a smart contract roll-up um but then as soon as you start to consider the social dimension of it it all of a sudden gets very gray you know where sure you may not have it quote enshrine the bridge you know uh into like the source of truth of your chain but then the fact that you have if you let's say you do have a bridge with another chain you are in some sense giving up your sovereignty because you either if you want that bridge to be trust minimized you know when you Fork you're gonna have to like basically sacrifice those assets and it causes a lot it increases the cost of actually forking so it does in some sense decrease your sovereignty so then it's like all right then you roll up like is the only role that can be solver and one in which there are no Bridges um and so we should just like give up uh on on the idea of software roles because it's never going to be practical or uh or not and like I I'm curious Kelvin or like how do you guys see this do you think there's like a attention here do you think that the definition is clear or is it just fuzzy inherently I feel like as soon as you bring up Social consensus it inherently becomes fuzzy so for example even in this example this example of oh yeah it's Sovereign because if the most the majority of your assets are on the L2 you can just Fork away only works if you assume that all those assets all those token holders that are uh that are native to Dale to agree with the fork but let's say what if I have an nft collection on an L2 that derives most of its value from the fact that there's a trust minimized Bridge with ethereum that is as soon as you forget my value drops so I won't support it so I will accept the previous Fork so the canonical chain that has the trust minimized Bridge as the one that my collection is going to support and you can come up with a lot of examples like that and in that case basically the social consensus of the protocol is completely different from the social consensus of the tokens that are deployed on top of uh that particular L2 which means that the value doesn't really matter though much it's just about who agrees with you and who know who doesn't and at the same time you can always bring up Social consensus so for example is a software envelope not a roll up because I can Fork the role up and add a transaction in the middle of the finalized batches that has never been submitted on chain does that mean that the current version of my server envelope is not actually a roll-up because from the definition of the roll up I can't really reconstruct the state because one of the transactions doesn't have they don't change it's just a question of do we consider like a hypothetical scenario in which you can fork and create something else does that have an impact on the definition that we currently operate in or do we just like chalk it off the social consensus and basically social consensus can do whatever it wants in crypto or to be fair any in any single I mean one one response to this is essentially that I I don't think you can just ignore social consensus like social consensus is a real thing it exists it's like how we Fork blockchains but it's also real in the world in general right like many things are essentially just social constructions the example I gave in my blog post was was coke like Coca-Cola right in the 1950s there's some recipe for Coca-Cola then in the 80s they try to turn it into New Coke and and social consensus basically says Nope New Coke is not close enough to still be called Coke so we're not going to accept it and then today you have like a different recipe of Coca-Cola which has high fructose corn syrup in it instead of instead of cane sugar and whatever instead of instead of cocaine in it and we still call this thing Coke right we still say like when I if I go out to a to a to a bodega and I like get a can of Coke I'm not like this isn't real coke because it's not from the like I could say that I could say like oh the only real coke was the first the first recipe that was ever created and and like I could say that forever but it's a pedantic point and everyone's basically just gonna say that doesn't make any sense I think this is real coke and on the other side of this is also that I I think this starts to get at like fundamentally what we're trying to do with these blockchains I think people often take this stance that somehow these systems are like as fundamental as physics and the reality is what these systems are they're all approximations of social constructions that we've created for efficiency purposes right and the simpler the social construction is the simpler the the the process of of approximating that social construction as code is and the less likely that you have a split is but the more complex the the social construction the harder it is to reflect as code and and at the end of the day these systems are not these like arbitrary things that we've created to enforce technology onto people they are constructed explicitly to to simplify the process of enforcing some or describing some social construction as code right and we and we understand that you can get efficiency gains that way but we can't just say that like social consensus doesn't exist I think that if you if you take that stance then of course you can have this very black and white View but fundamentally social consensus always exists and and what we want to look at is is what are the different power dynamics within the social consensus process that might lead to one result or another yeah but my argument isn't that you can just you should just ignore social consensus obviously social consensus is there and it'll always be there it's just a question of should it impact our concrete definitions because you can apply the same thing the same social consensus argument to literally anything or so do the cryptographic properties of signatures matter oh no because we can just ignore those signatures so yeah there are no cryptographic Properties or like does a certain consensus mechanism have finality guarantees oh no it doesn't matter because we can just the social consensus can just ignore those properties and that's my argument here it's not that social consensus doesn't exist or it should be completely ignored but my argument is that it shouldn't impact the concrete definitions that we use to define things the the Counterpoint here is essentially that that we we should look at this in a more rigorous way and look at the Spectrum along Which social consensus operates right if you have a system where all of the economic value on the system is entirely bridged assets then you understand that to Fork that system you would be forfeiting the value of all these assets so there's this massive cost to any fork and so we understand that the bridge has an enormous amount of power within that sort of system if if on the other side of the spectrum you have a system where there's a tiny Bridge it's trustless it's whatever right you know it's a standard like ethereum roll-up setup but it's a tiny bridge and it only has one usdc worth of something in it then to Fork that system we're not forfeiting very much at all and so that bridge doesn't have as much power over the over the over the the social consensus process of of the roll-up and the point being made is that you is that I don't think you could say that there is an extreme on one end or the other where on one extreme you can you can completely ignore social consensus and On The Other Extreme you completely ignore the bridge the reality is that there's always this sort of Middle Ground where this power dynamic between the bridge and other actors within the system is is constantly changing the point is that having uh the majority of the assets native tool to doesn't mean that those the social consensus of those assets will agree with the fork let's see if the protocol users will agree the token holders of a certain token might not agree or usdc might not agree or something chain link why not agree and so it's difficult to quantify how easy it would be to Fork only based on the value of the assets deployed and on top of that we are completely ignoring arbitrary messages so for example if let's say a certain L1 governance protocol uh governance on a certain protocol depend is being done on the L2 it completely depends on the LT for certain things to be upgraded or whatever or certain parameters to be changed will those people agree with the fork or no we also have to put value on that yeah I'm not saying that that that immediately assets on L2 become distinct from the social consensus pressure of the bridge either classes of assets like the the the the launch of native usdc on arbitrum yesterday is a very is a very like clear example of an asset class where it is very distinct from the bridge that's not to say that the bridge you know that usdc doesn't have a massive incentive a sort of reputational incentive to follow the arbitrum bridge assuming the arbitrary bridge is making sort of uh you know good quote good upgrades to the system but if if there were some catastrophic event where all of a sudden the arbitrary Bridge makes a you know changes the state transition function so that usdc can just be minted arbitrarily there's pretty much no chance that circle is going to follow that fork and just allow people to redeem usdc arbitrarily they're going to make the decision to follow the version of the system where that's not the case so it's not to say that there that automatically assets on the L2 are independent from the bridge but that we can't just ignore the like we just have to look at the power dynamics and this is going to be very unique to each individual system kit can I uh you know interject for a second well first of all um I I want to say that I do believe you know layer zero is social consensus and that's something that at least uh within the celestial Community we say all the time and so I I very much agree with with kelvin's point that you know blockchains are a tool to automate and sort of encode what we've agreed on Via social consensus and so we can always no matter what system you build you could like the root you can always go back to the root uh you know and and change things by just getting people together and and deciding to to Fork um but I also see you know Togo's side as well and and someone who articulated this uh you know I think pretty well Kobe I think said this first and then uh dank red kind of followed up with a similar tweet but they basically said like oh you've been lied to you know all erc20 contracts are actually like Sovereign and like you know they can be forked at any time um and so I guess that that kind of touches on the the idea of like you know it does it become absurd at some point to keep you know saying that oh well everything comes down to social consensus at the end of the day so therefore everything is forkable like where where does that where do we go like too far in that line of reasoning I I don't think there's ever a point where where it's absurd like I I saw those tweets and I thought it was funny because the reality is it you know if you wanted to Fork one of these systems like if you wanted to Fork an erc20 like the code is still there but the value and the social capital that's sort of attached to the name of that token can easily be maybe not easily right but but can be transferred to another another contract and I like we have to understand that there are there are clear power dynamics and we should we should be we shouldn't lie to ourselves and say that the bridge has less power than than it does I mean I think today within within the major Roll-Ups the bridge has an enormous amount of power uh that that probably overpowers anybody else within the system but just by the nature of these systems and by the fact that you can start to create value that is truly independent from the bridge and and sort of the threat that the bridge has to to delete its native assets from your chain it it's I don't think it's absurd at all to to to to say that the that those power dynamics will shift for a lot of these systems right the the usdc thing is is a shift in the power dynamics uh within arbitrome and I assume will be the same with other systems and and as time goes on there will be other systems that just out out the gate already have these power dynamics that are very different and and don't fit neatly into one side or the other and it has like very practical and tangible um examples like we can see why this matters and like why people need to understand like what social consensus and security assumptions am I opting into when I hold the given asset um and that is one of the things that is legitimately great about Roll-Ups is that like you can kind of pick and choose between these different assumptions um and like the one of the examples that I put in like the last post that I made um which like Patrick had pointed out it's like a great example to kind of show this um it's like Justin Sutton which is like it's kind of a funny example but like what like when he was holding like steam like during the steam steam Hive hard fork and like the chain just decided the hard Fork uh socially and just basically like delete all of his money um like that is something that you are opting into when you use a chain like that in that system that would fundamentally not be the case if you know you have that exact same scenario and Justin's son is holding a ton of eth on a roll-up and it's locked in the bridge or that's locked in the bridge and like that's collateral realizing some other position he has on the roll up then you are not subjecting yourself to any external consensus but you get to operate in that environment um because the roll-up could want to take Justin's son's money in this example and there's nothing they could do because he has his money in the bridge and he is only signing up for the social consensus of ethereum social consensus of ethereum wants to fork and you know delete all of his money in the bridge they could do that but you may not want to subject yourself to an additional social consensus and like that is like a fundamentally important trade-off that like people need to be able to understand and pick and choose between like there are often times where you will not want to subject yourself to that kind of social consensus or at minimum like you have uh like a real Pro like due process and like the sense of like an on-chain governance that you know that you're signing up for of this is what can happen to my assets if I do X like this is the process that I'm going to be subject to like that like has very meaningful and direct implications we have a cameo speaker who just showed up and I'm excited to have on the mic James prestwich who has been chiming in on the debate and Twitter and also just I mean even before this week in the past I've had a lot of conversations about this topic and I think he has a really good point of view and particularly one of the things that I wanted to talk about was he had a tweet about basically you know why he thinks um this topic is so controversial which we we did touch on a little bit earlier um but basically uh James was saying that uh he asked some like fundamental questions that I would love to get his take on um and he said you know the questions are essentially like do Roll-Ups actually scale the underlying L1 or are they you know just a separate chain um like what does an ideal data availability layer look like and uh do do Roll-Ups actually inherit security from the underlying one I think these are very spicy questions because um yeah they they change the way that we perceive Roll-Ups and the relationship to the underlying like blockchain they're built on James you want to like jump in here and actually explain your perspective on all this stuff uh yeah no problem uh have you know really quick answers for each of those three points uh one is Jersey doesn't scale New York even though the bridges exist two is nobody's ever asked what an ideal data availability system is except you know to some extent Celestia eigenlayer the current Dialogue on rollups is a consequence of asking that question and for number three inherit is deliberately chosen to imply a paternalistic relationship it makes the roll up subordinates to the host uh it is much better to say that the roll-up rents data availability uh or buys data availability the rollup has the same relationship to the host as any other smart contract you wouldn't say that uniswap inherits from ethereum uh the roll-up Bridge is the roll-up is buying data availability the rollup bridge is buying gas with which to verify the role of State transition to serve users foreign yeah so a couple of things so one do we actually have a concrete definition of scaling because I've heard quite a few versions and I'm not sure if we actually have it luckily I have a long history of defining my terms uh uh I I remember your definition of scaling but I'm not sure if I agree with it ah uh uh well then I guess if you're saying up front that you don't agree with it then the answer is no you already know we don't have a agreed definition of scaling I I I I just meant to ask whether there's a consensus on whether your definition is correct or not um I have actually not seen anyone else offer a definition of scaling uh so yeah that's a good point like people use it quite freely and don't really Define it concrete well this goes back to my point about inherit people don't Define what it means to inherit security they chose the word for the sense that it creates of a you know hierarchical you know paternal family relationship they didn't Define what inherited security is the same way people saying that Roll-Ups scale ethereum did not Define what scaling is fair so with regards to scaling uh you gave an example of Jersey in New York but another example would be building a new District in a city that would be scaling of a city so it depends on what example you pick here and I feel like uh with regards to scaling I I would Define scale well one thing I wanted to just say James I really liked about your third point of you know uh inherent I actually never thought I never really kind of realized that paternalistic implication of of that like using that phrase um but like it really does your point really aligns with what like within the Celestia Community we've been saying for a long time which is like you know even this even when you say L1 and L2 you know it kind of implies like this relationship of like you know one chain being the more fundamental or more important um you know of the two and in general like you know I feel like that's something that's Celestia has been trying to push against like this idea that Roll-Ups are baby chains right that's why we've been beating the drum about Sovereign roles for so long is like to us and like you know for a long time this is very contrarian we would we were saying like Roll-Ups are their own blockchains and their own right they're not just some extension of an underlying system uh at least they don't have to be um and like that's so important because like you know again tying together kelvin's whole point about social consensus like social consensus is such a huge part of you know what blockchains are and what makes them powerful and without sovereignty if you're if your roll up gives up sovereignty then like it's not really a true blockchain and so it's not as useful and so like even the cosmos Community would say like oh I don't want to build a roll-up because like then I'm not a sovereign chain I'm like no it's just as Sovereign as like your you know your Cosmos zone so anyway like I I really I really strongly agree with that Roll-Ups are really interesting to talk about because no other category of blockchain has this you know service provider relationship that Roll-Ups do with their host um you know I really don't like phrasing it as inherit but we should look at this as like the roll-up is buying from the da host uh and the service provider relationship is not a like hierarchical tiered layer one layer two relationship uh but it is like very interesting and it is fundamental to what Roll-Ups are yeah it's kind of like you know like a smart contract is a smart contract inheriting security from ethereum or is it just kind of like you know when you you pay gas you're you're paying for ethereum to scale to secure the smart contract I would say it does inherit like uh you're paying to to get some certain properties in return and that's the same with the roll up I'm paying the cost of publishing the batch to get certain guarantees in return for that I don't think so I I paid for an inheritance uh uh yeah okay uh but you do pay taxes uh anyway I don't think we need to like you know talk about I I I don't even have to like go into the details about like the definition of inherent or whatever um John and and uh Kelvin yeah sorry to talk over you guys John and Calvin um definitions are critical to what we're doing if you can't Define the term you can't understand what's going on uh semantics is the purpose of having these discussions true one small thing I um no oh come on whatever go ahead all right I'll I'll go quickly I mean I I fully agree with a lot a lot of this I think that I think we need to take the opportunity to to look at the properties and kind of step away from definitions and just just look very clearly at the properties sort of abstracted from the definitions like it's it's fully correct to say that that what Roll-Ups are doing and and what is interesting about Roll-Ups is that they are buying these properties right ordering and and possibly also data availability from another consensus mechanism and that's and that's that is a valuable thing because consensus is hard and consensus is annoying and if you can rely on another system right that's it it is a valuable thing to have but just practically looking at what that gives you that gives you ordering that gives you data availability does that you know when you say it inherits security what are what are you really saying are you saying I think I think when we say that word or we say that phrase there's this sort of implication that the the sort of value of the assets or the information on on these systems is is inherently also you know as secure as what what you would expect on on the parent chain and and that's not true by default and and so you kind of need to like I I really strongly just agree with this this statement but I I wanna I think there's like a really important opportunity just to talk and spend some time reviewing The observed properties and then and then you know over the next couple months trying to come up with new definitions that really clearly describe the observed properties rather than what has happened which is that the definitions came for the words came first and we kind of observed the properties afterwards yeah one like small thing I would add on this kind of conversation because I do think it is very important um there's kind of like relativistic or paternalistic type relationship um and like tying that to what we actually observe which like can be fuzzy at times but I think we practically can't observe I mean like this is the simple reason why I use the words L1 and L2 in the way that I did um in the post of not saying it's the perfect definition but at least for me I think it was like actually very helpful in framing the way that I'm thinking about these things um like more or less using those kind of terms is like what is The Ledger of record for this given asset whether it's usdc it's ethereum teeth uh it's optimism Etc um like that is an important relationship to understand like is very observable in that like five bridged eth on optimism like I think we can all agree it's quite observable that the value of that is tied to the fact that there's some ethereum blocked in the bridge on the L1 if the bridge gets hacked on that roll-up and all the eth disappears like I think we can pretty confidently say like the value of that bridged eth is going to go down a lot because now it's completely under collateralized like people were holding that thing in recognition of the fact that I have this if underlying it and like that is what derives its value from um so like that's why I used like the L1 and L2 and like these very relativistic ways in which like a chain could be an L1 and L2 like kind of simultaneously like people can modify the definition you use it however um but like it does capture that like very relativistic relationship where is ethereum like really an L1 or a roll-up really an L1 for Native usdc that is deployed on that chain if like we all have the very clear and measurable understanding that this thing has value because Circle has some dollars in the bank account and they say my coin has value if Circle decides that never mind we're not going to honor this thing anymore and like the you're not getting your money back from the bank account the value of that asset is going to go to zero um like that is like a very clear and important like relativistic relationship to like under just like just to understand like what is the relative like power between these different chains like who are we trusting in these different relationships it's not necessarily the perfect like way to frame them or anything um but just like understanding that relationship between all these different entities that are all interacting with each other like is fundamentally important to understand yeah I feel like it's not quite correct to Define little ones and l2s from the perspective of the assets because the definitions used before like for example in Patrick's paper uh from 2019 on layer to use the definition was more from the perspective of the L1 and the same applies for l2b so l2b defines Delta Layer Two from the perspective on of an L1 so essentially you can have an asset that is natively deployed on an L2 but it's still an L2 because you can essentially run an L1 full node and be ensured that the LT is running correctly assuming that the proof system works correctly of course so that's an additional assumption and that's why we call them trust minimized but it's it's difficult to define a given asset based on whether it's native or not because there are a lot of things uh that play a role here so for example what if my L2 asset is locked and requires a message from the L1 to be unlocked but it's still native to L2 do we consider that to be an L1 or is that an L2 I I don't want to push back on that um uh proof oriented uh look at security the L1 can never know whether the proof system is working correctly because it does not know the state that is that the proof system reports to prove it can know that some subset of the state conforms to the approved system or it can know that the proof system has halted but it cannot know whether the proof system corresponds to the entire roll-up state uh and therefore you cannot have that guarantee that the roll-up is functioning correctly you can have some level of confidence about some portion of the roll-up state yeah I think another important Point here is that this is this is always from the perspective of an observer who chooses a particular State transition function right you can say you do not you don't have Universal I think like an important Point here is that is that you know these things are not absolute when we're talking about what is the real op mainnet what is the real arbitrum we're talking about the sort of social thing that we've created and and and people could Fork off and say that okay now this is the real arbitrum but somebody the the bridge what the bridge gives you is is a view of a particular State transition function and that state transition function may not be the quote real arbitrum in the sense that it's not the thing that everybody in the world is calling arbitrum but it's it it is a specific State transition function uh but it's not Universal right you can't say that the bridge gives you Universal access to the thing called arbitrum and it will always be the case that what the bridge reflects is the thing that we socially refer to as arbitrum that's just not true it could be it could very well be the case that the thing that we socially refer to as arbitrum is completely different than than what the bridge observes well neither does your full node on full node either you just don't know which other Fork exists back then but you you are aware of the specific state of a specific Fork that doesn't mean that every single participant of the social consensus agrees that that's the canonical Fork show the same argument applies here yeah yeah exactly but but I just wanted to push back against the sense that that you you have trustless access to by running an L1 node you have trustless access to the thing that we socially refer to as X Y or Z right you have you have access to to enforcement over a particular State transition function so um I wanna I I like this sort of like line of conversation but I want to tie things back a little bit more to like real real systems uh and I think you know we are getting closer to the end of our time um and specifically one of the questions I wanted to like revisit was this question of like what does an ideal da layer look like because you know for a long obviously this is something that is a question that's very close to our hearts at Celestia and something that we've thought about very deeply and you know one of the major design decisions of Celestia from the early days is to not include settlement so there is no smart contract environment there is no way to you know have an enshrined Bridge with Celestia uh at the moment and you know we felt strongly that was the right decision because it just didn't seem like settlement was something that was uh it was like a nice to have but not a must-have and the the overhead of adding execution to the underlying da you know ads or adds overhead to every you know roll up that wants to use it um and so it was just like not worth it like going more minimal was really the right approach in our minds so I'm curious uh and and we get used to get a lot of I would say like criticism for that they're like oh well there's no way to settle on Celestia so it's like unusable or you know what I mean and so um I'm curious if this debate sort of shifts that perspective for interviewer like what what do you think uh the ideal da layer actually looks like and does is settlement a big part of that or is it not as important I want to open up that conversation I feel like it depends on a specific use case so for ethereum the a layer is specifically added to make the cost of publishing the data for the Roll-Ups that are approaching to the underlying layer cheaper whereas from before Celestia for example the the whole idea of Da is used for a different reason it's it's used to provide it's basically used to provide some guarantees to to the chains that don't want to bootstrap all their security from the ground up so I like to use this example and I know James is going to push back on this is that Roll-Ups on ethereum are deployed to scale ethereum whereas uh on um on Celestia the Roll-Ups are deployed in order to borrow some security from Celestia so the use cases are a bit different I mostly agree with that actually um like I I do think it's use case dependent I mean like there's obviously certain technical properties of like yeah you want a lot of data availability ideally validity approval or if you're encoding you know Etc like that you know things quickly censorships isn't all that kind of stuff um but like the Practical reality is yeah like different Roll-Ups have different needs and they will want an optimize for different things um if your roll up explicitly wants hey we want to tap into all of the users of ethereum and we have all these users that want to use eth in a different place in a trust minimized way um well then the way that ethereum works is great for them if someone has no concern for the base layer assets at all and like don't care about tapping into users and liquidity then yeah they like there's no reason for them to have another settlement layer there um whatever that means um that is just like adding overhead or clogging up the chain or anything like that um like it's just not useful to them so like for different in use cases they're going to optimize probably for potentially like different things when talking about eth is a good da layer we always come back to this implicit assumption that users will want trust minimized Bridges not just Bridges but trust minimized Bridges this is the you know distinguishing factor for ethereum compared to other da environments um and I don't know if that assumption holds I think that the majority of users have expressed a preference for non-trust minimized Bridges and that's likely to continue being the case going forward I think that cctp is going to be a much more important Bridge than the um you know optimism or arbitrum token Bridge from an ecosystem perspective and from a user perspective spicy Kelvin what's your take um yeah I mean it's interesting I mean there's there isn't obvious use to to these types of bridges um it is it is a unique property that you can have when you use ethereum as a data availability layer because you share access to the ordering and consensus um and and sort of the the practical use case is that you have you have pretty strong guarantees about bridged assets right that's like a valuable thing that you can have and and so you you have access to an enormous amount of of liquidity and users that already exist on ethereum um I as to whether or not people want these trust minimized Bridges I'm I'm I'm in the camp that there are plenty of institutional you know very risk-averse people who do want this and and for whom this is this is still not true right these bridges are still not good enough to to get this kind of movement between the systems but of course it is correct to say that that something like a like a native usdc Bridge starts to change that formula because you are sort of no longer reliant on on the bridge in this very direct way so an Institutional user is much more likely to choose circles cctp than it is to choose arbitrary or optimism token Bridge for uscc yes so I think we'll also I mean one one point to keep in mind here too is that like at least to date none of these like Bridges l1l2 bridges are trust minimized right like they all have I was about to say this yeah so maybe that's also except pov1 yeah exactly it's good to be one TM um yeah so go ahead oh sure no I was just saying it's difficult to say whether the users have voiced their preference or not because they're only they only trust minimized British that we currently have has eight dollars on it um it's a it's a payment only roll up so yeah once we have more established infrastructure that is actually trust minimized and it will be much easier to tell but right now we're just like it's just a guessing game at this point yeah I think that's very fair um and it's just an interesting thing I want to note at least uh related to Celestia is that like although we we currently do not have any way to support a trust minimized Bridge um to to any of the rollouts build on top of Celestia we had Mustafa posted an idea in our Forum recently about how we can actually bake that in a really State minimized way using um uh like ZK Roll-Ups and and having a verification op code on Celestia so anyway what's really interesting is that the the funny thing is that the motivation for doing that had nothing to do with providing settlement for like Roll-Ups built on top of Celestia but actually it's kind of the reverse is either we realized that there might be demand for a trust minimized bridge for the Celestia token up to the Roll-Ups and so it's funny because I I don't know just like the opposite of what you know people were complaining oh Celestia it's like you need settlement for the Roll-Ups but actually Celestia needs that capability more for itself in a sense so it's kind of like this ironic twist of fate in my view um I I again want to kind of like keep things on the topic of like the way that this idea these ideas will actually change the the systems that we build and we have and we're also kind of running up on time um so it's kind of like a last question uh we have you know togro from scroll and also Kelvin as part of the optimism team both building roll ups I'm curious you know in light of this debate on this conversation are you is there anything that you guys are going to change about the architecture of of your Roll-Ups that that you know potentially make them skew more more Sovereign like will there be peer-to-peer gossiping of fraud or validity proofs or just in general like what how does this change the way that you guys think about what you guys are building thank you Calvin do you want to go or should I go all right I'll go uh we've been discussing peer-to-peer propagation of proofs for quite a long time I'm not sure if there's a lot of benefit right now because it takes quite a quite a non-negligible amount of time to produce a proof right now so the benefits skewed towards Optimist technology because it makes more sense for them right now but I feel like at some point once the proof systems get efficient enough where uh where proofs can be propagated quite fast I feel like it would make sense to propagate the proofs prior to publishing them and verifying them on chain because then you can have stronger confirmation of chain confirmation than you you can get right now but but we're still quite a long way away from that being like necessary um yeah I mean I I don't think there's anything that I'm gonna change today uh with a lot of this stuff it's you know part of it obviously is you know op mainnet is the way it is and there are a lot of systems you know building on top of the op stack that are that are you know taking very similar making very similar assumptions and creating very similar architectures and relying on ethereum in this way um and and so for for those systems I'm more interested in just observing how how this shift of the Dynamics of social consensus happens over time but yeah I'm much more interested in this from the perspective of new potential systems that um that make completely different assumptions uh and and sort of the the the the space that you have available to you to design within that very fair yeah I mean I I I coming from but pretty much Celestia hat on essentially we really believe strongly that users should be like directly verifying chains and so to me you know that's why we push so hard on this idea of people running light nodes and making the the hardware requirements like extremely minimal and all that and so I I and I think part of that is like peer-to-peer fraud proofs I mean I guess it's not necessary but um I I personally find that model of like verifying in a peer-to-peer nature like just more like philosophically lined um so anyway I hope more Roll-Ups kind of move in that direction because I think a lot of the uh Roll-Ups to date have have been sort of based around this more smart contract model uh of security and sort of using that as a central point of their Network anyway um so I want to wrap things up uh I guess we can go around and everyone can give their you know final thoughts or takeaways or like last messages for the audience uh and like you know just tell us like what you think where things are at where should we go from here what are the most important things that you want people to take away from this conversation so for me I'll just quickly mention like some of the important like kind of up shots of this um one is obviously what you're talking about just like I mean at just a simple technical level like people kind of reevaluating what does it mean to really settle um in other words like how are we Distributing person like making different observers aware of that and realizing that like there is a different space that you can work in where you can distribute them P2P um you could post into a bridge you can have like multiple different chains which have a validating bridge that you're like quote unquote settling to there's all different kinds of contracts there um and then also the very kind of bigger things um relate to kind of like the just the change in kind of like power dynamics and how we think about this um in particular a lot of what like James was mentioning of seems highly likely that native usdc and cctp um something like that is going to probably grow like quite meaningfully and probably not even take like that long to do that and like that has meaningful implications of both on just like safety perspectives for users um but also just like who is actually controlling the different assets in these chains um and just like having a better understanding of like what influence does Circle have over a different role like what is like fundamentally the task of on-chain governance that is controlling this bridge like what are they actually tasked with and what power do they have versus like what is the social consensus like responsible for and like what opt out did they have in this system that's going to look very different in different systems um so just like understanding like the interplay and the actual responsibilities of different parties in those as new chains look very different it's just like a fundamentally important thing that like I think we need to think a lot about on that like kind of governance and social consensus level beautifully said James October uh for for me I think of I don't build roll ups uh I you know work on a bunch of different things in this space and all of these you know semantic arguments on Twitter are about truth seeking is if you're not going to evaluate and reevaluate your prior knowledge about Technical Systems as they evolve and progress and it's a dialogue in the space evolves you will not understand what is going on understanding roll ups is going to be critical to the next you have two three four five years of this space and if you get stuck in the Legacy understanding of Roll-Ups as a you know client state of another blockchain you're going to get very confused over the next couple years could not agree more Kelvin give us your closing thoughts yeah I just debates and Arguments for quite a long time especially since the space is progressing quite fast and every other week someone's coming up with some new idea on some new construction that changes the way we see things and so yeah it's just you're probably gonna hear us and see us arguing on Twitter for quite a long time against my only statement is you know live in Nuance understand nuanced reality and uh be comfortable with it nice some some real wisdom uh well thank you guys all for coming I mean there's still so much more to talk about and I think the the Twitter debates will continue and uh but ultimately you know what's great is that we can all disagree on certain aspects of this but the more we talk hopefully the the further and like refined these ideas become and the career they get and I really appreciate that you guys and a lot of other people have been engaging in this conversation and sharing your knowledge and advancing the conversation so thanks for for coming on and um yeah we'll see you on the twitterverse
