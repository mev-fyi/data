cool awesome um happy to be here with everyone um and with a few Cosmos ogs um today I kind of want to talk about the internet of modular blockchains uh setting the stage um in the past and talking about a little bit of history of Cosmos which I'm sure Ethan will be happy to do because he loves history only from the 16th century that's right so fast forwarding from the 16th century a little bit Cosmos came about somewhere around 2017 and set this vision for an internet of blockchains a feature that would Encompass thousands hundreds thousands millions of blockchains and to accomplish that they came up with the first modular framework for blockchains which is a composable suite of software Primitives and the cosmos SDK what's now common bft and IBC so that we can live in a world of millions of interoperable blockchains so what I'd like to do today is talk about the future of those three different components and how different New Primitives like data availability and what's going on at Celestia with separating consensus and execution fit into what was the original uh Cosmos vision of a modular future um maybe zucky if you don't mind talking about uh for a few moments uh the state of tenderment uh and where we see that fitting into this future comment Comet Comet Comet bft everyone um yeah absolutely so I guess the you know the like all right my my main thought process is so in a lot of ways this whole software stack was like designed in an integrated way with interoperability as like the end goal so we picked a consensus algorithm that had an efficient white client that didn't need a new Advanced cryptography techniques or New Advance like zero knowledge proofs or New cryptographic Primitives like BLS signatures all of which were not very mature at the time but would still give you uh high performance uh like clients and bridges but we're also starting to see sort of the uh and so you know we built the system um I think like I'm talking a little bit about lunch about how um you know we sort of it is a the system was built with Bitcoin as like its only real reference point so like how do you build a Next Generation system from Bitcoin now we've got a lot with like in like the Bitcoin was the Bitcoin was very much the inspiration uh we are now sort of way past that um in in so many ways and really seeing the limitations of that system it's been a big breakthrough getting uh ABC I plus plus out the door uh which was the first big change to the uh consensus API and is a system like no one else is offering so it you know it is interesting that we still are able to like push the limits of the possible uh on top of this stack but there there's a lot of work to be done and like you know where this stack you know like and what Ismail was talking about right uh you know the PD calculator was not expressive enough for to build Celestia so you had to build a Frankenstein of two P2P layers to build for uh uh Celestia and so as we kind of Advance towards the future I think we we're all gonna have to figure out um sort of where this software goes from here and uh how it sort of more or natively encompasses these different use cases thank you so continuing to like consider these pieces individually for the cosmos SDK do we need to consider alternative hosts for the SDK um and how do we 100x Cosmos uh with uh those Primitives yeah it you know want to call out Marco in his team who are doing great work on helping to expand the the cosmos SDK to help support more underlying data availability and other consensus algorithms that works extremely important and then on top of that also more VMS and you know when we talk about modular like this is what it means you want to be able to pull the pieces out plug new ones in and easily swap out those components and you know I think that the the sort of innovation of Celestia was making consensus breaking that down into different parts and like allowing those components to be swapped in and out and you know those that that does like require large changes to some of the software because I think when you're building something that's really easy to you know make assumptions and just like bake things in and um yeah it takes a little while to unwind that but a lot of that work's been done by the SDK team right now I think it's going to be a really interesting question to see like if the most value the most number of in in comet in the cosmos SDK is coming from common bft as a host or as role kid as those in like a year five years from now it's going to be a big I think that's like those sort of like one of the existential questions yeah so going back to kind of base later and security uh Ethan maybe you can touch on um kind of the merits of mesh security uh with uh all Cosmos blockchains uh that are IBC connected versus kind of data availability and consensus with uh Celestia and how those two are linked sure yeah I mean I think what's Happening Here is look we um we had to First create the inner chain right so we just stand up a bunch of I mean Once Upon a Time the multi-chain was a sort of uh you know Blasphemous idea we had to convince people proof of stake was going to work there could be many change that sovereignty mattered and and so on and that you know what we needed to do was sort of go bottom up build a general purpose interoperability protocol uh for these you know individual chains to start to connect to each other and now that we sort of have that we can start to explore the different ways to actually share security over that interchange that that now exists and so all of these sort of different solutions you know using accommodated availability later using things like mesh security or interchange security or so on there are all sort of different ways to explore you know different areas in the trade-off space for sharing security Over The Interchange right and I think the reality is we don't really know yet um how it's all going to shape out there's going to be some kind of you know complex uh uh you know arrangement of all of these different solutions and you know ideally chains will be able to sort of choose for themselves which ones they want to experiment with and if they're even able to experiment with multiple of them at the same time right so mesh security certainly uh you know holds forward a promise of allowing sort of tighter economic integration between um different chains and allowing them to sort of strengthen each other's uh Economic Security by sharing stake data availability offers you know a sort of different way to uh you know to offload or Outsource Outsource a certain element of security that's less about you know sort of sharing between many different chains and more like okay let's use the security of one big chain for a particular function Outsource to that and then focus on uh you know on on what we're doing but I can even imagine that there might be some way that uh you know Sovereign Roll-Ups or something using da uh Celeste has a DA layer might still find ways to to sort of uh you know anchor other definitions of security to each other and share and I think we frankly I think we still have very poor definitions of security we use that word as if like we know what what it means but it means like so many different things and there's many different um elements to it and so I think a big part of what you know what we need to do in this sort of new phase now that the interchange here is to actually get clearer definitions of what uh what we're talking about and the kinds of security you know what that means what what kinds of guarantees are really being offered and how people can actually reason about them yep thank you Ishmael I think um your views would be really interesting here given that you know you were one of the original Cosmos members and now you're internally at uh Celestia um and how your views on The Interchange Vision have evolved uh being inside a Celestia now and how you see that going forward so how I see it is that actually so that's just like the um like continuation of what we built before right like um the the first component of The Interchange was the the cosmos up to so to say and um basically what we're building is what the Cosmos app could have been right like it's it's a it's a version um of of like the Hub that has like actually a purpose in The Interchange or like in in a like in this vision of like application specific chains it actually serves a concrete purpose which is um offering like the service offering of Celestia is essentially just ordering your transactions and data availability right um so yeah I think I think it's very like very logical continuation essentially and um I think I agree with with Bucky that is like a lot of um there will be a lot of like experimentation happening right and um um Celestia will be well I'm sure like Celestia will play a crucial role in there and like it will enable um a lot more experimentation particularly because you offload the execution to these like applications or like the app layer you you enable much more like experimentation with like zero knowledge stuff and like um different VMS essentially which I think is will be way easier if if um compared to having to stand up your own uh like Cosmo Zone essentially yeah I think that's basically covers it yeah thank you I think that um the continuation of the experimentation is uh really something I'd like to press harder on which is more is more for developers experiences to be able to customize uh as granularly as possible uh to build the best application experiences and I think part of that is roll kit um I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about roll kit that coming out of Celestia and what that means for kind of the the internet with blockchains sure so roll kit is um basically a drop-in replacement for Comet so it's like it takes these same abstractions as Comet bft or previously tenement which is like the main abstraction here is ABCI which is like application blockchain interface it is an interface between the consensus layer and the application right um so we took that abstraction such that Cosmos SDK developers can continue like using the economos SDK as they're used to and or like people who who want to use ABCI and like build applications on other languages like there were teams building in Haskell in Rust and like other languages penumbra is building like in Rust for instance and anoma um like all these like all these builders that are used and familiarize themselves already with with the with the uh with the stack with the cosmos SDK they can like continue doing that while um not are not being forced to spin up their own Cosmo zone right like they don't have to spin up like a proof of stake chain they can use a roll kit um as like a sequence of software like that posts data to bitcoin as we've seen before in the panel or Celestia or polygon of whale right like it's a it's a it's a general like more General piece of infrastructure that we build such that the ecosystem can flourish and like experiment with different data availability layers yeah awesome um so 100x in Cosmos is something that I think we're all interested in doing um part of doing that is connecting um non-native IBC chains Jack maybe you can talk about some of the work that you and the Strange Love team are doing uh extending IBC outside of tenderment and maybe we can take that a step further and talk about um new clients for IBC and and how we get to that future yeah sure uh I think also like there is this strong place for Comet or other classically bft consensuses within this world we're starting to talk a lot more about shared sequencers and in some of these other pieces and I think one of the beauties of the way we've built this stack is these modular pieces these Primitives can be sort of like mixed and matched in all kinds of different ways and the experimentation that's happening now is helping us optimize that developer experience make it as easy as possible for developers to spin up their own systems and then go sell Services into this interchange economy you know Celestia is kind of bringing New Primitives to the table but also a novel combination of existing Primitives and they're selling that as a service to chains over some of these basic interfaces uh we're I've got some more talk this afternoon about uh modular IBC patterns and I'm going to dig a lot deeper into some of these topics but in IBC there's this concept of a client and the client does all the authentication hey do I know which chain I'm talking to did users send these packets over on these other chains and that abstraction is really General enough to put all kinds of cryptography in the in whatever the trust assumptions of your system are you can encode them into that client so with the roll-up world coming there's all these new trust assumptions there's all these new models for how to verify the state from these uh Roll-Ups and the work that we need to do with IBC to ensure that this internet of blockchains continues to be connected is to build out all of these different trust assumptions into these clients so that it enables IBC everywhere um you know the I think that with optimistic rollups we're likely to see a lot of the IBC traffic go through shared sequencers or other committee based Solutions compiling the the fraud proofs and all those things a little bit too heavyweight right now computationally because you need to run the full State machine over on your counterparty um and it's a lot easier to to go through a tender mint committee that's a shared sequencer but in once the the ZK role of Technology matures a little bit more I think we're going to see that become the the dominant method in a lot of ways and that model fits much more nicely in IBC because all you've got is this little CK proof you shove it into the client and you're good to go a lot in you couple that with the Celestia data availability sampling like client as well and then you can fully prove the state of that chain so um you know bubbling it up a little bit where we are right now is like all of these Primitives work they're just centering production um but I think David to your particular question about bringing that mass adoption that we really need to see and really enabling developers the work over the next year is to sand the rough edges off of the developer experience and allow developers to launch one of these Roll-Ups in five minutes and any one of a number of languages um and you know all of the pieces that everyone on this panel here builds are a huge part of that system and uh it's really cool to see it coming together yeah thank you um so right now we're uh at a point in crypto where there's a lot of infrastructure a lot of new infrastructure being built and all of this is in service of building killer apps and whether that killer app is money as Ethan suggests or it's something more web 2 oriented uh social or or not we need um maybe a little bit more infrastructure to make these experiences better so maybe we can go down the line and I'll ask you what's missing I you know I really take a contrarian piece here and say I think a lot of the infrastructure that we need is here today and I think especially with breaking consensus into different pieces a lot of people have talked about Celestia and data availability as the in-game of blockchains like I I do truly believe that that is the case so I think really what's missing is compelling developer experiences in ease of use for all of these products because at the end of the day infrastructure is a product and products need users and if it's really hard to explain how all these things work then we can't bring in the users what a product does is take a really complex idea like money and Kofi or data availability and puts it into a very simple developer experience or the developer with a few lines of code can express this very complex idea in an instantiation in the real world and you know I think that that's really what's missing right now like we've built out the infrastructure we don't need five more consensus protocols like let's use what we have because it's plenty fast enough great um I would agree um zucky since you have such a great taxonomy of the now hundreds of uh well close to 100 blockchains that use tenderment um maybe 65 or so connected IBC chains uh application specific or not what applications are missing for IBC chains that would bring in those new users that would then create the flywheel for more developers to come in I mean I think there's an interesting thing that's happening right now which is like there has been I think there was like as a practical matter a real lack of applications in the internet of blockchain so we like built out this interchange Vision we had staking IBC transfers it was all okay great you saw all of these new chains spin up we basically had one popular application which was osmosis um and uh and then there were a lot of applications also in the Terra ecosystem and like a lot of The Interchange application development was happening over in the Terry ecosystem so Terra ecosystem explodes last year takes down takes out a lot of the application ecosystem uh in the inner chain and then you are end up in this sort of like we've spent this year where there's kind of like nothing to do but stake um now I I think in the last like few weeks we've seen just like enormous number of new applications some of them are Terror you know come from that Terror world and are launching on top of Osmosis now um you have teams that are funded by um you know various accelerators and Dows all launching so there's actually now quite a lot to do with your assets um there's you know it seems to be like a renewed enthusiasm for nfts on stargaze uh and all of these things are maturing uh rapidly like the user experiences are almost acceptable they're about to become actually acceptable with sort of the apis that like Skip and it's built uh so on the whole I think we're like we're like kind of at an interesting threshold point where one of the biggest challenges that like Cosmos needs to overcome is sort of reactivating our user base we have a user base that has kind of uh you know sort of you know built a relationship with the software that's basically like oh okay I just feel like steak and occasionally sell my staking Rewards or whatever and now there's all this new exciting stuff to do about with the Stout with with your staking rewards Etc uh now is the time to like actually get them to go out and experiment um again this is the time to wake go out adventuring in the inner chain and I think that's one of the biggest challenges another big challenge though is all of the growth tooling to to sort of to do that like as a product Builder you actually have to go out and reach users and and communicate with them understand their needs uh get them to engage build growth funnels that infrastructure is also being built on Cosmos yep um Ethan what's your biggest hot take in the cosmos ecosystem whether that's technically architecturally or from a user perspective putting me on the spot um that a lot of it I mean it's not surprising but I still think a lot of it is um really like vapid uh they're still it's so much just like assets assets assets what are we doing with our assets and we might as well be Bankers you know that's what Bankers care about uh and we're supposed to all be here to like change the financial system but we're just kind of rebuilding it um yeah it's transparent and it's more decentralized and open and that's really important but what's even more important is is the underlying uh structure of debt really that that we're um you know that we're replicating and uh and so I think until we we really break through the like number go up and and have like real applications that aren't just about that um you know we're not going to make it so maybe you all think I'm not gonna make it because you know I'm I'm uh I'm the guy pushing back against speculation I mean obviously I understand speculations is is important for bringing in you know users and excitement and hype and narrative and memes and that's the stuff that sort of makes the world go around but you know I'm still looking for applications that that sort of move beyond that that aren't just about you know finance and I think there's there's an opportunity now with the sort of impending collapse maybe of the social media Empires there seems like an opportunity to to get in there of course it's also fragmenting which is um sort of interesting but I I think that's uh that's an opportunity that this community needs to figure out how to how to address now arguably we need more scalable infrastructure to do that and so you know what's what's the thing that's missing infrastructure wise I was going to ask for for Ishmael and say Celestia launch but you know he can answer for me too um but otherwise you know I would I would tend to largely agree with Jack that there is a ton of infrastructure here it's just about making it um more usable and accessible for use cases that aren't just about speculation right like if you talk to like some people I was just talking to someone yesterday at um at osmocon who was like telling me how they're kind of embarrassed to tell their friends that they're in crypto right um and this is like a serious you know developer in crypto building like infrastructure and real stuff but it's like embarrassing and and I still hear this from from people you know sometimes we try to hire people from web2 and they're like oh crypto you know that's just a bunch of scammers and right and so there's still that yeah uh so there's still some of us are proud of it you know we all like DJ ends whatever um we'll show you but uh you know so I think there's a real image problem I think that image problem comes from the lack of sort of more real applications and and uh and you know that's on us to find those applications and it's hard I mean the early applications are going to be speculative and and that's okay but sort of moving beyond that I think is the next the next big challenge for all of us to make this work so um I do think that's actually like one of the benefits of moving to this data to like modularity that is uh sort of underappreciated which is one thing that I don't think we fully grasped until like we saw it live was that the incentive structure of building Cosmos SDK chains meant that you had to build like liquidity and narrative around a token uh long before you had a product that was useful to anyone um at scale and so uh I think like one of the most exciting things to me about like sort of these modular architectures is you've seen this in the ethereum world where people are able to launch apps build or build and build an app you know build an application build an environment build a community uh build a lot of excitement typically a lot of excitement about the coming future airdrop uh but nevertheless uh that's a different sort of uh expenditure of energy than having to sort of build liquidity around a token right from the get-go um and I think we're gonna and and sort of the modular infrastructure and the way in which you sort of pay as you go for using that modular infrastructure rather than having to like build this like huge upfront cost um I think a lot of it was always described as like oh it's really hard to get validators I think most of us experience that getting validators is not that hard there's like hundreds of them they're all looking for some new thing to speculate on which is your token um and you know they're all that's the that's the structure of their business but getting but like having to devote time attention energy to like liquidity of an asset and narrative around an asset before you have a product is just a huge disservice to everyone and like feeds into only building speculative applications yep I would agree um Ishmael maybe you can uh talk a little bit about um as we're seeing basically every ecosystem or L2 Converge on these modular Frameworks um Cosmos having started from a different perspective which was interoperability first ethereum having started at share Security First how you would position Celestia against other da Solutions building on ethereum versus building on Celestia and other Cosmos related blockchain Primitives yeah I think um Celestia is the least opinionated right like it's it's like tries to be as neutral as as possible by not like enshrining a settlement layer for instance um I mean for like other pure data availability layers then the main differentiator I guess like is that we probably the first like they would go to market and like the first attack has um certain features like data availability sampling live uh I'm running on like a test net so I I can't predict the future like like on on on how this like ecosystems will play out um but I'm like like I'm I'm a bit biased but I'm obviously convinced that um like the the feature set the team the um the being like early like I mean Mustafa came up with the paper in like 2019 that the groundwork was done in like 2018 we've been talking about modularity long before it was like a buzzword uh or conferences being been made right um I think that is the main differentiator is like the tech and the cloud that we have yeah just to tag on to that if you think back to the the 90s we had Microsoft was the dominant operating system and that was like just one ball of closed Source software that nobody really knew how it worked it was incredibly tightly coupled and they built this whole ecosystem around that Linux came around it was a set of composable modules that allowed you to plug in any hardware and easily integrate that and Linux like grew a lot slower but it's ended up taking over the market for operating sources in Computing and I think that this is very similar in Cosmos we've come at this from modularity first and so let's just kind of taking that to the next level but in ethereum they started with this idea and it still is the fundamental idea in ethereum and you see this with the L1 L2 dichotomy l3s even people are talking about now that's being pushed the centrality of ethereum within that Vision has always stayed if the asset and eat the chain both of those instantiations are what everything else in the ethereum ecosystem sort of aspires to filter down to and when you build those assumptions deeply into your software it makes building actual modularity much much harder and I think that that's the advantage we have is we've built from that place from day one we've learned all the hard lessons on how coupling makes expansion difficult and we've had to push through a lot of those software barriers and like help make better interfaces and you know like yeah anyway it's a slightly informed thought but yeah yep um Zuki what uh what's the future for general purpose l2s on ethereum say we're all in Cosmos because we think that Roll-Ups or blockchains themselves will be application specific so what's the relationship between ethereum base layer l2s l-3s and why developers would would need a gen L2 so I think like the my general view of general purpose l2s is they are meeting a need for rapid prototyping um ethereum itself as ethereum has gotten more expensive and has developed a lot of and as frankly like developed become a playing Ground for like large dollar value real use right so like large counterparties do use ethereum to like move move large amounts of money um uh and use like a set of of D5 building blocks to do so um the rapid prototyping sort of environment of experimenting with new applications I think one of the hardest things like you know one of the biggest challenges we've had for Cosmos is it's probably not the first thing that a new team should be building is an app chain like a general purpose environment is actually probably a better place because you have to sort of don't have to invent the world and you have to like fit you can figure out your uh uh product Market fit you can figure who your user base is you can build your community and so I think the model of dydx is really like the model for the app chain world where d-way DX the app chain is dydx V4 and there was V1 and there was V2 and there was V3 and uh V1 and V2 were a general purpose product built on a general on the ethereum blockchain using it as a general purpose Ledger uh V2 is an application specific L2 rv3 was that application specific L2 and V3 is an app chain right and you and they learned along the way what the application what they actually like what was what had product Market fit what were the key features what did you actually have to Target and build and that then you know making that one year investment where they eventually stopped improving the existing Legacy product and built the option version of it could be make sense because they had like all of this knowledge and all of this experience built in and we're all going to see how that turns out but that's a more plausible like way of getting there and so so I think like the ex sort of like now you have like a bunch of you know you have a bunch of general purpose Cosmos chains where you have functionally like neutral where you have Neutron and Archway and osmosis and like all of these new general purpose chains where people are rapid prototyping new applications and some of those new applications may eventually pave the way to be independent app chains but that's sort of how I see the relationship um and most of the modular teams seem to have bought into it on the on across it where they are launching general purpose chains now and toolkits for building your future application specific chains for going from um like a web 2 app first to then an app chain like instead of starting from like the evm kind of environment or something like that yeah I mean I think the only big the the real challenge is like I mean in all ways like building decentralized software is just a lot more difficult a lot more but like the the biggest challenges you we like non-c like self-custodial money monetary systems are such an important value um and that's really what you have and whether it's the app chain world or the or the or the smart contract world is like can you plausibly build um in the but you know also you know you do it it uh you know as a you know where most of us are or like you know most of us are Americans are exposed to like sort of the western system which takes you know where you have a lot of financial regulation the minute you have custody um and that's also a big sort of barrier to building so I don't know like you you you'll probably see more like I've been watching what's happening with this like unibot thing um I don't know if anyone I think more of the degen's in the audience probably are following it but it's basically like it's literally like it started out as an application where you're basically just like where there's like you're just like giving your private keys to a a telegram bot right and like moving money through that but it does seem to be like developing into like a real thing um to come back to to Bucky's Point earlier like I think it would be nice if developing uh uh like starting on web free would be as easy as on web 2 like as Zaki said is like much more difficult currently but like as Jack also mentioned before like I think what we like the infrastructure that's missing is like to make that easier so I I believe that will be the case like it might be that there might be trade-offs right like there will be trade-offs hundred percent um but like just from uh from from from the usability point of view I think it will be possible to have something like AWS kind of style where you you code your thing you click a button and your chain is running right like that that is like not too far-fetched at all there are people there are teams working on that right now so I think that will be possible and then there's no reason to start at web 2 if you plan to be like a decentralized app afterwards right yeah right I think just to like there's a couple orders of magnitude more developers outside of crypto than there are inside of crypto but I think a big part of that is the developer experience that's been most pushed in crypto is this evm developer experience is somebody's worked in web 2 it's a not a great programming language to work in and I think one of the another Advantage we have as an ecosystem is we've got this proliferation of other VMS and programming languages that you can write in JavaScript with the gorick go with the cosmos SDK rust with wasm and many many others and that is I think going to be key to longer term developer adoption offering these developers something that they're familiar with meeting them where they are and yeah that that's also going to be key so developer experience is one thing user experience is another I'm curious how you guys see wallets playing out in an internet of thousands and thousands of blockchains our wallets application specific is there one to rule them all is there a WeChat wallet for crypto what are your thoughts there I mean kind of far out idea is that wallets are just top of funnel for applications so wallets go find the users and bring them in exactly how they do that I think there's a lot of white label Solutions out there already and you know you could imagine a convenience store launching their own wallet that has their loyalty program that's running usdc and that filters back down into the inner chain and you know wallet is this term that I think we need to unbundle a little bit but I think the way that we talk about it most is that sort of top of funnel of the users there's obviously the custody pieces there's the the technical infrastructure that's needed to make that happen and all of that stuff is really cool but at the end of the day it's about eyes and clicks and tokens and that's users Zuki if you could snap your fingers and make one thing happen in the internet of blockchains to accelerate growth and adoption what would that be well I think it it would it would have something to do with the wallet conversation I think we don't really I mean I don't feel like I have as a builder a detailed understanding of consumer Behavior regarding wallets the way consumers behave wallets with wallets mostly doesn't make sense to me and when I and like so like things that don't make sense to me is like why is metamask so sticky like why is that so sticky and why is it that the user feedback um but like at the same time like why is it that like users are like hey I use Kepler and now you want me to install metamask to use the similier app and I don't want to do that either like very confusing to me like what what exactly it is because I don't personally experience it and like one of the biggest challenges I think we have in general is that like we like a big part of like where application Builders lose contact with their users is in the wallet infrastructure like we have this third-party piece of software that we don't really have control over um like we we push a user into it and then like we maybe see the output but we don't know what goes on inside of it and it's like it's a real blind spot in understanding sort of consumer Behavior so like what wallets have to be like such that users will masked adopt The Interchange is I think like one of the like that is like one of the biggest pieces and we just have lots of theories um and those theories now need data to sort of validate them um and it's hard to get visibility into that I think that in the same way I was talking earlier about the ethereum community having this uh like core ideal of uh everything kind of filtering down to ethereum and how that shapes their world view in web 3 so much of what we do is a reaction to what we what we all really don't like about web2 and I think we have a lot of blind spots when it comes to some of the good things about web too and what Zachy is talking about with tracking users is a great example when you're an app and a user clicks through the wallet connect there's a lot of missing analytics in that flow that don't allow you as an application Builder to understand what the user behavior is and how you can help improve those user experiences and you know it's the same thing with the programming languages thing like we need to meet those users where they are and yeah it's that's a key message I think the thing that's Skip and is with ibc.fun and then they're announced Kepler integration is you know like I I was saying you know like one of the biggest pain points of Cosmos right now is that like there's this website tfm.com that no one has ever heard of but it makes the IBC ux 100x better um and it's like mostly what I use to interact with IBC now I used to use like the osmosis deposit page or whatever and and those sorts of things um but now we have I mean like that experience much of that experience is now coming also to be integrated into Kepler how will that change behavior um is I think is going to be a huge like data point so how do we bring those users in for uh things like TFM or ibc.fun if we don't have any insights into that behavior if you know we're in blockchains and most wallets are pseudonymous uh unless they're docs how do we gather any insight into uh topple funnel uh business development for applications and preserving privacy on the other end I personally think like um I I mean tracking users in in the browser like opt-in is an option show like Telemetry and stuff that would certainly give us insights but I think like it could start even much simpler you could like just uh do usability research talk to users do focus groups it sounds very like naive but I think you will catch most of the uh uh flaws of like our thinking of how users interact with things and they're actually interacting with things like I think you'll catch like 80 percent of that just by like doing proper usability research and I think that should be done independently of like one ecosystem it shouldn't be like driven by like oh we want to like figure out metamask we want to figure out Kepler it should be independent of that like here is a user they want to interact with like an app or web free or something and um it should be independent of these ecosystems in my opinion I think that would already move the bar much higher uh this is kind of really side but uh zoko from Z cash is one of the people I've seen do the best job of this every time you meet somebody for the first time he has them install a zcash wallet on their phone and then send them Z cash and he times every step of the process and keeps a record of all of these and like this type of focus on user experience is missing in a lot of I I think there's also like a kind of an interesting question like I don't think we're really clear on what the top of the funnel is for the modular ecosystem is the top of the funnel like ethl1 users or like so or like monolithic blockchain users is the top of the funnel like social media is the top of the funnel like web 2 application users it's Tron payments in Asia quite probably yeah not a joke you're right a quick survey how many people in the crowd raise of hands has a Kepler wallet yeah pretty decent amount okay maybe 80 90 um zucky let's close on this design uh tell us how to get into the cosmos ecosystem what is the path of least resistance as a user um Cato and Squid those are those are the things like uh squid router is great for bringing assets from any other ecosystem onboarding from lots of place Cato is a great Koto is a great experience for onboarding from uh Fiat um you know if you're in like sort of depending on jurisdiction et cetera but I honestly think that like again the one of the missing pieces like I know a bunch of ethereum people got excited about bad kids and wanted one they were all like how do I how do I outboard onto Cosmos and I was just like squid that it's like it's it's that easy an answer I think more support you know like with like uh uh uh the the the worm chain and uh and like noble coming on wine and stuff like that there's going to be more options to that but that's right now the best you couldn't get them to install Kepler they did no Kepler was fine they couldn't figure out how to get assets into Kepler okay okay and you know this is like those core pieces of infrastructure that have gotten built out one of those is swapping forward on osmosis where users can send an IBC packet and have it swap automatically and send those assets out so in this particular flow you want to buy bad kits on uh stargaze but Stars you need those Stars somewhere and you need to make those IBC transfers but the automation makes that easy it makes it a single transaction on ethereum for the end user and they end up on the Chain they want in the asset they want that's a key experience yeah and I don't think we're that far from being like I will I have eth I want a bad kid and like you don't have to do anything other than like sign and intent or an order or whatever and that and then there's like the infrastructure will just take care of it we're really not that far from that future cool so if you're in ethereum go to squid transfer some assets over by a bad kid if not uh go to Cato install Kepler come on over to Cosmos we have a lot of fun boxing matches included um I'm sure everybody is hungry and looking forward to lunch so I want to thank everybody on the panel for all of your time and you guys for being here and um have fun today thank you David for moderating [Applause]
