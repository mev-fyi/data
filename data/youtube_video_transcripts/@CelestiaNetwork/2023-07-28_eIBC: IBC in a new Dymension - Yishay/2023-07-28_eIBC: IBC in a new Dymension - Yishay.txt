so my name is ishai another co-founder of Dimension and this talk is going to be about eibc and IBC in a new dimension so eibc is a paper that I wrote with the team about optimistic rollups in an IBC setting but let's talk a little bit about context what is dimension and how does it connect to ybc so Dimension is a network of modular blockchains called rollaps we're in the modular Summit so it's worthy to say that these modular blockchains they post data to a DA layer like Celestia or like a veil or any other da modules or da capabilities that we're going to have in the future and these roll apps are modular by execution as well so they can choose their execution environment and they settle to the dimension Hub which acts kind of as a router to this internet of rollups to this network of modular blockchains that is called Dimension so the dimension hub um is a settlement layer with an enshrined support for our roll of framework which is called the rdk this is a unique architecture I think seeing a lot of these lectures here and a lot of talks in the modular Summit I noticed that Dimension has a very unique architecture as one of or I would say probably the only settlement layer that focuses on modular settlement and validating bridge for Roll-Ups so that's that's interesting and it also enshrines the roller framework that we've built I think the difference between Dimension to ethereum for that matter in terms of settlement is that Dimension doesn't use Smart contracts for Roll-Ups it actually uses the chain itself to support these Roll-Ups and to gain more decentralization for sequencers from day one so this is kind of uh why we built Dimension but let's talk about eibc and what it is so eibc is an IBC based protocol for supporting optimistic rollups um what does this mean and why do we need this protocol why can't we use just IBC uh this is a question that comes to mind why can't we use vanilla IBC for rollaps just reminding you all um that mentioned roll apps are optimistic roll apps so this question comes to mind and the answer is we can actually use IBC we can use IBC and we use IBC so from from the dimension Hub to the Roll-Ups themselves we use regular IBC this is not an issue but from the roll apps themselves back to the dimension Hub we can use IBC but we have a setback we have a setback that is common to every optimistic rollup because of a characteristic that optimistic rollups have which is the fraud proof dispute period so optimistic rollups are the most popular scaling solution I guess most of you know that on ethereum in terms of tvl in terms of popularity you see arbitrum you see optimism you see all these Roll-Ups they're very very popular but they have a few issues one of them as I mentioned is the dispute period so the dispute period basically prevents us from trusting the roll up immediately we need to allow other participants in the network to submit a fraud proof so it's a one of an assumption that somebody's listening or somebody's uh capable of submitting a prod proof to the settlement layer um but there's another setback that we that's not that known or not that common of people uh to talk about or to think about is the verifiers Dilemma The verifiers Dilemma is the situation where a sequencer is honest and is being honest for quite a while let's say that and other full node operators don't have any incentive to run a full note for rollap contrary to an L1 or a customs chain where they can validate and earn rewards earn fees uh roll a full node does not have any incentive to continue running this full node when he knows that the sequencer is honest he's assuming that this might be a possibility for him to catch fraud and maybe make money but the more we go in time the more we understand okay the sequencer is honest and most of the verifiers would just stop operating these nodes these nodes cost money so they just eventually stop and the verify and then the full note or the sequencer by that time of point point of time they can be tempted to start uh cheating or doing any malicious State transitions so this is the verifiers Dilemma we have to make sure that in an internet of Roll-Ups like we envision in dimension where we say Cosmos is just the the tip of the iceberg we can build an internet of Roll-Ups which are connected to the cosmos ecosystem vibc and via the dimension Hub we must figure out a way to understand who will verify these Roll-Ups and to understand how we can trust these Roll-Ups or these sequencers if they don't have a lot of full nodes out there so these are two big problems if you want to address an internet of Roll-Ups that is based on the optimistic approach so we have a solution and this is what I want to talk about today the solution is called eibc E is for escrow so eibc is an IBC rapper on the settlement layer that basically transforms the sediment layer into a Clearing House of IBC withdrawals that are tradable or that you can use to clear them before the dispute period so we want to address the dispute period we want people to get an instant transfer experience and not damage the ux for everybody because of the dispute period we have for optimistic Roll-Ups so this is a short kind of uh brief about eibc let's understand how it works in detail so for understanding that we need to address the assumptions so the first assumption is that users are willing to pay an additional fee for instant withdrawals this is obvious if you want to get out of a roll up if you want to get out of an exchange you would pay a little bit more to get out of that roll up or that exchange or whatever it is you would pay a fee the second assumption is that verifying a roll-up eliminates the rollback risk for the verifier so assuming I am suspecting something or whatever it is I'm running a full note of the roll up I have now verified the state I eliminated the risk of it to eliminate the risk of rollback the third assumption is that verifiers who encounter fraud will submit a fraud proof I think these are pretty feasible assumptions that we can take and it will help us move forward with the flow of eibc and how it works so let's talk about the flow so Alice is a user on roll up X she sends an eibc withdrawal requesting uh 10 dime out of the roll-up um so Alice says I want to withdraw 10 dime and I'm willing to pay one dime fee okay this is an example uh it's not the implementation but just an example so Alice wants to withdraw 10 dime she sends it as a regular transaction to the roll app um with the with the fee with the review requirements later on the eibc message is related to this to the settlement layer SQL module which cues it and this is an important fact an important detail here the eibc message is relayed to the settlement layer to the escrow module and not to Alice itself so Alice is not getting the the eibc uh withdrawal remember remember we have to wait for finalization there is a fraud proof dispute period so we need to make sure that we only accept the real IBC message after the fraud dispute period super important so we need to figure out how we can counterpass this um this hurdle okay now Bob which is a liquidity provider and uh remember Bob because he's also a verifier but remember him Bob is a liquidity provider who decides to fulfill the eibc message the ABC transfer he's willing to purchase the delayed IBC message that Alice has already sent remember the settlement layer escrows these IBC messages and he can actually auction them so Bob is capable of purchasing a future withdrawal and paying nine dimes right now remember Alice wanted to pay a fee for getting out of the roll-up immediately so she she's willing to get 99 for a 10 dime in the future uh which Bob is willing to wait for it so Bob actually sends the nine dimes to the settlement layer escrow module the eibc module on the settlement layer delivers Bob's tokens right Bob sent nine tokens and now delivers the nine tokens to Alice immediately right so Alice wasn't capable or she didn't want to wait she got her nine dime immediately and the original eibc message of Alice the 10 dime is now waiting for finalization but it's rerouted for Bob's address so what we did here we made the settlement layer a clearing house for roll-up withdrawals so we actually we we took um one need of Alice is I want to get out of the roll up immediately I'm willing to pay the settlement layer escrow is the message it knows it can't accept it because of the optimistic assumption and Bob is willing to take that additional risk an additional waiting time uh for that fee okay but what happens if there's no one who wants to fulfill the eibc transfer the IBC liquidity transfer in this scenario the message would would just wait transfer the IBC message would just wait as usual and would finalize and would be transferred to Alice according to the optimistic assumption that we'll wait for the dispute period so this this eibc protocol is is is fully compatible with ABC it just uses a wrapper on the settlement layer to create a market for the future withdrawals it's a market and this is what it is and this is I think what makes it super exciting because it elegantly provides economic and crypto economic assumptions or Game Theory to create a better system so let's look at the results the result is Alice received her tokens immediately without waiting the dispute period Alice is now capable of transferring vibc of course her funds or tokens whatever she wants to any other roll-up in the ecosystem that's pretty amazing because once you withdrawal out of roller packs or whatever rollup you are you can easily deliver the tokens or transfer the tokens to any other roll-up that's connected to the to the ecosystem so by solving what we did in the first leg in the first flow how do we get out of the roll-up we actually get a roll-up to roll up system that works fluently um so Alice also didn't need to trust any centralized actor for bridging this is super important because uh you know right now everybody's using optimism whatever roll up on ethereum or whatever rollup that is optimistic they're using it with the liquidity provider that they Trust so we Leverage The IBC mechanism and we leverage the trust in the validated set of the dimension Hub to create a trust minimized environment for people to use and uh basically to leverage it um the other results from Bob's side is Bob made money I think it's super important to understand that we want to allow or we want to enable as much ecosystem participants that will make money this will this creates a community it creates an economy um it it it you know rewards the players that are in the ecosystem and it's good but Bob apart from making money has a crucial incentive right now to verify the rollup and this is I think this is what makes the ABC super special and super important uh and elegant is that we kill um two birds with one stone and we allow the ecosystem to verify itself so according to usage according to if a roll-up is popular you would know that it's being verified because somebody wants to get out and somebody's willing to give liquidity so you would know that this roll-up is safe because it's being verified so we're using crypto economics we're using Game Theory instead of computation to create this incentive mechanism to verify thousands of or tenth tens of thousands of Roll-Ups uh with crypto economics and uh by that solving the verifiers Dilemma so the verified dilemma is solved um the Thrive proof dispute period is mostly solved if there's interest in the roll-up right so if somebody's in the roll-up if somebody wants to take the risk of running it it's also soft so it's also kind of a on-demand situation and uh yeah and we get a better better ecosystem and a better experience for our users uh creating this internet of Roll-Ups with immediate withdrawals and usage of the original IBC mechanism um I guess we're getting to the end of this presentation thank you uh maybe time for Q a don't be too rough I know you got you're gonna have hard questions especially you in the back there yeah um any q a anybody wants that something I assume not okay thank you [Applause]
