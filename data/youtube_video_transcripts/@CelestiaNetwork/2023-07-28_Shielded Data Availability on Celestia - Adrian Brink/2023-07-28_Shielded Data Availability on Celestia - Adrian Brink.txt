all right yes indeed this talk isn't about anoma um if you wanted to find out what a Noma is you should have listened to Chris's talk yesterday um and I know I love Celestia um if you haven't seen it watch the recording it was a great talk um cool I will very briefly today uh could I get a timer up well we'll see how long it takes um cool yes I will talk about chill data availability on Celestia today or the ability of how we can retrofit privacy guarantees and also forward fit privacy guarantees into existing protocols without needing to make changes to those protocols which as you'll see in a little bit is going to be quite important especially when you start thinking on how do you want to build privacy preserving rollups on a lot of these systems so before I start let me give you very quick till they are on what narmada is how it works and sort of why we need unified privacy sets so namata and nutshells its asset agnostic multi-chain privacy until really no matter at least on The Interchange we didn't have the ability to have asset agnostic privacy privacy was always tied to specific assets right like when you think of what Monero or Z cash do they provide very good privacy guarantees let me scratch this zcash provides very good privacy guarantees [Music] um and Monero provides you should do your own research privacy guarantees um but they provide them for specific asset types as in in the case of zcash they they have Zack and in the case of narrow they have XMR and so users are now forced into this model where for some reason they have to hold or like pay for their milk in the store using zec even though I think most people would much rather use usdt brings it's it effectively adds an extra type or an extra feel to the notes in a zcash-like system to provide a unified Shield set where all assets no matter where they were created or how they were created can live in a unified childhood set this has the tremendous property that you get low volume but high value assets that inherit the Privacy guarantees of the low value but high volume transfers so for example a very trivial example here is all the usdt private transfers in Armada provide privacy guarantees to you're like hundred thousand dollar nft and this is really the only way to get privacy guarantees for long tail assets uh which don't have a lot of inherent volume but due to this you can inherit the Privacy guarantees of sort of the entire Shield set and the other big thing is it means we don't have to keep forcing users into accepting specific assets in order to be private users can bring user generated assets I would assume in most cases it's going to be something like usdt usdc but if people sort of in two years from now want to create a new fancy stable coin that fancy stablecoin can inherit the last three years or sort of shielded set activity and as a result has a much stronger privacy set at launch the way this works with Armada is that Armada is a basically a chain it's a sovereign L1 that connects to other systems via IBC sited on IBC if you are thinking about building a bridge don't like read how IBC works this mostly solves all your problems Uh custom bridges are terrifying and they're very prone to errors so with Armada you get permissionless connections to other chains for IBC so in the future if other chains pop up or assets on other chains pop up those assets can also freely flow into no matter and maybe one of the coolest things is we have Shield set rewards in Armada which means that the namara governance unit can effectively incentivize rewards to be paid for holding Assets in the field set um and this is actually very important because most people at the moment treat their sort of privacy as in I want to like have privacy right now for my asset but this is actually really problematic because that means you sort of go from a transparent system into a shielded system and then back out now we have sort of a lot of statistical attacks that you can possibly pull off against this so the much better idea is that you mostly want to hold all your assets in a shielded set all the time and when you want to use them somewhere else that doesn't work with the shielded set then you want to make them transparent and cool thing with Armada is you get Shields and rewards within the shield set so as in if you hold some eth in the shield set there may be incentives there that get paid out in the shield set in the native asset of namada and just by holding Assets in the shield set Also if anyone here is thinking of building private lending platforms you need the convert circuit that enables Shield set rewards because it's roughly the same idea you have a transparent list of sort of conversion rates for specific asset types and you can then upgrade specific Assets in the shield set for example you can go from like osmo at Epoch one to osmo at Epoch 5 and at the same time when you do this upgrade you claim the rewards for it um yes this convert circuit is fully documented um if you like cryptography you should check it out cool and now coming to shielded actions um once you have Assets in the shield set you want to ideally have the ability to interact with the rest of the ecosystem whether this is on the interchain or soft within other specific l1s from within the shield set right you don't want to have to take out your money from the shields at all the time in order to use let's say a osmosis pool so shielded actions is really the generalized case of how you interact from within the shield set with application logic somewhere else and really this can mean with specific dapps for example on ethereum but this can also mean with specific app chains like Celestia or like osmosis and let me quickly walk you through an example here for osmosis because this is sort of very instructive I think um you hold some Assets in the shielded set you want to make the choice that I don't like the atoms anymore I want to now hold some osmo um traditionally what people would do is they would um personally take the money out of the shield set transfer it over IBC to osmosis swap it on osmosis swap it back right and this is sort of normally they would go to their standard osmosis address and then sort of do the swap there with Armada you can instruct the validator set to do actions on your behalf this is really the right way to think of this you can instruct the value I said to take some action elsewhere while staying within the shield set so you can construct effective using an arch proof in Armada it says I would like to swap x4y then the valid data set will take the assets via an IBC method bringing to osmosis on osmosis use the IBC memo to execute the swap the counterpie or the person that executed that swap is the Nevada vowel data set it is not some specific person it is the entire chain sort of wanted to do a specific swap on osmosis that swap gets executed the assets get returned from osmosis via IBC again and they enter the shield set again at which point the user has full control over these those assets again and there are some downsides here which is specifically due to latency if you start thinking like what does this actually mean under the hood this means at least one IBC message which means at least like one or two blocks confirmation on the origin chain as well as one or two blocks confirmation on the sending on the receiving chain so you talk on like maybe 30 seconds so you can see here this is like not instant um if you're on a system that has sort of like one second block times this is it's going to be hard to get the same kind of latency guarantees as soon as you want to hop between multiple chains but the really cool feature now is that you have Shiller tops um and none of these none of the core systems need to actually change what they did osmosis provided Shield swap provided swaps and no matter provided privacy um and but we can start integrating these systems using IBC in order to actually have very complex user flows where we can start in a really modular way combining all these different systems in order to get something that is like from a user perspective much more useful than individual components um let me quickly also walk through the architecture how this actually works um this is sort of the heart of an armada is The multi-asset Shield pool if you're familiar with the sapling circuit on zcash this will look very familiar to you you can really at a high level think we've added an extra identify an extra field to the node types in the sapling circuits in order to have an asset identifier so that all assets can share unified child set what happens in sapling actually is that you can instantiate sapling for other assets rather than Zack but I can identify as an external Observer which sort of shields that you interact with whereas in Armada an external Observer can only see that someone was interacting with the shield set but they don't know what actions were taken this could mean that I transferred this to an address that I control myself this could mean that I transfer the student address at someone else owns this could mean I wanted to execute some shielded swap somewhere else or I want to create I want to submit some data to Celestia in a shielded manner so this is really powerful actually has some abstraction because it can work with arbitrary assets um yes and so the basic idea is that you can sort of go into Armada transparently then go into the shield set do whatever you want to do in the shield set go back out if you want to take your assets back out and then go with wherever you want to go via IBC again um yes so this is sort of the entire architecture and I will won't go through the entire sort of slide but just to highlight a couple of things here Nevada comes with cubic slashing which actually means that if you should be really careful which validators you select the more uh percent the high percentage of a value I said commits an infraction the higher the sort of the slashing rate Rises exponentially so if you have been slashed on Cosmos for example slashers are constant um if 30 onomata commits a fault um slashes are going to be tremendously high so there's really now an incentive to actually start splitting your delegation across many different valid leaders that run in different security models um yes Nevada on the hood just used comment B of T so you get fast finality bft you get all the IBC integration the state machine isn't using a customer SDK it's using uh it's written by hand and rust to implement a bunch of this cryptography um yes and sort of we also have a custom ethereum Bridge mostly because we don't have ABC adapters to Theory mat if anyone in the audience wants to like do cool work please work on integrating IBC into ethereum uh it's not that difficult but it just requires engineering effort in order to get it done and this is also true really like the way the interchange ecosystem or the multi-chain ecosystem is going to work is we should be building IBC adapters for other systems for example there's no reason why something like near or polkadot um or any fastenality mod on bft wouldn't be able to speak IBC yes now coming to shielded data availability actually work and why is it useful um again the model is roughly the same thing which is a users in the shield set they want to interact with Celestia they want to be able to post some data to Celestia the user has to generate as your knowledge proof ideally on an edge device within Armada this instructs an armada violator set to effectively submit data to Celestia on behalf of that user and again the so the interaction that the world observes is that the Nevada validator said submitted data on Celestia this could mean that there's an individual person this could mean there's sort of 100 people behind it but the world doesn't know um and when you start thinking on like what kind of Roll-Ups you want to be building this is actually becoming incredibly important especially for privacy preserving rollups if you have privacy preserving rollups where individual users want to be part of this roll up and have to submit data to Celestia it means that in the current model without Shield data availability they would need to figure out how to safely submit those individual transactions to Celestia without revealing who they are so in the current model even if you had a privacy preserving roll up on Celestia users would need to be incredibly incredibly careful and this is almost impossible to achieve that they can sort of privately pay transparent fees on Celestia um with Amara Celestia doesn't have to worry about this problem anymore and how you like get private fee payments working rather we can say well we have these two systems that each do their unique thing but by combining them you can start submitting using the feature sets of both effectively so whatever feature set Celestia may even offer in the future um using shield.da you can always submit that data privately on Celestia I think there's also an interesting other aspect to this where privacy has a lot of benefits but it also has sort of its complexity and end user because all of a sudden data moves from the center of the network right like when you think of something like ethereum data all lives in this globally distributed globally readable database in a privacy preserving world this data starts moving to the edge devices where individual phones need to hold this data so one big question is are users going to store all this data themselves or are there going to be Services where users can for example offload encrypted nodes too and this is I think sort of a future direction that um I'm not exploring too much in this talk but that is really interesting think about for future research on how can we leverage data availability solutions to provide guarantees to users that they can get back that data for example the encrypted nodes which they will need in order to access their their funds an interesting other research area here is oblivious message passing or how can you query a data source like Celestia in a privacy preserving manner because one of the so in my opinion the most valuable data set most likely in this space is actually in Fiora because everyone has access to all the rights to the chain right like if you scan ethereum and see all historic rights but inferior is like one of the only companies in the world that has access to 99 of all the reads which is the much more difficult to obtain data set in solving the world of blockchains and so with oblivious message Crossing we can actually start thinking on how do we have reads Against full notes that do not reveal exactly what kind of key in a Mercury I'm looking for as in like right now I go to a phone number and go I would like the value of this key with oblivious message passing you can live in a world where you create a range of keys and it's not clear to the full node exactly which key I wanted to ask for um yes this sort of leads into the modular thesis a little bit on we should be splitting concerns uh not every chain needs to do everything um there's a clear benefit to standardization and specialization um if and only if we have decent interoperability protocols that can actually make this sort of specialization still composable um so I think we're clearly going to head into this direction and sort of a title of execution settlement consensus and data availability I think we're also going to see more specialized chains around privacy guarantees around um sort of transferability tradability I think we're clearly heading in this direction but this becomes much easier to build for effectively as an engineer because so yeah instead of writing everything like if I think about this in terms of software instead of writing everything as one large monolithic mono repo we start writing individual libraries that individual other systems can start consuming um yes and this is sort of I think one of the last slides privacy is a service um this is namata is going to start providing this where you can use lamada to drive actions on systems that you actually want to use for other reasons but you want to retrofit as a personal choice privacy into those systems for example maybe some people want to trade a lot maybe other people want to use Celestia a lot no matter actually doesn't care Narada just wants to provide really good privacy guarantees for whatever other for whatever users want to do on other systems and I think this is we're going to see this more and more because there are lots of interesting ideas being built and very few people have or very few teams have the amount of cryptography engineering required to make these systems private as in making every system inherently private is a very difficult task because all of a sudden you need to start thinking like how do I build proof of stake fully privately that gets very very complicated it's very interesting when it gets very complicated and so with privacy as a service we can rather say we can build individual applications and individual dapps and we can retrofit privacy into them in a very transparent way for users yes if you'd like there are more resources here Discord Twitter the no matter testnet um yeah thank you very much [Applause]
