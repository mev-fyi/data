now having listed all of the kind of main components of a modular blockchain stack like how do we define what a modular blockchain is so i define a modular blockchain as a blockchain that outsources fully at least one of the four components like it ie it does not handle that component so so for example like solana wouldn't be a modular blockchain if you just added roll-ups to solana because solana's l1 still has a smart contract environment and its and its validators are doing data availability consensus and execution and they're not specialized in a specific task and therefore it's not it's not modular so what is not a modular blockchain uh so there's often some confusion on this a module like a blockchain that handles all the components but has a modular software design is not a modular blockchain uh a modular software design can be helpful to build modular blockchains like we use tendermint the abci construction in tenement and is very helpful to build modular blockchains but the software like but deploying a blockchain using this modular software library does not make that blockchain modular in itself and secondly um a network of blockchains where each blockchain network handles all the components is also not a modular blockchain for example avalanche subnets are not modular blockchains because each chain in that subnet in the network handles all the components that i just described therefore is not modular
