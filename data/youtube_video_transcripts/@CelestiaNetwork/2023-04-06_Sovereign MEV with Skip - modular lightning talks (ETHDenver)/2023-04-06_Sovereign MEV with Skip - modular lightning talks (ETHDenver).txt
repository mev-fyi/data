uh my name is Barry I'm one of the co-founders of skip my other co-founders right over here Magnus um I'm gonna talk to you about Sovereign muv today and what skip is and what we do we are a series a startup by the way and we're hiring for anyone who is uh not yet convinced in what they're hacking on um so we build Sovereign Mev infrastructure and protocols and for us in the modular stack in The Sovereign L1 stack that means basically giving protocols the ability to do two really important things one is help them control what kinds of Mev can and can't be extracted so a classic example of this is almost all the validators almost all the protocols and Cosmos that we work with don't want to facilitate front running or sandwich attacks because they are net negative for user experience but they are very excited to facilitate back running style Mev because that's something that doesn't actually harm the uh price that their users are executing against so they want to be able to facilitate certain kinds of things and prevent other kinds of things that they view as more net extractive and then the second super important thing is control who and which stakers actually profit the most off of Meb so in ethereum the way PBS works is it's just sort of this massive subsidy system for the proposers but in the modular stack in The Sovereign stack people have Mev wrapped into the story and the go to market and the unique value proposition of their chain so we work with chains who want to see Mev actually go back to LPS because they view it as something that harms LPS we work with chains who want to see it go back to validators we want we work with other chains who want to actually go back to the developers who are building on their chains so that's sort of kanto's approach that's archways approach all these ideas around contracts secured revenue and then we work with others who just like want to see users recapture their own Mev as their end goal and so giving them the ability to do these two kinds of things is sort of how we Define sovereign muv and what we use as our North Star so we provide two styles of solutions right now in protocol Solutions so we build this thing called protorev for osmosis that I'm going to talk to you guys about and then extra protocol Solutions so off-chain block space auctioning systems if we call Skip select which we deploy to Atmos Juno terra2 injective and a number of other Cosmos chains so skip select first is basically a very customizable top of block auction system for primarily tendermint and IPC blockchains so the way it works is we run from infrastructure that we call the Sentinel that captures a bunch of bundled trades from Searchers who are trying to capture most liquidations mostly back running opportunities and then we have a bunch of low latency stuff that simulates those transactions tries to find uh bundles that we can put on chain together that are complementary tries to find which ones conflict and then constructs the most profitable top of block that we can for validator and for a protocol According to some preferences that they have so validators decide okay do I want to facilitate front running and sandwiching do I not do I want to keep Mev for myself do I want to give it back to my stickers if I want to give back to the network and how much of the block is Skip responsible for building so unlike the system that does some of this work in ethereum we don't build the whole block right we build a portion of the block that is configurable by the chain and by the community so that we don't actually become and nobody who builds the block can become a vector of censorship from something like ofac there's a collaborative block building process that happens so this is deployed a bunch of different places on Cosmos running on several hundred validators at this point processing tens of thousands of transactions a day um the second thing that we do is called protorap which is fully in protocol so this takes advantage uh much more so than skip select does of the kinds of very unique things you can do when you decide exactly how you want different kinds of transactions to function in your VM when you have something like a cosmos SDK or an OP stack blockchain something you can only build in the modular staff um basically that high level way it works is it in houses all Mev recapture that is possible just on osmosis one chain basically doing back running calculations after the execution of every transaction on osmosis and it does this at no cost of capital it flash mints and Flash Burns tokens natively and it's fully open source right so like it was built in partnership with the osmosis community in partnership with their developers there and it runs on each validator as a part of consensus so there is nothing that anyone in the cosmos ecosystem including or in the osmosis ecosystem including us now can do to actually undermine this kind of Meb recapture system and it's fully controlled by governance so high level graphic for how this works you have a transaction comes into the decks potentially imbalances prices you have a solver that runs sees okay is there free money to be made by rebalancing those prices and then flash mints and Flash Burns tokens to do that and then it redirects all that Revenue back to the community so instead of this leaking out to Searchers or more likely to infrastructure providers that those Searchers are using to win latency Wars it goes to osmosis so this this kind of solution in its current form is not generalizable right it's very very specific to how the osmosis Dex works and very specific to um the kinds of transactions they have but the long-term goal is to have Sovereign solutions that enable full block building control by the protocol without any kinds of off-chain actors in including Skip and have those be transparent and open source and enforceable by consensus in the same way protorev is and compatible with cross chain and media extraction right so how can we maintain a lot of these properties that we've achieved with our very specific custom system but build something or a set of solutions that are more generalizable to a host of other things that folks might want to accomplish and build in in modular ecosystem so this is some inside baseball and tenement which I don't know how much anybody actually knows about but I'm going to talk about it and maybe you'll learn something so tendermint is a consensus algorithm that's beneath Celestia as well as all these different Cosmos chains and it's in many other places as well it's in polygon they use a fork of tender mint the binance governance chain uses a fork of tender retirement sort of like this Godfather consensus algorithm that's in a bunch of places and the way tendermint interacts with the application code on top of it the actual like blockchain State machine is through this thing called ABCI which is the application blockchain interface it's like exactly what it says it is and the way it works right now is tenorment builds the whole block comes to consensus on the Block does all of the work of consensus and tenement doesn't know jack about what transactions actually mean or what the application actually wants to accomplish so it just sees like bites that are flying around and that's nice for for scaling and generalizability but it's shitty for Mev because what that means is any kind of off-chain random actor can come in reorder transactions insert new things do whatever the hell you might want and there's no way for a sovereign app or roll-up developer to do anything about it so ABCI plus plus is where this is going um I think they couldn't think of a great name for the next generation of this system but uh the plus plus is supposed to capture that this is much much better and and it is especially from an Mev perspective because what's changing is that the application is becoming very intelligent about actually uh its own block building process so what you're going to see is instead of tenement coming to consensus and then just giving the application a block transaction by transaction the application actually dictates how tenderment votes on a block so there's a process by which tenurement asks the blockchain hey what transactions should I put in my block and then code written by rollup or application developers in tenerment or on Roll kit or any other ABCI plus plus aware uh SDK can replace those transactions add new ones shuffle them around do whatever and then return that to tenerment and then tenerment gives up to all the other validators and those validators ask the application again hey I got this block how should I vote on it and so what this means is the mempool in many ways which is just sort of like this thing that controls Mev and has been like sort of attached to the consensus algorithm for so long and and is in most uh chains is becoming something the application can be opinionated about which is going to give application developers the ability to be very opinion about how Mev works and potentially realize more of this vision of sovereign Mev that kind of makes sense those very like specific and Technical but I think a lot of the ideas generalize to things that we want to see in lots of other formats in the modular stack but our goal something that we're working on a lot right now is trying to like I said before generalize proto-rev into this broader concept of having protocol owned Builders where application developers can decide can make decisions about how a movie actually works on there um so we're building the first version of this right now as basically an auction that validators can run where you have new kinds of transactions that are like meta transactions where Searchers can bundle in the same way that they can bundle using skips off-chain infrastructure validators can simulate things in the same way that skip does so in our off-chain infrastructure and in the same way that we maintain reputation systems about users interacting with our block building infrastructure we're going to give validators all of the same tools and protocols all the same tools to do that so we think there are a lot of kind of downsides of off-chain systems even though we we built one that works very well today um the big thing is like Builder centralization uh so like skip builds basically all the blocks for a lot of different chains and Cosmos right now and like that's nice for us we like that but but it's probably not good for decentralization even though we have that collaborative block building process um and it's not really incentive compatible right so there is no reason people trust us I think because we we generally are good actors and uh have have products that have helped the cosmos ecosystem and all of these uh Sovereign app developers make a lot of money off their media and prevent the kinds of mu they want to prevent but like in practice we could just rug that system right because it is so centralized and so off-chain um it's opaque like people don't really know what our infrastructure does and we could censor transactions uh in theory and systems like PBS sort of claim to solve this and in some ways work towards solving it but in practice you are seeing in ethereum that like there are relayers that stand out as being responsible for most of the blocks that get included in ethereum right now and and some of those relayers are ofac compliant for example this is like a big problem in ethereum right now so ethereum is like slowly beginning to think through some of these questions about how can we put more interesting kinds of Mev aware logic and build Mev aware applications on chain but because the VM uh is so mature and because it secures tens and tens of billions of dollars of capital right now their ability to experiment with this and their ability to move forward with this is quite slow um but we think that we can build protocol on builders that fix a lot of these problems and uh make meaningful improvements over off-chain systems and still help chains achieve sort of this goal of sovereign Med we can sort of make validators into much more intelligent Builders themselves we can using consensus and rules in the protocol enforce um resistance to off-chain agreements between validators and particular Searchers and we can have all of this be open sourced um and auditable by the community editable by application Developers we're starting to do this now osmosis is going to be our first design partner for this in protocol auction system that I've been talking about and we're going to be leveraging a lot of this cool stuff from API plus plus to make it so that proposers can't just undermine the whole thing and take the money for themselves um this v0 of what we're building like I was saying is going to introduce some cool new things this on Gene bundle type of transaction uh the ability to actually have a single pay single winner auction on chain which is not something that ethereum or other ecosystems have been able to accomplish in the sort of old days of Mev pre-flashbots pre-pbs you had mempool gas Wars where all of the losers still ended up with reverted transactions chain and we're able to actually fix that problem using the Sovereign toolkit and then we're going to be using these things called vote extensions which I won't get into a lot of detail on but basically allow the network to have some additional data to audit some of the decisions that are made by a proposer so what that means is we can make these auctions more credible so we can a proposer can say oh hey this was like the highest paying bid but actually like it was some bid but they just took a bunch of money from someone off chain we'd actually make that much much harder to do um and then you're still going to have very useful off-chain actors around Searchers and and more advanced simulators but we can give this toolkit to chains um and we're going to have the first version of this launching sometime I think in the next four months is the goal but the idea here right to back up a little bit talk about like why we think this is important in the first place is that there is a feedback loop that we've identified in Cosmos that uh drives a lot of development there that I think is going to drive a lot of the development in the broader modular ecosystem as well very important which is this idea that there is a sort of mutually beneficial and reinforcing relationship between the core devs of a protocol the users of that protocol and the various sort of off-chain on-chain centralized entities that secure it in Cosmos right this is just validators but in the modular stack this also gets a little bit more complicated you have provers and sequencers and validators maybe and sometimes you have all of them and maybe you don't have any of them but this idea that the those kinds of actors have very frequently reputation and participate in Social consensus and give feedback to chain Founders and and sort of act as the voice of the users in a like a sort of meta competition that's happening between all of these different l1s and modular protocols creates a very nice feedback loop but that feedback loop only works when you can actually implement the new kinds of features and feedback that you're getting on chain when the application developers actually have the ability to be responsive to it and can't just get rugged by off-chain Mev extractors and and profit maximizing proposers who go unchecked so we are trying to move this sort of Black Box process of what happens between when a user signs a transaction and how a bunch of transactions get put into a block more on chain or at least make it more accessible to protocol developers to govern audit control and improve so that's kind of what skit is all about sort of what we're working on right now I think that's the end of the talk oh yes like I said we're higher um we're series a right now hiring for developers researchers and Ops rules so you know pick your poison uh but we'll be around afterwards if you guys want to chat with us we have two minutes per question if you have any questions for Barry go for it yeah I have a question about like skip select in particular like uh I know like Cosmos like first and first our certainly traditionally invest the way it experience need to run like a separate software now just first get select is that good question yeah we have a modified version of tendermint that they run that it is aware of our auction basically so we send them bundles of transactions they also get stuff out of the mempool bundles go first mempool stuff go second is the simple explanation and the mempool will still first come first serve uh quick question and follow-up is it social consensus that like how do you enforce that squares the school so there is a combination of we police validators to ensure that they're actually building the blocks that we're expecting them to build and social consensus so like something like chains are now sort of opting to upgrade to Mev tenorman on a chain-wide basis because they want this system because it actually now like on Juno it was unprofitable or in a validator two months ago and now because of Mev recapture validators are able to actually pay their infrastructure bills which is kind of cool alrighty thank you yeah thanks yes
