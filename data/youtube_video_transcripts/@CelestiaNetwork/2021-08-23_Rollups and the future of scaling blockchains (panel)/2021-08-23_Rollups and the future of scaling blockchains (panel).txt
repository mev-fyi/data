panelists except we are now joined by ishmael coffee who's the cto of celestia and uh the moderator of this panel is lima from polychain so you might take it away [Applause] [Music] um side chains employed so um if we're seeing scalability um with sidechains that are being deployed um why do we need to give us [Music] is that it's um has a much bigger security assumption of questions much bigger security model than roll-ups and so for example with quality with each athletes of the polygon to transfer them between ease and fibroid there's this bridge that relies on a few more events it's basically a multiplicity wallet with a partner with a few that are less than 10 probably um [Music] you know outsiders and those signers could potentially steal everyone's funds if they were but i think this is a very short-term solution because we're seeing uh hacks on projectable all the time and it's only a bad amount of time and before users realize this topic situation and users will want more security for their advance because in the long term it's more and more likely um that the the hacks will happen on the bridge because it's using a multi-state effectively i fully agree um so it has two interesting sides to the one side is that if you have more fonts in the arrow in either in the side chain than the state you actually have full incentive for the validators to to exit scan you know just to steal all these funds especially if they believe that the top evaluation is speaking it's not so it's just very clear currently that doesn't make sense it's not a stable mechanism you know like in blockchains we build stuff based on incentives and based uh basic game theory which incentivize the right behavior and here people behave like against their best interest essentially but the second aspect is that it's notoriously hard to protect hotkeys on servers and you need them for something like a sidechain you need the service to be online and to store these keys in the memory of the service and you only need to hack a few of them in order to steal all these funds and this is very hard and it also provides possible deniability or like it can be in the same job administrators of the service or administrators of the cloud serving cloud centers like data centers that provide the hosting for them can do work and neglect their activities and so on so it's very shaky to see know i think that's as you said as you both said to just summarize is that we need zeke roll ups or optimistic words to provide a similar scalability as like something like pulling on provides right now but without uh memorizing doing too many compromises on security yeah and also like i understand like to the end user they can't see security and so you can't rely solely on the security like it has to be other incentives to use roll-ups and as less you are trying to create incentives obviously other than security even a very strong percentage and i like i generally genuinely believe and that if we make you know if you make it possible to deploy roll-ups or make it possible to deploy your own blockchain as easy as it is to a small contract and then not only will that be more secure but will also be the preferred way because it's simply easier to correctly create your own execution environment create your own team then be mounted by you know the very tight constraints of the epa yeah that doesn't make sense so still on public security difficulties um what failures in there is do you [Music] [Music] we have to remember that this is all learning technology uh so robert carlos has been in production for a year optimistic products have not been production ever and uh there will be bugs there will be uh problems and security vulnerabilities and people will fight them and we'll go through it for a number of two preferred things we should just expect that so we should not rely on a single uh line of defense we should be layering our defense with multiple things we should do a lot of stuff like um [Music] insurance in the beginning to test things out before they uh enter through scale before they become the alternative or lots of financial system so like the the only way to ensure that something is is really secure is that if it's been in production for a long period of time and it's not big that the system can be insurance if you're billions of dollars one two three years uh that you can probably trust it but if you make a small change in the system you can already introduce like the this is very interesting and interesting question like how you deal with the upgrades for example but expect your ones and just like be ready for it too much money in any of those systems i would like to add just a tiny additional thing that is specific to our roll-ups are deployed right now is like um if you have like a centralized sequencer or in both cases like zika warm-ups or optimistic vlogs it makes it easier at least for short periods of time maybe it makes it easier to censor or like hold the network and so that's why i think it's also important that the world of chains are actually like real people and i believe that the purpose of blockchains is to be functioning as a social coordination layer so we talk about can you talk a little bit about layer one but there's also a layer zero which is social consensus like every time you have you know a hardcore theory you have to get spatial consensus from their zero and particularly what you have to get special consensus and back in 2016 when there was this massive dial high criterium you have to go back to social consensus and people and they theoretically do hard fork and effectively and reverse the hack and i think that's perfectly fine and one of the play but it's not ideal if you create a smart question ethereum you cannot expect for the entire ecosystem to hard fork just because your specific quantifier was a hack but that's why i think with the with the model that we're trying to create as celestia where you have these specific rollouts and hardcore you can go back to the social consensus of that specific role up and hard to walk without affecting directly all other rollups and there's still the issue of how do you be able to cross-train bridges between roll-outs and other robots but in the case of music follow-up and even though mr wallace has a long road that's a one-week withdrawal period in some way that provides the advantage because it provides the ability for the social consensus to go back to the social consequences [Music] to really to change the rules you finally have this i agree on the issue of uh larissa and social consensus business individual abortions are foreign but it's also it can be a dangerous role if we rely too much on social consensus especially in the absence of uh stability mechanisms like if if the system is not as stable and doesn't have a stable state and then you say oh it's going to remain stable because like we know that we will always rely on such processes in the end this can be very dangerous so i i you know like with the dollar situation i think there would be much better off if the incident if the president was not set with immutability and instead uh we remained for example there was the the software which led white hot white hackers to get money back not all of them but significant portion so if you will be much better off without the fork and just going this far with build software is my opinion so we should preserve cause as much as possible uh but of course like with the final like the source of powers people that they they decide what the law is that yeah sure and we don't disagree there and i think the point is that um just because if you have this social consensus later the whole point of blockchains is to reduce the cost of social coordination and that does and that is why you should make sure your protocol is because the point is to reduce and reduce the um chances of your essential consensus over there rather than relying explicitly on system processes there should [Music] yeah one last thing to bring up before we switch it his attention to this is how opportunistic option governance happens do you have any specific thoughts on how that can be basically influenced by let's say the social consensus 51 of the coins can change the rules of the person i think that's interesting but that's not something i would advocate for myself because that effectively creates like a rule like they say that the rules of the chain should be decided by whoever has the most captain whereas the point of opportunity is that um the rules of the chain uh like the whole point of me is that if this is one percent attack or or this earnings majority of dollar doesn't change and should not be able to change the rules of the chain and that's why users need to independently validate the transactions of the chain and to make sure that all transactions are added but like if it's the business because you have to trust the port producers but if the bot producers are allowed to change the rules [Music] it's not necessarily invalid but it changes some of the key values that i think are important um a bunch of improvements i would i would give more i think exactly that one's for for indications but ultimately you should rely on official social governance and and to the actual stakeholders in the community not necessarily way by wealth but already by maybe informally important [Music] case for launching governance for things like taos where people want to tell you like you want to match some treasury and this treasure is um it cannot explicitly like you really need a majority of those like not not at the mental level like not changing the rules of the football team itself for the reasons which uh staffing described and also uh i think it's it's really beautiful what we have today with blockchains without that affordable in that blockchains are inherently anarchic and voluntary systems everyone who participates in blockchain does this because they believe it is better for them to participate no one there's no hershey if you don't like the rules of this chain because of like you don't like this particular branch with this particular community you can always walk away just your new rules or not accept the change caused by the majority and you just see and you have your own community and and then you participate there voluntarily with zero conversion anywhere so in in situations where like which status has where you can the majority can impose rules in everyone else the dispute disappears all of a sudden it's a majority role system which is very different again people are free to experiment with that and they can always support even if the material doesn't like it right so like but no one can prevent that i can always work tests and just build my own a system which functions in a different way so in a way this like 51 rule changing is just just a statement it's just a narrative it's it's not like technically enforceable uh so the but like philosophically i think it's better to just uh articulate it uh out here that is a system in which um cursion i just want to move here um to what muslim said there's this middle ground where um on-chain governance could very much look like in the cosmos model where you have like on-chain signaling mostly though it's not like in tasers where you vote and then it's like one chain and forced or something like this but um instead you just vote with the token and i don't i i'm actually a big fan of this um but so for celestia um we want the base layer to be as animated and having as little execution as possible so um if we decided to go with the ethereum model and not do any launching governments there the beauty of the system is that you could actually have like a governance roller where you can like do the signaling on there and you could actually apply it to the token if you wanted to so maybe uh like ibc like they're not changing communication protocol which is also used in the cosmos world where you could if you wanted to you could tie the token of the roll up to the main chain um otherwise you can still have like a government's wallet so there's a lot of middle ground that could be could be used and it needs to be explored awesome um yes just to switch directions a little bit um back to what um briefly mentioned with opportunities having this withdrawal secreted um he framed it as a positive in the scenario but typically it seems a negative because you would want to have immediate withdrawal capabilities with bridges getting more mature and equity providers come take distance that seems to be less and lesser than the issue is that their bigger disagreement um yeah i'm sure [Music] so let's say like you're on a roll-up chain want to transfer your assets to some other chain and you spend it there then instead you have to label it you didn't sell you have to wait a week you can use the equivalency provider and it would be the provider would have an account on both robots or both chains and you you send the account on um you send your funds to the the within the provider account under the roll update where you withdraw from and then they give you assets on the roll-up or chain that you want to withdraw to and that's perfectly secure because the degree provider instead of relying or looking for wordpress they can validate the rollout box for themselves and when they value the roadblocks they can be completely sure that it's impossible to generate a footprint for it and therefore they can be completely sure they will definitely get their pumps yeah absolutely i i disagree uh because there are many situations where it won't work smoothly uh in my opinion uh for example in times of volatility where the movement is strictly or mostly unidirectional so everyone wants to leave this chain and go on and sell some donuts and then you quickly will drain out the capacity of the uh providers and it will become just very expensive like you will have to pay a huge premium on or whatever we actually saw this happening with polyglot certain like on the on by thursday there was a 12 very significant drop in the press and everyone rushed to exchange was traded significantly at a discount compared to one by one but there is also a coordination problem that results in cost problems because you need to keep this massive amount of capital idle part for no reason just like that for keeping that capacity how much do you keep there one million one billion you know like and then so you need to balance it you need to see exactly like what's the usage is what's like what's the daily fluctuation of this uh exit volume and so on i think it's going to be really hard and it will just create all of the cost it will all be transformed from the costs for the end users yeah turtles but but but the scenario is the same scenario it's a scenario where um jesus cannot reassure their father's potential but seems to work it also happened in the waterfalls in the case of the malicious [Music] [Music] [Music] where you can have sovereign roll-ups that are sort of like like chains in their own right and and so the four priests don't need to be listed on chain but can be distributed within the peer-to-peer network of that roll-up sub network and because you've distributed four persons particular network you can have a much much lower challenge period um within that weather network because there's a much lower network syncing delay to distribute a footprint within a peer-to-peer network then there is to actually post to one chain and wait for mine to accept that um so that you can be like you can you would use the stream like the template for software however you still have the challenge period with with with crosstalk bridges like if you actually um transfer your wallet from one to the wall to another [Music] layer of the launching and a little bit of ibc to like to the other chain but use leverage ipc to like submit to the flop somewhere that is like available to you into the world instead of like waiting you know you cannot make us you cannot assume that the challenge period will be too low because like you don't know how much money the capacity there is like maybe the change is really busy and like maybe miners would actually have it all regulations [Music] make less assumptions you can easily make more assumptions about it about depending on what you control then yeah so the follow-up question i want to ask that is relevant to draws or the food providers between roll-ups um are there any specific advantages that zk volts have or relatives and vice versa that deal specifically would not come to the assets because we're seeing that is becoming more popular through in-game assets as on this one [Music] uh will prevail in more questions because of the properties they have and one obvious uh advantage which is insurmountable for our policy class is that we edited for entities from l2201 can now be accelerated in optimistic follow-ups and easy girls it's mainly very fast just a few minutes which takes too generic improve and apart from that i think that you live with nft is inherently a very popular movement and you're gonna have a lot of difficulties like it's a um it's something that caters very much to the mass audience and you're going to have a lot of entities only a fraction of them is going to be valuable most of them are not going to be variables you you like roll-ups have cost because they provide this high level of security so they're very well suited for d5 high-value transactions but not so much with these micro transactions so my [Music] feeling is that nft7 will be very popular about something like activeporter or sidechains but with zika porter it's it's great because you can easily transfer them from this keyboard account to the zquality account once you get some really valuable editing because it's also it's very popular and with art you never know like it can happen overnight like it probably does make sense to don't want to see you almost because it's not completely application it's just like a transfer of assets and these guys right now are well suited towards like simple transparent assets and they're not very well suited right now to get more complicated like applications that have more complicated logic and long term that might be solved and i know some people are trying to work on like one general like purpose um having a general place complications [Music] but it's not because [Music] you mentioned that the zika porter and the uh [Music] do you mean exactly what you just said that you can easily like transfer from one account to the other and it's so it's always an either or [Music] within the system they are uh indistinguishable essentially the the difference is like outside of the validated level who publisher are now published with database which is extremely observable by the uh by the users but inside the system there is no distinction you just have one address the other has some coverage stairs and some of the bounces there so it's really it's seamless just like everyone yeah let's see thank you so in a row of centric world um i know that you said you think that there's going to be one instance of zika sync but in the celestial world there's going to be multiple roll-ups right so you can consider both scenarios um in a scenario where there are multiple roll-ups how did you envision um multiple apps being on one roll-up or one roll of specific or one absolute chain um affecting and leaving and travel ability um yes i think your effect is that learning like yeah it's last year we have multiple rollouts both for scalability reasons and for um 30 reasons because um like you you don't want to it's not scalable to have like a massive uh like one role of doing more execution because you need to um have an activator with a lot of resources to you know to um that chain and also you have and also you have to have fog proof generators that have a lot of resources uh you all have the same issue because you still reflect you still need the cp approver to process all the transactions but you don't have the recreation issue this is constant regulation cost as fast and then the second reason is flexibility we want people to have to have flexibility of creating um their own like creating different execution environments like you don't want to have like one roll-up that's just easy or what i mean like someone can break it later someone can definitely click on this first year um but like we don't want to we don't to be able to have people create their own execution environment to be able to innovate and different things but i'll let you hear about myself which is payments there's not much detail flexibility of different execution environments because like there's only one way to do payments there's not how much does it like [Music] yeah this is true but then you normally don't just want to transfers you have to do transfers will then you want to remain within the system so think from the user perspective you have one bullet have some something some balance in it you want sometimes you want to send a transaction to you send somebody to a friend or pay for something online but then you will also want to participate in d5 from the same property [Music] it's like why is it away from the possibility like saying like you should like embed a bunch of d5 vehicles into this they can transfer things but they can also invoke contracts and they can program what they can convert the more interesting question is like do you want to experiment with the different execution environments evm or non-avm compatible and this is a really big question and it's not the best language it's not the best api but it's it got sticky it's actually terrible in many ways but it gets sticky and now it's it's standard there is no question like no no understanding with browsers that support alternative apis and very much just supports javascript and dom and standard html things right so i'm afraid we're at this point with evm at least for the durable future it could be this like there is no like edl compatibility will be this lingual franchise of um yeah i very strongly believe that there's like the necessity to like innovate and experiment with different things especially like everybody for instance mentioned you cannot come up with a perfect solution in all cases and the beauty like in celestia is that you can like have different literally have different roll-ups that deal differently with this and also um you know you mentioned telescopes it's a very good analogy but i i i'm very happy that although javascript maybe like in the browser the default okay there's like a bunch of other languages that we as developers can use and i'm very happy about this fact and i think also um we already live in a world where people build like in different languages not only using evm and also in using updates development still have an evm compatible execution environment on top of for instance celestia and so there's no there's no limit i guess it's why would we limit ourselves to just javascript in quotes like even if also i think it's it's we're still i still believe it's quite early in my logic space and most of the new innovations are like the the yeah the innovation happens much faster than in the broader world so even if javascript in quotes might be the standard now like six years from now the world will be completely different and i think that's a good thing [Music] yeah so it's also a lot about language it's also about resource pricing and so it's like withdrawals providing a bit different because uh like people have created all kinds of things to make javascript more powerful like you know jquery and their languages that compel you compile cd javascript like there's all these days like stuff like the js and for coffeescript to make it more powerful um but that's that was from javascript because um javascript has never been server script doesn't run like global share for permission so you can do all these like abstractions that can be done on local machines or within the browser but it's much more difficult to do that with computer like ethereum and like i implemented is like electric things like adjectives um it kind of cuts the library's abilities like you've got the gas cost is 2 billion gas for example and there's no way for me to optimize that um like without convincing like like the ethereum projects you need to do which you do a lot for introducing your own code and so it's much more than here there's a lot of like software to introduce if [Music] with specific things that are more expensive than medical ethereum you have to do health blocks to just using our codes to do that [Music] which is what is your long-term vision for the crypto list as a whole and how do you envision celestia there's a decent plan to that specifically with respect to privacy transparency and user adoption sure so like you think is a mission-driven project the mission is to bring crypto to the hands of very well it's just a question how it's not like it's not a question but whether or not it will happen it will happen it's like we have to figure out how to do it exactly so we start with what we have now it will bring us to some multiple uh of the users potentially possible ethereum today so we'll probably invest like we may have like hundreds of millions of dollars not billions yet but eventually we have to get billions uh [Music] i just [Music] can't see a world where this is not happening for a variety of reasons for from social perspectives like there's a huge demand for this music event this is a problem many people have and don't know they have uh and there will be more events in the traditional finance world that blue push people don't development will make them embrace this technologies more and also the young generation of the translators are just very uh token and grouped today like they're not just situations they like generational shifts from now uh the majority of people in the world will be just like natively exposed to that it's just inevitable like governments they will all potentially have their own value system or or or a decentralized application or a chain to either track if we need the governor's purposes or value transfer purposes or um or just to be called information to make it more transparent and i see a mental world where every community has its own kind of like state on some kind of chain um or on the internet um to keep track of either value or governance and it's just going to be awful like to have every community have a having a shared state on a shared environment and but if you make it possible for for communities to easily deploy your own software chains um within seconds then i think if you make a difference it will eventually happen and the only kind of question there is like from a technical perspective is it how how do you make those different chains associated communities like possible because right now if you create a smart contract you can easily put a call ultimate contracts in ethereum and do stuff and communicate with all smart contracts but in a world where everything is a better roll up and if interoperability and visibility between those robots and communities becomes a little bit more tricky and i think that's but unfortunately i think uh we're going to deal with that because that's what's what's very happening today is after the past 10 years blockchain developers have basically gotten a free launch uh with conversability like they haven't had to think about impossibility of them like just employers one contract and just call your core smart contracts very easily but even the ethereum in the future like the theory to point out that that's no longer very case like you have to have this role of century word like roadmap where people were expected to create their own more affordable applications and and so you have to accept the fact that developers will have to think more carefully or bake in accountability directly explicitly in their applications and technologies like the cosmos ibc will be very important for that pocket that yeah i'm very much aligned with like what um vision is i i'm just adding i just want to add but i think it's not a massive option and these global communities and that interoperate with each other is not just something we want to push or is like nice to have from a technical perspective or it's like because people are already crypto native or whatever but i believe that um eventually like something like some form of like global coordination across communities is also like a necessity for us like as a global society all right thanks for your answers [Music] that's the question alice i should have answered it before but uh it's related to the key sync and the water so do the async and ziggy porter support inter contract like communication or evm so can you uh using sdk order and ddc like share state between countries [Music] inside advocacy uh now using cpc like using those lots of discrimination so like you said that zkc using worker is idiom compatible with the cable up so uh like and it runs vm at some point and post uh the results of chain like on player one so is it possible for to do like roll up level in your contract like so you like deploy one contract and other contract and can they uh interact with each other it says this year well this is a great question thank you so much that means like i i i still didn't do the job when explaining the representation like i was trying doing my best but like i need to find a good wording so this is what we meant when we say they are seamlessly interoperable and composable so like essentially like everything is inside this thing you can think of it as a as a model of ethereum so the answer is clearly yes you can deploy multiple contracts you can call each other these calls can be atomic uh they will execute share the state access each other's variables good delegate call do normal call and everything works just exactly the same as what i want does this have some questions so there is very hard there is no elimination like if you run on on there is no contra computation on the level well there will be some limitations like you probably cannot do like one million calls in the same block like there will be some soft limitations based on or currently a very [Music] how high how deep is your versions that can be how many contracts can be made how many calls can there be uh in a single transaction in the block and so on there will be like some technical nature of the proof generation although we have requested four generations with radically over unlimited we just think there will be some nuances there but from practical standpoint it won't affect like most people so like these are very very high thanks i actually have a follow-up question today like what if you hit capacity in that area and you deploy another such like another instance of that how will they involve them yeah there's like always right too i watch a simple game [Music] [Music] uh and we can chain as many of them in a single big hole block as we can so first yeah [Music] we just like have a big powerful sequential processor which takes transactions and then puts them in the block and then hit the block like this as long as you need i mean there's there's limit to how um [Music] but let's say you get a quarantine where there's still a there's still a limit to how much like this certain transactions so i guess the question is like can you parallelize the the proving development into multiple like causes uh sure so this is the limitation of all the incompatible systems shared because the vm is special and there have been proposals by uh vitali muttering for example to add a normally on top of evm transactions to make choice a parallel transaction process possible where you specify it's a long-term complete language which accounts are going to be touched by this collection and then you can build a tree of dependencies and then you can execute the sub-paths industries [Music] and this can be happening this will probably happen in the future like the this is the pretty far future because for now the bottleneck of evm uh compatible chains like with actually gas and everything which is not basically cpu it's not the bandwidth it's the uh random storage access uh and this could be easily so like this this could be easily boosted mainfold if you just store all of your storage in the around in memory you disagree but what this will give you is requirements for running the processor node will be very high which is okay for zt roll-ups which is not okay for optimistic calls so for for executives it's perfectly fine yes we have high requirements for running a node you have to run it in a very powerful machine with lots of cpus and lots of batteries and you cannot do anything wrong anyway because you you will produce the proof and you will share this book with everyone like it will be reflected here but i agree this won't work for optimistic homes because everyone should be able to run if you want other consumer hardware and then you can have this limitation okay so seriously i have multiple recursive um [Music] [Music] you could do that if you wanted you could build a hierarchy of chains where you like such a shards where your execution each of the chart this is possible we use craft cd in the original cpa portrait post but and this will probably indeed happen so some of the application specific community specific uh uh systems who will be like this like games they will have their own chart and the the most transactions happens within the shark they only [Music] no one else no need to know except for the relative to ethereum is you could like put the validator for the aggregator do are like pretty equal in this regard if you don't address so many problems specifically then you're down to your sequencer whatever it may be minor extraction the sequencer allows that's what you have if you have a centralized sequencer they can do whatever they want you can form blocks that make gray and [Music] sequencer it's a question of how you structure it right and in general what's your philosophical position that you need i can say that that evil because it puts a certain group of users in a much more privileged position than everyone else and this is what blockchains are against that's if you want the mining pool operator has a lot more power than uh than the um provides the demanding shares like they can do in a secretive manner so that no one notices immediately and they get all the profit to themselves right and they don't share it with with the um mining cash break with the actual miners and they might understand hold them accountable unlike just distribution rewards so for the kissing as long as uh there is a single signature which is centralized uh uh this the operator just guarantees that there will be no reading but transactions are going to be served on first counters for surf order with the decentralized sequencer we'll have small low latency blocks within a second so this will lower the width of opportunity to reorder transactions because you need to provide the confirmation as soon as possible and in the long run we'll have something like uh time locked encryption prevent censorship and movie all together fundamentally because the the minus one you know what they're saying but what's going on until it's um no i was wondering how are you doing your time and to have another question yeah we said well with questions i can we do two questions please sure i'll make it quick i'll try to i have a question you mentioned ultimately what you're referring to and the second question what's your friend with father knots like first question is about what is what do you mean by automatic automatic bug bounty and second question you mentioned about the plan with honeypots what are you going to do it's the same thing so like automated background is just a convert which has some value in it and if you crack it you get it so like this is or you could you could do like more stuff like if you find a vulnerability in this corner and you can prove that there is a vulnerability in some way like for example you can destroy it not just steal the funds from it but you feel like you have a separate convert which points to this one and it will release the the bounty to whoever can prove that they destroyed this card they executed the transaction that led to destruction uh this would be something like this like this this will provide you more um like if for you as a exploiter or whitehead hacker who like hacks around do be very guaranteed uh rather than relying on reputation and trust in project owners who might or i will give you a lot so this that's what they call fine parts thank you yeah quickly um it's it's mostly to do with hey but i guess also like philosophically between what role looks where and the source of where they're going there seems to be a lack of discernibility in something that zk sync does and that it provides you can kind of say group it is arbitrary occasion or you could say it's um well you have this validation of state transitions for for any given proof in inside compatible versus like what would say earlier stuff like say money being kind of limited to what they can do and i think a lot of people mismatch between normal recursion normal robots and then arbitrary recursion first whether state transitions or cairo do with the defining cpu in the circuit do you think more discernible language ought to be provided so people kind of know where it was and then what the future may be so do you think multicellular language must be given so people understand the difference between like validating a state transition for any rolled up truthful or any purchase going in in what zk synth two point totals or in what characters versus non zk evm in this case compatible roll ups like like previous things like your money and stuff so you're just saying like well you should provide a more strict rigorous language to distinguish between different types of but i guess recursion methods on projects because people seem to batch together companies like loot ring and mirror and aztec with sort of the types of things going on now and they are quite different in what they apply to and what they provide i mean of course like inner workings are different like software's completely different but what they actually plan on doing and what they provide really is quite different and they seem to be brought together or stuck together and that doesn't seem to mold quite well oh i see so well you have a hierarchy of uh classification of systems right actually like you
