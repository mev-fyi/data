in theory price updates moving through solana are moving at the speed of light through fiber which is as fast as news travels and then it's competitive with something like nasdaq and cme so that's kind of the dream the horizon and this is how we've been building like everything you know looking at that final state how do we get there and what are the pieces we need to get to and when you kind of take that perspective you don't really care if the architecture is modular or monolithic what you care about is can we synchronize like information globally as close to the speed of light as possible and usually at least so far there's no gains to be had using a modular architecture that right now everything that we've been doing is around this like monolithic state because that's what's going to get us closer to that final state of you know global information symmetry all right well i'm excited for mustafa's response to that yeah like i think this discussion um kind of highlights the key kind of philosophical difference between like solana and systems like celestia or ethereum which is i think solana kind of you know systems like solana view blockchains more as a distributed computing you know platform where you can like you know have a global settlement whereas like we like celestia and also other systems like bitcoin and ethereum we see blockchains fundamentally the main the the fundamental purpose of blockchains is that it's a verifiable uh competing platform not just distributed but very very verifiable and and that means there's a there's a focus on you know decentralization in that setting means that you need to allow light nodes to verify the state of the chain uh otherwise like if your goal is just simply to have you know fast like like fast agreement on the state how does that goal like fundamentally differentiate from you know what web 2 achieves with essentially with a centralized or distributed database even um like you could argue you know that the fundamental difference is that you have a global set of distributed parties agreeing on that state and but without the ability for end users to verify these dates in my opinion that takes away one of the key properties of blockchains which is that like well-resourced actors cannot violate what the social consensus of the chain has agreed what the rules of the chain are like like like if this lawn or valde is for example wanted to change the rules of the chain how would end users like verify that without running a you know a well-resourced node
