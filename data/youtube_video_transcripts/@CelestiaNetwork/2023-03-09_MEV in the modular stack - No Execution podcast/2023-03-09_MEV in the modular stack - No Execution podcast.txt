so first of all thanks everyone for joining obviously the the speakers and all of you guys listening in um we're doing this space because Celestia is you know very interested in uh pursuing sort of what the next thing is and trying to understand how the space is evolving and I think one of the most interesting new topics to explore is Mev in the modular stack and so we're really excited to kind of have this conversation and hopefully you know it doesn't just end here but keeps going and there's more kind of ongoing conversations that get sparked from this um I also want to say that the modular category is still so early that a lot of these things are changing you know by the by the month and so like if we had had this space a month previously we probably would have had a lot of different answers and it'll probably change significantly a month from now too so um with that Preamble finished I first want to turn this stage over to the speakers I'd love for you guys to introduce yourselves and your projects um so why don't we start with uh you Elijah yeah sure um so I'm Elijah um I work on application specific infrastructure mostly uh decentralized Finance um at Duality we're currently building um a next-gen DEX with a focus on how can we recapture Mev and return it back to liquidity providers because you know we sort of see this as a major problem um you know if you've you know seen a lot of the the recent like news and Analysis on you know uniswap LPS and um you know impermanent loss loss versus rebalancing all these different ideas uh you know we sort of see this as like a critical problem to to scaling uh dexes um so yes that's that's been a major Focus I do a lot of research engineering and occasionally like help out with operations um but um you know my focus is very heavily into like you know understanding the Dynamics of you know Mev especially in the context of application specific infrastructure and you know we've been thinking as well about Celestia and how how Celestia fits into the picture there so excited to share some thoughts awesome thank you so yeah you guys are trying to make sure that LPS don't get wrecked which they seem to um all right Josh why don't you um let's give us a background in Astra all right I'm Josh I'm the CEO and founder of Austria we're building the shared sequencer Network um and so kind of I guess how Mev kind of comes into that is just like sequencing in general it's kind of the layer where Mev gets extracted like fundamentally right Mev is kind of at least in my view um this value that can be extracted based on kind of contextual ordering of transactions where a more naive you know uh transaction pricing mechanism um would just assume that like every transaction is like equivalently valuable relative to kind of resource consumption and Meb is you know kind of changing that Dynamic we're saying like yeah one transaction is worth more then another transaction if they're ordered in a different way relative to each other and so when we're thinking about providing shared sequencing for multiple kind of Roll-Ups in this modular ecosystem we need to be thinking ahead of you know what are the implications of Mev how are we designing that into our system um and what impact is that going to have on you know adoption of our shared sequencer for kind of Downstream chains thank you Barry let's hear about skip yeah uh I am one of the co-founders of skip we build uh Mev infrastructure for Sovereign app chains and Roll-Ups we build two kinds of solutions one is uh out of protocol uh off-chain systems that help intelligently build blocks on behalf of these Roll-Ups in these chains so that they can extract as much healthy Mev as possible and prevent the kinds of harmful Mev that they want to avoid like front running and sandwich attacks and they can redirect that Revenue back to the stakeholders in their chain that they believe as a community deserve it or need it or should have it and the second kind is in protocol solutions that do similar things around trying to use the application blockchain stack to give validators superpowers to build their own blocks in a way that can be decentralized and integrated into the protocol so the protocol has more native control over what Mev can and can't support even without any kind of off-chain actor we're on a bunch of different chains right now throughout Cosmos Juno terra2 Atmos com Dex injective and are launching on a handful of others later this month and excited to spend more time in the Celeste ecosystem and the roll-up ecosystem amazing yeah we have a great representation of different people thinking about mov from different angles from you know amm's indexes to sequencers to Sovereign mov in the causeless ecosystem and and truly we're blessed to have these guests here today because they're some of the I would say foremost thinkers on these like evolving space of mbv especially this Cutting Edge of modular Meb so um with those backgrounds finished I want to start with just we need to sort of lay the foundation for the rest of the conversation about you know what is the landscape of mvv today what are modular blockchains and how do modular blockchains change the landscape of mbvu how do we how do we see them so the MVP landscape evolving due to this new uh sort of architecture for blockchains so I don't know if anyone wants to sort of take a stab at that first um but I'll open the floor for you guys to jump in and sort of help likely the background for the whole topic yeah that's that's super helpful Nick I'm probably out of Elijah and Josh the the least qualified to try to define the modular stack for people but I can start by trying to talk about sort of like what is Mev actually mean a little bit um just so people have some context because I find oftentimes like we throw these terms around and nobody really knows what we're talking about and Mev is one of those words that people used to refer to a million different things but um at the highest level like we're talking about the process by which blocks get built right there is a um the way blockchains and Roll-Ups work is you have users who sign their transactions that contain some information about what they're trying to do um and they sign them and they broadcast them into the network and sometime later those transactions all get hoovered up and combined into a block that gets posted onto the network and Mev is all about that sort of dark space in between um where which is not governed by the protocol and which can exist in a lot of different ways and and looks very different for nl1 or a roll-up or an L3 and but it has really meaningful Financial consequences for all of the users of the chain like where transactions are ordered what transactions are included or aren't included um obviously as consequences for censorship but it also has consequences for you know how much money individual Traders can make or lose and you know whether LPS are able to be profitable or not and those kinds of things and so when we're talking about Mev systems we're really talking about systems that are like the fabric between like order flow on chains so those transactions and and block space and and how we combine those things into blocks wonderful you're great it's a very very kind of giving us a great I think overview of you know what Mev is and I guess I can give an overview of kind of what we mean when we talk about like the modular stack here or like the you know the modular ecosystem um so you know if we think about like a monolithic blockchain you know and then we think about like you know Barry's explanation of Mev in that context right there is um you know some leader selection mechanism right so it's whether it's like you know ethereum's kind of stake system or you know um something like tendermint um there's some mechanism by which like a block proposer is chosen and then that proposer generally in these systems has you know called like a monopoly on The Ordering of transactions within that block and generally how we see this in say like flashbots land like on ethereum um they will bid out you know the rights essentially for who wants to pay the most to order blocks in a certain way that is presumably profitable for the people kind of placing those bids um in the modular ecosystem we move away from this single layered uh monolithic chain where now we have multiple chains and therefore there are multiple blocks being produced so you know using kind of a live example here right you will look at like optimism or arbitrum I mean in those cases both systems have you know centralized sequencers so there's really one party producing the block for the roll-up and I think arbitrums example from their white paper is like a little easier to get a reason about um and so they have the sequencer and you transactions go into kind of this one point so you know it's very mentioned right there's not this necessarily like mempool that is sharing around these transactions that then are kind of out in the open for people to decide how they want to order them there's just a single party that receives the transactions and then it at its own discretion decides how to order every single block but then the next step that kind of makes this modular right is that it chooses to assemble this block and write it down to another chain that it uses for data availability and so there's a lot of debate in you know roll-up spaces around definitions of finality and I'm not sure finality is even the right word but you know that's a digression um but generally like about what kind of guarantees you get from when the transaction is safe to be trusted based on whatever mechanisms whether they're bridging or just for like kind of user application um but that's usually dependent on this bundle of transactions this block being written in some kind of batch of you know one or more blocks down to the data availability layer um whereas in optimism's case they're using ethereum in a sovereign roll-up they would be using Celestia um and so there's a question of kind of this finality and I think the kind of question that comes up here is you know when you submit a block to a layer below again that has to kind of go into the mempool of that that data availability layer below you and there's this kind of open question of are there implications of Mev based on the Block proposer on that layer below you which is going to be tenement based in Celestia's case and whether or not they want to accept the batch of the transactions from the role up above you whether they would censor that whether you need to pay you know a bid to get get that included sooner rather than later and all the kind of standard Mev questions about that and you know the thing that's kind of you know Upstream from that is is the question of finality of the transaction on the roll-up layer and if that is dependent on the layer below it um then there's at least some kind of value that that could potentially be you know like an MVP right like there's a value for you getting that transaction posted on the ba layer and maybe there's a mechanism by which the da layer or the block composer on it may try to extract that value through you know some kind of you know Mev auction mechanism um all interesting points like I I think like that's one thing that you know I I haven't gone so deep into but is a really great point which is that like finality and like the extra gadgets you can you know use in finality you know what's what role does that play in Mev um you know I I think of me being like a little bit of like a simpler way obviously it's not a simple topic to reason about always but you know the the definition I would give that you know has been most useful for me is right like you know someone always wants to be first and everyone wants to be included right and Mev is just the value that you can get from you know how you order transactions and you know taking you know taking people's payments to rep you know for how much they value being at you know in a certain point in that order and also just taking people's value for just being included in the first place so maybe just about uh ordering inclusion and like I think you know what excites me about modular Mev which you know I think Josh actually brought up a really interesting point about the finality piece I actually think like most of modular Mev is the same tricks as monolithic Mev just in a slightly different disguise and so I think like you know modular Mev is just going to boil down to the same things which is you know how much does someone want to pay to be first and you know how much does someone want to pay to be included and um so I think like there's going to be some interesting you know there's some interesting applications that you know implications you know with the sequencing layer uh but yeah I think that's uh that's that's like I think where you know how I've been thinking about it so to summarize um Mev is like this this value that can be sort of extracted or created by imposing a certain ordering of transactions in a block and in the modular stack the modular stack is kind of like now instead of having one single mempool one single like blockchain one block you kind of have multiple blockchains kind of running on top of each other and so you have like in different layers of the data availability layer at the bottom you may have a settlement layer and an execution layer um you may also have sort of like a shared sequencer Network within that which will definitely dive into more deeply but um to me to kind of summarize like I like Barry's mental model of like there's a user sending a transaction there's this black box and then it gets included in in the protocol in a block and that what happens in that sort of in between space is Mev and in a modular stack like that space kind of gets uh stretched out or like there's more steps in it because you know you you might submit your transaction to the execution layer and the sequencer or that layer might put into their block but then that execution layer block has to go for example to the settlement layer and be ordered there and then finally to the DA layer so there's just a lot more I guess steps and room for uh different types of ordering at the end of the day is maybe potentially one way to think about it I didn't get I think that's a great way to to put it uh it's like when you have a monolithic chain like the process from sorry I'm just gonna stop talking there's some kind of announcements oh they're getting expanded where you said it like and I guess I'll try to summarize it like my words right like Nick I think your summary was good in that you know we think about if we think about an inclusion in ordering right like for a user to get a transaction to let's say like the level of finality that they want or or it's like good enough for them you know if we think about this in like a general payment thing right like health and finals the attraction have to be for the good you are presumably transacting for to kind of be given to you in a monolithic stack right there's just the one block once it's included in that block you're like done but in uh modular staff you think okay it has to go through the roll up and then presumably the roll-up have to also um get the transaction included in the block for the da layer and and that is kind of the finality so you add this extra hop in the middle and the question is you know what can occur at that hop that you know obviously can't happen in a monolithic stack where that hop does not exist great uh that segues really well into I want to dive a little bit deeper into this and pose the question of you know where do we think that Mev will be captured in the modular stack will it be at the data availability layer a settlement layer the execution layer or will it be you know this shared sequencer layer that captures it um and is is there should we try to design the modular stack in a way that a certain layer certain layer is like it doesn't Mev doesn't like leak down to or uh or Mev gets captured a particular layer like is it is it desirable um to design the modular stack in a way that like is more intentional about directing where mov goes yeah uh great questions um I think like the the first question which is like you know where will Mev accrue in the modular stack is like one that will largely depend on like the norms and culture around validators uh I think like this is a point that like I've heard Barry talk a lot about um and you know he's convinced me of this which is that like while there's these like formal ways we can Define Mev and you know show how they can be captured at the end of the day right these you know there's like a social layer below it uh that you know has some sort of you know that that has some sort of way that they want to govern their application right there's like the set of validators who at the end of the day are coming to consensus on like a lot of these norms and that's like seen a lot in like the Sovereign World um with uh with uh you know app chains um that said if you look in you know the direction of like ethereum um it's you know they've sort of taken this approach that like you know Revenue will be maxed out eventually and so we might as well try to like Excel tolerate the process and so like everyone's sort of like fighting for themselves and everyone should just try to maximize Revenue by like running these like you know combinatorial auctions for for Block space um so I think like there's been a spectrum of ways that you know communities have treated Mev you know you've seen like app chains which you know basically banned sandwiching and like threatened with uh social slashing but you've also seen you know you know generalized smart contract platforms to something very different which is almost like encourage the capture of me they uh to accelerate you know it's to to sort of push people to think more clever about mechanism design uh so I think it'll largely depend on like what sort of culture and Norms exist um and sort of like at that level um I also think like you know if if you know you don't want to leave it up to like what Norms develop or you know what culture will sort of surround you know the validator side of like you know modular ecosystem um you know it becomes clear it's definitely desirable to Design Systems to try to you know be proactive about taking a stance on it either in the form of like wanting to make it more efficient to be captured for validators and or accrue to the application Level you know I feel very strongly you should probably accrue to the application Level and users specifically um so you know I think there's like a bunch of different directions to go and do that um and you know we can get more into that you know I don't know if Now's the Time For That or later but um you know that's those are sort of my high level thoughts there you know I could give kind of an opinion that's like less on kind of the where you put the value and what I mean that's like you know whether you're giving it back to the validators where you're going back to the application the application developers or the users and more so thinking about it in kind of like an architectural capacity and thinking about you know what are the kind of negative externalities potentially of Mev and so you know prior to flashbot right you know I think a lot of people are familiar with the idea of like a priority gas auction where you know the best way to kind of get this probabilistic likelihood of you getting to close an Arbitrage or whatever was just spamming the network um and it's very obvious that like it's undesirable for everyone else who's not one of these you know Meb Searchers or whatever trying to close this ARP who have some presumed expected profit if they land a transaction if you're just some normal person wanting to trade or do whatever kind of functionality on the Chain then you're obviously bothered by this kind of Noisy Neighbor who is you know dramatically increasing the gas prices so there's this negative externality that I think when when we think about the opinionated question of like where do we want to Mev to go you can think about where do we want the value of Mev to go but I can also think about it like where do we want the the activity um through which Mev is extracted so this kind of you know peer-to-peer or kind of transactional activity to occur um and and my opinion is is essentially like at a bare minimum we want to make sure that the extraction of Mev is done in an efficient manner such that it is not kind of polluting the chain for users who may not be you know particularly interested in kind of participating in whatever kind of Arbitrage game is happening yeah so I guess what I was angry is like in the architectural structure of like Mev extraction so less so on kind of the social question of like where you know who deserves the Mev and more so like the negative externalities in the envy and what defines kind of where the Mez can be extracted is this question of like what is the canonical chain and and that to some degree defines um kind of things around around the Mev extraction so in ethereum write your canonical change you defined by an on-chain smart contract Bridge right and and that has some rule in it of like this is the sequencer that is allowed to submit the transactions um into this you know call it like an inbox or whatever whereas in The Sovereign World up it runs something much more similar to like an L1 where you have some rule that is kind of defined by essentially like the the software right and like the the peer-to-peer Network that says you know this is the valid piece of software and if you run the software you will connect to like peers in the network and and those peers will all decide on you know a similar like leader selection mechanism and obviously that like kind of who gets to produce the blocks and who has kind of what kind of Monopoly on block production or whatever other mechanism you use will Define the structural system of like how Mev can be extracted um and so I think that's one of the big things to kind of think about because there's a lot of different ways you could design this you know I'll just throw out the kind of like naive way you could think about um structuring this kind of you know rule of what the canonical chain is in like a Celestia thing um that's not something I'm gonna kind of like encourage people to do but it's kind of the simplest possible way that would give an example of how we could push Mev down to the data availability layer and kind of some of the costs their implications of it is just say you know if you say we have thumb roll up that is you know Theory realized data like such and we will say the correct chain of this Roll Up is whoever lands the first block that looks like you know a given structure on you know top of block within Celestia um and then you just kind of wraith right and you say whoever lands the first block in Celestia gets to decide what the canonical chain is and you can kind of easily see how that would create a system where the game for deciding you know what Mev is um kind of extracted on the roll-up is defined by um you know an actual Med game Downstream of the roll up on top of Celestia because people would obviously you know first play a priority gas auction on Celestia to say like okay I'm going to like spam Celestia in the hopes that like my highest bid will land kind of top of block and then presumably you would see you know some kind of mechanism similar to like skips right where you say okay I'm going to pay a bid in some kind of coordinated auction mechanism to say I will pay you know X much for a top of block auction and you will pay based on what you think you can extract in the and so I think the design space here is very very broad but that's kind of a simple naive design that would push it down to the DA layer um one alternative perspective or maybe this is somewhat aligned with what Elijah said is like when I think about where Mev should accrue um in practice it's often driven by like you know these relationships of like power that exists um either between individual actors uh like the proposer for example in the monolithic case or in the modular stack increasingly between like the individual actors of the different protocols so like the proposer of the d a layer versus um either the proposer of the shared sequencer or like the validator set of the shared sequencer and that's like usually what what dictates that that plus culture and and Norms so like what you see in Cosmos for example is though is that many of these app chains like all the ones that we work with are electing to as the validator set not extract Mev related different running and sandwiching and instead focus on healthy Mev to Elijah's point about culture which I think is really interesting because you know we talked to a bunch of ethereum folks before building that into our block Builder as an option and they're like oh no one's going to use that no one's going to want that like every single validator we work with uh barring maybe one or two has explicitly asked for every protocol we've worked with has explicitly asked for it so I think like culture and Norms do have a role to play but when I think about like where Mev should accrue like I think you can take like an ecosystem wide or like a crypto-wide perspective which is you know in the long run we probably want these systems to provide just better ux for people who are actually trading on the chains and are actually like using the technology that we're building and I think better ux can come in a few different forms like you know for example for a DEX form a better ux is you get better execution price right that's why like the front running and sandwiching doesn't matter or uh matters because it makes your execution price worse so you want to like design your Mev systems to try to give your users better ux from a price perspective but also like maybe better ux from the perspective of just how easy it is to interact with the chain how predictable is their experience right like you don't want a system to Josh's point where one of the externalities is that like when your shared sequencer posts your transaction to the DA layer for its like final finalization uh the da layers validator said is uh incentivized to censor you that's uh that's like a bad ux um if you like submit a transaction to some roll-up and then you check back five minutes later you're like oh what like it got accepted by the rollup like why did this never happen um and I think Mev is like actually a pretty powerful force for trying to design systems that have better ux and I think that's going to be good for crypto overall like that's one reason that I'm personally excited about Duality is that like they're taking this as a first principle of the design and saying and you know the chains we work with in Cosmos are the same they're saying we're going to give Mev back to users and to stakers and that's going to be part of our competitive Advantage um and I think that's a really cool pattern I think you're going to see that play out more with Roll-Ups and hopefully you're going to see the modular stack like exploit this design space in a way that like ultimately uses Mev as a tool to better off crypto users nice yeah to summarize um it sounds like the the design Space is really wide and depending on how like the choices that are made me V can kind of uh accrue in a lot of different ways but this sounds like we're all kind of in agreement that uh Mev is worse when it has a negative causes negative externalities for users and like on the user experience and so as long as we should try to design the system in a way where it doesn't impact users and hopefully even through things like Sovereign mbv it can actually be like beneficial to users or at least net neutral rather than like extractive um but one one thing that kind of popped into my mind as we were you guys were kind of discussing this was um does Nev kind of threaten the original value prop of modular blockchains in that kind of the one of the selling points is that okay we have these discrete like separate protocols and nodes doing like separate things and specializing different functions um across the stack and they kind of don't have to know about each other and what's happening at each layer and um that way we're able to build this really efficient system but Mev might create this incentive for example for someone to literally run like the like a a node that knows about everything every layer of the stack it's both it's like a data availability layer it's also running at the sequencer layer it's also running the execution layer Etc um and that way it's it's you know able to capture the most Mev more than more than anyone else like does does is that a threat to modular blockchains is that inevitable um what do you see yeah so I see actually like a lot of you know analogs to how um we see like like the ethereum stack of like you know proposer Builder separation and what they call like the Mev supply chain right where theoretically right there is this idea that if you are a you know let's let's assume like a sovereign case if you are a block proposer um or a validator on Celestia and you are also a validator on you know uh a roll up on top of Celestia um than it is like profitable for you to control both of those things and therefore when you have the turn um as you know validator on Celestia you'll just like censor everyone that is not um your validator for the role above you and that presumably gives you kind of like more control across the whole stack and I think there's like like like you know legitimacy to kind of like the concerns there but but also what we actually see is you know and this is um what we've seen in kind of like different discussions across like Cosmos ecosystems and like Atomic you know cross-chain stuff like just the overlapping of these things a lot of it's dependent on kind of the the size of the set of I'll say like block producers right like if there's like 100 people or 150 people or whatever like how often do you actually get an overlap between those things and you know that overlap will determine how valuable that kind of you know stacked control is whereas I think the reality is like if you get to like a relatively small set the overlaps become rare enough that you're kind of incentivized to say like well I want to get like whatever like the fair market price is for you know my control of like block proposal at whatever layer I'm at and therefore I'm just going to kind of sell that off um and it would have to be kind of a very very large um reward in one individual kind of block um during that overlap period for that to be kind of the outside value where that's like kind of your focus um you know I think this is there's like there's like the second order and kind of like iterative games concerns over like if you get a reward by controlling more parts of the stack then you will acquire more capital and that Capital will allow you to acquire more stake and so on and so forth until you control a really large amount of the network but I don't think these are concerns we really keen and we've seen kind of the economic specialization that fundamentally like modular Stacks encourage where you think well someone will actually just go be a Searcher over here and they will optimize being a Searcher and then someone else who is like a blocked proposer will say like actually it's not my interest to also be a Searcher I'll just kind of bid that out I'd love to hear from Barry who has a lot more experience kind of you know interacting with Searchers and and block proposers and validators kind of on the ground and understanding kind of the perspectives they're having in this you know are they thinking about verticalization or are they all kind of comfortable with you know the supply chain at the split in kind of the the individual pieces of that they return to themselves yeah um so in general I think a a good way of thinking about this is people um people are always in in crypto especially but everywhere like people are always like in competition with one another um and a lot of times in Mev that competition leads you to want to verticalize um across different parts of this supply chain so validators want to become Builders or Searchers want to become Builders and want to build order flow solutions for wallets so they can move across different parts of the stack um I think a lot of validators so just like speaking specifically to my experiences you know most validators that we work with they see themselves not in competition to like extract as much Mev as possible but in competition to be seen as like the most aligned with their host protocols because if they have like there's a very clear and present notion of reputation in Cosmos and the community has the ability to both you know through the individual actions of a delegate by staking or through like social slashing or like Foundation grants like reward and punish uh people validators for different kinds of actions there and so because this competition is based around like how how good of a steward am I seen as like it it leads less towards verticalization and more towards supporting like recapture for for users or recapture for stakers because they're they're really just trying to get as much stake as possible so like validators and Cosmos frequently advertised that they're using skip like they'll change their the name of their validators as it appears on chain to say like oh like um you know my validator and then in parentheses 100 of Mev returned to stakers and that's because their view is you know they can make more money by getting more stake as opposed to make more money by just trying to extract um and that if they just try to extract they'll be seen as worse stewards which will be harmful for them um for Searchers I think it's it's interesting like the line between Searcher and build blurry in ethereum like I the thing that I've always said is like a a Searcher is really just like a builder that has less order flow and like better algorithms and a builder is just a Searcher that's focusing on order flow and I think like increasingly you're going to see those roles look more and more similar in ethereum uh which has like the most mature ecosystem around this by far I I'd love to kind of double down on on the thing you mentioned about kind of the validators being good stewards because I think it's an interesting concept and I think you know historically we saw discussions in ethereum I'm gonna get like the dates wrong but somewhere around like circle like 2018 2019 you know with the miners there were discussions of like oh should we be kind of like extracting things is there value here when kind of I think it was like balancer or whatever was the first kind of opportunity showing up where the miners could say hey we could reorg thing not reorder but like reorder transactions in a way that's like more profitable for us than maybe that returns us more money and and such and such like revenue is like compounding whether it's proof mistake or or proof of work but what you know the same argument they used was like us as like a mining pool would be viewed as like Bad actors by the protocol um and therefore we will not do it but like eventually this kind of like like Floodgate broke right like eventually someone just said like us for it like we're going to go be like maximally extractive and we will return like the highest yield because we are maximizing our kind of monetary returns and people that don't believe that is kind of a sensible incentive aligned or whatever will not you know participate in our mining pool but people who are just kind of like ruthlessly um maximizing profit will say okay fine we just want like the the higher yield so I think there was this existing historical situation in ethereum and kind of the best discussion of this I've seen I think was like a chopping block podcast on like Mev maybe I don't know like six weeks ago or something um but it didn't like hold up like over time so I guess I'd love to understand from you like is this something that you think will continue to kind of uphold or do you see there being some point where a sufficient quantity of the stake essentially says like hey you know actually we're like here to be kind of like ruthless kind of like capitalists within this kind of semi you know Anonymous ecosystem um and they go back to that maximize for yield or do you think they'll be able to kind of hold this equilibrium of like everyone's going to be a good actor because that is like in everyone's interest kind of long term I I don't know I think like one important difference is you know for Sovereign l1s is the ability to socially slash validators um which you don't have to the same extent in ethereum I think you know the roll-up version of this too just to help like App application Level things Recaps removes is Fork Choice rules that are based on how much Mev folks are how much Mev that the chain is recapturing right you can create like competitive or cooperative mechanisms around there that are a lot more expressive than ethereum has had up to this point and you know for what it's worth right now like this is playing out real time in Cosmos so on osmosis um there was a lot of of hand-wringing and concern around blockchain actors extracting Mev including skip you know the core osmosis team and the core contributors there really didn't want any kind of off-chain uh block building Market to emerge and uh there there was a solution for that I mean skip is obviously one of them there was there's another one and um you know we talked the osmosis core team we decided not to launch there the other solution did launch there and what the osmosis team did is is they you know put together a proposal where they said look guys like we think this is bad for our ecosystem we're working on other mechanisms to mitigate Mev um around threshold encryption in the meantime like please don't do this thing around maximum extraction and if you do we are going to try to police you and we will kick you out of the validator set you know we can't necessarily prove a hundred percent but we we are going to like do everything in our power you know as the core developers and as the community to ensure that your behavior continues to reflect what we believe our users care about and what you believe our users care about and what you've seen is that like that's worked so far I mean it's been it's been only months it hasn't been years but like it that has worked um nobody is is running the off-chain solution or very very few validators are running the off-chain solution uh there so you know what what's Skip's response to that was we worked with that team to build in protocol Mev recapture Solutions because like you can do that kind of thing when you have a roll-up or an app chain and I assume uh you'll see this play out again more and more I don't know like another thing that's cool to look at just on this point is if you go to our uh website uh skip Dot Money slash validators you can see who's running skip on each of these different chains and you can see the percentage of Mev that the validators are choosing to keep for themselves versus give back to the stakers and it's different like the average is different on different chains so like Juno for example those validators are like very generous they give back like on average like 80 percent of Mev and that's held up even while the profit has basically 25xed in the course of the last six weeks uh but on evmos the validators give back less they give back something like 60 or 50 on average and so you do see like meaningful differences between communities here yeah I think of like a controversial Point here right and I don't want to like derail things into like you know this discussion necessarily but something on my mind it's like I think there could be there's an interesting distinction I think between kind of the scale of a chain and what I mean by that is like this is like a question of like app specific where an app specific chain is kind of it is easier to have a probably tighter-knit Community by way of having less dope and therefore you don't have kind of different groups of people that all participate in you know something like ethereum right there are very very different groups of entities within ethereum there are D5 people they're nft people they're like different kind of communities within that whereas presumably within an app chain it's much easier to have kind of one cohesive community that can kind of have this you know kind of social community policing and say like hey we as a community all agree to this where past some kind of threshold of decentralization right you no longer have a single unified kind of like group think opinion that says like hey we all agree on this um you know I think from some kind of like certainly like crypto ogs like people coming out of like a Bitcoin cap or even like a historical ethereum cap they might hear the idea that like oh the core four teams as they'll socially slash you if you do something that is like capable within the protocol but like they just like kind of ideologically disagree with like that sounds like a very concerning kind of thing that like you know you would get you know ranted at by like Bitcoin Maxes you know um and maybe not even Bitcoin Max it's just like generally like bitcoiners right um so I think there's something interesting in that about like you know app chains and kind of the idea of like Sovereign Mev and and how that kind of creates more cohesive communities that may have smaller scope individually but are allowed to be more aligned kind of in their um in their mission or their kind of opinions exactly yeah I was I was just going to say that um to me Sovereign chains is what enables Sovereign Mev and that's that's my thesis like it's it's impossible you need sort of that level of coordination and sovereignty to be able to like recapture Mev in the way that like a community wants to although I definitely want to hear from Elijah on this because I know that they might be able to design this actually within the application itself I'm not sure but maybe that's that's possible you definitely can't do any social slashing but maybe the the application can have some sort of like logic that does this but um I just yeah I think this is a really interesting like concept and just the on the bitcoiner versus like OG ethereum crowd right there's this uh idea that you know uh code is law right but in the modular ecosystem at least for Celestia we really believe that social consensus is like layer zero is social consensus and like that is what law is not code and so to us I think like you know the modular blockchain uh one of the big selling points of modular blockchains and running your app on your own L1 or your own rollup is that you get that social consensus you get that sovereignty back and I think that could be a really powerful driving force for adoption of the stack is like hey why why are you building on ethereum and leaking all your value to a different layer or giving all this up when you can actually capture it yourself anyway Elijah I want to hear from you on this yeah yeah um so one of the things that first excited me a lot about Celestia and sovereignty um and you know I've had some like like you know some sobering realization since that like are all addressable and I think like you know are part of the you know desirable design decisions to like think about when designing a modular stack but was this idea of like Mev based sequencing rules uh you know Sovereign Roll-Ups you know can choose in essence what we're calling a fork Choice rule for their you know for their for their roll up um and like in theory this is like a really really really you know nice idea um in practice and like just a shell um you know a paper that I co-authored recently and I see malicious listening into this uh into this um Twitter space uh you know one thing that we actually found is that like if you formalize you know if you formalize a lot of like the the you know if you formalize a lot of like the systems and the Dynamics around uh Mev auctions and you know having a sequencing competition to return the most value back to users is you know in essence an auction um and there's only a single proposer that the surplus of that auction should actually end up in the proposers uh you know lab right like the proposer should be the one that you know sensors all the bids that they want too and you know includes only the bid that they you know deem right at the end of the day and can keep all the extra value for themselves and so this is this is a product like what we've discussed a little bit earlier in the spaces which is that um you know in leader-based consensus protocols like tendermint like Casper like you know snowflake um right there's a single block proposer who has a monopoly over what's included and how what is included is ordered um and like this is you know when someone is like Monopoly on something and they have a financial interest to exercise it right uh you know the the sort of accelerationist point of view is that they probably you know most likely will and if the rational will um you know exploit that um and so you know I think I think like the the sort of interesting design space here is like you know there's this there's this really positive notion of sovereignty um but you know sovereignty is still to some degree uh you know mitigated by the Monopoly that any given you know any single given block proposer has over the system and so you know I think I think like you know one thing that that would be interesting for Celestia to think about um and you know that we've we've talked about a little bit in the past uh is this idea of you know taking away that Monopoly and and creating a system where you know multiple block proposers um actually contribute to what is included in you know in a block and how those transactions are ordered within that block um and I think that like you know if that can be tackled then you get a lot of these nice properties around you know what you can actually do with Mev auctions you know you can imagine that if like you have multiple block proposers uh and you know all you need is for your transaction to be included by one of those multiple block proposers for your transaction to make it into a block you get much better guarantees over like what will what can and will be censored um and you can like run these auctions much much more smoothly um but I think like this idea of sovereignty in general right and giving the power back to users right we talked a little bit about like you know what where like the pipe you know where the power dynamics lie we're in like ethereum the validators have a ton of you know power whereas in like you know Cosmos where you know we have app chains right the the sort of power Dynamic is much more that like the users and or core development team has a lot of power because you know they're sort of the ones driving the roadmap and or bringing in the liquidity um and so you know in sovereignty a nice part is that like because it is so easy to permissionlessly Fork um you know anyone can do it at a really really low cost right versus like in you know in the in the chain worlds right the cost of like forking and then maintaining a decentralized value changer set is like really significant versus in like the Sovereign world right the cost of forking and just like you know having like some full node that's running you know an alternative sequencing around is much much more cheaper it's much cheaper but you can still retain a lot of the benefits of decentralization uh you know inherited by this you know Celestia's validator set um I think that's like the exciting part about sovereignty here right is that like it's you know Shifting the power back to users and or like people that might not have like War chests um full of you know cash and you know teams full of Engineers to like go and you know decentralize a you know a validator set um but um but yeah um but I also think like a lot of focus should probably be taken to the base or you know the the validator setting how consensus is actually working and you know the logic by which like transactions will actually get included um so yeah awesome well so we have a few more minutes left and um I wanted to shift the topic of conversation to sort of the last thing that we haven't covered yet which I find really exciting which is um shared sequencer networks and the role that they will play in Mev and we're lucky because we also have um Evan listening he's one of the engineers at Celestia and he wrote this amazing post on our Forum where uh he kind of proposed this really cool notion of lazy Roll-Ups where essentially you can you know the standard way of of doing sequencing for Roll-Ups is that you have like this tight coupling between execution and sequencing or ordering and in his model actually you can have sequencing be like decoupled from execution and it's a really really interesting idea and I know we've talked about that but I want to yeah I want to go into like what is the design space for shared sequencer networks what is the motivation like why would they be useful and um also touch on hopefully we have time cross domain Mev and is cross domain me the uniquely kind of enabled by building in a modular stack with a shared data availability layer so the big topic whoever wants to jump in first go ahead yeah I guess I can jump in on this and I think this the kind of idea of the shared sequencer ties in a lot to you know what Elijah mentioned about you know this question of like uh easy forkability and you know this kind of broader space of like what flexibility in design and you know kind of deployment do you get in the Sovereign roll-up ecosystem right so right now I think Roll-Ups in general are in a very Nathan design space you know we essentially have two that are really live and if the evm people can be mad about you know we think there's only two but like um generally right there's like optimism and arbitrum that are like live and being used on like mainnet with like you know actual trading happening and both of them have centralized sequencers right so we don't really have a use case uh or like a live example of like what decentralized sequence thing actually looks like across rollups right now um but the kind of you know proposal you know after is working on you know building obviously from um you know evidence post on the Forum and discussions we've had with Evan is this idea that like we could propose a network of sequencers that are you know building on evidence design right like they're lazy and so what we mean by that is we essentially have this kind of opaque uh block space Market where we say Hey you submit a transaction to us and we will order it and then the fork Choice rule that your roll up kind of agrees to is that of the shared sequencer um and the shared sequencer will not execute your transaction but there is some deterministic translation between an ordered block for your roll up and you know the the state route that will be generated based on like a state DB right there's like you take like an input function of like a state DB a given ordered transactions you know a block essentially right and then you get a new state route from that right and the idea with these kind of lazy Roll-Ups is that you can have an architecture where it's permissionless to join like a sequencer set um and this goes back to like Elijah's saying about like how much effort is it for someone to decide they want to stand up a new roll up or to Fork away an existing roll-up and if you separate the sequencing component from like execution um then it allows you to have you know this you know sequencer layer that sits there and anyone can show up and just push transactions into it pay whatever the kind of market price is before transaction to be included there um and they get some you know decentralization guarantees for you know liveness or whatever um from that and then they can run whatever kind of state machine they want on you know call it like the back end that laterally evaluates these ordered blocks of transactions um and we just see it as this kind of component that makes it much easier for you know people to kind of stand up a larger quantity of Roll-Ups versus what we've seen is like you know quite frankly like a relatively heavy burden within the cosmos ecosystem of you want to launch a cosmos chain um how do you coordinate kind of sufficient number of validate Earth and how do you incentivize those validators to you know produce um block for your chain um again separating the execution ordering allows you to at least get the ordering for relatively cheap in a way that does not constrain the design space of execution um I think you know there's there's some interesting implications just touching on like Sovereign Mev like I want to be like upfront about right if the the idea is that if your roll up utilizing a shared sequencer for your ordering you know Mev is extracted at like the ordering step so you would not using kind of Skip's terminology have Sovereign Mev you would be participating in this kind of single Mev market across all Roll-Ups that are participating in the shared sequencer and you'd be bidding into that kind of same Market where if you want to order your transactions in a certain way but some other roll-up is also utilized in the shared sequencer and they're bidding much higher for their ordering because they have some profitable Arbitrage or whatever on their chain you are having to participate in that market so it does kind of potentially reintroduce this kind of Noisy Neighbor question of like the shared block space Market um but we think at least there's like potential for this to be uh beneficial design so that you can have a much larger number of Roll-Ups where each one is not having to go through kind of the same you know whether like like BD or kind of you know um like infrastructure stage of setting up a large kind of decentralized set of sequencers which quite frankly we haven't even seen kind of the large you know north of billion dollar tvl um ethereum roll-up actually kind of pursue so so it seems like there's at least some kind of technical if not kind of you know um enter the coordination challenge to like actually get that set up um such that like even the live Rolex right now haven't put suited or prioritized it barrier Elijah do you guys want to yeah uh I mean I think that that's a great explanation of it um I I think like what I would hope to see on Celestia over time is like a market of shared sequencers that roll up can opt into and opt out of and you know Force those shared sequencers to uh compete with one another for the business of the Roll-Ups that are on top of them and through that competition create a mechanism by which uh Roll-Ups can you know sort of recapture at least some of their own Mev it's like okay I'm going to give you the right to order my transactions and extract Mev for me but like we're gonna expect you know we're gonna have some way where we can try to have like a bounded expectation around how much Mev we think we're worth right now and if you're not paying you know our community some portion of that we'll go and we'll find a roll-up who might be um so and you'd need you'd need like you need multiple shared sequencers uh shared sequencer networks for this to be the case you need you need like not a single one of them to become super dominant to a point where like there are other reasons that the the Roll-Ups can't opt out uh and you'd you'd need it to be designed in a way where um your roll-up can be quite uh agnostic to which Shard sequencer it's using but that's that's a line of thinking that I think is interesting I mean I think oftentimes people just like wave their hands and say like oh the market will solve this but I think like that's that's probably like the one of the ways and a good way for shared sequencers to to compete and I hope like this last ecosystem it you know grows big enough to support that kind of competition I think that'll be really really cool to see and good for end users as well yeah as a role of Builder or roll-up Community you know using a shared sequencer is very convenient and saves you a lot of overhead and time but then you are kind of giving up the the ordering which uh it gives them access to Mev and so if if they have a monopoly on that they can kind of like be more extractive um but if there's competition that's there's like hey I can migrate you better treat me well uh as your customer otherwise I'm gonna go somewhere else I strongly agree with that yeah I think there's kind of two phases of this in a large idea I'll make like a quick Point you're right like you know obviously if we're building a shared sequencer Network there's this kind of competing goal of like we want to be successful and like attract users and whatnot right but so there's kind of two components right there's the architecture and we believe that like the shared sequence architecture we're designing um Works in such a way that it's relatively easy for a user to go you know move over to an alternative sequencer for whatever reason they don't want to continue using this whether they want to go to their own you know Sovereign sequencer whether they want to use a competing kind of shared sequencer you know the benefit of all the data is fundamentally like written to Celestia at the end of the day um we think that's a very very good kind of like way such that we can show like hey you don't even have you know something that's very common in kind of cloud ecosystems of like it's expensive to egress your data to like an alternative cloud provider so once you're kind of sufficiently far along you're stuck there you know this sequencer is very much something in kind of you know liveness right so yes you know you might have to like pause your chain if you want to switch over and maybe it's hard to coordinate kind of a live switch but all your data fundamentally can remain in the same place and you can still move to kind of a new sequencer if the one you've chosen you know whether that's after or someone else isn't kind of satisfying to you for whatever reason yeah um so maybe going back to you know just a stepping back one second like I think uh that one of the things that really attracted me about Celestia initially was I think there's going to be a number there's going to be a number of experiments around composability you know now that you have a bunch of you know Sovereign you know Sovereign applications that share block times right so we we spoke a little bit about this problem earlier where there's a bunch of chains that you know all have different block times and you know while it's valuable to have um you know while it's valuable to have like be a validator you know multiples of these chains you know whether or not those block times will sync up at certain points or not is like an open question and how often it does for them to capture value from it is another question um there's also a lot of use in Block times picking up that you know it's well it's easier to extract value like you know there's also composability benefits so I think like you know as a whole having shared block Times by sharing you know da layers something that like you know I think is is going to be um you know it's going to be exciting to watch you know the experiment that play out there um I think like the decentralized sequencer I'm most excited about other than Austria um you know I I think uh you know Josh is is you know probably one of the the you know the the top thinkers about how sequencing in the modular stack as a whole should work but another decentralized sequencer that I'm really excited about is actually Celestia as a decentralized sequencer um and I think like this was sort of this idea of like Mev based Choice rules or Mev based sequencing rules native to Celestia I think it'd be really really cool as Celestia um and other like modular layers could crack the censorship problem um you know this sort of like Monopoly that you know any given leader in you know leader-based consensus protocol has over what actually gets included in the block um crack that problem and and you know make it so you know make it such that you can have like a bunch of different people who are you know all completing to get included into a Celestia Bach and get their blocks include you know they're you know their inclusion in Celestia block is like a block for a roll-up right it's a set of trans actions that will be executed by some roll up you get a bunch of these different blocks formed and included in Celestia block without the risk of censorship and then you have the roll up you know based on rules that are just ingrained into the actual role of itself decide which one of those blocks the canonical one I think like that's in a lot of ways almost like the Holy Grail of of decentralized sequencing where you you don't need to touch anything else you don't need to bootstrap a new validator set you don't need to you don't need to do anything else you just have it like out of the box in the actual app you know in the actual DNA layer itself um you know I don't think it's an easy thing to accomplish I think it's a really really great goal to strive for and I think like you know in in any decentralized system there's going to be imperfections but I think like there are ways to smooth a lot of the surface there um and you know some of some of the ways I talked about earlier was you know you know creating systems which have multiple block proposers um you know is one of those ways um and so yeah so I think that's like something that'll be really really interesting and you know it's sort of like Celestia itself being a shared sequencer slusty itself being the sequencer I think it's like a really exciting point that has to do with like you know all these role of settling on the same deal or not settling on the same daily but posting you know blocks to the same DNA layer and sharing block times right so they're sharing block times they could share the sequencer has the actual data layer I think it's a pretty exciting idea um but you know we've got our ways to go I love that I mean the original laser Ledger white paper I mean that's what it was a lazy Ledger and client-side smart contract so the original Vision was kind of that you know those kind of pre-roll-ups and the idea was people just post data like end users interact directly with the data availability later but then with the whole idea of Roll-Ups emerging it kind of became this thing where um you know we expect there to be this other layer that uses users and interface with and then like the roll-up sequencers interface with Celestia but there's actually nothing stopping someone from using Celestia in that way um so yeah it would be interesting to see how that all uh plays out well we're at time so I want to open it up for you guys just to give any closing remarks and also share where people can learn more about your projects and what you're building uh yeah so quickly closing remarks super fun conversation nick uh thank you for your time Elijah Josh thank you for uh all the insightful comments whenever I talk to you guys I I feel like I learned so much about the mod for stack um but just in terms of meva you know I I think I just want to Echo Elijah's point that like one thing that's been really great about operating in Cosmos is that having the cosmos SDK and tendermint as building blocks that people can use has led to larger scale faster experimentation than you're able to see in other ecosystems uh you know across the block building and transaction designing uh the iron space and I think like with the modular stack you're going to be able to see a lot more of that with Mev itself directly uh and you know we're super excited to be a part of that future uh you can see more about Skip at skip that money and you can look at our open jobs at jobs.skip that money 18 off like a similar clothing remarks so like once again like yeah you know echoing Barry's point right always good to talk to Barry Elijah and Nikki as well on you know all things modular um or you know Mev specifically um for us kind of on like where you can find us we're pretty early here from like a publicity perspective you know we're kind of in stealth but you know you can kind of follow the um Astria org Twitter account um a-s-p-r-i-a-o-r-g um or just kind of myself on Twitter if you're looking for updates and we're open to have kind of more public information kind of in the coming weeks here yeah um yeah thanks thanks for having me as well I mean like I'm I'm really really excited about what slocity is doing with modular crypto will look like as a whole you know the way I've sort of like formulated in my mind is that you know every every cycle there's you know some new asset class or some new reason to come on shade and every time you know our systems fail the users um and they fail the users because you know you know transaction fees are High um and they fail the users because you know the users are being extracted value from right and so that's the question of Mev and that's the cat you know question of scaling and I think that like you know this is an incredibly interesting talk because it's sort of the intersection of the two it's like how can we solve like the two biggest problems towards actually Building decentralized Systems that users can can touch and feel the benefit of without needing to worry about like losing value or paying ridiculous amounts and so um you know I the way I've been saying it to you know internally to to friends and to um you know to people I work with is I you know I really see this as like sort of the GPU moment for crypto or like things become cheap fast you know flexible you know can handle tons of data um and you know can can do it around the world um so I think it's it's really exciting um and yeah you can find Duality um you know we have a website duality.xyz you can follow us on Twitter um you know just to sum up again you know we focus on like Mev solutions for decentralized exchanges and we're building a decentralized exchange which you know recaptures Mev and returns it back to the LPS because we sort of see that as like an existential problem towards you know um liquidity provisioning being like a viable thing to do on chain um and yeah thanks for having me fantastic so thanks everyone for coming thanks for listening if anyone's out there interested in these topics get in touch with us there's tons to build as you can tell and the modular ecosystem is a rapidly evolving and growing space and there's no shortage of things to get involved in so if you're passionate about this like get in touch seriously we'd love to hear from you and once again thank you to the speakers Elijah Josh and Barry a lot of exciting stuff to uh to come from these projects and um let's keep the conversation going on Twitter so um if you guys have any more questions or thoughts or this like any of the discussion you know gave you some ideas um you know post them on Twitter or on our forum and let's continue the conversation there's still a lot to explore thank you guys we'll see you next time
