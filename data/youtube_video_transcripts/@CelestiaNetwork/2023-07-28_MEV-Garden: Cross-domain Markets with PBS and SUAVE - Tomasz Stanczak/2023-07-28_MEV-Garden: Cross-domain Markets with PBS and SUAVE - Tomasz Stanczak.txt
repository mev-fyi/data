hi everyone uh so I'll start to stand here the Mev Garden so that's very very sweet name because we've been talking about the Dark Forest for a long time uh so my name is tamash steinchak and mated flash Bros founder netamind uh trying to wear a few hats and we'll be talking about how to connect through PBS many different domains with Suave so this is not an announcement of a product it's not a suggestion that first was going to build it it's more like building the open presenting you a bit more of undercooked ideas that potentially will be rejected like maybe something will be missing in quality maybe it will be not really aligned with the values all the values that are at large but so Illuminating through the bringing transparency to maybe activity providing permissionless access to Mev extraction and distributing fairly the Mev Revenue all right so once again I'm Evie Garden we'll move away to something that's a bright Place clearly divided into components PBS uh and with kind of conditions for everyone to participate so we're talking about uh connecting everything with the existing ecosystem and making sure that there is place for everyone especially that the users feel very good in this ecosystem this is one of the small steps really what we'll be showing and hopefully we'll end up with something like this and maybe a little survey like how many of you know what PBS is okay it's going better and better so now we divided it slightly more but just slightly more so I say the builders will divide them into the sequencers and Builders sequencers will be choosing the transaction sequencing transactions and the builders will be building blocks out of the transactions that are pre-selected so it may happen in some of the setups and it's particularly might be important if you start talking about the shirt sequencers so start to forget for a moment that sequencers are what in the Roll Up is like everything together and how nowadays we see the PBS down so I'll go quickly over maybe some very simple visualization so what we have what we can end up with so nowadays many of the Roll-Ups are like simultu and the centralized native sequencer in it um the decentralization very often is seen as like just introduce a few sequencers and leader election and they start proposing blocks one after another depending on some some rules we have a shared sequencer we say that the sequencer is actually shared between multiple l2s l1s and we may have some atomicity with it and then the something that is like ethereum nowadays would be you start splitting the sequencers into proposers and Builders so this Builder Market they're bidding for the for the best block and there's proposers so you know all of this right now I start saying that we will say that shared sequencers and Native sequences like centralized sequencers all of this can coexist and it can start to have various combinations of all those setups and also a very important thing is that PBS does not necessarily require that the proposers are decentralized you can have a centralized proposal native to the roll up and still create a builder market so they can be bidding for the best block and the proposal may decide to either capture that value for the operator of the L2 or to maybe burn it for the protocol foreign all of this may coexist and because we can have many different protocols arriving at the solutions at very different times with different like we've seen arbitrine proposal we see what scroll was proposing what Stark net is working on and so on and so on so maybe in this world for a few years where we want to create the market start building the markets for Mev and for PVS and and still connect all of those different protocols so when we know that we want to achieve that we set some design goals for the protocol that will allow to do the PBS with the cross domain Mev and we want to support that heterogeneous sequencer space different designs we want to enable permissionless and transparent cross domain Mev Market we want to be in line with the whatever happens on ethereum but also be in line with what happens with other chains right so think about not too much pushing the protocols themselves to change we want to operate slightly outside of the protocol maybe opposite to what what Zaki was saying or maybe not opposite but related to what what saki was saying um we want to respect the position of various Market players that are building shared sequencers middle words riskaking Solutions and so on so I want to make sure that everyone feels like oh well there is a Marketplace arising there's a game which I'll be able to play with uh play inside we want to make sure that it's 12 aligned so that's my internal goal like make sure whatever we're working on at flashbots is actually part of our greater Vision that is strategically well tested and discussed and one thing is that we keep thinking about it we need to ensure that their equal rights are there for the solos takers and large operators to participate in that game and this is for the for the like validators or proposers and now this will be the proposal for what we really can build to try to support all of those requirements so first of all we want to have some kind of chain it can be swap chain it can be something on the side of suave chain which is just like a global ordering system so a set of Oracle so whatever construction and the construction here is not really defined on the technical level more on the on the vision idea level we want to order the blocks on different chains and have a way of looking at this ordering from the outside just to use it for construction of the proofs and slashings so I'm saying I'm looking at Twitter's construct net polygon and many other chains potentially and maybe even things outside of the L2 or ethereum space and I want to keep order of everything that I can do possibly within all of those domains and I say that I want to introduce a definition of synchronized block proposals so if I'm a shared sequencer for example I'm practically in some cases I'll be sure that I'm proposing blocks that will happen at the same time like so I know that I like if it was a base roll upon L1 I know that every 12 seconds I produce block and within that block I'll be producing blocks batching blocks for multiple roll ups so I can start making some promises but to describe those promises we need to agree on some definitions and I'm not sure what those definitions would be over time in the market which of those would be the most makes the strongest and and here for example saying something like a very strict definition like we're looking at two different domains and we don't allow anything in between so um on the screen the ethereum block 100 will be synchronized with the Stark net block but not with the following ethereum block and not with any of the blocks before this darknet block because they belong to a different domain and and there is something in between so I want the blocks to be exactly next to each other but then maybe this will be difficult and maybe we would sometimes not care about the other domains because I'm trying to synchronize to blocks to extract Mev and maybe not always I will believe that for some other chains construction I can extract that Mev before before this happens before the synchronous execution happens so maybe I want to define something that is like strict but within the domain so as long as there is no other block that belongs to the same domain as the two blocks that I'm talking about in between that it's synchronized so here the ethereum block is synchronized with starknet Block it's also synchronized with the polygon block because there's nothing from ethereum or polygon in between so there's only start Network in between and it belongs to another domain so I don't care and the more domains I will see there the more I will probably want to restrict the number of domains that I care about when defining what does it mean that it's synchronized and then I may say that well I really care only about the situations when both domains that I'm synchronizing between or multiple domains like we can probably extend it to many domains if if no set of blocks happened in between that would belong to the same domains then then everything is fine so here I really say that even one of the last polygon blocks is still is still synchronized with ethereum ethereum block 100 but the start Knight block 202 is not synchronized with that block because we see above the ethereum and start Network in between so this is not very strict I'm just proposing something that may be relevant when making an announcement like if I'm a if I'm a sequencer proposal as a proposer I want to so shared sequencer proposal I want to make commitments to what I'm going to do and I have to describe it in somehow and as I as we were working on it we discovered that well that definition is not that obvious we may still need to worry about which definition elastic um the communication about this the announcements may happen for something like nowadays through the relay but potentially may happen through the attestations and P2P Network so there should be no difference whether we keep the existing ideas of ethereum and existing roadmap whether we change it towards the epbs and Trend PBS no really to the to the way we approach this this solution and maybe Garden and when you look at the proposals of Pepsi like protocol enforced proposal commitments you can think of this a bit like a cross domain Pepsi so cross chain PBS we're adding communication layer from proposers to builders so the other direction proposers make announcements like in Pepsi like some some announcements of what I would like to commit to and I Define asynchronization between the blogs that I'm about to commit to and I can be slashed if I don't deliver that so we'll show how to do that and once again think of it maybe as a cross domain Pepsi um and this is part of the design goals we want to create the permissionless and transparent market so you start to feel maybe it's permissionless because we created that chain and anyone can start announcing announcing this like proposals defining some kind of we can have some format description of what I'm going to do as a shared sequencer I can say polygon ethereum Block in 10 minutes there'll be synchronized according to the strict domain rule and and if I don't deliver you can slash me if I do deliver then actually you can start bidding on that proposal and any of those shared sequencers native sequencers decentralized sequencers may start judging themselves how much of the probability of delivery of that of that commitment they have do I only propose it to only announce it if it's 100 if I'm sharing sequencer or sometimes I want to start extracting value even if I have five percent chance a 50 chance of success and I know what the what my deposit is what can be slashed so this is both the global time with the set of proposals we look at this chain and we see that we start noticing blocks and there is a commitment from a proposal saying how do you synchronize Stark net ethereum blocks and then we start seeing beads from the Block builders that are now across domain block Builders and are bidding on on what what will be the best payment to that synchronized proposal the block is selected when it's accepted when the bid is accepted then from now on WE practically have a promise that there is some slashing so the deposits were exactly it's deployed it's maybe not the most relevant it can be something on this chain I mean something outside some restaking solutions and so on and then we at the end either I delivered synchronized blocks according to that definition or I failed if I delivered I get the beat that was promised if I failed I'm going to be slashed why is it important in the Suave roadmap alignment well if you have seen the presentation from Robert about Suave we were talking about this promise that a Searcher can say I pay you one if if you deploy something on two different chains so without this maybe the the one problem is that I may make this promise but on the other side the executor has to have some kind of expectation about How likely they are to achieve that success of landing something on two different blocks and I want to have someone else promising that yes they can do that for them so the executor want to have a bid but also a promise that they can operate on that beat and start simulating and building blocks so this is the component that is needed for swap to connect for the cross domain and this one thing is here in yellow because it's kind of missing this is risky it's uh it's to be explored how the solos takers solo proposers validators can compete with the large operators that have huge overlap between two networks so shared sequencer is a simple case but if I'm large operator to networks for example 70 of blocks on one network 70 of blocks on the other network more likely 30 or so then I will have overlaps very often I can make these promises of cross domain extraction all the time so I can capture more and more value so if in these we have to make sure that as proposals between the solar Staker solar proposers can be somehow coordinated and that we know what exactly happens if the slashing happens who is at fault for not delivering and I was the roadmap well ensuring that the design is actually satisfying all those goals so I've already PBS on multiple chains so they can be connected to this solution and this is not trivial as we've seen there are different questions about what consensus mechanisms are used like if it's standard means how this will work there if it's ethereum L2 how it will work there how it will work with Proverbs and so on and so on so that PBS work already started many uh we look at many protocols and try to help them to build pocs so reach out if you would like to have those conversations with the flashable Steam and yes we love to hear from all of the l2s all of the domains of what exactly works here what doesn't work is there much Mev to make here how the market makers think about it is really needed and is it value aligned yeah and just to summarize Maybe the slide was initially in the front but we didn't know about the time so um The Flash was never mind collaboration started around 2021 and there's a bit of invitation for many Builders teams or like protocol engineering teams to to maybe start collaboration with Suave with with flashbots on swap for multiple components we do lots of research materials together frps but we also do engineering so I hope that the Journey of being totally outside of flashbots and enjoying the fantastic time on research and building can be your journey as well thank you so much that's all from me [Applause]
