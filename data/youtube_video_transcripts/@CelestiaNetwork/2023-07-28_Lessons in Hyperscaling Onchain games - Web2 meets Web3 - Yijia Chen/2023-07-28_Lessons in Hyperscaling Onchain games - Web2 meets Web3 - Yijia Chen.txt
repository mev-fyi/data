so yeah let's talk about uh infra for fully launching games I'm sure you heard of a couple talks on this but I want to take a slightly different approach let's talk about Keystone which is our uh which is what we recently developed as the the new flagship uh fully on chain game infra and but I'll take a a slightly different approach where we start from the experience that launching games need to or are uniquely poised to create and then the design paradigms that can create those experiences and finally what infra can support those type of design paradigms and for those of you who aren't familiar curio is a crypto native game and infrastructure company we are pretty uh we're like basically all in on fully launching games and we want to make it happen as soon as possible uh and we're both building games to push forward the game design barriers as well as the infrastructure so yeah that's the that's that'll be the structure of the talk first a quick philosophical philosophical detour what do you think makes the world real world feel real uh is it just the rendering quality or is there something else and there's definitely some an important piece to this which is the social relations we have with other people uh if you think about it humans are social animals from the beginning and the relations we have with other people are very complex there's you can't really Define someone as a pure friend or a pure enemy it's very rare that that happens and we have all kinds of interactions with people um and varying degrees of promises and agreements and contracts that gets that that happened now Virtual Worlds today and games today have a very limited social interactions if you think about it compared to the real world and why is that um let's take a look at a couple of game models today the first genre I would call social 1.0 which is uh purely PVP based and the only social relationship that happens in these games is uh competition so players fight each other this is StarCraft by the way um and you know CS go and OverWatch and these games all belong to this category there's not really any cooperation and the only thing that happens is competition which is very drastically different from The Real World and a lot of player complaints in this category is like one the onboarding costs the barrier to entry is pretty high usually because there's a lot of skills involved and there's not that much social interaction so um and then the next step kind of uh in the in the multiplayer genre with social relations is social 2.0 where most of MMOs are and in this category there are two types of PRI primary interactions one is cooperation within a certain groups such as the alliance is defined by the game or competition between the groups so players are no longer just competing on the individual level they're also cooperating within a group and competing between groups but this is still very different from the what we see in the real world which where people can can act you know anywhere between friends and enemies and that's what makes it interesting so what exactly is missing right let's take a specific example from the previous picture which is Rise of Kingdoms um which is ammo style civilization right when in this game let's say the player highlighted the two players highlighted in two different guilds or alliances one to trade with each other let's say one to trade resources two types of resources they can't and they also don't need to because the game is defined as competition between guilds right there's there's no need for play-to-player interactions which takes away a lot of the fun and this does not limit to players that happens between guilds as well let's say the two what goes on the top one to sign a peace treaty for some time they can't also they really can't do that they can promise to each other but if one side betrays there's no punishment that will come right and and that equals No Deal so what does the real world do better than games add these in my mind there's two very important components the existence of Highly valuable assets such as your house or anything that makes you really care and interaction and and effective law enforcement that protects people's interactions around these assets right and that's why people you know when you walk to work and and fight your colleague over a a small disagreement you don't have to worry about them taking your house or killing you or something like that because there's a mechanism that protects you from uh from getting those harm but there's no no such thing in Virtual Worlds or games today and I think uh so blockchains actually already figured out half of the the solution which is the existence of digital assets we have digital assets that can get very highly valuable and decentralized so it's protected some people might even say it's more secure than in the real world but there's not really the equivalence of law enforcement right when people make promises to each other there's not an entity that can say okay I will enforce these for you and today's game the problem is that there's not a language in which the the players can tell the game engine what they're agreeing to right so that the game engine can take care of the promises for them so this is like a pretty trivial example where let's say in a grand strategy game I don't know if you can see the text but let's say you have a player named vitalik right next to you and you are equal strength and you're fighting over a couple gold mines and suddenly there's this player called Justin Sun that's a pro that approaches both of you and with like a lot of high level Horsemen right and and reasonably you want to stop attacking each other for a bit so that you can both defend against this much stronger player but let's say in two and let's say you agree to do this for three turns but in two turns you decided you just really want the gold mines and you're gonna attack italic anyways what happens well nothing really happens and in fact if everyone does that to vitalik he's going to quit the game and blame the game for not being designed very well so what can make this up right what can allow Justice to come in Virtual Worlds and let players not worry about uh and and worry about breaking promises and actually interact fairly with other people well we designed a system called treaty which is actually very straightforward it's using smart contracts to enforce social contracts in games so basically in MMOs and Grand strategy games players are able to create us create or reuse smart contracts that uh Define their relations with other people in a way that gets enforced automatically by the blockchain uh over some trigger condition so what do I mean by this uh some examples of this include a simple thing like non-aggression packs which we just showed with an example uh with vitalik to more complex things like North Atlantic Treaty Organization you can have Guild currencies that on chain Saudi Arabia's can launch to back with their oil you can even have different kinds of governance models that govern how policies get passed and treaties are we think important social building blocks for blockchain for online games is to allow players to exact to do exactly the social interactions that they couldn't do for a long time and this is uniquely suited for blockchain because smart contracts already exist but they currently don't have a function in much more context Rich worlds like games compared to things like D5 nfts so yeah we were we we built a game out of 3D and we launched this January 2023 so this year and people really enjoyed it people made some wife jokes about this for playing the game too long and and not sleeping while not washing dishes but anyways um the game lasted for a week and actually the end result of the game was affected by some player creating a treaty called loan agreement they basically the the ultimate Victor of the game were able to loan troops from another player uh and to raid the alliance who are already occupy the center of the game the the game which is the flag tile that is the victory condition so that was pretty cool but we ran into some other problem and yeah like I think players really enjoyed it and we have we're so confident about the design space of high high State PVP adding on the social interactions that were building a real you know real-time World strategy game with high stakes fully on chain and hopefully launched that in a couple months but I think we ran into problems as well which is with uh with regards to Performance right each transaction of our game which wasn't that complicated uh when there were 20 players playing right you you check a couple treaties you check permissions and you you move people you battle it they took anywhere from 20 million gas to a couple hundred million gas right and that's not even because the smart contracts poorly written it's just because the game is so context Rich right you need to perform a lot of logic in one transaction and that's why players were joking that the player the the blue troops which indicate movement in our game don't actually move the red ones don't actually attack because the moment of intent uh was was just too far from the moment of execution in the games and this is not unique to our games this is a sheer problem with all fully on changing game Frameworks today right because all the logic is implemented as smart contracts that live on top of the blockchain that use usually evm or stocknet execution environments to uh to to run the game right which these systems are not meant to do and you know it's games like Dark Forest kind of avoid this problem by designing their game in a way so that all the actions take really long time and that's what meant to be so you know Dark Forest had energy Rays taking anywhere between 15 minutes to several hours to send which is which work I I would say could potentially work for some players but if you want to get to mass adoption and have a lot of players who don't really care about the blockchain elements and just want new experience come this is very limiting right and so uh specific problems games are very context rich and they have much bigger transaction size uh and and because of that you have some follow-on problems like stacked you deep so you have to do more gets um which you know even just crypto cripples the system and there's a lack of game tick so what that means is let's say if you want to move from point A to point B the intent is moving to point B but the actions are uh you might want to move many times before you get to point B that usually traditional engines take care of using this thing called game tick which is kind of like the sun rising every day or Seasons coming every year automatically and they don't come because someone send a transaction that the Sun would rise today and in the same way you move in the game you take every step that the game engine basically take for you you don't have to send transactions every time and check the permissions every time and check intent which are wasted computation and finally solidity is not it's okay for small dollar scale games but to create a game as complex as some of the even medium stage size games in web 2 it's it's very very complex and there are much better suited languages that and stacks that allow players to develop or allow game developers to develop much faster and more stably so because of all these challenges we thought okay we wanted to preserve the social composability uh we wanted to create a com to preserve the social composability aka the ability to create contracts social contracts and the trustlessness of the logic and the assets but also we want to add high performance and great graphics and basically all the ux stuff so game a great game developers can create these fully on trained games that will take us to the next stage right and that's why we created Keystone which is a well it's a solvent role of based launching game engine framework meant to specifically a hundred extra performance while preserving some of the best parts of fully on chain games and um I so I should need to switch screen to show the demo but uh you can find this on our Twitter basically we put we spend two weeks putting Warcraft 3 the game on chain and all the movements and battles you see with the dozens of troops moving and attacking at the same time um you know sub second level happen in real time on chain right and all the logic are are on chain so that's like a huge step from what we see today with today's Frameworks including our past framework with pretty so key features of Keystone include its high throughput ECS based game engine ECS just States the the way games uh game data is stored and it supports the the fast game Tech supports classic RTS style games like Age of Empires you can theoretically for for a fairly simple game get to 66 per second which is pretty much you know what all you need right for for a close to like very very real uh type of type of experience it supports historical State querying so you can write treaties such as if something didn't happen for three turns then you know whatever reward that is or punishment this is not about the current state it's about historical State and finally it supports evm based treaties so 3D store use solidity but use pre-compiles to get inside certain States and finally it's written goes so basically I'll talk about the the architecture you have the game logic that lives on the same layer as the evm so it's not it's not really fully on-chain but fully in chain um because if you think about it the digital physics for the the game rules don't really change that often just like the evm layer right and what happens is the evm supports all of the social contracts players make with each other in real time whereas the game tick and a lot of defeat like indexer and a lot of other features that blockchains currently don't have with games are added uh in parallel with evm and introoperate with custom stateful pre-compiles and this whole system set all data to Celestia da for anyone to basically observe and be able to challenge the validity and also to ethereum for payouts and the asset related features right and basically there will be a multi-sig of Guardians that that are basically sequencers of this whole thing and the multi-six is able to kick out to vote out anyone who acts maliciously and um and you know based on players input um so yeah and this is this is like we basically open source this by the end of May and uh we're we're in the process of still improving the system uh coming up with uh Keystone V2 probably in the next couple weeks we want to um you know all games obviously built on top we're getting more people who are interested in building uh launching games that are not just hobby projects to build on top um and to really impress people so um yeah definitely welcome all suggestions or questions here um but yeah we think this is the first step toward games that have massively complex social relations like Ready Player One um that also have highly valuable assets this is what we don't have today in in today's virtual games so yeah we're building Keystone V2 we're working on the flagship game which is the high-stick strategy game and ultimately we are uh as I said earlier like the game Space that um on full engine games open is massive and we alone cannot possibly explore even probably five percent of everything and so uh but in order for games voting on Keystone to succeed um we can just host hackathons we don't think that's enough for a game like you have to worry about so many things like art distribution and and capital we will provide all of that for you um as long as yeah yeah like if you talk to us we'll like figure out what's the best way to be on chain for you what's like the tick rate um design like how do you how do you settle data how do you get your initial group of players um we'll even match you with the artist team the r teams we have uh for basically much better looking games than today's launching games uh support you with all of that so you can and focus on the mechanism so yeah that's everything um I think we're slightly over but I think we're gonna take some questions foreign oh okay you're next hey um great presentation thank you um so I'm just curious in terms of the users for these games right um who do you think this appeals to primarily is it your um hardcore on-chain Gamers like the ones who uh play Dark Forest or is it more crypto Gamers who are like your axes Etc or probably they're more for speculation or do you think there is a pathway for this to get entirely non-crypto Gamers from outside mobile or mobile or you know um console based right just curious where is this going from a user standpoint yeah that's a great question so we're solving a very fundamental user need and it's more on the psychological rather than technical side where we're attracting players who are generally very uh willing to uh who are interested in highly PVP types of games with high stakes uh and and at the same time perhaps are looking for more more complex social interactions in in online games so imagine if you're a competitive DOTA if you're a really good DOTA player but you're not competitive so you're not enough to participate in Esports right but you still really want to play RTS games and play with Stakes with other people right and perhaps win or lose based on your skills and you want to improve your skills so you can perhaps earn more right that's the type of people that we think we're attract we will attract that's obviously in hypothesis right we still need to test it but it's drastically different from today's blockchain or like web 2.5 Gamers who are I would say looking for asset appreciation which is unsustainable uh it might have a big overlap with today's fully on-chain players but not perfectly because I do think a lot of fully launching players today are only interested in the technicals but are not really looking for a good experience I do think the ultimate goal is to get people who for example like Starcraft or like poker right and and like basically fit the criteria I described earlier to come right and we need to basically solve a lot of problems before that comes true okay thank you yeah foreign okay I got um One Technical and one social question Let's Do It um my technical question is uh in my mental model of like time it takes change to execute thing like the bottleneck is really um the miracleization like committing to the state um yeah some any form of commitment like how how do you do that um because you managed to bypass this bottleneck by doing something clever or don't you yeah roots or something uh yeah that is the the slow part you're right um and there's kind of different ways to think about it if you need real-time settlement um I don't know every like on a sub second level I think you might just like that that might just have trade-offs with how complex the game can be um and or I'll turn alternatively you can have uh kind of a challenge period after let's say each game lasts for three days or something at the beginning right I I don't think we'll have like very persistent games at the beginning do you have strategic depth in that case you can have a challenge period after the game so that people can run the game over right uh after after this the data settled and localized and settled and uh make sure that everything's this this fair and then basically the payout then happens um so I think it really depends on the specific game um setup that you have yeah and also this this is not like this is very early like we haven't thought too much about consensus uh of of like the localized data that's a hard hard problem that I think we're we're thinking about so yeah yeah so yeah yeah if I'm correct is that there's some outcomes that you care about like this player one and maybe these resources shifted after the game right and so the the game nodes will commit to that and then you can sort of challenge that these are not the correct outcome but you don't need to miracleize the whole state with all the health at any point right exactly we or we could immortalize the whole state if it's you know if it's doable yeah yeah yeah that's really interesting question there uh the other one is like okay so you the premise of your game is well not the premise like one of the big features is you want the smart contract agreement between player but you don't you think that sometimes like the sort of drama of it is what uh get gets people hooked you know like the Betrayal and the like um game theory of it like oh I have disagreement with this guy but I need to watch my back because he might betray me and then if but if he does his reputation is going to be ruined and it's like sort of an iterated game thing like don't you think that's worth preserving some of that or how are you think about it no this is a key question so let me just ask you right let's say like your you know in today's corporate world right everyone signs contracts like ndas with each other and like freaking like I don't know what whatever other types of contracts but there's still tons of betrayal that happen right and they are basically kind of like loopholes of the the contract that gets exploited and that makes the whole betrayal more interesting so let's say I sign a non-aggression pack with you it doesn't say I can't have a vassal state that can attack you right I can pass the troops to them to attack you right that's something so we're creating these structure for very blatant violations to be impossible but you can think of it basically requires players to think on a higher level and like betray on on a more interesting level if if that makes sense yeah that's interesting that's cool it's definitely like the goal is definitely not to avoid all like avoid any social relationship change in fact it's to encourage that but by freeing a lot of the minute for like to small things to worry about like uh like if I want to do a trade for three level for three turns with you I don't want that to be broken if I'm doing that with like 500 other players but then I can think strategically like oh like maybe what vassal State should I set up over like the next 500 turns to have what kind of XYZ goal right so like you're actually expanding design space of the interaction that are possible because there are things you would never ever do right if you couldn't trust people yes and there are also things such as you know we don't allow we probably won't allow permanent non-aggression packs just for the you know for the reason you mentioned right you know we can have all 3DS time bounded to like 500 seconds or something like that that's also a pretty like straightforward thing to do uh to limit the uh the negative these consequences cool yeah
