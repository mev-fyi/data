foreign my name is actually I'll say my real name Mauricio Trujillo and also known as bunny or konejo capital on Twitter um we're building a multi-chain search engine a block Explorer is called Aura and also thank you everyone for being here right now um yeah name of the talk what we search for search engines in a narrow modular existence so first of all what's what does this mean what how can Dora actually help with any of this what does it there you go how can I how can we actually use the search engine approach to approach let's say some stuff that have been talked about already modular applications being able to actually interact with epic specific specific chains and also how do people actually even if to begin with how do we approach infrastructure today what are the different heuristics that we interact with some of the ones that we were already talked about um application specific role of so on so forth intensity creators multi-cosystem type of fabrication then search data how do people actually relate to all of these goods and services day-to-day how people start searching let's say true Brands instead of searching for a very clearly defined queries to engage with a good and service then externally Blended monolithic chains as opposed to internally random modular apps that may leverage infrastructure that is embedded exclusively that is very opinionated as to what they may enable and as well as hey how do we ultimately end up engaging with all of this so first of all I see a little story so Jazz and Jacob also from the Celestia team approached me they're like hey bunny can you actually speak at the um at the moment or something I'm like yeah I'm more than happy to uh always ready to speak whenever someone else needs to so well the first things that I go is like okay I have no idea what people are going to speak talking about model Summit or then modularity in the overarching sense of the world so what do I do I start searching how do people actually start searching in their day-to-day lives people start searching on their day-to-day lives in um let's say at least within crypto we've somehow stumbled upon the uh semblance of having intense intense meaning um whatever your definition of it may be as it being bounced on the end state of uh of an action on the state change constraints on this stage on the stage change or also as Vlad said something along the lines of uh they are a glimp scene to your into your deepest desire the deepest desires of someone's brain no matter your definition of intents there's something that we cannot clearly agree is especially this is something as simple as I want to do X and that's it so how do intense are how are intents able to leverage stuff like D5 gaming nfts and identity specific applications they're able to leverage all of these because they don't necessarily make any concrete differentiator between them they may not necessarily measure different security assumptions they all they really care about and that is the nature of intenses that your end interaction gets fulfilled and that's it how does what type of world do we build we love this type of infrastructure the type of world that we build is one in which is composability is pretty much unquestionable and we end up in a world in which we have an any to any type of relationship between goods and services in which if no matter what resources you have currently available there will always be infrastructure that allows you to partake on any good and service You may wish so how do we how are we actually able to enable this we have some multi ecosystem infrastructure this is honestly one of my reverse decks we have some of the people in the room uh from those logos there you may recognize a couple of people from Caldera modular Cloud that um it's quite skip routing mechanisms mod roller plus service indexing mechanisms they're all very and of course intense they're all very much needed to be able to enable this type of theme this type of workflow that people are very used to in the regular World um that regular world meaning outside of crypto but is that how people really relate to sorry sir to go back this one sorry thank you how do people actually relate to all of these goods and services within crypto and how do people relate to all of these outside of it it's very clear there's a very in there's a point in which every single crypto office does starts pretty much looking like each other uh we call this effect uh in seeing recognizing patterns where there may not be any uh paridolia there's a paradoli of the apps in which people start seeing stuff like nft marketplaces on uni so people start seeing stopping mechanisms within NST marketplaces people start seeing options where they may not necessarily be a need or a desire for someone to actually start leveraging options so what we find is that all of these goods and services eventually become commoditized something very fascinating though is that while the business services may be commoditized their providers are non-fungible every other provider will be selling you the exact same thing but in a much different type of delivery packaging that some people may be used to and that's actually good that's very good actually so how do people outside of crypto relate to um searching intense and fulfilling of any desires they may have we where can we actually look at something like this we can look at search data which is honestly one of the most valuable data in the world in my opinion um people don't necessarily look for goods and servicing in a very clearly defined query um they actually if you look at the top 100 searches on Googles or even across their changes uh especially if you start very heavily localizing people relate to goods and services through Brands they don't necessarily um it is very rare that actually something as con as concrete that is not brand heavy makes it to the top 100 searches is usually just related to like World Cup events and even then you could argue that okay there are events there are sports so we have bronzers branches of proxy for actions uh we have antimeria in which the verbalification of nouns uh not the announced nft of course but what we get to is that we have these two first and second degrees of Santa Maria where a lot of infrastructure is currently laying on is that we have for uh we have ways in which you have protocols like not necessarily protocol action an action at this point uh emailing uh people feel very comfortable saying hey email me just send me a message they don't necessarily specify which provider they may be engaging with and that's completely fine um another way of using um is not accessing protocol but something's akin to being able to emit a message uh Twitter people feel very comfortable uh using the anti anti-meric word Twitter tweet it um these very easily allows us to convey hey I want you to express an opinion I want you to tell that opinion to the world people feel very easy doing that so if this is how people search okay we understand that brands are very important we understand that maybe it's actually good to have branding around certain applications maybe certain chains but is it enough there's this concept of branding externally branding your monolithic chain it's in this sense meaning that if you have an uh let's say a 4K VM chain is just done it's exact same thing as an evm but you just so happen to have an nft Marketplace in that chain and that's all that you really do there it's not necessarily optimized for nfts it's just a chain that has an nfts mark an nft smart contract and that's completely fine and that's pretty good for most people where we very much like to push for it though is that we want to people people to be incredibly opinionated about the infrastructure that they leverage for their specific use case in this case in this senses where we are actually pushing for is app chains we believe that very entire approach will be to create Brands around a generalizable chains applications whereas what we should be aiming for and forgiving forgive me there's a typo there is to create infrastructure around such change specific applications in this sense if your application um they say very very high frequency trading specific application should have instant uh the shortest finality time and shouldn't be contested maybe something like IBC should we considered maybe something that um I don't know the ydx is a very clear example of that maybe there's applications in which you should rely more on social consensus as opposed to some very very clearly defined cryptographic security mechanisms who knows we can play around with this they eat also modularism is very much of built anything and we strongly believe that if we should build anything why shouldn't we actually build this in a way that we can actually start iterating on goods and services on monolithic ecosystems watch which is precisely what we've seen and then actually go into production and optimize for service providers for different service providers economic incentives on something like a modular stack in this sense one of these examples that is actually a paper that is should be getting polished either today or tomorrow by tarun chitra is in how sequencing and the you can mod you can model pretty much every single Divi app has a sequencing of Liquidations in that sense if you start considering that sequence then ordering becomes really incredibly important and you can start arguing for the 13 certain sequencing of uh how to say it of certain chains should be the most theoretically optimal for this specific D5 application that is a fascinating concept I think is very interesting to say every single application that is deployed on this chain will not have a Competitive Edge against this one D5 application that's fascinating so now every single app is a chain how do we actually go about searching every single one of these applications how do we actually go about engaging with every single one of these providers uh once we every single one of these providers starts looking the same or hopefully they don't and one of all and once every single one of these providers is able to leverage their specific infrastructure that makes their ecosystems Blossom as much as as almost theoretically no one else can what we do what we do at Dora is we like to take the approach of a generalized generalized search generalized search engines we very much believe that power users will and end up engaging with topic specific aggregators uh we're all in Paris right now I don't know how many people in the room are based out of Paris or even France or Europe in general but I will bet that most of you ended up using at some point either something like a airline aggregator maybe at first we started engaging when we first got into the industry we're like oh I'm going to my first conference I want to use I want to I want to see what I can use for traveling if we're wearing very experienced Travelers before we probably use something like Google then in the end we of course narrow down into okay I want to use my Expedia I don't know there's there's plenty I just use Expedia because very convenient um but what we see for an appropriate ecosystem that lends itself to be mastered up there is that users will engage with the most generalizable meaning the one that and he's able to capture most providers has the most coverage friendly quite simply just being able to understand it from the get-go uh I thought it was fasting it was insane the first time I got into a plane I was like wow how do people actually get this and my parents told me oh you just go on the internet and it was blown away by that and provider acknowledge search engines if we believe that every single one of these Brands is actually incredibly meaningful to the experience of a user actually engaging with this goods and services search engines should be incredibly intentional as to what brands they're leveraging in order to provide all these services well we do Adora is we have a couple examples of it actually um what we do adore is we try to be incredibly intentional as to hey these are the specific tokens that you're you're solving this um if we click on let's say the crypto.com to the transaction there you and yourself in UCC will tell you that you this uscc is being provided by Circle if you click on every single one a Smart Country we try to make it abundantly clear what types of organizations these smart contracts are associated to that way hopefully giving people their Assurance of hey you don't necessarily even have to trust Dora right we're a search engines uh there's a very uh funny cons uh thought experiment that maybe the chain is dead and the Vlog explorers have just been producing information for you uh that could be true blogging Sports could be lying to you um but still we don't want people to trust us what we want these people to trust friends that is who they seem to trust right now that is who people I mean Celeste is also brand we seem to trust them to figure out modularism they're doing an amazing job at it so therefore I wouldn't why should we actually change the way people just behave and think right now and thank you so much love you all thank you for coming here thanks if anyone has any questions as well more than happy to um yeah if anyone has especially questions as to how our stack works as well because it is infrastructure day as well more than happy to dive a little bit more into that yeah feel free um yeah uh we actually I think blocking sports are actually interesting on that because we haven't found a whirling which we needed to rely that heavily into the into our own proprietary technology up until recently um there was a very much a run-on to the bottom on stuff like indexing within evm chains that was something that we found as I said they were applied to providers that ended up showing up there's been around two volumes to how to actually go about indexing it I think we've done a fairly wonderful job at it uh not only us but also some of our close Partners ghost guys simple hash um I think it is an interesting question as to see what are are we gonna see around onto the bottom indexing approaches on a modular ecosystem I think that is all necessarily quintessential to be able to even begin to Fathom whether or not we're going to be able to let this ecosystems Blossom um yeah I think there's a couple really good teams doing amazing work at that I think modular cloud is one of those themes so let's see how we can make this ecosystems be better than everyone else foreign [Applause]
