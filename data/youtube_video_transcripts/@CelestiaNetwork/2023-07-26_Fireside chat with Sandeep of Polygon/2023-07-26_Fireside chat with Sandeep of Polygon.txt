hello hello what's up everyone so um I remember when Celestia and lazy Ledger started uh the architecture that's proposed is uh is one of the original Cosmos ideas from like 2017 and uh you know it's very anticipatory of a lot of scaling bottlenecks and a solution to it polygon was born in much more uh practical and reactionary implementation of addressing scaling problems in real time so yeah we talked a little bit about sort of the story and how we kind of get to modularity but you know how did you guys kind of get started in India decide on architecture for the POS chain zkbm and then up to polygon 2. yeah I mean when we started uh you know polygon uh I think the core team initially uh the way we were different is that we even though we started building the infrastructure but we were before that we were actually building the apps right and uh it was very clear for me mid-2017 itself that you know building the apps on uh this uh system like on on ethereum on a public blockchain is not going to scale most probably and uh it was also very clear that the the dev Community liked uh ethereum a lot and there was already a very big community so we like now it's look it looks like how did we see it before like you know five years back but it was even then it was very clear that uh you know eventually the ethereum is going to emerge as the layer one and now we are seeing like even many layer ones even becoming layer twos and things like that so it was very clear that we wanted to you know build something which you know developers could be would be able to use and uh that is what you see in whatever you see polygon does right you know we are we are not uh even though now we have like extremely high quality like research like we almost spend uh spent like one billion dollars in uh you know the and and now have the best talent in the ZK space and you know became the first uh you know project to launch a full-blown ZK evm which is a layer two built with ZK Security on top of ethereum the DNA is very clear like we want to build for the developers where uh real world applications can be built uh so you know everything we do uh the core DNA is that and we move uh as per that mission the mission is that to bring millions of users in web3 and whatever needs to be done for that that should be done so polygons put uh more transactions of value and transactions through tender mid consensus then pretty much any other projects that maybe the binance bridge uh and it's a core piece of architecture Celestia is also using um what's kind of what was your kind of your guys decision to utilize that and how's that experience been no I mean uh tender mint uh is uh I think as a as a pluggable consensus you pick it up and build on top of it I think it's the is the most evolved most mature uh you know uh consensus or consensus uh SDK Cosmos SDK previously uh uh I mean this is one of the best ones and that's why like at that point in time and not only now only even in 2018 when we were building it it was the most mature and the best and I think from our side also although uh we are very deep into the eth community uh you know care about it very deeply but I think after ethereum if there is a ecosystem which you know I also and lot of people in my team which is layer one ecosystem which we respect really is Cosmos ecosystem and tender mint is a you know invaluable uh contribution from Cosmos through the whole ecosystem and even now like uh you know we are building some things where we need a single slot finality consensus and obvious tenement constantly keeps up keeps coming at the top of the evaluation list so I mean now it's much more evolved but even then it was very clear to us that as a you know Plug and Play consensus into whatever we are building uh tournament is pretty good and yeah we are we are happy that we as you said that you know we would have uh you know put in more value transactions on tenement consensus then I think the whole of uh maybe orders of magnitude bigger than that actually yeah Luna had a good run um so what was kind of the polygon experimented with a lot of different scaling Technologies um as you know kind of new the limitations of this uh you know plasma side chain uh what was kind of the story and journey to start working with the Hermes team and get to this uh zkbm that launched in March yeah so I mean when we started uh building this at that point in time uh uh only like the Practical approach as as I said that we are driven by pragmatism we are not we don't want to build sand castles or like some Cloud castles which nobody uses and back in 2018 19 all these Layer Two approaches were not evolved we started building plasma we were the only team which actually delivered a plasma to the mainnet but then nobody use uses used plasma at that point in time and uh then uh you know we were very clear and then this optimistic roll ups approach came along and all those things and we were we evaluated that and we realized that this approach is also again uh you know kind of uh uh Band-Aid right like you know this is this doesn't give you the ultimate uh you know infinite scalability on top of ethereum and that's why like we were looking for a more a better approach the end game approach uh to say and that looked to be ZK at that point in time and that's why we focused all our energies into ZK and here we are like I think uh you know arguably pound for pound the best team in ZK with the with the products which are out there in production and getting traction day by day yeah so you know ZK technology is obviously very hot um it's definitely the core technology underpinning polygon2 so that was recently announced in the past few months um you talk a little bit about the sort of architecture and vision and the components of polygon2 yeah so polygon 2 a point O is essentially a multi-chain vision wherein like the the goal is as I said that you know our goal is again our goal is not to provide this blockchain scaling technology our goal is not to provide these fancy consensus Technologies and all that stuff our goal is how do we get one billion people into web 3 in next five to ten years and what technology needs to be built for that and at the end of the day for the Developers if this needs to become as we call it internet of value it needs to have the similar kind of characteristics that the internet of information that we see and we call web2 today it needs to have similar characteristics what are those characteristics the current web 2 world is practically I'm not saying theoretically it's practically infinitely scalable the more apps more uh you know new different kind of applications are coming in you can spin up more servers you can provide additional amount of computation everything is available and it's almost practically uh infinitely scalable secondly the information is seamless like I you know back in the day like 10 20 30 years not 10 20 but 30 40 years back when the internet was starting you know these were like die separate they used to be darpanet Euro net this like you know different kinds of networks and then this whole www tcpip uh kind of uh things happened and then all these internet all these individual networks got connected with each other and today we have a you know seamlessly connected internet across the across the world but previously even if you had information on one internet which is let's say one network which is on us and you want to bring it to let's say Europe Network you have to the same thing kind of what you have to do today like you have to bridge the value from one asset one chain to another chain then you you know and right now not they're not even safe security zones that from one chain you take on the other side either you are relying a bridge or you're relying in the destination change security and all that stuff and that's why like it's the value is not seamlessly uh you know it's not it's not easy to move uh the value seamlessly from one chain to another and this internet of value needs to have the similar kind of characteristics as the information has anybody can create uh share and exchange information in the web to World same way it should be possible for Value in the web web 3 world so uh you know the point how we have built is that this is a multi-chain environment like where you can spin up as many layer tools you want as many change similar to very like similar to Cosmos Vision you can spin up as many layer twos as we want but they are all secured by the zero knowledge technology so all these chains provide their ZK proofs to ethereum right and we are for for all of these chains to have a fast interconnectivity with with each other they we we propose the interoperability layer everything else like otherwise this cross Chain lxly Bridge and everything is built out from our side but now we have proposed a fast interoperability uh aggregator layer which which what it does is all these chains submit their ZK proves extremely fast already we can do two minute proofs uh as per our current technology and we'll be uh the new upgrades that are coming up you will be able to Every Chain will be able to share a create proofs like in five to ten seconds and eventually going to two seconds also so every chain essentially creates two seconds proofs submits to this aggregator layer and all these proofs of different different chains they get aggregated and get submitted to ethereum so you have eventual hard finality on ethereum but you also all of these chains let's say I am on chain number 100 and I want to interact with the transaction across chain transaction that is coming in from chain number 10 let's say the moment chain number 10 10 submits the ZK proof on this aggregator layer on chain number 100 and all the other chains they clearly know that okay this particular transaction which is coming in that is already proven by the ZK proof on this aggregated layer right and I can without trusting I don't care now that whether that chain has one sequencer two sequencer thousand sequences it's a reputed sequence uh you know validator on that chain or it's a private chain Enterprise chain I just don't care it's a simple value or the transaction that is coming in which is proven by ZK so we can prove the execution so it doesn't matter if there is a college dorm room a guy who who's who has a chain which has multi-million dollar value flowing into the public chains the public chains can easily trust that value so as I was saying that what this system provides is first of all it's infinitely scalable that as many layer tools you you want to create like today if we wanted to with this aggregator layer if there were 100 000 chains this system will still work if there were 1 million change the distance will still work right and secondly all of these chains have fast interconnectivity between them and eventually you will reach a place where users won't even realize that you know this all this bridging and all that for them they are clicking or let's say I'm playing some game in some chain which has a dedicated capacity to that chain almost like a server I play I you know get some money I want to swap it to USD on a public chain where the liquidity is there it should be for for a user it should be a simple click and the transaction happens that's the ultimate vision and again as I said that it rolls back into our ultimate Mission which is again how do we get you know mass mass across chains yeah um so that sounds like a fairly modular architecture would you kind of agree with that no definitely that's a modular architecture and you know modularity is you know is the end game for this like you know we can't have monolithic architectures like uh you know many layer ones like uh without naming them many of the layer ones have you know postulated that there is one single layer all the transactions of the world live in that that has like you know even if you are not a technical person you can understand that would have limits of physics on that right you can't have the whole world's data transactions everything in one place so modularity is going to be the end game and all kudos to Celestia uh Team like I think you guys own the modular uh you know concept uh because you know like uh originally coming up with this uh separated parts of the stack uh with this with this idea but then uh from our structure I think like in it naturally evolved into that where now we have multiple roles like polygon 2.0 also postulates that that uh basically you have multiple roles within the system first all the polygon validators have hundreds and hundreds of these chains to validate on plus you have multiple roles so you can either be a prover you can maybe a data availability cluster provider like you know we call it local data availability clusters if you don't want to go into a public data availability chain but the system is very open if you want to have a data availability on Celestia on Avail or any other data availability provider our system is pretty agnostic to that and then you have the validator layer then you and the way some of the strides that we have made on the ZK level like you know right now uh a lot of these things are being productionized but on the research level everything is built out and eventually we'll be able to have like decentralized prover layers and then obviously this aggregator interop layer is also one more layer where uh you know people can collaborate so automatically yes this is like a fully modular uh you know Vision yeah so that aggregator layer I mean it sounds kind of a lot like sort of the IPC Vision uh key part of this unified liquidity piece um you expand a little on the the bridging thought process right now and the lxly bridge that's currently proposed for polygon2 so the functionality wise yes it's exactly like IBC that uh you know you you can accept value coming in from one particular chain on the other part or the other chain and the whole ecosystem is interconnected seamlessly and the user experience is real good so functionality wise exactly like it's an interconnectivity protocol in terms of I would say in terms of the how it works it may be like actually the reverse of IBC on how IBC works is that each chain like this is as per the best of my knowledge that how IBC works is that each of the chains is running a light node of the other chain and then whenever any transaction is happening you rely on the light node uh you know information that that that you're getting but you have to still rely on the consensus on the other chain but what aggregator layer is doing so basically the the the the block creation or verification is is is spread out like each chain has to very find the verification of the other chain separately whereas in the aggregator layer we are actually aggregating the proofs of all the chains like all the ZK proofs are being uh aggregated on one layer and then every other chain can simply uh you know take that proof and and you know rely on the transaction so in terms of construction it's uh completely the reverse but functionality absolutely um the same and then overall the liquidity the secure liquidity kind of bridged over from ethereum with all that sort of be aggregated and available to any of these yes Essentials yes yes that's the whole thing that's the whole lxl by bridge where we have a you can call it like a master uh smart contract non-custodial contract which all chains Connect into and that smart contract actually uh then any ZK proofs you are submitting so you can directly move your funds from one chain to another and you can directly exit to ethereum because the funds are the liquidity is being aggregated in one single layer so some a lot of talk about validiums have come up um obviously the plan right now seems to be the existing proof of stake chain will migrate to a z KVM Palladium at some point you kind of talk about the structure of a validium and you know what are some considerations for Builders um it's really like Cosmos started as this hubs and zones concept where you'd have your own kind of like cities and towns like every city kind of provides the same infrastructure but has its own culture and growth trajectory and values and uh it sort of seems like you know that's still kind of the multi-chain goal that people don't really talk about it that much but yeah what's sort of the the architecture for validiums and um you know why why should develops consider building with them the architecture that I talked about that you have multiple chains they have prover layer they have data availability layer and there is an aggregation layer for everything the validium is one special case of this whole architecture like validium in the concept of ethereum actually in the context of ethereum when you have both the data as well as the proof on ethereum that's a roll up and then when you have only the proof on ethereum and data can be elsewhere that is the validium you know construction uh for ZK roll ups and it's actually specially applicable to ZK roll ups because uh on ZK roll up the sequencer cannot cannot cheat once the ZK proof is submitted that's why it's called validity proof like in case of optimistic rollups for example they are called optimistic rollups because there is you optimistically assume everything is correct and then you as you expect that somebody from the uh from the community if there is a fraud Community will will you know run a fraud proof whereas in ZK these are mathematical proofs these are validity proofs once the proof comes in it's accepted on ethereum you know that the sequencer has executed the transaction still this proof uh correctly so that's why like you know you don't need data on ethereum blockchain uh to uh basically to validate the chain like in case of optimistic rollers the data is not there you can't even validate the chain because you don't know what what is happening in case of z k the ZK proof itself is the validation of computation you need data only if you when you want to exit or you want to do any kind of cross chain operations and all that so that's why what you want to do is you want this data to be fairly available but that data doesn't contribute too much to the security of the chain per se 100 like of course there is a like weird Ransom attack and all that but there is there are multiple other multiple ways to address that using uh you know Force exits and all that I'm not going into that but point is that with ZK this construction is possible where you can have the execution layer uh submitting only the proofs and the data is elsewhere and that's where all the data availability uh chains become relevant so and I'm sure you get this question a lot but we have a very uh Cosmos is very has been very much known for its tech for a long time but uh the community is constantly asking where we're going to find users uh polygon has been very famous for its Speedy efforts uh and um output uh what's kind of the secret there you know what how have you guys been able to get the users that you've been able to get I think this this stems from the DNA itself as I said that you know our mission is very clear I said that you know I mean at least from my side and now we have like some of the biggest researchers like Jordy and you know Daniel and uh you know bobbin from maiden and all that so their focus is building all these research efforts and all that whereas and I think you know we are as a team also we are fairly modular right so there is there is people who are building the tech and I am my mission of life is how do I get you know one billion users into web 3 maybe starting with 100 million users let's say in next two three five years right so like as I said that from my point of view we are not here to create fancy technology this has this approach that approach all that kind of fancy stuff that goes around I am here to make sure this trustless compute basically for me is trustless compute this Human Society currently we we interact with digital systems all these digital systems are centralized and you know that's why we are fooled with so many fooled with so many things in so many ways and my mission is that how do we make this trustless uh you know World possible because we are spending 60 70 of our time in these digital worlds and how do we make it more trustless that looks like a natural evolution of humanity and once that mission is clear then all of these things flow through that it's very very clear in my mind that you know what we are building needs to have users if this is something you know kind of extreme which can't get users I would probably not vote internally uh that you know we should build something like that even though it looks very fancy and you know crypto we as crypto industry we are very big fans of narratives and you know all that stuff I don't care about that so in that Pursuit I'd say you probably talk to more builder teams than any founder that at least in crypto that I've come across what do you hear about Celestia or D.A layers uh when any of those teams are considering their choices yeah I think right now when I speak to a lot of developers obviously that 95 of them are on ethereum only and on ethereum as a developer they really so the developers don't really care that you know when they are building an application where is the data going to be honest right and the Celestia kind of use cases the the kind of Technologies they are more relevant to let's say the protocol Builders like like us um and also I think the the roll up as a service providers The Sovereign Roll-Ups thing that you are you are doing but because you can't go to the developers and tell them that you know we will give you this data availability system that data will be system to the developers it should be like this is the environment where you can build the app and all the other things are abstracted from them and this is the job of these system integrators or roll-up service providers and all that to make sure that you know the better data availability products are used for that be it ethereum 4844 be it Celestia Avail or all the uh different kind of datability solutions that are coming in yeah I can tell so I I don't yeah I get da so but I don't hear Too Much from the developers and ideally I should not like we should not even index on it too much it's actually the job of the infrastructure providers who are going to provide execution environment to the developers that should be the job of like roll up as a service software develops and and things like that yeah so just make it make sure the SLA is there and it's a seamless to all the potential users as possible cool well that's all we have time for I don't know due to q a or no all right thanks Sandeep thanks everyone [Applause]
