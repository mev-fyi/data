light nodes effectively um like allow end users ordinary users with like whether you know a cheap laptop or mobile phone to have almost the same level of security as a full node because they can get assurances about the state of the blockchain um using technologies like fraud proofs or zk proofs and like this is the fundamental reason why the bitcoin community has decided not to increase the block size limit like in in theory bitcoin could do a zillion transactions per second if they increase the block size limit and optimize the node software um but the bitcoin community has fundamentally decided not to do that because it would increase the resource requirements for end users to run full nodes and validate the chain which is like the the pretty much the critical or the critical aspects of what a blockchain is supposed to guarantee that the state of the chain is correct effectively and but with light club with newtek with new light color with new light node technology that has that uses like fraud proofs and data they're the sampling and zk approves you can now increase the block size limit uh without compromising the ability for end users to validate and verify the chain anatoly like clients on salona um the so the devil's in the details obviously here um when you look at like uh e2 like deployment like go to nodewatch.io there's about 6500 machines that run the 300 000 e2 nodes eth2 validators there's only 6 500 actual boxes so the real world deployment is that you take a salon validator and then you load it up with like a few hundred two nodes right e2 validators and that's your that's your eth2 deployment so the real world is that machines are getting bigger and the salon validators are not uh stacks of xeon processors they're like 32 core systems which is what you get out of uh you know like a data center right now for you know 800 bucks a month which is not insane by any means it's not building racks and racks of of of systems like you would for you know like a centralized service to handle all those users um so there's a bit of like kind of i think uh like uh i don't know um like you have to actually look at the details of how these things are deployed so it's it's uh i think uh it would be misinforming to say that the amount of hardware necessary to run solana is that significantly different than um any of the other chains when you actually look at how these things are being deployed in the real world but like clients themselves when you're talking about like a different system for verification uh there's obviously trade-offs so whenever anyone brings this up the question that i have is assuming all the other nodes everything else has been destroyed how many light clients do you need to re-re-hypothecate the network to reconstruct it so how many nodes are you trusting when you run this thing and those trust assumptions are important to users because the end state of like a monolithic chain is when you don't run any nodes you're trusting that at least one out of the whatever 3 000 boxes that run the replicate solana at least one of them is honest so when you're on a like client you partially participate in validation and then you assume that at least x number of other like clients are honest to help you to actually help you get those very like get those guarantees so it's up to the users to pick which one and if they even care
