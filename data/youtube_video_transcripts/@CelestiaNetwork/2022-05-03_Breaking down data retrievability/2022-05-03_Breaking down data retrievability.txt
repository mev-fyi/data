[Music] so celestia does not guarantee dates of achievability what celestia guarantees is that the data was published uh at some point in time the assumption that we make for this retrievability is like basically the same as ethereum full node uh which is that you know once the data has been published and once you compare if you can verify that the data was published then from from from that point on there's an honest minority assumption for the ongoing retrievability of that data um it's because effectively like if you can if you if you can check that data was actually published internet then for the ongoing achievability you just need to assume that there's at least like one honest uh like no like server on the internet that's willing to um like host and serve that data or like there's at least like one available data on the internet somewhere kind of like a kind of like this dry sound effects in a sense um and this is why also there's a block size limit like obviously that would not work if you have like you know tens of terabytes of data because you know people would not be able to host that and but if you if you have a block size limit that scales the number of users then you're more likely to go and that assumption is more likely to hold true in particular because the way that we want to design the system is that you can actually contribute to the storage of network without storing the entire blockchain um so like we have this concept of of partial storage nodes that can store parts of blockchain and contribute you know part to the parts to to part of the storage of the blockchain kind of like a kind of like a bit torrent files with different peers that hold different parts of the file okay so my my nitpicky summary of the situation here would be that you know i would say that yes if all the data in the celestia is one terabyte then i would assume that this data is still retrievable and retrievability in my opinion is the security requirement not just availability so if it's just one terabyte i would assume you know this data is probably there but if it's a a million terabytes then i would assume that the actual nodes in reality actually storing all that data is much smaller so meanwhile it is commonly said that you know as users grow you'll have more sampling and the security group scales with the number of users i think that you cannot escape this harsh reality that as data grows there will be perhaps fewer that actually stores the data and the the certainty that you can retrieve it shrinks so i think like attaching when you're saying that security scales with the number of users you're really thinking about the data availability sampling scales with the number of users but security is retrievability and retrieval retrievability is impacted by the actual size of the data so that's just like a nitpicky summary of the situation i still understand that the data availability sampling does you know give you uh [Music] favorable properties here but if you're going to the very cold harsh truth of the situation then thousands of petabytes of data on celestia you're going to have to rely on that that data still exists because you're not sampling it all the time and you're not getting proofs from other nodes that they have sampled it to your node all the time at least not in the way that celeste is designed at the moment do you think that that's a fair like did i did i say anything that was incorrect there well i mean i i guess there's two things i would say to that um like the first thing is like what i've said is this is is the status quo um of like of like how blockchains work uh like you know that's that's how that's the same assumption that ethereum full node uh makes and obviously that assumption does work like no one complains about the assumption as you rightly say that's because you know we're talking about a few therapists up there um but the question then becomes like if you have like what if you have hundreds of terabytes of there and it's like so okay there's like there's several things i will take that first of all just because we don't we would not want to have like on chain or in protocol incentives for data retrievability does not mean that there cannot be uh incentives for data retrievability like it just means that the incentive layer for data achievability and data availability is decoupled and you know for example like ethereum like how does like ethereum technically does have like ethereum today technically also has a data retrievability problem like that's why people pay you know infuria to get access to full nodes uh to give to to get api queries from inferior to to get data out of ethereum um but you can think of inferior as a centralized data retrievability layer for ethereum but obviously you can actually have um kind of decentralized versions of that for example you know you've got pocket network which is more distributed and you have like the graph which is uh achievability for index data and then and you've also got like you know data storage protocols you know for example file coin has proof of reachability um so like the first thing i would say like there's no inherent reason to deco like to have um data retrievability incentives as core parts protocol the second part i would say to that is um like even if that's not good enough it could be the case that the like end user the the the end user applications that people belong to last year could make their own assumptions about data receivability and like for example they could create their achievability assumptions within their within their applications and like celestia guarantees availability but if those applications want higher data which is building guarantees they could add data visibility or proof of reachability within their applications if they wanted to do so even though i don't think it's necessary but they could
