so we're all excited about model architecture but I actually wanted to cover something um something which I think doesn't get discussed a lot when it comes to modular chains and which is how the economics are going to look like right when you have all of these different layers working with each other what what are the economic models which we have at play and what the incentive design is going to look like ultimately what we've seen as a modeler technology in general when it comes to blockchains is not something new we've seen this in web 2 as well so what we've seen is that uh you know web 2 software architecture was always it was always monolithic it was replaced with apis and microservices and ultimately what we're seeing the same in web3 is that the monolithic chain architecture is also going to be replaced with model architecture right so at mantle for example we built a modeler chain uh we've gone live with eigen layer data availability we've taken the op stack and turned that into a modular stack um and what we've also seen is that API driven architecture led to like billions of dollars of value creation and we expect the same to see at least I expect the same thing to happen with the with the model architecture as well so let's try to look at some of the different layers of the blockchain and try and see what the incentive design is going to look like um so ultimately on the execution layer right we've seen like a lot of interesting things happen so if you've been following uh what what some of the other layer ones have been sort of doing for example Aptos came up with block STM which is parallelized processing there's also arboretums arbitrum stylus and polygon maiden and and what we've seen with different execution layers is that people have started thinking a little bit beyond evm so uh there was a there was a time or rather I would just say over the last 18 months we've seen that evm has been the sort of execution layer of choice but of course now we've come to this point where we can also see that evm is reaching a stage where either we optimize evm or we look at a different kind of execution model where we can use possibly other languages Etc um to sort of write smart contracts possibly do things more efficiently and ultimately you know there are a couple of ways of doing this at the execution layer you could possibly charge gas fees accrue some yield to stakers moment you start to decentralize you need to figure out some sort of economic model and ultimately the value will lie in in very optimized execution and it has to be deterministic in nature as well so if you can solve something like this in a decentralized manner where you've got multiple execution environments all fighting for this piece of the Spy we could see some new interesting economic models come out so I fully expect that with more and more VMS there chains will not sort of work with only one VM there could be one multiple ones depending on the kind of outcome you're looking for when it comes to gaming or D5 and ultimately as long as it's fast secure and deterministic and you can parallelize things we're going to see some interesting economic models come out of the execution layer um similarly on settlement right so uh if you guys have been following what happened on Twitter uh Anatoly posted something interesting where you could take ethereum transactions and put those on Solana um I don't know if you want to do that but uh but but it kind of gives you this interesting choice right so can we settle on other networks in the interim before we settle on ethereum like these days you must have seen so many different Roll-Ups are coming out on a daily basis and and which is great for for the ecosystem because that just means that the barrier to creating a chain and running a chain has reduced so much that everyone can have their own blockchain which is great but this also produces other challenges where we're going to see the block space on ethereum which is earlier crowded by transactions is going to be crowded out by roll ups more and more State routes are gonna eat up and stay truths while you can optimize them and you know we'll sort of get into that later but ultimately block space is again going to become a premium and and we need to figure out some interesting ways in which we can settle we can solve for incentives and we can achieve the kind of performance we need without like sacrificing security assumptions so ultimately you also have like this L3 app chain narrative going on these days like you can build your own app chain I think so many people want to do that um should you settle should they settle on ethereum should you only settle on L2 like how does for example the hyper chain model work on ZK sync like some of these things have been discussed from a technology standpoint But ultimately what you really need to solve for is how do you create value of the token of the chain building on top so all of these chains which are l3s all of them gonna have their own tokens how is the underlying layer going to build value accrual for those tokens ultimately is going to be the main kicker and of course valued lives sort of in derived security and faster finality but along with ecosystem benefits so for example if you're building your own L3 chain should you build it on ZK sync should you do OB Collective like how do you make that decision and what we've seen time time again is that the ability to get speed execution finality is something we've continued continuously become better at solving but how do you help the ecosystem and what does the ecosystem benefit look like ultimately when you have all of these different sort of chains fighting with each other you scroll you have polygons CK sync op arbitrum Nova how are they gonna help you design your ecosystem and how they're going to help you create value for your own token ultimately in my opinion is going to be the most important factor when you make this kind of a decision um and that's kind of why ecosystem benefits ultimately are going to be a very big factor so for example when we try to uh at mantle talk to chains who want to build l3s like the main conversation always is around ecosystem benefits for example liquidity listing of tokens and what else can we create markets for the tokens building on top um and if you go to the next layer right so data availability of course is now this hot new layer right we've got Celestia we have eigen layer so we went live with eigenlayer but we've been talking to Celestia for a while there's also polygon avail so many so uh so so much so so many different like data availability Solutions with different let's say security assumptions are also there and we also have E3 staking now as this new primitive where you can take for example the economic value of a token and you can use it for utility versus collateral based deals but ultimately you again have to create utility for the chain token so for example in our case what we liked about eigen layer is the fact that we could restake Ethan get security but we could also take our own token and stake that on on the data availability nodes thereby creating yield and value for our token and this is super important so whenever you talk like for example about Celestia or a whale luckily all the founders are here so I can quiz them about these things but uh how are you going to help my token and where do the ecosystem benefits lie so with more data availability Solutions ultimately the ability to solve token related and value related problems is going to become more important than any piece of technology out there um and and we're just at the start of data availability so I expect to see like more economic value sort of uh or rather more like different approaches to economic value come out of the time to come but this is like the main question I literally have when I talk to like data availability uh players out there um and if you go to the next layer right the consensus layer now again like consensus layer is a total war zone right now with ZK VMS doing their own thing um the share sequencer approach is also interesting but again the question is always the same how do you create yield right so you have all of these ZK approvers you have like shared sequencers shared Bridges fantastic how does it help my token like how does it trade value for me so I I sometimes feel that we talk a lot about technology we talk about eip4844 we talk about local trees to reduce proof size and optimize all of these things but ultimately and yeah you can find gas free extraction models and offer yield on decentralized designs but how's the trade value and ultimately these are the conversations we need to start having so you know I think we need to start looking a little bit beyond the technology and try and see how we can solve uh for Value in these decentralized designs um I'm just going to keep it really short and this is basically the last slide but ultimately technology will decide if we can build modular chains But ultimately the incentive design is what will decide how we do these things how these execution layers come together how these data availability layers come together how the consensus layer comes together so uh no value no token equal to no bueno and we need to really solve that so uh so anyway thank you so much for listening I just want to keep it really short and want to get more people start talking more about incentive designs and I think the key of how we're going to implement all of these things lies in in the token itself so so anyway thank you guys that that's really it [Applause] you wanna maybe take some questions oh yeah um do you guys have any questions anything anything you want me to cover about incentive design foreign how are y'all thinking about communication of that's right I didn't layer you know can I beat eigenda before they even were out right yeah part of your token model surprised by how the economic um not necessarily because the core security assumption or the underlying infrastructure of how eigen layer is built is already set in stone right uh because it's in the white paper so it's kind of already decided upon now the way okay so the way to think about these problems is that the way you solve modularity with technology you cannot really change that so I'm actually against changing technology to fit the incentive model what we need to do is take the infrastructure more like whatever the security assumptions are whatever the restaking layer is and what we need to do in that is bake economics into it so the data availability nodes which is securing data availability for many different chains which is ultimately secured by the underlying eigen layer restaking infrastructure unless you can offer some token utility there you know I feel chains may think twice before adopting this kind of a sort of a data availability model right and similarly for Celestia Celestia has got such an interesting model itself right which is a little more optimistic in design polygon Avail is using cardi polynomial commitments but ultimately how they create value for the networks token and what those where those benefits lie are are going to be like super important so I don't think these companies or or anybody else building this needs to change the infrastructure they need to just figure out how to fit an incentive design into into their underlying infrastructure so eigen layer is doing that using nodes I think celesteam shows hasn't will have some approach I think Avail is going to be live possibly by q1 of next year so I look forward to seeing how they sort of solve these problems for Networks this is that does that cover the question how mantle themselves are thinking about incentives right because you're using that both on the gas fee context and I guess if da stakers are also staking yeah this is the so so I would say that in terms of token what I would say is that how we plan to structure it as an ecosystem token so it'll be used for gas fees it'll be used for infrastructure staking it'll be used as the ecosystem token it'll be used for governance and then we'll it will also be used in all the other protocols You're Building like the liquids taking database protocol which we also plan to roll out possibly by Q4 of this year so the token will have utility across all of these all of these sort of you could say infrastructure pieces so that's kind of how we've designed the token and whatever is produced in the future and whatever products we're going to make we're going to ensure that we bake in some sort of incentive design cool yeah all right all right in case you have any other questions you can always just reach out to me on Twitter it's a first name last name
