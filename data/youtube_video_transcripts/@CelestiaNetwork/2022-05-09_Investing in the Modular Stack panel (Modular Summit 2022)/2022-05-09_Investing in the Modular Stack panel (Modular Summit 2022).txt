all righty hello everyone uh i hope all of you have been enjoying today uh as much as i have i know i've been really looking forward to the summit and appreciate maven and celestia inviting us to speak today um but my name is joe i do investing over at framework and very excited to be joined by this group today as we kind of discuss our various perspectives on supporting the modular thesis through our work as investors and in the space so i think we'll kind of start just by kind of going around uh introduce yourself uh where you're from uh and then as well maybe the first concept or idea uh that introduced you to kind of the modular paradigm yeah cool um so i'm mathis i'm a partner at maven 11 and part-time event these days we're co-organizing this so incredibly happy you're all here um i think i first ran into modularism or modular blockchain design when i ran into the lazy ledger paper written by mustafa in 2019 i reached out to john adler with some questions and we then helped bootstrap lazy ledger with their initial sheet round hey everyone i'm i'm alex i'm a partner with uh blockchain capital um i was first introduced to uh to the concept of the modular blockchain paradigm probably in 2019 just reading each research forum so the the first concept i i don't forget the specific project that i first read about but was the optimistic roll-up so it was either optimism or fuel or arbitrarium hey i'm will uh i work at galaxy digital and invest on behalf of the team there um obviously paid attention to the optimistic roll-up stuff in 2019 but i think the moment where the shift to the modular sort of approach really clicked was watching in like october 2020 when vitalik was posting about the sort of rollup centric roadmap and ethereum's shift from east 2.0 sharding to a to sort of like a data shard centric approach was the moment that it clicked that these like different functions of a blockchain are going to be split up and then started reading mustafa's papers at that point and got you know started to work with the team around that time and then you know proceeded with that so cool my name is eli i'm a partner on the polychain investment team i think the the first time that i started thinking about kind of the modular stack um i think it's hard for me to trace back exactly but it really evolved from conversations just with brilliant people in the industry one of them being james prestwich who i was kind of like trying to work with i guess when i was like a struggling or a mediocre developer um just on interoperability interoperability and so this evolved into this idea of or or this exploration of a trade-off space of you know really you have like composition which is like you know how do you compose different functions within a the same execution environment like how the evm operates today um and then you have interoperability you know and and the various kind of permutations of that with ibc or xcmp in the polka dot ecosystem um and then you know we we are also thinking about scaling um and so this this evolves from you know all these ideas around sharding and how do you how do you appropriately communicate between these charts like how do you make them interoperable how do you um how do you compose these functions because that's a really interesting you know kind of thing to to you know discover with with you know flash loans or what have you um and i kind of came to the conclusion that like you know maybe the best way forward is not to you know put such an emphasis on on composability or or like kind of uh synchronous composability rather and so you know after evaluating this for a while you know you can you can kind of like parallelize it with shards or you can kind of compress or commit data in a roll-up and just after exploring a lot of these ideas i i actually realized that what i had kind of discovered or rediscovered was a pitch that i heard a year before with the lazy ledger white paper and so for those who are not aware lazy ledger is the you know the academic name for or behind celestia exactly um so that that's really what led me to you know yeah this modular kind of way of thinking i love it let's uh i think one thing that i'm like really curious around to get some of your guys perspective on is you know in a broad sense like what makes you know yourself or or kind of the investment thesis that you hold you know why is it so bullish specifically on on this modular stack versus monolithic constructs uh yeah i think it's it's of course about the various parts of the stack and that you can optimize for say data availability or execution etc but maybe deeper down and especially with data availability sampling it goes about giving users or end users and their lite clients the ability to be first-class citizens i think still words for use um of these crypto networks so that i with my mobile phone have similar security guarantees or almost similar as a full mod whether that metals or not is maybe the bigger question and i think we'll get into that later with mustafa and anatolia but that's i think that's why we're building web 2.0 um to have entry verification absolutely about you alex yeah i mean for me it comes back to like why we're here in the first place which is we want to build um you know we want to build open incorruptable censorship-resistant networks for the web i mean our view we see you know the majority of the world's economic activity moving on to blockchain networks over some period of time that you know is probably over the next couple of decades and in order for that to happen i mean you look at what the end state is and that's millions of transactions per second so what we have right now is definitely not going to get the job done and like what is the best proposal for how to get to that end state and um and to do so safely and by safely you know that would that would mean without breaking the guarantees that decentralized blockchain networks give you today so censorship resistance and security primarily and the best proposal that i've seen for that is to scale via rollups and to scale via a modular blockchain stack where instead of introducing a an honest majority assumption every time you scale horizontally you can scale vertically and via some combination of fraud proofs validity proofs and data ability data availability proofs you can introduce only an honest minority assumption and you can significantly increase the throughput and the express expressivity of of new execution environments that all share some decentralized foundation so i mean that to me makes the modular blockchain stack um the the only viable approach right now to an end state where the world's economic activity is happening on blockchain actually what about yourself well i mean it's always i think for us comes back to scaling we just simply haven't seen like rollups can work but you know we're not operating at scale yet today right so you know the kind of scale that can onboard you know a global and you know full user base you know across across the world so when you see i think why we're bullish on and we believe in the modular thesis is because you know when you split out these layers data availability from execution from settlement you you can optimize the three separately right and you can let them when they're bundled together you fundamentally can't you know you know perform the optimizations um that each one is able you know capable of being on their own right so when you it gives splitting out data availability in particular gives you the ability to go from you know basically data available availability proof and you know in o of n right complexity to to o of you know square root of n right and that's a phase shift in in the ability to scale block chains right and we're looking i think you know in some at times particularly investing in technology it's like you're looking for phase shifts as an investor and like going from o event of square root of n is a phase shift and so i think we think this kind of stuff will continue to emerge as this you know sort of thesis is played out and technologists continue to develop along these lines anything to add there eli uh i think i covered a lot of this in kind of my earlier point kind of jump the gun but um i think the only thing that i would kind of add was that you know if you look at the history of computation you kind of like you know maybe you started with like uh something more primitive like uh abacus and then you kind of worked your way way up through like application machines like you know there were these um kind of machines or kind of like contraptions that you know could uh solve a fourier series or something right but they were very application specific that were very bulky and then we worked our way up to mainframes or what have you and then worked our way all the way down to you know kind of modular modularizing it right with you know cpus gpus whatever is kind of in your desktop or laptop and i think that you know we're seeing a similar evolution in the blockchain space um but i do think that there's like you know there's a little bit of ambiguity about like you know what modularity actually means right i think that so far we've seen modularity in the cosmos sdk or the the substrate design for for polka dot but i think that you know celestia is really really interesting to me because you know you can have all of these modules you can build custom execution environments but you still uh inherit the security of the underlying chain through roll-ups or whatever and i think this extends to other kind of you know other categories of investing whether that's you know bridges or or what have you it's like really important to you know further modularize some of these concepts but also still inherit some of those um you know security principles elements of the kind of the security foundation i got you what do you all think is kind of like or are some of the larger distinctions when it comes to uh you know investing in uh a modular thesis versus the monolith like one maybe we could start with yourself ela on this one sure so i think um i mean uh we've been pretty bullish on you know uh kind of this modular paradigm for quite some time um but i think when when thinking about kind of monolithic versus uh versus modular architectures you know if you abstract modules in celestia or just like roll-ups on ethereum um or what have you really you just kind of end up with like a bunch of different chains if you abstract it away enough um and i think that you know like our name is polychain right like we we have like a bunch of application specific chains in our portfolio um and you know whether you're exploring that because uh you want to implement some kind of new execution environment or um maybe you want to incorporate you know cheaper fees for some kind of privacy based feature or whatever it may be um you know we don't live in a monolithic world it doesn't really make sense to even from a portfolio construction perspective to invest in one monolithic chain if you believe like in that kind of thesis right so uh yeah i mean i i still really like solana and everything i really like ethereum um and i don't think that they're going anywhere but i kind of view them almost as their own modules interesting well what about yourself what do you think makes kind of the largest distinctions between investing in these two separate thesis yeah it's it's actually i think maybe more challenging in theory i think to invest in modular not like it's hard to decide to that that should be your thesis but but thinking through like what parts of that stack are um going you know are going to be valuable is actually i think harder to do as an investor frankly i think when you have you know that like a sort of monolithic l1 so whether it's ethereum or something else right fundamentally the re the you know tokens on the l1 are being used to pay for you know secure you know sorry you know uh compute bandwidth like memory and solid state storage fundamentally they're provisioning those resources on the network and but that's okay because those things are all bundled together and you know obviously you're paying for it at the op code level but in like at the end of the day like you know when you're submitting a transaction you're paying for all in all in one bundle fundamentally and so it's like and that creates a surplus you know that you know a transaction fee that produces a surplus above and beyond what the miner takes in that's kind of the eip 1559 model i think this is more challenging right because now you have different layers where there's different fundamentally different resources being sort of like provisioned at the end of the day and understanding which of those resources like uh whether that's computer bandwidth or solid state storage or memory like understanding who what people are willing to pay for each of those and then who exactly is going to pay for for each one i think is pretty non-obvious to me at the moment maybe these guys have answers but um that i think it makes it more challenging frankly to like really evaluate um these pro i think these like modular projects as an investor alex i know we've talked a lot about this kind of what are your thoughts maybe on some of what will was speaking on are just kind of the distinctions between this yeah i mean for me i think it comes down to end user and developer choice and iteration speed um specifically so when when you build a monolith like blockchain you are you know you're marrying absolutely consensus settlement data availability execution and that constrains the directions that you can move in it's much more difficult to upgrade a system where all those pieces are coupled together whereas in a modular blockchain you can deploy a new role up when you want to experiment with the new execution environment and so over time like like you know what i'd love to see is like a wallet where i can have almost like a slider for like what's the level of security you need what is the level of privacy you need what you know what what is the um the speed of of transactions that you need um for for whatever your application is or even just as an end user doing payments and you know i think if we're if we have wallets switching between a bunch of monolithic blockchains that are specialized for each of those things that introduces a massive security hole in bridging assets between them and so when you have roll ups you have these like natively trust minimized bridges that are baked in and you can achieve you know very like highly customizable security highly customizable privacy etc for for applications without compromising on security so i i think that approach is more sound long term almost giving developers kind of an additional choice by kind of modularizing that yeah exactly i mean at the end of the day like this is these are open networks it's open source software and so like the more experiments we run the more iterations we produce the better the results are going to be and the faster we're going to move as a space and so i think one of those approaches lends itself much more effectively to experimentation to iteration and i think that it's very likely that that will produce more interesting applications and developer experiences long term anything to add on that one uh no i agree with almost everything that has been said but two maybe more general points will said earlier right these roll-ups aren't live fully yet so i think there's still a lot of ongoing research and when looking to back founders i think you have to accept that there can be quite radical pivots based on the latest research so you need to look for people that are willing to do that that aren't like set in stone and i'm going to build just this and when a new insight comes they ignore it in addition and i think this is something we already see with the rise of bridges between monolithic chains i expect these communities of the various parts of the stack to get increasingly intertwined so we see that with avalanche and terra now right their communities are sort of splitting uh combining two bridges i think in the modular stack that's gonna happen so much more yeah and it is an interesting thing to think about when you you know not only are you modularizing the technical components of these but also the underlying social consensus of each of these layers and it does lead to kind of some of these interesting kind of ideas to think about on a much longer term basis as well as people are kind of choosing where to where to go and which layers to use under them um you all think there's maybe a particular layer within the modular stack that you believe is maybe like underappreciated under discussed or maybe even potentially undervalued yeah yeah i i think right now we mostly focus on execution environments that are evm focused i think different types of execution environments virtual machines i know fuel was on here earlier they are doing something with that are fastly undervalued because it brings in a whole new wave of developers and i think that's something that excites me a lot about modularity i'm sorry frontrunning you i know you're yeah i mean maybe just to like expand on on the intuition there like the i guess the most dominant development standard today is based around the evm which i don't think that a lot of folks would disagree is is suboptimal in a number of ways like the way that it prices storage the way that it handles memory these things like create limitations in the types of applications that you can build and the level of scalability that you get like the amount you know how efficiently you use node resources at the end of the day and so like allowing um the space via modular execution environments to break away from the the evm and run experiments on like can we optimize a vm for a specific application like to me that is that is like like we've more or less saturated probably development efforts on around the evm and that's important we should continue to you know to improve it and make it better and make evm proliferate more but like alternative vms are very important and have a large place in in the world and so those experiments i think are very welcomed yeah we're we're all going to be on the same page on this one i mean ironically it's like data availability sampling and data availability that like unlocked all of this right so in some ways that's the most you know like that should be what we're most excited about but at the end of the day like the real exciting part of the modular stack fundamentally is that um i you know i i think the design space for the execution layer has been blown wide open by splitting out execution optimizing the data availability and consensus layer i think like we haven't even started to explore the design space and what's cool about it is it you can iterate a lot fast i mean obviously cosmos and cosmos sdk and other projects have provided like some outlet for this in the past but still i mean there's a lot there is a lot involved in scaling a validator set uh you know and some of the work you have to do to spin up a call you know sort of like a cosmos zone so i'm not their credit to where credit's due to people who have you know gone down this road in the past i just think the pace of you know developing new rule sets for execution environments or execution layer is going to be um way faster on top of celestia and in this sort of roll up in a modular you know modular you know sort of approach things that like i mean we could talk there's a number of parameters we could sort of imagine tweaking you know but you can there's there's just so much you can do whether that's increasing block intervals trying something with longer block intervals where it allows you to do longer sort of like compute right so that you can do like write longer programs if compute is really cheap and you can write longer programs you know people might try doing something like that you might try you know i've i was i you know parallelization of transactions uh was mentioned before like the there's so many parameters you can you know sort of modify and it's just a multivariate sort of like design space and i'm excited to watch people explore this over the next couple years because i think that's where a lot of the exciting stuff around the modular stack will happen yeah i i think that there's like just this kind of elegance uh around the like minimal design of celestia specifically um and when thinking about you know how the execution environments on celestia or any other chain will evolve does get really interesting naturally the the first step is to have this kind of evm environment maybe slightly modify it maybe it's a canary network or something uh like that um but i think that the next step gets even more interesting where you can take a cosmos sdk app and maybe decouple some of the staking economics from the the core business logic right you no longer or or maybe you don't have to subsidize uh valid the validator set as much right or or you know you can defer some of those costs or or just cut costs in general i think the the the the step after that uh gets even more interesting where you know you can kind of have this ide where what you're really doing is deploying separate roll-ups of sorts um you know and you're no longer competing to include a transaction in you know this uh this this order book uh this uh order matching logic uh or and you know and and that's separate from uh voting logic in a governance module or something right so you have like a matching engine module and then you have a governance module or something right and these things can seamlessly uh uh communicate between one another um using celestia um or you know uh you know even ethereum can do this on a long enough time horizon i'm sure absolutely um i think like one of the ideas that makes me think a lot about is just like you know i think we've covered a lot of you know what this stack or what about this stack excites us i'd love to hear some more about like you know what are the implications of that on applications on end users i think there's an aspect of security that could get discussed here but also just the new design space that this opens for applications would be awesome to hear your thoughts on yeah so um [Music] so i think that um you know even taking a step back from just thinking of celestia as the modular stack i think that other applications um have been really interesting to see uh to see evolve so you know there are these different kind of layers that we've seen as more chains just come into existence um you know you don't have to you no longer you know are just loyal to this like l1 eth right um and you know using a lot of layer twos uh feels very similar to layer ones that have deployed evm compatible environments and so we're seeing you know um new kind of like liquidity layers like um connects where that can act as like a clearinghouse between all of these different uh environments and i think that um you know when you have this clearinghouse you don't really have to worry about um you know certain security concerns because you know it's modular modularized in a way where it inherits the security of you know the the local instances where it's deployed or you have something like nomad that can be used for uh passing messages between these different modules or environments um and then you know at the application layer you know you know outside of just um uh outside of just you know kind of communicating or transferring tokens between uh all of these environments you have like core applications right it's like something like dydx um you know they're they're deployed on stark net and i think like the majority of the reason they can even function is like solely because of kind of the scalability increases yeah exactly right will what do you what do you think about like or what excites you kind of about the application space when it comes to yeah i think you know we've made a lot of points uh and gone there's just a lot i think that's that generally excites this group one thing that i want to flag as well while we have it's like some of the work cello has historically done on plumo which is the sort of light client that's optimized for mobile i think there's some elements um you know celestia's data availability is very different but data like the modular paradigm and data availability like uh sort of like a like let's call them like an eager blockchain versus a lazy blockchain like lazy blockchains are like fundamentally pretty good at uh for like fundamentally better for sort of mobile users and like if mobile users want to be self-sovereign because like clients have stronger you know sort of censorship resistance guarantees so i'm excited to see if we can so you you know use the data availability paradigm and the modular paradigm to approach you know new applications for mobile first users i i it's a little bit further down the road and that's a little more speculative but i think that's always should be a goal of the crypto and blockchain community is like how do we build things for different sort of like sort of computing platforms like mobile and um so i know i know that's a bit of a digression from some of the stuff eli was just talking about but i wanted to flag it as something i find exciting and we'll see if that can you know that can sort of like emerge i'm definitely aligned with you there like i think there is an end goal for web3 where you know we need to have or at least provide the optionality for end users to be you know verifying on and then making that easy on it on yeah device like a mobile phone otherwise like inevitably somebody will build it you know we'll build an application for mobile phone and you won't have the option to do to have like you know sort of self-sovereign tv a really you know censorship resistant light client um so you know that for me that's that's pretty cool awesome i know we only have a few minutes left but i'll let you guys hit on this one anything particularly um interesting that you guys are kind of foreseeing when it comes to the application layer uh sure um so my a colleague of mine uh ryan likens it to uh you know i guess like the shift here to a breakthrough in hardware so it's really hard to say like what does this new paradigm enable um but i think we have some instincts on what it might enable so for as an example fuel processes transactions in in parallel so they can run at a significantly higher speed than a monolithic blockchain so that enables things like micropayments which aren't practical um or economical on on blockchains today they also have a significant memory expansion um at the node level and so that allows things that are memory intensive like an on-chain order book dex for instance which is not something that you can really practically run on on ethereum today so yeah without any trade off yep ties what about yourself to polish yourself yeah i think the order books have been mentioned a few times right i totally agree there also on the application layer i think we will just see more radical innovation because it's easy to just deploy an application specific chain and try something out another but this is maybe more infrastructure if you will as bridges that's their shared state between optimistic rollups is an area i'm very interested in i haven't really seen that yet so if someone is building it do reach out but yeah apart from that agree with what they all said awesome guys well i think we are at time but really appreciate you all joining us and thanks everyone for coming out to the summit i hope you all have enjoyed [Applause]
