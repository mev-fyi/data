hey welcome everyone to another Community call with Celestia this is community call number four and we have a lot of exciting uh updates for you regarding mocha tesne and Arabica devnet um before we get started um we want to like you know give a quick update about things that people might have seen on Discord or asking questions so we wanted to get it out of the way now and focus the rest of the conversation on Mocha and erotica right uh so we want to address questions regarding the email about the incentivized contestant um if you haven't received an email you either haven't signed up but a node operated list or you were caught by one of our filters because you tried to game the waiting list or you're Innocent but you got caught up by a filter which can happen so for context for a lot of people we had over like 20 000 people interested and we only can give it for like like we can only admit up to one like a few sense of that you know so you're gonna use q and even if like some people completed it it might not even be approved they're created a high probability of that um just simply like I mean even if you received the email there's simply no guarantees that you'll be invited to the incentive by test a good figured up how big that queue is so we wanted to put that out of the way and give you that kind of context so this is all we can currently share about the incentive I've tested um we'll have more updates in 2023. um for the remainder of the call we will be covering um other topics like mocha testing so if your question for this call is related to the inside of our customers other than the context that I gave you right now um and we'll repeat that context on um we'll repeat that context on like in the chat outside of those um we can't really provide any more information until January or like February so but by the next year we'll have more updates but for now for the remainder of the call we're not going to cover any questions related to the incentivized testing other than the update I gave you now I hope that's okay and that we can have a really good call um trying to see if any other point um sir another point is um regarding this call if you did not sign up for the note operated waiting list from a while back but we detect that you have been historically and meaningfully contributing to Celestia on Discord on GitHub um and you're an active Community member we might invite you to sign up to the incentive by customer but there's no guarantees because the waiting list is big and it's big and to the point that it's overwhelming right um and with that said let's get started covering mocha so mocha test net um let me try to find the actual blog post about yeah so if you if you folks haven't really seen um I guess you know we did say it in the announcement but worth talking about it here um wow the chat is pretty active huh um so um here at the blog post oh no I did it wrong um I sent it a direct message to somebody when I should have sent it um to the group let me try to figure it out um rock media can you like grab that blog post something on our channel uh in the chat anyway so growing up in Utah and producing Arabica and mocha so if you haven't noticed we're all big copy fans so we're naming our testing after coffee beans with Arabic and mocha being the most popular coffee beans now what did this update and why you should care about it is so Arabica devnet is only like focused targeting developers you've probably seen it already um in our Discord like you know you're doing Arabica faucet for a developer to get onboarded so with a replica devnet um validators can't really validate on Arabic cook or just like something that we are like running but Arabica devnet will always have like some of the latest updates from Celestia and it will allow you if you want to build a stubborn roll up Arabica devnet will make it so easy for you to do that so check it out um there's a lot of docs there um and yeah like you can do an evm roll up it's a lot of VM roll up Cosmos VM roll up and deploy them on top of our erratica um and then third the mocha upgrade so you probably all know about Mamaki Mamaki is a test net uh um we deployed sometimes in we hit me I don't know so it was like maybe in April or May we deployed uh Mamaki test day so that was like a validator focus um uh testing it because we want to test a lot of things that would validator um when it comes to consensus breaking transit or coordination related um practices so that would Mamaki now Mamaki was kind of outdated by the time like um with all the new braking standards that we're adding so we decided instead of a hard part an upgrading mamacy we decided to do a hard spoon a hard spoon basically where we start a new network but we maintain the same state of the Mamaki on Mocha so if you're a validator or if you have a Celestia one uh address on mamapi you're definitely going to have that same balance um on Mocha so it's a very easy way to migrate over and we recommend if you're running a monthly validator at the moment please uh shut it down and run a mocha validator instead um and with that let's go over mocha and all the exciting upgrades um so in mocha there's there's a bunch of new uh exciting changes and I don't know if I haven't found a call but I would love if Evan wants to go over it yeah sure so like what Yaz was saying with mocha we had a quite a few breaking changes so starting off with upgrading the cosmos SDK and downgrading tenement and the reason that we downgraded tenement was there was some peer-to-peer changes that I think um were causing a few issues with Mamaki and now um with tender man 3-4 we're using like a more tried and true peer-to-peer stack so we hope to have a lot of improvements there we also increased the over amount of data the overall amount of data that could be included in a single block so instead of having four megabytes now we have eight megabytes potential block space we include we also in upgraded our encoding Library so now the air Assurance coding is significantly faster and that's something else that we wanted to test and then we also had a sort of a new format for encoding our data that we think is significantly easier to reason about for role of developers who are working at a very low level and then we also changed it so that now every time you post your block data to Celestia you can check for the inclusion of that block data without actually having to download all of it so you can do it very very quickly which was always like a critical feature for Celestia we just finally um we ship this I think back in September now it's being included in mocha and I think that's about it it's a very exciting update we will still if you're a validator on Mocha please stay tuned into the Discord Channel because we will likely have updates on anything that might need to change to make block times more consistent but so far things are going decently well I think that I think that's the only updates for me awesome um yeah um from the Celestia note side Renee um since Mamaki and to the point of Arabic and mocha I know there's a lot of changes that went through Celestia node on the Da Side um uh do you want to talk about some of the changes that went into mocha uh yeah can you hear me yeah I can hear you okay there aren't many user-facing changes besides um like our development of the rpcu component um so before we had um something along the lines of like a rest Gateway that we um opened on Port 26658 um like as a default uh but now we've migrated that to Port 26659 as a default it's still available with all the methods that you guys are used to but now we're developing out Json RPC on Port 26658 it's not fully complete yet but it is almost um it is almost there um and most of the changes have actually been in regards to how we do data availability sampling and um how we propagate um shares which are just like chunks of blocks across the network and how we store them um so a lot of it has just been hardening uh so not not many user-facing things on the Celestia node side um but yeah mainly the main changes you guys will see are with the RPC um I don't know if there's anything maybe on to add something I think you mentioned everything perfectly so yeah nice and sweet okay I'm done alrighty um not sure if there's anybody from the Roman okay side um like I don't know it's not related to mocha and Arabica but historically people when they're using Roman using it with Mamaki was kind of problematic because Mamaki had a bunch of issues that were inherited from Upstream uh Cosmos and tendermen that we resolved in mocha but now like that things are more stable with new shiny new testament named after Coffee Bean if you folks notice we move we pivoted from tea to Coffee which is a great pivot in my opinion because I'm a coffee Maxi but pretty well uh Roman people um I don't know for sure anyone else when the team is here but do you guys want to give any uh updates there um if not maybe we can also talk about what people can expect in January aside from the incentive by President I know we're planning something related to the qgb but it's not announced yet but like maybe we can give them a little snippet Evan what do you think say again sorry um I'm talking about like we're planning it you should be testnet at some time um maybe we can tease that out to people and stuff like what to expect by next we should in the in the in q1 we should launch a test net for the qgb and this test net will be sort of its own thing we're working on what we're calling the qgb V2 and it's just like um more or less just a different design but we'll have extremely similar if not identical from a user perspective functionality so in q1 we'll have a test net that you'll actually be able to use so you'll be able to post your data to that test net and then you'll be able to prove that that data exists on any AVM chain or that proof that that data was posted to this testnet from any evm chain sweet so yeah I mean that's one thing to look forward to with the crucial beat um um being close uh in quarter one that would allow you like if you're a sovereign like uh if you're a roll-up developer and let's say for some like you know for um philosophical or other reasons you want to still settle on ethereum but you want to benefit from Celestia for the data availability component and scalability that it offers you can still do that using the Google view so that is like uh super exciting like update that we'll have later for now there are what I would recommend for everyone is play around with mocha run a balloter if you like run deploy yourself and roll up on product uh mocha or Arabica um and let us know like you know give us some feedback we're we're here in the Discord um we're happy to chat about any kind of um um any kind of like improvements that we can make we're always updating the docs for the latest information and yeah um we're very excited and we'll have more updates in quarter one 2023 but for now um unless somebody else wants to mention anything from American that I might have missed maybe we can go to q a um and as a reminder q a has like we're not going to answer any questions related to the incentive testing we already gave like um we it gave an overview at the beginning of another call um we'll have more information about the incentive in quarter one next year um but for now we just want to focus everything on like demo care and erotica announcement so with that said um if anyone had any question um because you're not able to unmute yourself we recommend that if you have a question you either type it in chat and hopefully you're not spamming the chat um and or you can raise your hand and we'll unmute you so you can ask your question anyone wants to raise their hand I mean to be honest I don't know how I can raise my hand I've never tried that before oh Josh uh yeah I don't have a question but it's under reactions oh is mocha going to be the long-term president great question uh Evan what do you think yeah that's the idea mocha will be around for a long time and will be it will we the release strategy goes for once we push a new release it goes on an internal test then and then it goes to Arabica and then it goes to mocha so mocha should be the more long-lasting more stable Tesla the idea yeah I wonder if anyone from her from the devops side is here um yeah so like like Evan said um like that kind of um step-by-step um deployment process makes it much more streamlined could Arabica since we kind of control the validator we can just upgrade it whenever the latest featured but then um things will be tested internally for new feature then you deployed on a ravita so that we you have real life users and then finally deploy it on mocha but Mocha because it required validator coordination that upgrade process takes a little bit longer oh June is in the waiting room the invite June um uh okay so we have a uh okay I'm gonna go through the question one by one um first Igor or uh let me unmute you Igor asked you on you hello hey can you hear me yeah I can hello yes hello team hello Community thank you very much yes everything is good uh I have a question regarding the test nuts it's gonna be on Arabica and it's gonna be a mocha uh we do deeply support the cluster project and uh should we take part in both devnet and the test net or though there will be like maybe it will make more sense to take part in mocha and do not run the Arabica yeah so mocha's valigator Focus so we're more than happy for you to run a validator on Mocha I think like that's something that we recommend for all validators and if you already were running one on mamati deploying like you know um on Arab uh on Mocha um will be you're still maintain the same state so you'll still have the same balances um Evan correct me if I missed anything there on Arabica you we don't have a way for people to deploy a validator because if we use it as a public uh test net that we kind of like a centralized Testament but we use it for testing for like if you want to test the latest Future Azure developer you can use arabica kind of like how people can use gorily on ethereum but to become part of the uh proof of the POA uh set it takes a long time um and you got like it's it's a not a straightforward process and the reason for that is because we want to provide developer an easy way to onboard with doesn't necessarily require them to run a node now on that side if you want to deploy stubborn Roll-Ups and stuff on Arabica or even on Mocha you can do both but if you want to run a valid or it will be on Mocha okay um there's a few other questions I think though like I saw uh be at racism uh be it do you did you want to say anything before we go to the questions in the um chat if you uh raise your hand I can find you an academy you otherwise I'll make you co-host if I can find you oh there you are um let me find hold on let me unmute you no make you co-host yeah uh thank you just a quick uh note is that uh yeah uh if you want to learn about letter uh please uh go to mocha um as it is a yeah because it is a lost uh long lasting test net for everybody to participate and um if you are deaf and you want the latest the greatest uh then Arabica is your One-Stop shop this is where we want to make sure that all latest releases from here all our repositories are living there mainly uh Celestial load and selection this is what I wanted to say thank you awesome um Igor don't worry um if you unmute yourself you want to say anything else you can just raise your hand and unmute you but for now I'm glad that you're running on Mocha we love having your validators on Mocha it's exciting to see um okay now let's go through the other question that were on the chat um oh a bunch of questions were just like sent to me directly okay so one question by Damien as a validator do we need to start from zero with token to be active no um Damien if you're already running a validator on mamati you should have the same balance provided you own the same p on Mamaki on Mocha so if you run it on Mocha you should see the same balance unless you ran it like you started to validate it yesterday because we took the snapshot like a few days back then you might not see the balance but if you've been running a Mamaki validator for a few like couple weeks you should be seeing the same balance on Mocha I hope that answered the question if not feel free to raise your hand or talk in the chat but um yeah um Big Jim I haven't had a chance to read the doc said are there any big changes to the Note specs required um if you're talking about our Hardware requirements that hasn't changed to my knowledge um because we haven't updated anything on the docs yet uh related to Hardware requirements could we tested it like they're they're recommended versions are the same however to keep in mind there's two new Flags when you run a validator there's like the daf daf EDM flag under the dash dash orchestrator flag and maybe it's a good uh segue for Evan to give more and like input on what those flags do or why they're there um and what to expect in the future with those flags yeah so currently those flags don't do anything they do they are stored in the state and we will eventually use them for the qgb but we just the the qgb has like a certain State portion in the state machine so we wanted to add that to the state missions we so we have it but we so we don't have to hard fork in the future um but currently it doesn't do anything and you can always change them later so you can't use anyone else's address so they do have to be your addresses but that's about it in the future um before we turn the qgb on we will notify people and you if you want to edit or change those addresses you can and then essentially we'll just turn the qtb on and it will start working magically sweet so there you have it folks there are two new Flags they don't do anything but make sure like um you can think their addresses but make sure there are Celestia addresses or your own and the udm addresses your own and then you can swap them out after um just having them there just so that you can run the network but you can swap them out later and in the future like what I've been saying when you when the TCP is turned on um they'll start doing something you know um all right so catch fire hi team how's it going with the modular fellows how many developers do you have on top of the Celestia maybe oh um go to keep your hands raised we'll go to you next um but Josh uh You Wanna Give an overview of the modular sellers um yeah it's going well um so there are 13 different teams I guess there are nine teams that are working uh on modular fellows as individuals so they're basically building a project on their own and then there are around 15 teams that are in the program as teams so they are further along in their projects maybe already have funding and the program's going really well we're actually going to be having a demo day um in the middle of January I don't think that's going to be completely open to the public but we do plan to share some of the more polished projects after the demo day itself and then in terms of like the number of Developers that are building on Celestia we don't really have those sort of numbers um so I don't really have an answer for that but yeah really looking forward to seeing some of these fellows projects kind of build out into more finished products as the program ends and then after the program itself yeah I mean uh having an accurate account for how many developers build downtrend is very very hard problem to you know derive an answer for because there's a lot of signal that you can see on train about you know how to train activities being used um but it's not like like hard science because like I can just generate a million addresses deploy a million random contracts on Tesla and that will be like oh there's a hundred different uh developers on that but we're working on a way through like you know at least come up with a more precise answer um that indicates what would be uh how many developers are building but the module fellow is very exciting there oh Josh um we did have underdogs like the calendar with different YouTube videos yeah maybe you want to share that yeah um so for cash fire um we have a docs with all like the videos so far um like the content so a lot of it is very like you know knowledge sharing around different modular protocols that are building on top of Celestia um or lessons there so check it out um Josh will paste the link there and yeah um I think you'll find it very useful okay uh somebody raised their hand first um but they stopped raising their hand who's that person otherwise I'll continue with the chat oh there you are shooting uh let me unmute you Jordan um okay uh did you have a question Jordan we can't hear you otherwise oh shh um okay um so I have to run validated you know do I need to do any chances um no um the only changes uh who wrote Coden Raider is um related to the two flags that we covered they're documented and adopts um under the validator no exception so just keep in mind adding those but otherwise if you have the same address you'll have the same amount on your validator on Mocha could you be on rabbit and mocha connect with ethereum testnet um So currently the qcb is not turned on Joel um and there's no cues to be like it's not turned on on either Arabica and mocha but Evan would like presuming that we do turn it on where would it be on like was it Robson or gorilla or whichever the cool thing about the KGB is that it can go to all of them at the same time that's cool right so there you have it you can go to all the evm network we don't discriminate between evm networks you know that's word modularism not maxism um okay um Igor uh I already had a question um shubham gurjar um is there an advantage to being active validator and test net I was in the top 150 for the longest time so there's no Advantage um it's more that hey I can validate blocks if you want to test them but keep in mind there's like I mean last I checked on my market that was like a couple weeks ago we had 150 active and 3 000 um waiting on standby you know sort of a huge demand for it but I guarantee you um whether you're on standby or active there's no Advantage whatsoever for you as a validator other than if you want to do some testing and stuff or like you know practice becoming a validator and stuff um the other thing is for people that we want like you know who are going to be in the active validator said there's an expectation like at least on testing it because mocha is going to be part of our deployment process there's an expectation that when we have any new updates or like that might require a hard part um that all the validator and the active set are actually responsive and can we can coordinate with them that would like one of the only expectations but I don't know if that is an advantage because it still means that you would have to coordinate with us but that's the only thing I can think of but otherwise there's zero advantages for you being an active validator investment other than to test out that your validator consign blocks um and that you can jail and unveil will there okay Nico will there be a second round of the modular fellow program that's a great question um I can give like a little line or two and then I'll open the floor for the rest of the team to share their thoughts so currently we're still waiting until we wrap up the program and the demo day after that um we need to assess like you know how valuable the program was like what did people find it valuable would do a lot of great projects and that and based on that we can determine if we want to do a second cohort otherwise we are open to maybe modifying the program um because potentially some of the project could be more application focused which is fine and great um but maybe we can do another flavor of the program around core development like you know if you want to be a core developer at every layer of the stack um like from da to consensus um you know having a fellowship around that so that's one of the few things we're thinking about but I'll open the floor for the rest of the team if they have any more thoughts or if what I said would not right yeah I'll chime in here um I think the whether there will be another phase of the larger program fellows program is kind of relevant in the sense that we're there's going to be a lot more support for developers in our ecosystem uh and people building stuff on Celestia going forward and it's sort of like a question of what different forms that will take so whether there'll be more grants oriented I think some of the limitations of the modular fellow program was that it's very high touch and also um it is is limited in the number of people that can participate and so if we want to have a type of program that actually is a little bit uh can have more participation from more people um I think that that could be a better structure um I do think that we want to continue a lot of the things that have come out of the modular fellows program such as uh we're doing these Insight calls and there's been a lot of like uh knowledge sharing and a lot of those videos I think are are public are going to be public um and so we'll continue a lot of like I think the monitor fellows program has started a lot of initiatives and bootstrapped sort of the core parts of our developer community and that's absolutely going to continue um but we'll probably have to as he has said recalibrate after this and see what direction we want to go forward in whether that's exactly the same or slightly modified um is still to be seen foreign thank you Nick um yeah so I hope that answered the question feel free to if it's not um if you have any follow-up questions let us know um about the modular fellows um thanks for the universe calendar and content could you uh Sub-Zero could you please give some project example you're interested in seeing during the demo page um Josh um I don't know if we discussed what yeah so yeah go for it I dropped the link in there but I can go over a few that are pretty cool uh right now um so I guess something that I think a lot of blockchain projects as they start like want to have is a naming service so uh Celestia name service will be something that we're looking forward to seeing coming out of the program uh so this will be similar to ens where you can tie a human readable name to an address um there is one called skinworks that's doing basically alerts and event monitoring for Celestia but also for namespaces and Roll-Ups on Celestia um there's another one that is working on building an execution layer specifically for gaming uh that one's I can't give too much else out about that there's also another gaming project that's basically building a like a roll up as a game uh which is pretty cool I think that's going to be one that we're definitely going to share publicly um and then yeah I'm not going to go too far on this but there's a lot of really cool ones that are in like the team fellows category uh some notable ones are constellation Duality Dimension Eclipse Juno and Skip protocol uh yeah but if you do have any questions um I guess feel free to reach out well it seems that somebody's asking pratham a question if you can raise your hand I can unmute you and then maybe if somebody had a question about uh CNS you can answer it if you like good to see your hand with so I can convert a lot of people in the list [Music] um one second all right take your time um okay while we wait on pratham is there any more questions about Celestia activities um and projects and anything like that um okay so there's a question from Nico on a high level which sort of missing Milestone to main net is there a simple way to crack insights um send you an info let me just make you a co-host let me try to find you um but yeah let me just answer Nico's question um is there a simple way to crack Insight on their progress um outside of a simple road map I don't know if there's any way to track Insight unless you're deep in our GitHub and good but otherwise um with missing Mouse Thunder missing like which Milestones are missing from to mainnet um I'll let um maybe a smile must stop if you want to answer this um oh question again uh the question is which are the missing Milestones to mainnet Launch and is there is there a simple way to track Insight on the progress let me copy paste it again I mean we have several project boards I would say there's no simple like super simple way to track progress but there are like everything is open source there's several projects boards that you can track like where you can keep track of progress um what are the missing Milestones I think we've been like nearly nearly feature complete like it's like everything is is uh like 90 done I think um there are changes that need to be done or and um tested and that takes time so it's not like there there aren't like major missing features like major Milestones that I'm missing uh awesome uh thank you so much maybe maybe I'll note uh someone can chime in and say like what they think on on their side but I don't think like from from corn app like from the consensus there's anything like super critical missing from the note side we have only improvements on the P2P layer for the Block City so that's the part that is in progress handling progress and that's it okay thank you oh it's fine were you saying something um I just said thank you sorry I was just missing it um okay um pratham how you doing can you unmute yourself otherwise we have a few other questions oh perfect yeah um yeah you want to cover CNS what you're working on so far as part of the modular fellow program yeah sure so uh thanks for giving me the mic uh yes and um I've been a part of the modular fitness program for the last two or three months and um I'm building CNS which will be Celestia's um naming service so it's it's similar to like an ens naming service like you have an ethereum so um you will have um uh like a human readable name that's attached to your wallet so you don't have to put in that long string whenever you want to send or receive assets [Music] um um so you know you can just have pratham dot Tia and like or pratham.cles here and you can send um like you know whatever assets that you have or whatever tokens that you want to send to me um so that's like the basic idea it's very similar to ens but um technologically it's build um on a different it's built using Celestia's data availability there um and uh that's obviously different from how ens Works where ens is you know written using a smart contract and um you know there is an nft attached to your domain name that you can transfer around CNS will work slightly differently um on um in but the experience will be mostly the same um and uh I guess the question in the chat was how does the domain name look like so you know um pratham dot um or whatever that you would want to have and you'll not only be able to like you will be able to have um all sorts of tokens that you can attach to your domain name you can have Bitcoin Dogecoin um and sunesh of course um and whatever token it is that you want and along with the domain name service we're also working on um a link tree idea built on are we using the Perma web technology so that um you have this sort of Link tree like page where you have all your social media links um in one place that's attached to your domain name that you have so um you know we're focusing on building a lot of utility for the for this project and um yeah you will be able to buy it just like you know how you buy um an ens domain name except you the of course using Celestia tokens so yeah and um we're almost in the final stages of building the Prototype right now awesome well can't wait to see how it turned out and I'll be definitely be one of the first users uh okay so I had a question but it was sent to me in DM um by Pro nodes will you test IPC during mocha testing so oh I only tested me personally I only tested IBC on uh Sovereign Roll-Ups and but um I don't know I haven't had you tested IBC on a concessive layer on Corona it will it's not included in the current state machine but it will be in the next update So eventually for mocha yes just not currently awesome do you think someone tested IBC on the devnet on the very first test so um yeah there's like no there's no like um there's no concern around it it's just that the versions that we used uh from omaki didn't include it and the cosmos SDK version that we used didn't have like a compatible version of IBC but it will be re-enabled soon as Evan said right it's all good if you send me a DM Pro notes you know I do that all the time accidentally I'm not really good at using Zoom um but anyways um any other questions like I felt like we had a really good stream of questions and that's always a good feeling but anymore feel free to ask while we're all here uh from Eugene Can I submit the form after the deadline uh unfortunately you know like we already have a big enough queue and we had to cut it off at some point um uh I think at the beginning of the call we covered um anything related to incentivized testnet we gave the update um so we're not going to continue answering any questions related to the incentivize that any other questions presumably not related to the incentive I've tested but related to mocha and all the fun thing that we do all right um so far we got we're at 44 minutes and we got 16 minutes left with a call um okay is there anything anyone from the team would like to tell the community before we sign off because I don't know I don't think there's any more questions coming in um so potentially we can wrap it up but anything we can tell them what to expect for 2023 all right maybe I can give them a little tidbit like so for 2023 you'll expect a lot more modular components that you can play around with or like run a note for so yeah I've been saying recently that you know 2023 is going to become the Europe after modularity so um there's going to be a lot of exciting new software tooling developer toolings um libraries that you can play around with for any project you want to build on top of Celestia or running a node with Celestia testing out different things um and anything related to project building on proper cell I said I can grow to ecosystem Gunther yes hey uh you have a question when do you think that Telemetry will be enabled are you talking about um wait Gunter let me just unmute you if you want to just chat um um if you wanted to okay let me ask you a new but um basically are you talking about Telemetry for Celestia app or something hey uh solution no uh do you know if you will enable this okay so um glip correct me if I'm wrong but now we have a dash dash metrics endpoint and what it does it would allow you if you deploy then like open Telemetry collector you can connect it to that endpoint it will collect all the Telemetry data from the da layer but Wonder tanglib would be able to provide more context there okay uh yes you you've like explained this pretty well but right now I know it already provides a set of flags that you can configure it to connect to uh any uh software that speaks to open Telemetry protocol for to collect metrics and traces from it uh if you want to have a deeper obserability on how you know performs uh in future uh we will have uh much more metrics that we have right now but
