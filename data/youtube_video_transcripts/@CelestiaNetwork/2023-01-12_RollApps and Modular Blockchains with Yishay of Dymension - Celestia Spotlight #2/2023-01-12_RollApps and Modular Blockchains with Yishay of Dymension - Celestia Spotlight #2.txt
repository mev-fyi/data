welcome everybody to another episode of Celestia Spotlight uh where we hear from the people at the Forefront of the modular movement I'm Nick white CEO of slusty labs and today I'm joined by ishai co-founder of Dimension Labs uh Dimension is the home of the Roll apps not Roll-Ups but roll apps uh meaning sort of Roll Up application specific chains and they're building a modular settlement layer and rdk roll-up development kit for Cosmos based Roll-Ups so we're going to talk about a lot of different stuff settlement you know different roll-up Frameworks bridging all that fun stuff ishai thanks for coming on um welcome thanks a lot Nick thanks for having me I'm uh super excited to be here of course uh yeah let's let's talk about Dimension let's talk about Celestia let's talk about modular blockchains and see if we can get some uh cool insights yeah sounds good um well just if I rewind the clock I remember this is probably over a year ago um when very few people were talking about modular blockchains and all of a sudden this Twitter account popped up called Dimension and it was saying you know over building a role of development kit and doing modular blockchains and like totally gung-ho and internally in Celestia are like oh who are these people this is so cool like you know we were stoked to see it because we internally been talking about the need for like a roll-up development kit and all that like to make it easier for people to build Roll-Ups and like also to see you guys just fully Embrace modular blockchains at that time when like we were kind of the only people uh sort of banging the drum uh just got us really thrilled so I I just love to hear about like kind of the the founding story of of Dimension and even you know how you uh got into blockchains and and specifically modular blockchains so let's start there definitely uh obviously credit for you guys like uh there's a lot of Visionaries in Celestia and top-notch researchers that influence dimensions and brought us towards this Paradigm which you know we truly believe like this is the way to go it's like technically the way to go um let's go back to that tweet and that Vision like we uh as a co-founding team uh work together on some ideas on ZK and uh like we came to a conclusion that it's not it's not fun and it's not kind of working towards where we think uh we you know where we think there's potential and at the time like Cosmos was not not at the time like since then like Cosmos was like banging it was like it was it was showing kind of a different vibe uh you know from the other alt L1 scenes it was it was uh it made us curious and it made us feel like okay there's there's an opportunity there kind of to to bring uh a new thing to to horizontal scaling to to look at it from a different perspective and you know and then we found about you know we researched everything and we looked at Celestia as well because you you were as you said you you're kind of the pioneers and modular and we said oh this this makes a lot of sense this is like traditional web like you know you don't have like a website with everything you know it's it's you know it's divided into a way that you know the economic units are are perfected and everything works properly and from there you know we're kind of noobs in Cosmos SDK we didn't understand a lot like but we had this vision of what needs to be done we had this vision of where Dimension is the product Market fit uh in terms of like settlement in terms of you know even even considering Celestia like what celeste's core offering is and what that mentioned can bring to the table and what is dimension uh generally um so we kind of you know we had some research we had some pocs and we understand okay this is this is something that is doable this is something that we can pragmatic that we can build is we can take our product capabilities and we can bring something to the table that you know changes the whole the whole scene this is something this is a different ball game because we're taking Cosmos into like a like imagine in a different dimension and this is kind of the game in a different dimension blockchains are not blockchains they're Roll-Ups but the more we kind of got into it we understand like the Roll-Ups are blockchains but it's it's it's it was very interesting to see like how we can elegantly assemble and restack the customers uh the customs and module is stack and come up with something so powerful and in my opinion just substantially better like it's it's I remember talking to people and they asked like okay what why is this better and I was like I hate to be cocky but it's just it's better that you know it's better you have the capabilities of deploying a chain is like deploying a server and now you can have this you can have value coming to your you know to your decentralized business so to do your distributed economy the way it should be and from scale yeah obviously a lot of people talk about scales like there's infinite people will tell you about TPS and yada yada but it's obviously that's also being taken care of and latency is ultra low and everything works better because there is no consensus on the roll up level and security is higher so there's like there's so much advantages so it was like a no-brainer and for us it's Okay We're Going For This all the way we're just heading and we're building this and it doesn't matter and we just learned along the way what needs to be done and we got uh to the point where you know we understand how it works and we release GitHub we release our documentation um you know we can we can show that people can build the world up right now and it's super flexible you can put you know there's a lot of stuff that the customers ecosystem has kind of uh you know is brought to the table for us there's a lot of stuff that you know you can choose your VM this is stuff that we didn't you know we didn't work on and we should thank the people that work on on on these materials but it just it brings the offering of Dimension into a different level and it it truly is a different level you can go ahead right now you can play with the docs you can see that you can deploy a very very uh high performance roll-up with evm with cosmosum someone with other VMS um and yeah it's just super exciting yeah wonderful um well everything that you're saying to me I mean makes so much sense because uh you know actually it resonates a lot with what I believe in which is you know at Cosmo verse last year I talked about the the internet of modular blockchains which is basically that you know in order to achieve the full vision of the cosmos ecosystem uh we have to take the cosmo stack modular you know and that's basically exactly what you guys are doing um you're kind of like taking a lot of the abstractions and the tools that were built but adapting them to this new framework that um adds in a lot of the components of the original uh Cosmo stack is missing like it's it's so much overhead to launch a new Cosmos Zone you don't have a secure way of bridging between the chains but in a modular stack with Dimension um you you can get that and and I also do want to re-emphasize as you did that this is all happening because we're building on the shoulders of giants where I honestly I think the cosmos community uh developer communities like one of the strongest and best in the space and and the the founders and leaders are just Visionaries who came up with like kind of the the precursor to modular blockchains which is like you know modularizing the software stack of blockchains and things like uh you know these interchange standards like IBC that I think are gonna you know continue to be state-of-the-art and like foundational kind of um components of the modular blockchain stack going forward but so anyway yeah you guys are kind of taking the taking Cosmos modulars is one way that I like to think about it so maybe let's go a little bit deeper into like specifically what what is dimension made out of you mentioned there's a settlement layer you know you did mention that there's also a roll-up uh SDK so let's like tell me more about those things like what do they actually look like under the hood so let's let's talk about the the roll-up SDK we love to call it the rdk uh it's just fun to say the rdk um so there's a difference between a roll-up and the chain in in several uh rolls I would say so in in the blockchain of the validators set is kind of like I like to I like to talk in metaphors by the way so I hope that's fine uh the validator set is is also it's also the Parliament that represents the people but it's also the government that takes action so in the rdk it's different it's it's partitioned into two there's one role that takes care of the government basically the operating uh uh sequencer or the operating uh business entity it's the sequencer and for the rdk we have uh something that's called the dividend uh parameter that says how much are you willing to as a sequencer to give out to the community and governance is uh governed by but not the validators by different uh beings I would say I don't want to spoil but there's a lot of cool stuff that we're building um but it's it's different so there's like two houses in in in a roll app um but the rdk itself is just it's based on the cosmos SDK like you said uh we're building on this great technology that other people build and open source and we're very grateful for that and we can give our um you know flavor of of of building blockchains uh by using it and by leveraging the code base that was already there um we just look at it from a different angle and we think what can we do better and this is why Dimension is dimension we really look at the most pragmatic way of deploying a blockchain of getting to the performance that you need and actually looking at it from pragmatic way of you know the things that people want when they deploy blockchain like liquidity they want security out the box they want liquidity they want they want to choose their VM this is what people need like in terms of not just bullshitting with all these you know the crypto regular stuff narratives and you know TPS stuff and stuff like that that's just like what do developers really want they just want like easy way in my opinion and other people on my team could even argue different but in my opinion like there's people want the flexibility they want the ease of use they want this one click uh blockchain deployment that is secure that is liquid and this is what I believe the next phase for blockchain and what brings us towards hopefully like a next Bull Run because we can deploy like a thousand of these instances which are secure which have liquidity and could operate like as a modular internet of value and this is where like Celestia and dimension really combine the vision and you know each one is working on its specific core Forte specific like core offering that they specialize and then kind of vision their way and uh and and by building this together it's it's it's like creating a modular internet the value which we hope you myself obviously a lot of people in the crypto Community uh will bring Innovation and real use cases and Innovative products yeah you said it really well um and and that's kind of why the modular flag is you know modularism not maximalism like rather in in a monolithic world you know each project kind of has to do everything on its own and bootstrap its own ecosystem and think about every solving every every problem and tying it all together and the beauty of a modular ecosystem is that you know Celestia can just focus on providing the best consensus NDA layer and then you know projects like Dimension can focus on the the actual execution layer the settlement part of it and tie those all together add liquidity and and make it as easy as possible for for those users that want to deploy a blockchain with one click so totally on board with that and and stoked that uh we're getting to work together on this because like there's no way that Celestia could solve all these problems uh you know on its own and uh there's so much problems even for Celestia itself and even for Dimension itself it's like building these distributed systems is something that okay you think you know for me I'm not a huge Twitter guy but I'm always looking at like people arguing on Twitter and then I'm I'm seeing like there's a lot of problems that you're getting there always you're always on Research it's it's a new paradigm it's a new thing uh and and this is exactly what you said like focusing on creating the best core offering like specific concentrated core offering uh that Celestia Dimension or other players in the module ecosystem do is what gives us value right what builds like a a full ecosystem that is that each one of the particles each one of the components is valuable and this is just like web 2 technology it's not it's not different it's this you know a lot of people and I I know like Celestia folks I guess you probably don't like this metaphor but for me it's it's just the same as front and back-end and database that's it there's like fluent then it's like the execution layer where you as a consumer as a client you're facing this is the ux that you get this is what you feel right on the back end there's like a settlement there like that basically takes care of everything that everything works like the the front and you know talk store like it updates or it or her whatever um and there's there's a scalable database that provides the capability of creating of Distributing data uh without centralizing it um and this is Celestia and you know people are you know and I I read a tweet by um by Mustafa that he said like we should change like data availability name like we should think about like the name and I have a proposal for you right now you should call it data scaling it's a data scaling layer it's it's data availability is a problem like of of data withholding a tap but Celestia is about scaling data it's not about the specific Edge case that is within the data withholding attack but you know that's this is my input but the way I think that people should look at modular blockchains is data back-end front end that's it no uh we were a big fan of analogies because um you know frankly the the technology is so confusing that like you need to relate it to something else to make it understandable and legible um and I I like I like analogizing it to web 2 Stacks so I really love that and like you know the way that I think about it a lot is that um you know modular blockchains are more like cloud computing in that um you know you have infrastructure providers like AWS or Azure or what have you and they just provide like the raw compute resource and then it's developers that come and deploy whatever virtual machines they need whatever servers they need to run their web application and I think that that's that's kind of what's happening in modular blockchains we have these really scalable sort of like economies of scale type uh you know systems like Celestia that just provide raw data availability and consensus and then these developers come on and deploy the blockchain like computer that they need and so like yeah these analogies I think are like super valuable um I like the database one uh and I I the data scale I actually I did I I did it I didn't think that you you'd like it like I I this it's not completely accurate right it's not there's so much more to it but you you can you can you know people not everybody has you know the the uh you know the capabilities of understanding uh every problem that distributed systems have but you need to to give them and you need to you know bring it to them in a way that we can understand we can talk yeah absolutely I mean no analogy is ever perfect and that's why you know people who are super technical like Mustafa often you know he always has a nitpick with with every analogy that we use but I'm like the big picture guy and I'm always like uh you know what we just have to like it's useful even if it's not perfectly accurate um but uh back to back to Dimension right so the people listening they want to know more about Dimension specifically and and sort of how it works under the hood and like what the vision is so I want to dial into specifically like the the settlement Hub of Dimension and first like what what is its purpose what does it function and and how does it work and like why do you think that this is a key component to sort of the the end vision of like modularizing the cosmo stack um sure sure um so that mentioned to kind of simplify try to I'm trying to simplify it to simplify everything Dimension is an app chain which the application of the app chain of this course moves to SDK chain which uses tendermint is to support roll-ups roll apps they work in a different manner they have different they don't they don't use tender mint they use Diamond which is actually a Roman Fork but it's a consensusless client so it's there's no consensus it actually delegates uh consensus to the dimension Hub which is the Customs SDK chain built specifically so to take this consent to basically to power these Road Labs I like to think about it as this is kind of you know you as a roll-up you connect into the dimension Hub this is the architecture uh it's built into the rail so it's not like on a smart contract layer uh uh let's let's take a look at ethereum for example if you want to build a roll-up on top of ethereum you would go to the smart contract layer you would design how that would work and you would uh update this uh update a smart contract on ethereum Dimension works on the Chain itself uh it's it's calculated it's built to support these Roll-Ups into the rails it's baked into the logic um and and this is what makes it super special that the consensus itself is to support Roll-Ups right so let's take let's take a scenario where uh God forbid arbitrary or optimism they you know the the bridge roll up uh the bridge smart contract gets hacked ethereum does not you know ethereum just moves on it doesn't it's not built it's a smart contract on ethereum and ethereum can't stop like it's not it's not built for this uh purpose but for Dimension like hacking or there's if there's a problem in the bridge there's a problem the whole system so the whole system is is designed to support Roll-Ups um into the rails itself I hope that makes sense so like um if if there is something that goes wrong uh on a given roll-up that's built uh that's settling to the the the dimension Hub then there's a way to kind of recover from that without impacting the other Roll-Ups is that it's just like in terms of social consensus like every Roll Up is is is a similar kind of first-class citizen in dimension right so it's it's a system that built that's built in the same manner so there's no there's no difference between like arbitrim and optimism implementation this everybody is kind of getting this infrastructure uh from Dimension from the dimension Hub so if there's a problem with one thing that's like obviously this consensus okay this this whole system is not working properly let's fix this let's let's you know this is this is our number one goal and it is to provide Roll-Ups with the security and the liquidity that they need and it's different than ethereum ethereum obviously is huge inspiration for everybody but it's not built specifically uh to support Roll-Ups although it's going there but it's not you know it's not into uh it's not built specifically for that um I'm curious is it um permissionless for for people to deploy new Roll-Ups on Dimension or is there some kind of like governance part no this is this is the huge you know we're betting in dimension we're betting on human Ingenuity we're betting that if we're making something permissionless we're gonna see some cool we're going to see some cool stuff people are going to build amazing stuff once we put in uh you know governance and what's once we put in the permission way this is it's more similar to the polkadot or a lot of other systems right now we want to have a permissionless system and we will have a permission system uh where anybody could deploy a roll-up without asking anybody um obviously to get there there is kind of a training wheel uh way um and there will be permission roll up at start at the beginning but once we make sure that the system is secure enough it will go permissionless and it's it's an essential part in the dimension Vision in the dimension stack um I think in the blockchain ethos as well like in everything like we the governance is is something that's pretty cool and Cosmos by the way but um but it's it shouldn't be the soul this you can't decide who gets to build an application or not and if you can do that you know that's you're missing the place you're not in the right spot mm-hmm and before we um hopped on the the call I remember we were discussing this all VM thing that you that you mentioned can you give us a little bit of uh uh some color on that because it sounds like some really interesting technology it could be could unlock um you know true like a universal settlement layer type of thing so I love to like dive into that a little bit so this is this is a great way to describe it a universal settlement uh thing or for State machines uh so obviously a sediment layer in an optimistic setup needs to emulate the state machine uh of a rollup that's deployed on top of it because it needs to know what happened in case of any dispute it's like it's the supreme justice right it's it's the court and if you don't know what happened you don't have the evidence you can you can't say anything so lvm is a roll-up virtual machine and what it means is that we emulate the we emulate the state machine we take the context and the state machine of the Roll app we emulate this for the disputed transaction and we conclude is it is it fraud or is it not the way we do it is you know it's Omri my co-founder uh has a lot of experience in devops and and just you know uh Dockers and emulating environments and it comes from just taking this experience into into blockchain um but essentially the vision is to emulate like you emulate uh any any other virtual machine you emulate the virtual machine of a roll up and you conclude what's the fraud according to it and according to the context that is injected uh with the fraud proof got it so uh and so people for people who don't it may not appreciate how cool this is like one of the challenges of you know doing Roll-Ups and um sort of doing settlement is that each roll up will have its own kind of application logic and potentially its own virtual machine Etc and in order to do dispute resolution you have to know what that logic is typically and so what that means is like I mean one of the whole benefits of the app chain thesis and like roll apps is that every roll app or like application specific chain or roll up has its own execution logic Zone virtual virtual machine so it's all customized but then that means that your settlement layer has to know about every single one of these different execution uh sort of Frameworks and that can easily Nick it knows the hash it knows it knows the specific you know it knows to prove that this state machine is this is what they say it is once they submit the state machine so for example I I would try to create a metaphor it's hard but it's like I'm gonna bring a judge a machine I'm going to bring it to the judge right and I'm gonna prove to the judge that this was the machine that was used in the crime scene okay once you prove it you say okay this is the machine now the judge could take the machine could put in the whatever input it has see the output and then it gives the machine back to the to the person and says okay thank you bye-bye and then it gives it the verdict is done and we continue but like you said it's it's really exciting because it really isn't kind of a break for me we thought a lot a lot about the names you know I'm a big main junkie and I thought like chain and chain RV you know there's a lot of cool stuff that we thought about this but um it's it's very cool you know it's just something that we really want to to develop and bring to the you know the first stage of uh of production or was it all VM no it's rvm rvm okay got it got it um yeah in fact you know the way when you're describing it it sounds a lot like um what they as I understand how polka dot Works in that when you are running a parachain you have like an app hash or like you have a hash of like uh the the web web assembly sort of like logic that the the that like implements the um uh para chain so it sounds like there's something similar going on there and then I know that like the the relay chain nodes like pull that uh they verify that this is the right State machine to be running and then they like verify the para chain and then like Vote or something so it sounds kind of similar but like in a like a much more important so it's it's cool because I see this happening a lot where um you know projects like polka dot were very close to sort of like a modular setup but they didn't like they weren't yet these abstractions or like the technology like um data availability sampling or even Roll-Ups so they they couldn't actually go all the way but they got as close as you could to being fully modular but uh they kind of had to be stopped short unfortunately and and there's so many parallels and a lot of people get confused and they're like well isn't polka dot modular but the the truth is that like when you get down to the brass tacks they're not quite modular they don't quite have the same sort of scalability and shared security that um you know Celestia plus Dimension or other modular setups have so anyway it's it's cool to see these these common themes and Technologies kind of recurring and being reinvented uh but fully modular so definitely you know I I'm not a you know forgive me but I'm not a big fan of of polka but they like the tech stack is is amazing it's uh sometimes uh you know I'm a product guy and like I think dimension you know is is a product first company and we want to create the most you know convenient way for for anybody to interact with the system and just because like I feel like I don't have the convenient way to interact with polka dot technology I may have like a bad impression but they have some amazing stuff you know that they figured out pretty pretty early in my opinion absolutely yeah yeah I agree with that um the last thing on on this point is just like you know people also like I would say that within the modular stack you know you have consensus data availability execution and settlement people tend to get the most confused about the settlement layer for a lot of reasons because it's kind of uh it has lots of different functions to me the two primary functions are basically uh bridging and like you know being able to Route liquidity or like message passing essentially in a trust minimized way uh between Roll-Ups uh and being like a liquidity Hub right so that you can not have all like tons of different versions of of assets on different chains depending on how they've been sort of moved between each other and you don't have to have like this crazy dense interconnected web of of bridges you can just have like a very clean kind of like Hub and spoke bridging model so that's one louder yeah exactly router kind of like the original Cosmos Hub Vision um and then the other one is dispute resolution which is where like in and that's specifically for optimistic rollups where you sometimes need if you have like an interactive verification uh game that that you need to run in order to decide which is the valid chain to follow um you need a place where that game takes place and you can't do it in a peer-to-peer way it kind of has to happen on a chain um so those are the two two main functions it sounds like the dimension Hub is but is doing both of those things essentially it's meant to be both the dispute resolution layer and a bridging Hub and asset asset Hub is that fair to say that's definitely fair to say but I think like from our Focus and and this is coming back to what I said like Dimension is a product first uh protocol or I would say like our Target is we didn't come up like with we didn't say okay we want to do this and we want to do this no we just said like okay what do people want like what do we what do they need like essentially initially we didn't have like liquidity we said like there's no smart contract there's no any activity on the dimension hub no economic activity at all but then we thought like okay you know developers Builders they just want liquidity and security and from that requirements we kind of came up with Dimension design we didn't think we didn't go through the research uh we didn't go through like the blockchain uh regular route where we okay we say we want to do this we want to no we said like what's needed what's needed and this is needed this is something that we believe that there is like demand for it people want to deploy app chains deploying the nap chain is hard I know because we're doing it you know we're talking to like a like a thousand validators a day into this it's it's hard you know there's a lot of stuff to do and you know there's there's amazing cool projects uh um that you probably also know that work on creating this roll up experience where you can deploy it you can deploy blockchain uh easily and this is how we got to kind of uh you know to the dimension design not just you know regarding settlement it's just it grew there because of research of what people want what we think that people want of course we didn't we didn't launch yet so yeah uh I'm glad that you guys are so product oriented because um I think that's something that the space has kind of been lacking there's been a lot of just engineering for engineering's sake or research for research sake like hey this is cool we're solving a problem but we don't not actually thinking about the end user um we're just kind of like scratching our own itch in terms of wanting to like uh you know build cool Tech and um I think in order for blockchain and there's a lot of people who are even not even building this is that's true there's there's so much you know Dimension is not a marketing firm I mentioned is not about creating you know I don't know the best ambassador program or the best you know it's it's it's a product for a firm um and people you know we after like you know the situation with crypto right now people shouldn't understand like okay we're trying to build something that's useful we're trying to build something that's protect people from you know events like we've witnessed right now uh we're trying to build a really useful economy that's online and that's free um and and people should not be you know people should not look at projects by how good is you know the leader or how good is uh you know the the marketing teams people should look at what do they feel could bring value to the ecosystem and even to the world to be honest yeah yeah and and I think that in order for blockchain to go mainstream and to be you know adopted widely like we need product oriented Builders and so again yeah just glad that you guys start with that as your North Star um so we cover the settlement layer and that was extremely interesting um tell me a little bit more about the rdk the role of development kit and sort of what is the vision for that and where what's the status of it um and like what kind of you mentioned there's a bunch of different execution environments you guys support like let's let's talk about that um yeah give me give me the lowdown on the rdk awesome so the rdk is is is originated from the SDK but it's it has a few differences I mentioned before uh that roll up is not a customer's chain it has different uh just not it's it's not that it's not a customer strain actually it is a blockchain but it has just a a different tweak to it where the sequencers operate the chain and not the validators and uh we're planning to put in something new that uh brings in governance in a different way I don't want to ruin the surprise that that's coming um but I I do want to share that on the rdk like the Customs SDK you can put in uh different VMS like ethernet which thanks to the atmos theme uh is built and could support uh the evm and you can put in cosmosom and hopefully in the future Fuel and uh move maybe whatever you can put on the cosmos SDK is is is relevant for Dimension Roll-Ups um I would say that in division the rdk is kind of a development kit for uh and decentralized online decentralized autonomous chain that is kind of a business it's it's more of a business we focus on value accrual we want to say okay a sequencer is an operator it's like the CEO it's like the company and the token holders are like the shareholders and there's also like board members uh and this is an online business and we want to create this distributed online business work uh without anybody interfering uh in the middle and creating this value accrual mechanisms that enable people to okay so that let's let's get a community together let's build something cool that makes money let's work together and let's keep it sustainable let's keep this thing running uh with its own uh shares I would say like the tokens of of a roll app uh they should accrue value but like everything every operation in there should accrue value to the Token holders and it's all governed uh by them by the roll app itself the only thing a rollup needs to do is it needs to get security from base players like Celestine like Dimension it gets it gets liquidity as well but it's it's essentially it's also uh I hate to say but it is a business it is some sort of business it can't run it can't be uh it can't be losing forever yeah it can't it could be a charity it could be cool but uh but it also something it's all something that people want and it's a community it's kind of I would say it's like an economic organism on the internet that doesn't need to have um you know the overhead of technically building a blockchain which is hard we know it's hard you know it's hard I know it's hard but you know people that are just you know psyched about nfts and psyched about communities and talked about games they don't need to to to go into like CS PhD research topics they don't want to be there they shouldn't be there they just need to have a framework where they say okay this is this is some cool thing just some cool infrastructure that I can use and I can distribute profits to whoever wanted to to invest in me and I can do it fairly in a cryptographically way where I don't scam anyone and everything is and every every part of what happens is verifiable and open and this is the vision that we have for the rdk for Roll-Ups for blockchain and uh yeah I think I think it's it's it's cool and and we'll get there yeah um I'm I'm glad to hear that you guys are thinking about uh this is the first time I've heard um you know the governance and the economic sustainability of of the Roll-Ups on Dimension from the get-go and solving that problem is actually a huge I would also guess from like a user perspective that's probably one of the things that they think about and and worry about a lot um and like making sure that the Roll-Ups that are built are economically sustainable um and that's actually I would say like in terms of marketing Nick in terms of like what is the messaging for people why should people build on dementia rollups is value like we provide infrastructure that will enable you to create more value for your token holders for yourself uh this is like the economic 101 that we have in mind yeah yeah and uh on that point well it's two things I want to say to expand on that one is that um one of the benefits of a modular blockchain stack is that you don't have to actually pay for your own security like when you're running your own blockchain like a monolithic blockchain you are really paying for your own security at the sort of like uh uh yeah like you have to pay the validators through inflation staking rewards and stuff like that and in in a roll-up modular model you just pay as you go as you consume block space and you benefit from economies of scale so like you share that cost and it becomes much lower per roll up than it would be if everyone was their own chain trying to secure itself and run its own infrastructure like you share the infrastructure so anyway that's a huge part the second thing is in terms of like value capture for Roll-Ups one of the things that I'm excited about and and maybe this is something you guys are thinking about too is like one of the big reasons for a an application to move from a monolithic chain like let's say I'm a I'm a DEX on Solana or a DEX on ethereum uh is I I want to move to my own chain so I can capture Mev right when there is like this there's a lot of value that that people can capture via Mev like that if you do it on ethereum or Solana it kind of like bleeds down to the layer one but on a modular stack your roll up can actually capture that if you implement in the right way and there's some cool teams thinking about that like skip also very active in the causeless ecosystem so I don't know if that's something that you guys have thought about but I also see it as a really big economic driver for why people would choose to build modular versus monolithic long term of course it's you know you can expect businesses you know even if they're decentralized and distributed to just hand over value and just say okay yeah you know I'm I I'm I'm with ethereum you know I like vitalik it's it's you know okay let's let's just not make money let's just not be profitable or economically sustainable it it it's not gonna go it's it doesn't work like that in my opinion um and I think like we should treat blockchains as kind of distributed companies uh essentially in the future and uh like communities with with the financial kind of um shared goal yeah yeah couldn't have said it better myself I love the word you said which is like a an economic organism on the internet like that's a really good way to describe what a blockchain is um last thing now we like I understand now the the settlement layer the rdk and that Vision now I want to zoom out a little bit and and like understand how does this plug into Celestia and like why why did you guys choose to build on Celestia versus you know other other ways of that you could build your stack or other da layers I'm just curious um for to get that picture of this project I think I think I started like we when we started talking I told you like Celestia is is a Pioneer in module boxing so um for us modular is about you know focusing on the core offering I think celeste's core offering is data scaling it allows thousands if not you know tens of thousands of Roll-Ups to to submit data and to have it uh distributed in a decentralized way where we can know that everything works properly and obviously for that reason Celeste is the best choice for data if you would put data on the dimension Hub it could fit you know demand of one two three four five six rolls and once you go further than that you know you start centralizing and it starts becoming more hard um so obviously Celeste is is in terms of the tech is is the best and uh you know as I told as I said before like this is this is modular you want to choose the best um fitting piece of the puzzle to work with you to get the best product and that's how it should be so I appreciate that yeah and and I think that one of the benefits that Celestia has had is that we have gotten the privilege to start from scratch you know with these insights of of modular stack like it seems like you know ethereum is moving towards a modular model but they kind of have the baggage of a monolithic L1 to to sort of deal with and overcome and I think that holds them back from going fully modular and then you know even Solana it seems actually from some of the discussions on Twitter that they're thinking more seriously about you know like clients and all that stuff but again there there's so much baggage in the way that they've built that I can't really see them ever making the full pivot or if they did they might just have to start over um and so describe I gotta be honest with you Nick I love the Solana guys I think that they're awesome I really love you know what they're building they're just Builders and they build what they believe in you know even if you know there's kind of differences I love I love the community and this is this huge uh respect for what you know they're going through right now and what they're showing but yeah even even though they're trying to make like uh the system itself more reliable for end users with diet clients and stuff like that which is great um but I have a lot of respect for them I I really like like what what they did what they built just a little inspiring yeah absolutely I I cannot agree more I have uh I I think that they the um sort of the rigor and also the practicality the pragmatism of their engineering their roadmap is like pretty outstanding and and like yeah I I'm I'm also a fan um anyway uh that kind of actually brings me to one like I have some big picture questions to ask you before we sort of like wrap up um that are sort of more like about the modular space more generally like one of the things I want to talk about since you're kind of in the cosmos ecosystem you know there's also a movement in Cosmos for shared security right there's this uh notion of interchange security um where the Hub or another Cosmos Zone can actually loan out security to a new chain that wants to spin up that way they don't actually have to like start up a new uh whole network from scratch um and there's also this thing called mesh security where uh you know different chains can actually stake their like put take their own stake and put it place it on put it at risk to validate another chain and um these are both different approaches of shared security but different from the modular approach which is like having a shared consensus and Data Network like Celestia so I'm curious like what is your take on those things where do you see them fitting in what are the trade-offs um and yeah tell me tell me about your yeah you know first of all like Cosmos does like what they're trying to do with ICS um is super cool um and they are like kind of ogs where we respect like what they build which is so amazing in the tech stack itself is is amazing in my opinion it's not the best way to go um like I don't I don't technically I don't see it working well um but it might work well to like being kind of this um place where like 10 or 5 or 15 or something like like a limited amount of trains could kind of incubate that's possible that's that that could be super cool and that could help uh Adam and Cosmos ecosystem mesh security seems uh very interesting in my opinion I also see this Tech working in the dimension ecosystem and kind of bringing roll ups to contribute security also through the Hub through the value that they uh um get from from what's going on on roll ups um I I like the approach of much security I think it's I think it's uh pretty pragmatic it's it's cool um for ICS I think it's kind of creating this uh um how do you say like an incubator this is it's like it's like a good incubator it's not I wouldn't say it's like a scaling solution it's more like a like a like a place to start like Customs trains that that would be a good definition for from my perspective but I'm not a huge expert on ICS and you know the the exact differences between the versions and stuff like that and the implementation details but I I think that it's it's a good solution to to bring in new projects and to kind of give them the Adam love Cosmos uh uh hug and then like free them into into sovereignty yeah yeah I like that it's kind of like the sandbox like the incubator for the space yeah I've also been interested in uh interchain uh security because it has your Notions of like scheduler and um even this this way of like sharing mvv um and I even think it can actually be used for like solving decentralized sequencing potentially uh as like having a shared validation I want to talk about the centralized sequencing all right let's do it if you don't mind I want to stick with you yeah like okay so in dimension we decentralized the sequencer by just rotating the sequencer um and like does the Hub there's a place where you can point at we can say okay this is the sequencer now and this is like I I read a lot about decentralizing sequencer and the challenges but I I would love to hear like what is the real how do you see the real pinpoint challenge of decentralizing sequences good question so well so for people who are listening right so a roll up has to have at least one or multiple nodes that end up actually like you know processing the transactions like into blocks and then posting the State updates and um and so that's what a sequencer is and ideally the so you don't actually have to rely on the sequencer to do anything correctly because you have fraud proofs or validity proofs that make you able to like verify that the the sequencer is not lying to you at least however the sequencer can do certain things like they can censor you or they can just go offline and that means that all of a sudden you can't really use the roll up and so you want to have a decentralized sequencer you want to have a you want to have sequencing that provides censorship resistance and and guarantees some level of liveness so that like you know the roll-up just doesn't go offline or you don't get screwed over so that's kind of to me the goal of decentralized sequencing is is that um and so obviously if you have one single sequencer they can do whatever they want so like if you have a multiple of them that seems like a very easy way of like providing more censorship resistance and more sort of like robust liveness however like that there's so many different ways of like skinning a cat and there could be there's things like I don't know maybe you see our lists are a way of like ensuring that there's censorship resistance even if there's only a single sequencer or I don't know maybe there's ways of like economically yeah we have lots of lines yeah economically punishing for censorship but there's also in Dimensions act um you can become a sequencer by yourself you know you don't even have to ask the sequencer you just post you know you just post time and you get sequencing time according to the dime that you post on the Hub and uh I I think and in that way also me via Cruz like down like the more you get profit from this the more profitable this economic organism is the more people would come and say okay I wanna I want a piece of this business this is a good business for me to operate I'll I'll join in I'll come in I'll put more and more and more and more and more until you get to this economic equilibrium and uh the roll-up uh lives but uh uh yeah uh I think I think Dimension has a very good strategy for the centralized sequencing um but you know we're all kind of still in the early phases of getting there we're not production ready with this we don't really uh comprehend all the all the problems that may arise but uh yeah yeah one of the cool things that will come out of um you know various Solutions of decentralized sequencing is a like that's the perfect place to capture Mev because if you're sequencing all these Roll-Ups like you are you know deciding in the ordering and so you can actually capture Mev the other cool thing is that actually as I understand and I don't fully I haven't like read up on the research on this but um you know one of the complaints about the modular stack is that you're you're doing sharding basically where each Roll Up is kind of its own uh computer and they can't actually access each other they can't like you can't have composability basically or atomicity between these Roll-Ups and I mean obviously you you can still do cross chain communication you can be trust minimized but you have to wait one block time basically at minimum but of supposedly with uh if two Roll-Ups share a sequencer set or there's some kind of way for those sequencers to coordinate with each other you can actually have cross chain atomicity um and again I don't that's all I know but if that's true uh which it seems to be because a lot of smart people are talking about this um that's and I think that can be coordinated potentially through this decentralized sequencer layer or network whatever that looks like so like I I think this is going to be a hugely valuable piece of infrastructure both from the value capture perspective as well as the you know the service like it's just going to be very useful for people because it it makes it so you can truly deploy a roll up out of the box you don't have to think about any infrastructure not even obviously not the data availability your consensus part uh but neither the actual like node saw like running the the node infrastructure for the roll up so yeah I'm glad that you brought this up because this is this is a big topic um and and I I would love to learn more about like um sort of the the decentralized sequencer approach you guys have is there like um do you guys have any docs or like where can people learn about all these um like the technology like the rdk that the settlement Hub and all that so first of all there's GitHub there's a few um private repos but does GitHub open um there's uh the docs docs dot dimension.xyz there's a lot of learning material about Dimension and and you can read over there there's the light paper where we just go over through our whole design um and how we see things and how like how it works and try to try to be as simple as possible it's not that hard to read um and uh yeah it's like it's it's constantly right you research is is a trial and error you you you think you know and then you okay you get to the implementation and things can change right uh but uh I think that we're kind of in in we reach kind of a mature uh design in terms of the system in terms of how everything works like I feel like we really kind of got the core fundamentals of everything and there's some more work to do but uh yeah we can we can talk about this more work because we're going on to test net in really really close so people could uh see see this in action and experiment with this yeah so um I guess in in closing I wanted to uh I want to hear like what what is the road map like where's development currently at what is a roadmap for 2023 like what can people expect uh this year what can developers who are curious uh play around with um you know where where do people go if they want to get involved all that good stuff so we we're not we didn't invent the the crypto uh social mechanisms you can come to Discord and you know these questions whoever wants questions or we're there uh does docs uh that you can play around with you can run your own node uh your own Dimension Hub known of course then you can run your roll app uh basically it means that you can uh register your roll app on a dimension Hub node and you can say to the dimension type note hey I'm a dimension roll app I'm obeying to the protocol rules this is the transaction please add me uh to become a roll app on the dimension Hub uh you can put on that roll up an evm virtual machine and put on contracts and see the latency see how see how it works see the performance you can do the same thing with cosmosum you can build your own native go modules on the rdk which basically means like you can build your own roll up with custom Uh custom business logic um in terms of the world map so we're releasing test that's not in February it's going to be exciting it's going to have first permission roll apps and you're going to see like we're going to have a web app that you can see that you can move from rollap Aid or roll out B and see how it works and and kind of uh have different flavors of rolab so evm um uh Cosmos like I said a native one uh see that working and then we're gonna progress uh into incentivized testnet they're going to have permissionless deployment of roll apps uh we we plan to have like this thing where people could Scout for fraudsters and and get uh you know reward for this and this is all incentive is super cool so you can go ahead and try to try to create frauds try to uh you know try to tackle this uh from you know the fraudster and try to tackle this from the people who want to catch uh uh the the fraudulent stain machines some points uh in mid 2023 we're going to launch test net Tesla sorry mainnet uh Genesis event and and it's going to be exciting uh hopefully it will combine with solicitors mainnet and uh we're gonna see a lot of roll apps uh submitting a lot of data to Celestia and uh getting a lot of liquidity from dimension um and really like implementing the the modular vision and just creating this alternate dimension of Cosmos problems uh and like I'm looking forward to it I'm just seeing it and coming into place each and each day that I come to work and work with like the amazing team that we have uh yeah super exciting well that is music to my ears um stoked to hear that your guys uh launched a sort of you know in in close tandem with ours and um just as I I uh the only hopefully the fingers crossed man yeah yeah well I I was saying that yeah fingers crossed also I mean in general whenever you're shipping um you know blockchain software it is so difficult and complex and there can be so many bugs and things that go wrong and some people need to understand that like that that happens all the time and so that's why even you know for ethereum upgrading uh to proof of stake took so long it's just a very very delicate thing but anyway I was about to say that um you know for me 2023 is going to be the year of modular it's going to be when modular stops becoming just like a buzzword and like you know uh something that people talk about in theory and it's gonna become something that's actually real and out there in the world that people can build with obviously it's still going to be early days for modular there's still a lot of work ahead of us um you know a lot of the tech stack is still in development and and going to take time to mature but it's it's going to be real and it's going to be it's gonna be like a new chapter for the entire blockchain space starting this year and you know Dimension is a huge part of that so you know Isha is shyam just stoked that you were able to come on the podcast today and um you know I'm excited for people to learn more about Dimension and um you know uh I think that this is just the beginning of a much longer uh you know partnership and conversation and hopefully we can follow up sometime maybe later in the year just to hear how things are going maybe in Tel Aviv or Hawaii I'm not sure yeah yeah that would be fun but uh yeah once again thank you for coming on and um excited for the modular future to be building it together yeah man thanks for the time appreciate it and uh you know lots lots to come uh for building this this new you know this new internet it is what it is absolutely well thanks again all right man take care
