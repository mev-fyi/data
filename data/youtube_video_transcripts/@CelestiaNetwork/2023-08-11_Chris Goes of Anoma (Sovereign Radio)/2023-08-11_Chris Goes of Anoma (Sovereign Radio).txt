Chris Anna welcome to Sovereign radio thank you for having me why don't you tell our viewers a little bit about yourself I'm Chris I previously worked as the architect of the IBC clinical for the cosmos project and now I am one of the co-founders of Sonoma and namata cool I want to explore anoma first um yeah tell us what anoma is what it does what it's known for what is anoma so I think sometimes we are like perhaps renowned for not giving a very clear answer to this question you just you're just smiling knowingly yeah no one will tell me right um although I will say that some of the things you said back then we didn't understand and we're starting to understand a little bit that's the goal that's the goal right yeah we'll see but to me it often helps to zoom out on kind of the history of what's going on in the blockchain space you know there's a lot of noise there's a lot of like technical noise and a lot of the technical noise leads to Great Innovation but it also makes it hard to see where things are going yeah so to me if you zoom out there are kind of three stages of blockchain architecture in the first two stages I think we've kind of seen already and we're in the phase of the kind of coalescence of the third stage and the first stage is what I'm going to call scriptable settlement and scriptable settlement really started with Bitcoin back in the days of Bitcoin no one thought about programmability no one thought about intense no one thought about solvers no one thought even about privacy because it was just like what was this crazy thing was it even going to work yeah a Bitcoin built I mean a surprising amount of like there is a little bit of programmability in Bitcoin script right but there's one asset the thing that the network allows you to do fundamentally is send that asset around maybe their multi-cigs are like a few different configurations but it's just you know the asset and the protocol are kind of very tightly coupled right in the second phase is what I'll call programmable settlement in really programmable settlement only came about with the Advent of ethereum there were attempts before to build colored coins different assets on bitcoin to build kind of some services around the protocol this was before the days of lightning tell us a little bit more but they they really never took off it was clear that Bitcoin just by its design treated all other assets and all other like programmability built on top as a second class Citizen and it was very hard to get both the kind of technical security and the user experience that you need in order to actually build something people want so with your came along and tried to build kind of you know full you know modular gaster and complete programmability on top of a distributed budget right it's the same kind of decoupling the asset in the blockchain a little bit right um so now people could make erc20 tokens they could make Dows they can make all of these kinds of programmable interactions but still the essential thing that was going on was settlement so you know when ethereum started out at least you sent your transactions to the ethereum mempool and they said what the ethereum what code The ethereum Ledger should run right they specify a sequence of imperative State transitions they say like go to this contract make this message call add these balances subtract these balances you know then you're done right and over the years you know when ethereum started out that was what happened and I I used ethereum in some of the early days and there were you set your transactions to the ethereum mempool I think I ran like C plus plus implementation before it got deprecated it had these really cool emojis on the command line output yeah oh well which one came after that after C plus let's suppose I mean it was C plus plus for a while it was C plus plus ethereum and parodies yeah which used to have this like in browser wallet interface I thought it was really cool I sat when they ditched that project but um but over time it's become clear that users don't exactly want to specify transactions they want to specify well kind of what they want when they use the system let's just say it in an abstract sort of way and there's a lot of in between that happens often they need to you know often they need to find what we call counterparties right they have one side of an interaction they have acid a they want asset B sure right right they're looking for an asset satisfying some properties but they don't know it's about the asset and you know one thing that's uh to me really compelling about these kinds of distributed systems is that potentially they can help us discover counterparties programmatically right this is very new so you could always like even with Bitcoin you could say oh I want to do a two of two multi-sig to like atomically swap some things um but I need to go I need to go troll around some signal groups I need to go to wintermute I need to go to like the OTC provider to find my counterparty right yeah a counter party Discovery was still male and kind of writing Discovery wasn't you know I don't think it's so much the Bitcoin and ethereum were wrong or anything like that they were just trying to solve a different problem right the original scope of what blockchains were doing just involved settlement it just involved ordering transactions on a ledger executing on maybe you know at most making the results available for verification by a like client right but users want something else users have what we call intents and the term intense um I I tried to look this up because I didn't expect it to become popular right and I was trying to figure out where where did I you know where did you I've used it for a little while but but I didn't you know I didn't touch any import to it right um I found the first time I used intent was in this short protocol description of wyvern that I wrote wyvern wyvern yeah wyvern's like a still existent ethereum Dex protocol that's used by openc for several years and I mean at the time I just thought like okay well why are people going to use blockchains I mean my you know my friends who don't go to this conference like you know they they will use the system because they want something right uh coordination technology is only useful if you want to do something with someone else yeah yeah right and just doing something with someone else already brings to mind this concept of counterpet Discovery right yeah um so back then I tried to build really what was kind of like an intense system on a theory they built a smart contract right so what was wrong with that though I mean the smart contract worked but it just didn't do everything that was necessary right so the smart contract uh I mean the evm is not not so not really designed for intents it's designed on the basis of like uh you know Von Neumann VMS just designed to execute programs sequentially and handle like message passing between programs on you know like on a Mainframe computer right that was the original design imperative for these systems um and it's possible to I would say it's possible to emulate intents on top of the evm and it works um but it's a little bit clumsy because the evm imposes this kind of strict ordering requirement so when you write transactions for the evm you include like the order of message calls you say start with this message do this other thing end with this message and you can't give any it's it's difficult to give freedom to the later system to make those decisions about ordering for you because usually what users care about is not Global ordering right you're paying for more than you want most of the time right you're paying these really high gas fees to get a global linear order of all transactions when most of the transactions touch state that doesn't have anything to do with each other and most of what the users wanted you know potentially could have been satisfied in a different way so what comes next what comes next that model um I mean in our view it will be this kind of intent-centric world yeah an intense Centric world really it tries to invert the problem so rather than thinking about okay uh you know we have blockchains and building stuff on top of them an intent Centric view thinks about users and users have intents and how do we kind of the intensor like the boundary boundary constraints of the system right so if you think about if you think I think something that's helpful to think about it spatially if you think about the intents the intensity like the circle of the edges and the intents flow into the network and in the network there are a lot of different they're operators right they're validators they're solvers they're gossip nodes they're all these other nodes and the intense kind of constrain and specify what they could do if we if we describe them well but some freedom is also given to the operators to make some decisions and that there's a tricky there's a tricky balance here between giving the operators the appropriate freedom but also constraining that freedom because if they have too much Freedom then you see something like Mev right then you see that because the the preferences of The Operators right are different than the preferences of the users the users want you know they want as much of acid b as possible or they want at the very least like a fair swap price but the you know the Mev Searcher wants as much money for them right so you see this kind of this this this um you know Divergence and preferences when the action space of these interior operators isn't isn't sufficiently constraint and that I'm guessing is where a Noma uh lifts right I mean so so we can see the vanilla as an architecture okay um and let me let me Define that by contrast I think it'll make it clearer so Noma is an architecture and not a blockchain now we will at some point propose a Genesis block for an asset which could be used by people but it's not like the the whole thing is built to be uh neutral you know you know Mass it doesn't have any privileged place in the system and it's not we're not trying to get everyone to like inherit security from anoma or something like this you see like there may be not the like a hub and spoke it's not like things aren't locking into a gnome as a blockchain right right in particular I guess we envision the topology of the actual consensuses that you want to run as determined from the intents so let me let me maybe give an example to make this a little bit clearer so if I'm in Paris and I'm trying to buy coffee and I need to swap my maybe I have some atoms privacy and Cosmos right I need to swap my atoms to Euro yeah to buy coffee um then you know my intent is to swap addends to Euro to buy coffee and I need enough security for like a coffee payment right I don't need a lot so probably just by virtue of describing that clearly you know the system can go look on my behalf and it can check because there's someone in Paris willing to accept atoms and give me Euros right and that doesn't require it never requires leaving Paris so you know the latency with this interaction can be like 50 milliseconds and you aren't you don't need to pay for some kind of Global Security that you just don't need in this case I mean not maybe maybe it's the case that someone you know no one in Paris has Euro and wants Adam seems seems unlikely but possible and then the system can figure out okay it needs to go search further and wider to kind of try and satisfy my intent I have a question about these the three steps you just gave there is also like a change in the way that the kind of technology is built so there's the utxo state model do you imagine this looking like the state model or is it something else yeah um so so maybe this is a little bit spicy but I think utxo versus account is actually kind of a false dichotomy like if I think if you investigate if you try and pin these systems down to their essence you know make them as minimalist as possible or as modular as possible you could say uh and you defer the decisions about ordering to run time yeah then you end up with something which is both and whether or not you know the state is still segmented right like in utxos but the segmentation of state is defined you know defined by the program and defined by the user and how they interact with it right um so you think of then the enoma system being a hybrid as well or do you like do you will you need to affect that level or can you just borrow it from what existed before um I mean I think you can emulate things on what existed before you know you can emulate utxos on an account system you can emulate account systems on a utxo system it just comes with some extra cost and it makes it like more complex to reason about what's going on but for the intent Centric do you need a new model um I think we need a new model particularly as it concerns uh sort of security and in or like consensus security and information flow control uh in that we need we need a way for users to specify these kind of the assumptions they're willing to make the consensus providers they're willing to use and the constraints they want to put on who gets to see what information right as a result of their interaction their intent their interaction with the system so I think that requires some more expressive systems which are capable of capturing these things some of the differences are maybe like implementation efficiency differences like you can emulate things on the evm it you know those costs matter because they translate to like dollars right if you're paying 10 times as much gas because there's unnecessary ordering going on then a whole bunch of use cases for your system just become becoming feasible yeah so some of the differences are just implementation and you could emulate it I want to ask you a question that folks might actually be asking so you sort of mentioned anoma and namata those are two different names two different brands what are each of those things I think we have covered in a way what anoma is why are there two right why are these two I think right right why are they linked and why are we doing so many things at once great question so just as there are three phases of like blockchain architectures I also think there are kind of three phases of privacy in blockchains I think we started out in the phase you know really with the birth of zikash where privacy was tied to an asset and privacy was like you know you chose between the different the different altcoins as they used to be called right and some altcoin in the different all coins were defined by the feature sets right so and the future set of Z cash and the narrow was practice privacy exactly I mean literally was a fork at the Bitcoin code base which added privacy they tried to change as little as possible yeah yeah um and I think that uh you know that credit to Z cash where credit is due zika okay as it exists today and the all of the ZK Roll-Ups ecosystems andoma penumbra pneumata none of this would exist for sure without the word cash but I think that that tie between asset and protocol choices has been very limiting because people have to choose they kind of have to choose both or neither so either they choose to exchange their assets to Zach and they get they can get great privacy world-class privacy all the Z cash block today but they have to hold that asset and that asset is not you know not necessarily what everybody wants for all interactions right people want many different assets they interact with many different systems they might want to use local currency and stuff like this and zikas just can't support that as if it's currently designed architected um so I think the kind of the second phase of privacy which is the phase which we're we're still in is one where privacy is service okay right and things like tornado cash and namata and you know I would say penumbra fall into this phase right so here privacy is not tied to an asset you can take your existing assets from the existing ecosystems and move them somewhere to get practices right it's a service it's like uh you can take the things that you have and move them into a private environment which is still separate from you know the whole thing is kind of mostly transparent mostly public and you might pay a small fee to do that right right exactly and and you have to you know you do have to choose between like do I interact with the apps on ethereum right now do I get privacy right now you can move between them cheaply even their cost is not zero right um so we're still in FAS and I think um you know the reason we're building the Mata is to help that face progress further and what's that third phase is it privacy from the ground of the third phase we think requires really a grandson for your architecture where I mean to me honestly I think uh you know it's hard to know how to how to play the memetics exactly but privacy is not quite the right word it's a very difficult word to use in the context of systems architecture because it doesn't actually describe a property of the system it describes a property of an interaction relative to a person right like what is a private system a system where all data is private to everyone is useless you never want this like why would you use such yeah it's like a magic box you put stuff in and you can never get anything I like this it's sort of like you're seeing the Nuance of that word right privacy is used a lot it means different things in different places and yeah there's this gradient and so maybe what is namata's flavor of privacy right and I'm guessing that is in that third phase actually right right I mean maybe so to situate things the third phase as we envision it is one where privacy is a default you could say or where users specify instead of specifying what they want to keep private which is still true in a privacy is a service world right fault your things are public you decide what to keep private yeah right you know privacy is the full World users decide what to make public right so which seems like you know that's how we interact in Social contexts normally totally right you don't make everything public to all of your friends at once you say specifically and it should be made easy to make things public right yeah um so no I mean we think you know we think about what enoma does is you know really programmable disclosure right things start that's private yeah and they you know or they it's not even they just start as local right the information doesn't need to go anywhere that you didn't specifically tell it to yeah and then of course you want to prove to specific parties that you've done specific things you want to prove to the validators that your transaction is valid you want to prove to your counterparties that they've been paid you want to prove to the auditor that you're a counselor in order and you should be able to do all of those things right but what is Nevada what is namata um so I think uh it's you know phase one is still most most assets are still transparent right there's a little bit of privacy as a service available but it hasn't yet been hasn't yet been normalized let's put it down if that were namata is phase one phase two phase two it's phase two the Mata is trying to normalize privacy as a service right and trying to kind of uh build some economic incentives around privacy that treat privacy as a public good so um privacy is a public good in the sense that you know it's uh non-rival risk and more or less non-excludable but also that the more people use privacy technology the more privacy everyone has for sure right but people are in this case like in an environment and they're going to opt into that space again that's right okay that's right um and that will still be true until we reach phase three but uh what we hope to do with the Mata is offer uh privacy as a service product that makes that opt-in costs as low as possible yeah right it's sort of designed to be one hop from the cosmo sequence system one hop from the ethereum ecosystem and the Privacy that you give to everyone by using a shielded pool on the Mata is paid back in some sense in what we call shielded sub rewards to people who are keeping their Assets in the pool so going back though anoma and Yamada so both exist at the same time how are they how do they connect right so anoma is uh like an architecture designed for the long term and we don't you know we want to be able to make the right long-term design choices because once you deploy a protocol it's very hard to change right see you know Z cash ethereum IBC everything has this property um but we wanted also to provide some assistance in bridging from phase one to phase three of this sort of three-phase privacy Spectrum uh more quickly because if we end up there's this like dystopia right where blockchain's become this transparent surveillance nightmare where there's now this like open intelligence market right yeah on ethereum called Arkham there's you know uh we need to be able to it's not only that you know an element tries to solve the long-term design question but I don't think this is enough right we could solve the long-term design questions correctly and like maybe the thing is live in two years and it's just too late and everyone has decided blockchains or surveillance Nightmare and you know The Regulators have imposed mandatory kycs on everything and we've just like given up right so we want to provide incremental steps okay to help bridge them then no matter is that I see so it's and it uses genome architecture it uses uh parts of it part of it uh yeah yeah it doesn't you know we wanted to ship them out quickly yeah um and sonamata uses tenement uh which I know will not use and it uses a more it's not fully programmable it just supports multi-asset filter transfers and these shielded rewards after Nevada is there something like do you have any sense for what the next stage what would what a third type of privacy product look like or network look like right I mean maybe you build it or would somebody else build it um I mean I think maybe it's good here to make a distinction between the architecture and The Primitives so anoma the reason we've gone out for this like what is architecture right and architecture in some sense can be understood as a way of organizing things a way of organizing components so it's a way of organizing things like ceremony of proof systems but as an abstract primitive right so the architecture is not tied to a specific one so I think that our you know we view our role as kind of helping with architecture and not optimizing specific Primitives I'm not a trained cryptographer I don't know what the you know newest thing in like efficiency zero knowledge proof systems is going to be but I'm hoping to build an architecture that is like future compatible with that by abstracting things properly so I think it will be a collaborative effort okay um but maybe one other useful I know in some sense a way of understanding what anoma is trying to build for inter operability of privacy is like private IPC which requires reorganizing a lot of abstractions yeah the way IBC was originally designed just didn't have privacy in mind it's an explicit design goal and as in many other things it's difficult to retrofit privacy for sure um so you know we hope to uh to be able to offer a way of arranging things that allows for the properties people want and then connect to all of these specific and often modular Primitives that optimize for specific things I want to bring us back to the topic of intense you just mentioned that and defined it earlier but like what do you see an interaction between intents and roll-ups like and why right um I think this is a good question and honestly sometimes maybe it's just that I don't I don't read everything but to me roll up is this like kind of fuzzy word where I don't always know exactly what it means so I went to the Celestia glossary earlier this week to make sure I had accurate up-to-date information and Celestia glossary said paraphrasing here something like Roll Up is a type of blockchain that ultimately uh interacts with and inherits some properties with from a layer one at least data availability which I think is good definition it's like uh it's clear but the thing the part in that definition that is a little like um a little fuzzy is a type of blockchain what is a blockchain so when we think about things in an intense Centric world we start with intents and we do what we call solving solving means matching attempts so taking like a for B uh B for a you can match those together but you can also do and what we've called so far in our parlance parse resolving partial solving is where you take a for B and B for C and combine it into a for C but I think this is a Roll-Up it's like an on-demand rule because you're doing a sort of compositional sequencing just on demand from the intents when you need it instead of and so instead of like when you use an application on a roll-up it sticks to a specific roll-up it's like you fixed some of the topology of settlement you're going to send your transactions to this application that application is going to sequence them and execute them and that is going to like post data to Celestial ethereum something like this still a little lost on that connection point though like you're saying like you do this partial intent solve but why like why not do that on a one or like why why what does that really have to do with the roll-up environment is it because there's certain parts of its consensus have been kind of taken out I think maybe the advantage of such an approach is it allows you to choose which Roll-Ups to use dynamically based on the intent so you're imagining multiple Roll-Ups then in this case you're not this is not all happening in a single one no it's like it's like Roll-Ups on demand it's like take two intense um a for b b for C and just make a roll up like make make a roll up uh you know in the gossip system really it's like like completely ephemeral but make a roll up combine them to a for C and then you know you could set you could view this even if you have some final settlement layer you just do this until you get a transaction and then you post the transaction to the settlement I guess this is a really different way of thinking about Roll-Ups I always think of Roll-Ups as like a full-fledged blockchain like where there's a team and it takes months to do something like this so like how would you be able to do it so quickly for a trade or for an intent Searcher or yeah I guess you call it intent matching yeah yeah yeah I mean I think it's possible to standardize the protocol so uh as I understand the space at the moment it's not perfectly but different Roll-Ups want to make different specific choices like they want to build different instruction sets they want to build slightly different VMS they want to optimize their storage for like such and such a purpose um and I think that's great and we'll continue to see that kind of specific optimization and enoma comes at this from the perspective of making things compositional so let's say there's like roll up software one with instruction set one and roll upside for two with instruction set two and when you articulate things as intense you don't need the instruction sets to be the same they could be different oh wow because you only check the results okay right so I can take uh intent one that was formatted in the way of roll up one and two that was formatted in the way of roll up two and then the intents need to be able to understand the results of executions there needs to be some like legibility at the state layer but they don't need to agree on the instructions is this almost like a roll-up on those roll ups that like just lives there for a brief second com does the combination and sort of spits back something yes exactly okay exactly it's like you're creating Roll-Ups when you need them what that looks like to me or what it sounds a lot like is a bridge between two Roll-Ups that does something but I feel like you're not thinking about it I mean you're calling it a roll-up you're not calling it a bridge yeah I mean I think it depends on it it hinges on if we look at the definition of roll up that Celestial glossary uses it says a type of blockchain so whether you consider it a rollover a bridge kind of depends on this like what counts as a type of blockchain right um and that depends also on what you view you know what you view the essence of a blockchain is right sorry to dive into languages but it's hard to like so so let's call this thing that I'm describing let's call this like parallel C sequencer composition right so we think a lot about sequencing and roll-up plan and sequencers are making decisions about ordering on each roll up right individually at this time yeah right and because intents don't specify ordering because they're kind of ordering agnostic or mostly constrain it somewhat this allows for parallel composition I think it might be helpful here to think about sequencing something that Lola folks talk about a lot and sequencers are making ordering decisions but intents are purposefully agnostic to exactly how things are ordered they specify it most constraints around ordering but mostly they specify what someone has and what someone wants right they specify preferences um and this allows for intents to be intents that were sent to different sequencers to be composed so we can say sequencer one takes a for b b for C composes it to a for C and sequencer two takes C for D and D for a and composes it to C for a then sequencer three takes a for C and C for a and composes which is action both like it's basically combining them from that start point to that endpoint does it actually have to combine all the stuff in between to do that or does it sort of throw it out and just say actually we're just going to skip all of you um it luckily with sort of a ZK roll up basically okay we don't need to reprocess things um so yeah so it's been processed you're using that I guess right that's right so when we do a for C we've already figured out the stuff in between yeah and when we do a c for a we've already figured out stuff in between and now it's just one more step of conception kind of going back to that like modular like all those roll up I'm just trying to picture like there's a lot of Roll-Ups all of a sudden what does that do to like the economics the center of gravity of one of these things like are we just getting further and further away it has become like more dangerous lower security yeah I mean I think um it will be very important in this world that we come up with good ways of describing security to users and enforcing those descriptions at the system level right so one danger you know just with the the or one maybe warning with the logical stack as it's kind of currently being deployed is the users are using these systems with a bunch of modular components operated by different parties and that you're not going to understand the security assumptions each other right in this case in this kind of architecture like where is the center of gravity for data availability like is it still in the middle and also like if you get further away from that does it does it affect security or something I mean I guess I would I would understand data availability in this architecture is polycentric that it's going to depend on what the data is like what it means to users if this is you know data data has some value right we can think of it as private keys that allow me to spend something or some kind of information about about assets that we're deciding to keep on The Ledger right and what that value is is not defined by the system itself right that's like defined by the relation you know by what five atom means or something to the world right yeah so it's not something that we can I don't think it's something that we can entirely standardize or that should live in one place um it depends on what it means what the user security assumptions are um how much they want to pay for it you know globally replicated data is more expensive how much they care about latency if you want to typically you want data to be available in the sense that you might want to be able to retrieve it in order to retrieve it you need to physically contact the person who's storing it and that's more expensive if they're further away right and and also I think it matters for resiliency that like you don't suppose that there was some global war and like the global data availability provider got object or half their nodes went offline or half of them are not allowed to respond to your requests anymore because the physical thread or something like this it would be really bad if your community's data was all only stored on this global data availability provider right so you always want like local backups and qualities of the data so you do see it sort of fragmenting then yeah and I see it more like you could also also view it as like a distributed cache optimization problem with just additional constraints around security like better test stuff like this okay I have a last question burning question I've had you know we talked about pneumata in the context of these like three stages of privacy but is Nevada a roll-up is Nevada a roll-up um well I mean the definition of roll-off includes something called L1 and I think maybe I have a slightly different view on on what an L1 is um I think people think of L1 as like an architectural difference like some things are ones and other things are not at once but if you understand L1 is also also kind of meaning that this is the final route of trust or something like this to me that's a decision that is Observer dependent it's like defined by the user not only and it's not even it doesn't have to be consistently defined by the user it can be defined differently for different interactions so when I'm paying for my coffee in Paris you know I don't want to wait for the global L1 right I want to wait for like the Parisian fast you know 4X settlement yeah yeah roll up right or something so that's my old one right okay um uh so would nomada live on would it no matter via L4 and a model could be an I mean at the moment it does not provide like full recursive State proof to provide something you know I guess comparable to like a multi-seg and some l2s some things that call themselves l2s just have multi-sakes so okay and that's like bridge over to something right exactly exactly exactly um uh but in the future you know certainly you know we'll have um full recursive tape proofs and then you could say that anything is a roll-up of anything else but would it be an L1 instead um things Branch off it maybe I guess maybe I mean both right I mean you really have I can hear this like you have very much the mesh view right like that it's a lot of it's not center with a lot of things coming out of it but much more like a mesh a lot of pieces bridging together data availability living everywhere yeah yeah I mean I would say eventually I think we're using these systems for economic coordination and eventually I think the the architectural topology will kind of be drawn to match the economic topology and the economic topology very much is polycentric right and when it's too Central we run into trouble like then we run into like Global world government or you know American Empire or you know other shenanigans that are difficult to to deal with because there's kind of one Center and everyone's competing for control right so yeah I'd say but do you think at this moment in time don't you feel like in the blockchain world there's also sort of that there is like the winners right now and they won't necessarily be the winners forever but it's like there's this period of like lots of different options and then there's a winner and there's lots of options and yeah yeah I mean in some way you could view that kind of expansion and contraction as like a learning process or a selection process not that's perfect but they're like they're periods of you know what we call Bull markets or something like this you could call periods of experimentation yeah and a bunch of money is spent on stuff that's like not going to work frankly but some of it is some of it and you don't know until you try right and then bear markets right now are this phase of contraction yeah yeah when the phase of contraction is I mean it's painful especially if you are not you know and there's lots of luck involved you know there's skill and luck and not everyone's going to be both Lucky and skillful all of the time right but on the other hand it's necessary to uh kind of not waste too many resources and to and just to clarify what's going on because like the con you can the sort of the group of people and the the the distributed Consciousness are forced to come back together and kind of reckon with what are the relations between all these different experiments now so I see I think you you see this now actually in this particular cycle there's this sort of like architectural convergence where you know you see it in ethereum Ducks is like uniswap cow swap one inch are all basically building the same like slight variations on the same thing um I think you see it in kind of the modular architecture of the 10th Centric architecture approaching each other from different directions bottom up and the user down um I think you see it see it I wonder if the experimentation has just moved somewhere else though maybe different maybe Parts like or are we only in an optimization phase where we've decided or sort of come together around ideas now we're optimizing those ideas or is there like yeah I mean I think there's also a lot of you know these systems actually work in practice a lot of the necessary experimentation is not technological or not solely technological it's also cultural and I think we're only at the beginning of that phase like cows mostly don't work right but there's a lot of good experimentation yes um and the good experimentation seems to be at least sometimes like congealing into replicable practices or languages or sort of patterns of organization that are at least somewhat different than corporations um and that for someone's definition of work work so yeah I think lots of that to come thanks Chris thank you thanks for coming on Sovereign radio and thank you all out there for watching
