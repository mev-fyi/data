okay so how does a monolithic blockchain look like and this is the traditional blockchains that we've had for the past 10 12 years or so or whatever right there they've all been monolithic blockchains uh monolithic blockchain in the base consensus there at the most base layer does all of data availability settlement and execution and usually settlement and execution are tied together now what's the problem with this the problem is that if you do all these things at the base layer you're doing a bunch of work and if you have to do a bunch of work that work kind of limits the capacity of the system it limits the total throughput and this is why many blockchains are now moving towards the modular blockchain paradigm for example celestia and ethereum 2 are based on this modular paradigm where the base consensus layer only does data availability in other words it makes the transaction data available but doesn't execute it on top of this you have a settlement layer for example this could be ethereum's ethereum virtual machine and usually and the theory in the e2 model for instance these two would be tied together and then on top of this settlement there you have a completely separate execution layer uh and these can be the same roll-ups that we've seen before things like fuel orbit from zk sync many others and the reason that this model is so good is because now the base consensus layer does not have to be burdened with doing settlement and execution it can just focus on data availability and therefore it can provide a much higher capacity of data availability by specializing in this and then on the flip side execution layers and settlement layers by specializing only in settlement or only an execution can provide a much better experience much higher throughput for those things through specialization [Music] you
