you know a successful accomplishment of like our long-term reason or our North Star is really to grow this modular future of blockchains accelerate and help bring it about and what a result of that will look like is we now have achieved say a four to five digit number of functioning Roll-Ups and I would say more than more than half of them are being secured through some type of hyperlane interchange security module welcome everybody to another episode of Celestia Spotlight uh I'm Nick CEO at Celestial labs and the purpose of Celestia Spotlight is to hear from people at the Forefront of the modular movement people building the infrastructure that we're going to be using in the future um today my guess is John call who is building hyperlane and hyperlane is a permissionless interoperability layer built with a modular security stack and that's a lot to unpack and so we have an exciting episode ahead of us um John welcome to the show I'd love to hear a bit about your background before we jump in but first I also have to ask you have you run a Celestial light node yet and if not uh why not what's stopping you well I was trying it's trying to run it on this this little Fitbit Versa two that I bought three years ago I haven't we're getting there Step One jailbreak the damn thing but uh that was like gonna be my contribution and uh if I don't manage to jailbreak it and get it running I'm gonna make it look like I did because I saw some of those memes and uh you know yours I thought you posted one where you had it on a switch and I was like damn this one actually is real because like I know the like I know the jailbreaking thing but is running in the background to make this happen so like it was impressive but maybe you'll see one for me on the Fitbit that would be yeah I'd be very stoked to see that so I hope you guys can get it um yeah let's hear a bit about about your background before we dive into uh hyperlane so for sure so um you know I've been in crypto for a little while I got uh really enamored around 2016 where nobody um over the weekend is like yo John I'm gonna put all of my money into ethereum all my friends are doing it do you think I should and why is he asking me this he's asking me this because like I'm the only one he knows who presumably knows a thing or two about money at the time I'm a bond Trader at Morgan Stanley um you know a little bit after out of school and like yeah this guy's like uh put everything I got to do with you I mean it's a dear friend and I'm like I don't maybe that's a bad idea I don't know I feel like let's spend some time on it and we spent some time on it and we spend the entire weekend and I'm I am just hooked because I'm someone who I grew up in Israel and Israel the banks are awful the banks treat you as if they're doing you a favor that they take care of your money uh it's not really your money it's theirs you just kind of get to sometimes withdraw some parts of it and so I had been very interested in anything that will help dismantle the banks and that's funny from someone who ended up working at an investment bank but I needed money so you know so spend the entire weekend on ethereum and I'm like this is the first thing I've ever seen that might actually like serve my general cause of kind of like dismantling these terrible institutions that is just like Banks because they've personally like irked me both in Israel then I moved to the states I'm one of the people that Wells Fargo steals money from in the account if you're familiar with like the Los Angeles area Scandal that my account was one of them uh and so I come back to the desk on the Monday after that and I'm just like oh my God like we are all gonna be out of a job this ethereum thing is coming and we're so and for the next two years in Morgan Stanley I am the laughing stock of the desk I am the crypto guy I'm this weirdo like 200 people conference calls they're just laughing at me and I basically from that you know spring of 2016 for the next year and a half I just relentlessly learned about crypto one point I become a small time Miner I think I might even have my uh we're excuse of the mess we're just moving I might have one of my last gpus I kept it as a Memento but it was a small time Miner for a little bit by the end of 2017 I get into crypto officially and find my first job that wasn't gonna land me in jail and became a crypto investor at a firm called passport capital uh had a good run there it was became like the first investor in things like Solana uh also had not so good of a run by investing in things that then kind of like unceremoniously exploded that you know I'm sure everyone's thought about and talked about it's been the next three years before starting hyperlane at uh at Galaxy if you're familiar with Mike novograts it's his firm ran the investment business there had also a great run there invested in this like obscure thing called lazy Ledger at some point and uh that thing I think is doing all right um and you know this whole time I like very interested in this notion of interoperability so like on my team I'm the only one without an engineering from the founding but the only one with an engineering background and um I remember like hooking up with the internet 1996 and like not being able to talk to my buddy who was on a different ISP like uh you know our chats wouldn't work you know the emails wouldn't work and then within a year at work and so when I heard that blockings can't talk to each other um I was in the San Francisco area a lot of Cosmos people in the Berkeley and SF area and they were just like no these things coming it's going to change everything like these black men are gonna talk don't even worry about it so I thought it's like a year away but five years later it still felt like a year away from being a year away and so end of 21 there was this opportunity to work on what later became hyperlane with you know and I was really interested in just like letting anyone connect any chain because it seemed insane that these super cool internet computers can't talk to each other so that's you know a little bit about me and kind of like how I got to this point it's a weird it's a weird story but I'm pretty content with my life with my uh obscure decision so far I love it yeah that's that's quite the transformation from Bond Trader to uh you know interoperability geek sorry yeah let's uh let's dive into hyperlane um and and so tell us like unpack this whole you know let's Edition that we started with I'd love to yeah so you know I I came in and you know today I want to talk about hyperlane we said no it's like this permissionless interoperability layer and it's got a modular security stack so what does that really really mean like if there's one takeaway you should take from the the entire you know 45 minute hour we're gonna spend together today and this is you both Nick and certainly the audience it's the goal of this thing called hyperlink is to let anyone connect any chain um and why do we do that because we believe that if you think about like the problems of blockchains these sometimes we talk about them sometimes we don't but like scaling is still like a major major issue blockchain's kind of by definition you know constrained digital resources so every time demand increases we get the same problem it's very predictable and I think that the modular uh you know future of blockchains is really a good solution for it to Me Maybe I'm biased the most promising solution so in this world we're going to end up having a lot of chains and we need a way to connect between them and we need a scalable-ish way to do that so uh what do we really mean you know like let's get into it sometimes we need to see stuff talking about hyperlane like uh and I'm starting to go on a minor tangent you'll see us talk about this concept of The Interchange Highway it doesn't seem to make any sense but just think of like us trying to create a path between all these chains floating in space and to do that we think we need to enable permissionless interoperability and to enable personal and operate interoperability we need modular security so in the same way that um Celestia kind of heralded this Ascent of thinking of a blockchain not just ads this individual thing but as the combination of multiple operations and layers in a stack we wanted to bring that notion to security um today and you know I recently wrote a piece about this by why I think that permissionless interoperability and interoperability in general it's kind of the last layer of that stack and we'll spend more time getting into that but what does it mean to sorry getting the moving ahead of myself how does it complete it we need this notion of modular security so at a high level just think about being able to instead of having a one size fits all like one security model that tries to address every situation at all times for all people no matter what you now the lineage security into individual modules and by virtue of being able to do that you're going to be able to have a more permissionless way to provision the service that is interoperability and in that regard I think it fits quite well into the modular stack so I think one way to make more sense of everything I just said would be to talk a little bit of like what are the problems that are faced by developers and people trying to create and navigate blockchains and through that uh it'll be an easier time to kind of conceptualize and really visualize how something like modular security makes sense how that helps us obtain something that looks like a permissionless form of interoperability and we can take it from there if you're up for it let's do it let's dive in all right so there's a general problem that probably everyone in the audience today knows about that is not really worth spending a lot of time on right like if you are tuning into a Celestia Spotlight I imagine you know about the data availability problem and if you know about that you probably are aware of like one of the most fundamental problems that blockchains have which is they don't know how to digest information that is not endemic that might like put simply a blockchain doesn't know anything about the world outside of it and if you wanted to know you need to find some way to feed it into it and now you're faced with like this typical garbage in garbage out problem and this is kind of like a fundamental thing and if you know been around crypto and if you're like oh that's like what feeds in the Oracle problem like yes that's right so this General problem of connectivity is what creates the the necessity for an interoperability solution but and you know in the year of Our Lord 2023 there are solutions some of them much better than others but they don't always work everywhere some of them you know to some people's view not as good but there are solutions like technically if I want to connect you know John's chain with mixed chain like we can find a way not everyone's gonna like that way but we can find a way primarily though this leads us in to what we think is like the problem that hyperlane is out to solve so we have a general problem that we're solving but really it's about a specific problem of permissioned interoperability so if you wanted to do any type of like complex action between you know two or more chains you really need more than just like simplistic acid transfer now you need to include some logic I need to be able to perform an interchange function call uh maybe you want to do a view call right like in IBC parlance month maybe to do something like an interchange query um and that requires some logic that they passed around now today yes we do have interoperability Solutions but they are quite permission certainly if you want General message passing you're looking at completely permission system and why that is I think there's a good reason for it and the this diagram is kind of meant to illustrate I'm not the best artist so you have to excuse me but I think it stems from the fact that in their effort to create the product that will be the connectivity between chains the messaging interface they have lumped it in and tightly coupled it with the security model to secure the message being passed I think again good reason for this in crypto like it's the most adversarial environment we've ever created right like a lot of people spend the last like 10 15 years working at Big tech companies where a model like move fast and break things kind of ruled the day but certainly like that doesn't really work in crypto crypto can't really think like traditional Tech it needs to think more like Aerospace because if you move that fast and break things like you make one small mistake now you're out nine figures right so it's kind of like you make one small mistake and that plane is  crashing from the sky that's not good for anybody so because of that people view security as a product within itself and I don't think they're wrong in doing that but that has led to them tightly coupling these two things but it doesn't have to be this way you can offer things that are uh and the same product same product quality on the security side but now the two become separate and so with we talked about this modular security what does it really mean it means we are no longer tightly coupling the message interface one product with the security product or product features and that means is that instead of thinking like okay so when I use this system this is its security model and I know that this is all I get from it this is what I need to do to get from it there's actually like a number of options and there's a way for me to operate some parts of it myself there's a way for others to operate and for me to kind of Leverage their service but in the hyperlink case it starts off with kind of like a base configuration where different modules will look like say they can be as simple as maybe wrapping an existing security provision like IPC they may be uh slightly you know like actually probably the same level of Simplicity and just hey there's a multi-sig and that multi-sig says that this is fine so I'm good with it to a bit more complex like oh I want to have uh a group uh validators that are attesting to the state of what they are putting money on the line in the form of their stake and that is what's making me feel comfortable with the the attestation of this nature two even slightly more uh more nuanced like an optimistic system where now we don't just take what was given immediately we put in some time delay the similar similar in uh and concept to the optimistic Roll-Ups that we're all familiar with but not exactly the same where you have some challenge period during that challenge period uh people can observe it does this look like a valid transaction okay if it does let's let it just let it manifest if it doesn't let's let's shoot it down and so that's the concept of modular security and how does it lead you to permissionless interoperability well in this world in the world of things being tightly coupled and intertwined you're always going to need the the um permission of the security model operator to basically add your chain into it it is has to be a conscious decision from them or it has to be something that like you can through some more distributed process can become a part of and so that was a lot maybe I'll stop there for just a second um but hopefully that you know gave people a moment to kind of like digest uh things but and Nick stacked me if I feel like I'm getting too into the weeds but I think one thing that will be really useful to kind of make sense of what we uh this this notion of different security modules is to understand like what different flavors do you get in the realm of uh interoperability like high level what the things look like how's that sound let's do it yeah let's go in I already have a bunch of questions but I'll save them till the end excellent uh and obviously feel free to interject you know as I mentioned before I come from a members really so I'm from a place where conversation is a very Dynamic uh thing so in interoperability you get native verification and external verification is kind of like the two main forms so native just really means like you're leveraging the consensus mechanism between the two two or more things you're connecting that's kind of really nice you know wherever you can use native verification and by most people is considered the ideal and I think it's very reasonable uh stance like if you can replicate that consensus in such a way where like you don't need to trust anything else that's really great you know that it's closer to trustlessness now it still means that you are trusting A and B right it's not magic there's no magic uh but presumably if you want to connect you know A and B you're kind of good with both a and b or else you probably would not be uh doing that we'll begin with so the what's the what's the catch the catch is that the most costly method right like replicating consensus is really really really expensive now you can design a system with certain set of constraints where under which those constraints you reduce the cost of this replication and a great example of that is IBC so IBC works with chains that look very similar mostly you know they don't have to technically be tender man chains but they have that same appearance right they have fast finality they have Lifeline verification and in those cases where the chains are for all intents and purposes near carbon copies of each other replicating consensus is not you know prohibitively costly it becomes totally acceptable but you know if it wasn't constantly we would use this everywhere everyone would there's no reason to not leverage this wherever you can good news there are some advancements that are going to make this uh more possible but to date we are kind of stuck with this we're mostly like defined you know systems that I like to call defined rule sets uh those are really the only place where you can easily leverage native verification so if we have native the other is external and the the big difference here you introduce something in the middle you know a third party between these two consensus mechanisms you're verifying so you're still trusting the A and the B but now you get a little thing in the middle and that little thing can take many forms as I stated before right it could look like uh you know do we crazy to think about but like we actually you know very early on there were single Key Systems where like one single key was signing off on things people were like kind of okay with that and then terribly as we all remember they're now this could be this is probably more likely would be a multi-sig this could take the form of some like proof of stake system where you have validators and they are putting money on the line as I said earlier now there you would have two major classifications in one case you concentrate all the stake on one chain there's a lot of good reason to do that and there's some really serious like Edge case risks that we can get into uh if you want later but in the interest of time I'll spare that and the other system is one where it's per chain so the drawbacks there is you don't get to have a mistake have economies of scale because it has to be divided per chain but you don't have those drawbacks that we can talk about namely like and this in this configuration you don't need any assumptions about an honest majority uh the system can also take the form of like something optimistic like we talked about before or it could even be some type of magic that we're just you know we haven't devised it yet like think of some cool new multi-party computation systems or anything and in there you might not even it might look like a trustless setup But ultimately you are still trusting the implementation to have been done correctly because you know I think this is one area where I diverge from the um some of the more you know research-oriented people where I consider like you know you're still trusting the quality of the implementation like we can't forget that you know that is a very important thing like a lot of implementation bugs have lost um a lot of money so all of this uh leads me to one of the First Things We Said at the beginning is just we think that like modular blockchains really represent kind of the future of solving you know a future solution to a lot of the issues that our industry faces and what is that going to look like well I think it's going to look like we're going to have a lot of hubs a lot a lot of hubs and what do I mean by Hub a hub is somewhere where settlement activity concentrates but you know even even less so than send one activity countries like does this Hub contribute to the eruption or spreading of other smaller chains so if the monolithic system is like let's just build one magic huge super computer you know in the modular world as everyone listening knows we're just aiming for more smaller computers and a hub is to in my view anywhere where an increasing number of small computers is connecting to and so I'm gonna have a lot of these hubs but like what should it mean for you what does it mean for you I think it means that we're gonna need permissionless interoperability because like there's gonna be an increasing number of chains an increasing number of hubs and excuse my language I will be using the term chain that's to refer to whether it's another layer one uh whether it is a roll up a generalized roll-up an app specific roll-up in app chain I'm going to use it as a cash flow term because I think we're moving towards a world where more and more apps are going to command their own chain you're already seeing the strength beginning the ascent of Cosmos has been just the enemy Cosmos has an ecosystem is the best evidence of that I don't think this trend is stopping I'm of course super biased and embedding the farm on this trend but uh I think we'll find a receptive audience for the strength so why do you need permissionless interoperably in this world because you're just gonna keep getting more and more chains and think of the work that your team is doing by making data availability much more plentiful right like making it much easier to submit fireproof or most everywhere you need by even work that is uh kind of how like extra curricular by creating roll kit one of if not the best uh roll-up Frameworks out there right you are effectively making it easier and easier and easier to spin up a new chair um in the meanwhile we're also seeing businesses come up to cater right like whether it's folks like Caldera in eclipse and ALT layer and conduit and layer and and then you know the number keeps increasing because this category seems to have so much potential people are making it easier and easier and easier for you to spin up a note chain okay so we're going to end up with a ton of these right like and initially dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then maybe even million well like I said earlier in the bit about like this being the last piece of the stack what is it all worth if they're all like disconnected islands and there's no easy way for them to communicate and so with hyperlink our goal is to create something that if it's this easy to launch a chain it should be this easy to get going with interoperability right so if like roll kit becomes like three commands and I got my roll up running can't hyperlane be the fourth and fifth command such that now you got connectivity and you're good to go and that's what we uh try to create with the system and so after all that it's probably time to spend just you know a couple minutes on how it works um this is a kind of architectural diagram that will show the life cycle of a hyperlane message and luckily it also shows all three parts of the system in hyperlane there's really three levels to to it working there's the mailbox this is a contract that does exactly what it sounds like it sends and receives information between chains there's the modular security stack expressed here through an interchange security modules or in our lingo isms for short and there's the relayer the relay is a permissionless agent a bot between chains that processes the messages if you're familiar with IDC relayers this relayer looks it feels very much the same so we'll go through a quick life cycle of a message got the mailbox your a user you um either like an app or an eoa you're sending something to the mailbox the mailbox has this interface A dispatch function that takes in the destination like which chain are you going to which address on that chain and it also has we said it sends in receives it also has the logic for receiving so in this case we call it handle and as you get into that logic now you're starting to get to that modular security stack that we'd touched on before this is where things like validators are like an optimistic Watchtower can come in and the cool thing about hyperlink is that when you define how you receive the information that's when you're selecting and you're really defining which security modules do I want to use and how do I want to use them so now that's the second level is the security models this is if the mailbox all on chain security modules are mostly on chain and so far as like the logic but they can also have an off-chain component like this Watchtower like some additional software to validate the state of a chain and again the third the relayer so once the message has been sent to the mailbox relayers look at the mailbox they see oh Nick is sending something from Celestia to uh the Avalanche for whatever reason Nick wants to see what's going on on Avalanche who's a big big avax guy and uh the relayer sees that and bring up Nick left a nice tip here for me I'm gonna take that thank you please and with that the rear layer goes to the mailbox on Avalanche pays the guest he's such that eunuch never had to have avex you paid for it in the native gas token on your origin chain so in this case you paid for it with um with the Celestia gas token and you don't have to worry about Amex that the relayer took care of it for you and now that transaction is included it goes through the security model so being included doesn't mean that it'll get processed because maybe the security model's logic says wait a minute something here doesn't look right um if everything looks good and the security model checks pass now it gets to its destination and all as well um and so that is kind of like a high level of Hyde works and I think you know maybe now is a good time to hit some questions can talk a little bit more about um the different ways modular security can work like the different ways that people can leverage hyperlane like anything that comes to mind really perfect yeah I've I'm eager to ask some questions that came up to mind um the first thing that I want to touch on because you know we've had you know conversations one-on-one about this I thought this was really interesting the way that you framed it is how this security model uh you know gives you a menu of different ways of verifying you know the message that you receive and I remember you also saying that there's even it can be conditional so you know depending on the like the type of message or the amount of money in the message you it goes through a different sort of security module I found that really really interesting and you also kind of made an analogy to how the real world works so maybe um touch on that for a bit perfect and maybe actually like uh I'll go back to this uh slide for one second here because it's relevant but um so think about it like this you go actually I just had this happen um let's mentioned we're moving I have to take care of some things in the bank normally when I go into the bank and I need to get like a hundred dollars out they just I put in the pin and like no questions asked and I can leave there in two seconds this time around I needed to wire a slightly larger sum you know over to over um ten thousand dollars and I got got a good line of questioning remember the last five transactions that your account did who's the direct deposit on your account uh do you remember the other name on this account like what's the address do you remember the address you changed from recently different security protocol I was doing something different the bank I want to do something treated me differently questioned me in a different way a different security procedure and the one time I tried to close my account I'm still a Wells Fargo client I was unsuccessful they really ran me through a ringer of uh of questions that uh it took a while to the point that I just gave up close that still have that same account so the bank used different modes of Security based on my action and that as a concept is something I think a lot of people will find agreeable and so I wanted to bring that same idea to hyperlane so you know in this little um diagram we got here you can see okay so we're sending something from ethereum goes to some contract and then it hits the modular security stack and it needs to go through some some of these configurations so with hyperlane like I mentioned earlier when you are configuring when you set it up you're deciding how do I want to receive this and as you do that your start you're defining like I want to use this security module I want to use this security module and I want to use this security module well guess what that also means you no one uh will know better how to kind of decode the contents of your messages then the implementer right like you're the most familiar with them and so let's say you are you know you're like a lending amp or you're like you're you're a margining app and someone wants to deposit collateral on if to borrow something uh say on osmosis well as the as this app you know what your message contents look like you know what your function calls look like and so as the message comes through you can say wait a second what is this person do is this person just taking out a small loan you know less than like 10 basis points of my lending pool well that looks alright how about we just go through Economic Security because there's enough stake in our pool to secure this right like there's more stake covering the amount at risk so it doesn't make sense for these validators to do them and this could be the fastest path let's go through that then another action oh wait a second this person's trying to take the clear out the entire liquidity pool for this asset that don't look right that that often is that going to happen and you know what if you really need that much if that ever happen you know should that ever happened right should it how often is that gonna how often does someone come into the Vault and it's like guess what we're doing today we're taking everything out probably not very often right something is amiss even if it looks right you might want to take a little while and again like whenever major major transactions have happened right like they always raise eyebrows you see people like on Twitter up in arms when there's like a three four hundred million dollar uh you know total action and some type of defects or like a series of D5 apps so clearly people are paying attention to these large moves so as the app itself you can be aware of this and you can say something different is happening here a different action from the one that came before it and I want to treat it differently I want to run it through a different security protocol so maybe in this case you say I want to run it through the optimistic system because this just feels fundamentally different and you know what do you really need that 100 million like right now could you wait 12 hours is that okay and so that's this concept of not just have like it's one thing to have the different modules and being able to as an app pick them it's another thing to then pick through them dynamically based on what the users are doing and um you know I think this is where it pays to kind of be a simple gun like myself uh and kind of stepping into crypto and being like okay look I get it I know that uh it if we if I could design something that is always the best no matter what like of course I do it but I don't think I can I don't think anybody can and I think you know by year six of doing this you're like I've seen enough you know bodies on the road from trying to do this that don't wanna so like let's have a menu of options don't need to be too many and let's let people kind of pick and operate the right ones and one thing I should mention hyperlink does offer the ability for people to write their own but realistically like I don't think that's gonna happen in the immediate term simply because like it's it's still a new system people still need to get comfortable with it but certainly I could see a world four or five years from now where there's kind of like a robust Market of security operations where you could even have competing right so like there there might be competing optimistic systems for the same set of chains there might be competing you know like economic uh security modules for the same set of chains but don't think we're there yet but it's nice to have the options hopefully that covered and certainly if it didn't okay happy to get deeper into any uh anything I just said no that was perfect and to me this is one of the biggest selling points of hyperlane is is this Dynamic nature to the bridging because I mean this makes so much sense and and like I don't know why someone hadn't thought of that before I know in you know in Cosmos they are adding things like you know a rate limiting to the to the bridge but like that's not quite the same it's not quite as deep as this sort of like modular Dynamic uh verification Logic for the bridge and and like I could see so many benefits also for user experience because let's say I'm just bridging you know ten dollars or a hundred dollars it's like do I have to wait you know the seven days or whatever for an optimistic Bridge like that makes no sense and that's such a pain um maybe a multi-fig is actually fine because like you trust that multi-stick enough for that amount of value you know and then all of a sudden it can be basically instant and so um it just it just makes a lot of sense you know um and so I'm very excited for this I have another question that's kind of built built on that which is you know uh in the modular stack we do want to eventually build towards these trust minimized Bridges right where uh like the the bridge actually fully verifies the execution of the other chain and so you're trying to minimize the amount of like assumptions you make you know so that you can't be exploited of course um my question is and those things are not ready yet like the I mean there are some implementations of them but I think it's still like a ways away before those are like practical and deployed you know as a standard um my question is does hyperlanes model make it easier for us to sort of like gradually upgrade you know like keep the same Bridge basically between these two chains or Roll-Ups and then add new security features as they become practical and usable so like it's not like oh we have to like Implement a whole new bridge or start over from scratch but we just kind of add a new pathway or something I don't know oh what you I love that you asked that question I love the answer question this is again this is where big benefit to uh if you're if you're gonna start a company I recommend being a little bit of a simpleton and finding really really smart people and surrounding yourself with them and I am so lucky that I am said simpleton and I found like an incredible uh brilliant group of people to join me along with this right and you you want to do exactly what you described it's like wait a second sorry I have tremendous faith in our industry and the people working uh on all parts of it that yes certain things aren't ready yet but you know I talked earlier about like native verification and wherever it is available like it is the idea I do want to use it so how can I use it so um if we really kind of like decompose what an ism is an interchange security module it's a really simple thing it's just a wrapper on some bit of logic that makes you feel comfortable about what's coming in so it you know you give it some type of thing that would make you feel comfortable you know maybe it's in some cases it's a multi-stick in some cases it's an optimistic system in some cases it'll be native verification wherever you know wherever you can get it probably if native verification makes you feel quite well and you wrap that and you kind of make that a logic gate for hey did that condition happen oh like is this thing that's supposed to make me comfortable saying I shouldn't be comfortable oh it does okay cool go through the gate oh it doesn't like hold up like what's going on and so what does that mean it means that again we can kind of ramp anything that would make us feel comfortable now conceptually there is no barrier to any form of investment being wrapped up as an ism and really this is you know why they make that a simpleton comment earlier is because like that was kind of like a requirement we laid out because it seemed like wait a second at some point someone's going to figure out better things than this and we are asking people to use this thing that we've built to put the you know their hard work their life's work in some cases on it right like what does it mean to you know integrate into something like hyperman means that you know you're you're kind of using this bit of infrastructure and you hope that it treats you well and you hope that it grows with you and so this ability to absorb you know new models and new advancements as they come up was imperative and so it really should be as simple for the user because as kind of like you know changing uh sometimes I grew up playing a lot of like Nintendo games love the N64 so it's kind of like taking the cartridge out and putting a new one in or just like adding it imagine if you've got an infinite amount of cartridge slots because sometimes you want to use multiple Ones based on the situation so as I said before when you do the second side of the integration right like when you define the receiving logic you say hey look at security module a b and c well now if there's a d that you like better how do you do it you go back to your handle function and you say hey now now let's look at d as well so the moment that these new advancements happen we wrap them in an ism someone wraps them this is actually where like the site this notion of anyone being able to write the uh a new ISM can come in quite handy um and that can kind of be forwarded to the network for other people to use that and what is that what is actually result in if you're already running hyperlink you just point to a different thing but like the assets that you're moving over all the other Integrations you have like everything else just keeps on working um so being able to do that was really important so sorry for the long way to answer but I'm so happy you asked that that's such a it really hits on a lot of things we've been thinking about for the last couple years I mean I I couldn't agree more I think um the I mean Bridge technology will always be great I mean I hope it's always like changing and and you know being upgraded and improved upon and and so if that's the case we need to build infrastructure that can accommodate that um and so it just again makes makes so much sense to me um I have a question that you know we've talked about a little bit uh you know one-on-one but I I think that the audience will also be interested in which is you know I want to put hyperlane in the context of the broader bridging category because you know there's so many bridges out there well I also think the term bridge is is very overloaded you know um because it can it you know it like there it's not like every everything that people call a bridge is really the same thing like you have you have things like you know like like a multi-sig bridge like you know that someone operates or or it could be its own sort of protocol like axillar that acts as this committee that you know attests to the validity of of different um chains um but you also have things like IBC which is not like it's not like a not something that someone operates it's more of like you know a set of functions and standards that different chains can opt into and then you know if they follow that then they can talk to each other and to me I guess hyperlane seems more like so the IBC type of bridge and maybe so maybe you could just like sort of high level see like how you see the bridging landscape and then where where does hyperlane slot into that yeah that is a very good win a very articulate way to frame it I'll start by saying you know I uh I used to and maybe this is dumb but I used to kind of be like it's not a bridge don't call it rage uh and my team wouldn't go um would would very usually get upset with you for that but uh I'll go into why I still think that is the case although I'm less militant about it I would say your diagnosis was very very accurate in the sense that we view hyperlane as uh or I say that we view IBC as our spiritual predecessor in fact like hyperlink came out of an effort of treating IBC as this is to date the best way that we figured out how to do this thing that we want to do what was it the thing that you wanted to do we wanted to let anyone connect any chain um and again by by that point in time IBC clear-cut the best way to do it but we um but where it felt a little bit short was on the any chain part because as I mentioned before it uh it's quite uh rigid in it right like it you know the things that it will uh work with and kind of give you the guarantees that you expect from it uh a limited set of chain and chains and unfortunately while Cosmos is certainly growing it is not the largest ecosystem just yet and so we wanted to take IBC use it as like the you know the starting point that like how do we make this much more extensible so we can enter different environments different ecosystems and so uh what I would say is like you you have things that are just actually just Bridges they are just like focusing on asset transfer and they have different forms inside like I would uh put it put the systems like or describe them by like an axis of how permissioned they are and this generally lends itself to like what I spoke about earlier this tightly coupling of uh product messaging interface and product of security and another axis of what are like the the security guarantees that I can get from this thing and so on like the you know on one far far uh corner you have something like IBC because it is very permissionless and at the same time it can offer uh you know very like very strong security guarantees that don't really require a lot of trust um you then have you would have something like um a more you know committee based Bridge like a a specific and locked in set of validators as being kind of much further out on the permissioned set but as long as those validators are good you might get like you know still really good security guarantees um hyperlane is on that permissionless axis I'd say around that same place of IBC but you want to evaluate like each different module setting as landing on a different place on the other axis of like you know how secure is this really like what am I trusting in the system right because in some cases modules will just be wrapping you know native verification systems which that's amazing where they exist and in some of the modules are going to be as simple as like a multi-sig and at other times the modules are going to be like more optimistic so you'll kind of land in different parts of these axes and maybe you know maybe in that respect that makes this two axis system not a useful way to uh dissect you know where does something like I really lay on the landscape but I'd say like if we're if we're maximalists of anything it's the notion of like anyone should be able to just do this and we don't want to be able to stop anyone and so permissionlessness is the thing we care about uh the most and probably a bit more permissive intended um with different security modules laying in different parts of the uh of the spectrum so um yeah I think just offering the choice is how we kind of reconcile that in some cases you're going to end up with something that can be highly trusted where like it might be you know you might end up on a roll-up where like the thing that's securing the outbound communication from it through hyperlane is genuinely just like a multi-sig controlled by the the people who created that roll up and we think pragmatically that'll be fine for a lot of users for quite some time um and then in other cases like an ism is going to just be like wrapping something like an IBC outbound Channel um so that's kind of how I see that yeah um I think that you know the the permissionless part of this is what's so important because you know as you said in in your presentation and we say this all the time on this this podcast the modular future is one where there's going to be a proliferation of different blockchains and um it's just not going to be possible or you know or desirable for every time every uh someone launches a new roll up they have to actually like go and do business development they get supported so they can actually Bridge assets it needs to work out of the box without them having to like call someone up you know um and that's that's really I think also just a core value of the blockchain ecosystem is like permissionless Innovation and so I I'm really you know glad and aligned with that you know hyperlane believes in that kind of um I'm still happy with that term for missionless Innovation uh it is you know there's actually a whole book I forget that the name of the offer um but this is something that was ingrained in me I'd say more than like I don't know 12 something years ago whenever I started like maturing as you know person in the world I'm turning 33 soon so that that stings a little um but this kind of permissionless innovation sense ever understanding it and hearing about it just became obsessed with it and I think that is really what drew me into crypto in the first place the fact that like just don't have to ask and I guess personally I find that appealing because I never liked asking like even you know uh I was in the IDF for a little bit and I may or may not have spent some time in like Army jail because I don't like asking um and I you know I'm not a big like rule follower as a person and this way of like I can just do stuff in crypto and like I can just use it and I don't have to ask anybody like this is the reason why I think software as a category has just kind of exploded over the last three decades and I think what makes crypto so appealing and so like the idea that we're gonna make it so easy for you to just like spin up a chain but then we're gonna like you know you're gonna do that and now you have to like find some you know large interoperability provider and you're going to have to like basically ask them to come and help you and like what are you doing if they say no and like actually worse than them saying no what do you do if they say if they say nothing right if they just ignore right because you're too small because you're near the crypto equivalent of like two guys in a garage which I guess maybe is like you know to uh two anime pfbs hanging out in like a gather town uh what do you do yeah um well yeah completely agree um to shift gears a little bit uh and start start to wrap up um I'm curious you know just selfishly how you first heard about modular blockchains and how you kind of I don't know got into that frame of mind and and how maybe that also informs some of the design of hyperlane as you said that you take take this sort of like modular like decoupling approach you know uh Sherlock sheer Serendipity so I I happened to go to the school at UC Berkeley and some of the first people I met who were into crypto were all like you know uh some would call them cosmonauts Zaki once made an analogy when talking with me about um how they were all like monks in a monastery and it feels like he didn't say this but to me it feels like that Monastery was dead set in Berkeley California uh and so I got to run into this idea and like they didn't use the same language that I think Celestia uh codified really but the concept they were heralding is like one of app chains and certainly like the construction wasn't as clear that messaging wasn't as clear as it is today but so that kind of planted the seed and like this notion that yeah this you know this like new version of the internet is going to be first a little bit more asynchronous than we think because like the all the internet works in an asynchronous fashion so like that seems not surprising and then that you're gonna have dedicated environments for dedicated applications that also doesn't seem like that crazy right like most companies have like you know their own little racks um and so that's what I first exposed to it and then it just continues a lot of just luck right like at a certain point uh I become friends with another like good uh Cosmonaut and later on we end up working together at Galaxy and they become obsessed with this like paper about this thing called lazy Ledger and you know so like that exposed me to what later became Celestia and like just being in that orbit and just working with you you're like I guess one thing I suffer from is sometimes like having um delusional faith in certain ideas and sometimes it's really worked out right like having that in crypto six seven years it was it was a great great uh outcome for me and in this case as well right like just thinking like wait a second I've seen these people are like they're encrypted for the right reasons they are not going to stop no matter what like they are not flinching that for a second so I'm positive that like not only does this make sense to me based on everything I said before it just like feels like this is gonna sound like but the Vibes were good you know like these were people who were not gonna go anywhere like we didn't go anywhere when crypto sucked a few years ago it sucks again now a little bit like who cares like I'm you're gonna have to drag me out of this industry and it seemed like the people working on this problem were exactly of that same mindset so I was like this feels good that we want to be here yeah you uh I was just smiling and nodding that whole time because uh I could not agree more um I think you know it's really important in crypto to uh I don't know align yourself with the people who are in it for the right reasons and you know who want to use crypto to affect civilization level change and and when that's your motivation it doesn't matter whether it's a bull or bear Market it's like we're gonna build this because we believe that this is what the world needs and um that's just there's just something about that that is so inspiring and when you surround yourself with those kind of people it just it feeds on itself you know and I definitely think Cosmos Community has that I think ethereum Community has that I also think that the the modular Community very much has that and um yeah I I could not agree more so um yeah to close things down uh you know what what's the the long-term vision for hyperlane and also what is the the near-term road map and what can people expect from the hyperlane team in the next you know six months or a year of course that's a lot of fun love to answer that so the long term kind of like vision is we not only so you talked about this civilization level change so to to affect that I think it's imperative that when you're building something you're not just building something that you know first foremost has to be able to grow the the pie of the crypto economy but second can it help accelerate its rate of growth so can we do that for the modular world so [Music] successful accomplishment of like our long-term reason or our North Star is really to grow this modular future of blockchains accelerate and help bring it about and what a result of that will look like is we now have achieved say a four to five digit number of functioning uh Roll-Ups there are you know annually hundreds of billions of transactions flowing between them and I would say more than more than half of them are being secured through some type of hyperlane interchange security module that would be like the long-term reason that we want to realize and the only way that we achieve that is if we fulfill the goal of letting anyone connect any change um that's that's you know that's gonna take a few years that has a lot of other dependencies but uh you know like you said we're kind of here and we're gonna like do this thing we're gonna basically dice Ryan and I'm okay with that and I think this ecosystem kind of self-selects for people who are like that because all the other people are just like you guys are crazy I don't want to be around you that's cool that's fine uh more short term you can anticipate a number of things so first I'd say like you know just keep tabs of what we're doing through either the Twitter account or the Discord we have a really fun Discord it's still uh kind of like a small place and so you can have a lot of fun conversations there with other people building on hyperlink and that's the best way to stay updated but in the imminent future uh watch for hyperlings expansion into new environments um I'd say sometime over the next six months you'll see hyperlane appearing as supportable for sea level the Solana VM affordable for fuel VM and most importantly its appearance as both a cosmos SDK module and a cosmosum set of instructions and so all of that like gets us closer to being able to allow anyone to connect any chain because again like hey if if I can do it in theory but then I actually need to like write the entire interpretation for like a different environment that's kind of tough so we we definitely want to deliver on that and um those are the biggest things that you'll see from us in the near term wow that's a lot of uh expansion I mean the the list that you had there is pretty much you know I would say the majority of every chain out there um so that's that's really exciting and uh yeah I mean people should definitely uh keep tabs on what you guys are doing follow you guys on Twitter hop in on the Discord um John you know thanks for sharing all your knowledge and insight on the bridging problem and also explaining to us more about what what hyperlane does and your vision for permissionless interoperability and modular security I think um you know we started out the episode with that you know as as a phrase and and I really think we we were able to unpack that and really explain uh what that means and why it's so important so uh you know thank you so much for coming on and hopefully people learned a lot thank you it was a pleasure
