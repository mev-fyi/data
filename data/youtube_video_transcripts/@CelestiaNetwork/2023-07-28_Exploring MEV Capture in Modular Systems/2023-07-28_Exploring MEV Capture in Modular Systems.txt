oh okay so I work at Celestia I'm a cordov my name is Evan and I'm here to talk about exploring Mev capture in modular systems and really start a discussion about a few ideas that they already exist if we combine them we can create a very powerful tool and I to be honest I just don't think enough people are talking about it and now before I get any further this has trade-offs everything has trade-offs only siths deal in absolutes so just getting that out of the way the alternative title to this talk was how to make validators cucks and on one sense I'm just being playful but on another sense I'm being very real weirdly real so like the status quo validators is capturing large amounts of value right this is how it works today and this stems from the fact that they have a monopoly over that given block now it is a small Monopoly it is only for one block but sometimes like in the context of a builder it's very important we can have a builder build a block it has three hard emojis that's a lot everyone loves that block but that's not the block that gets committed that's not the canonical block that's because a different Builder found a way to exploit more Mev or do something else and ended up bribing the proposer more so now we picked that block so the proposal is getting most of the money now that's not the end of the world it's not even the worst thing in um ideally like uh the proposer can up the security budget there's it's not even sure that like this is not ideal like all Mev has to get captured somewhere going to the proposer is not the worst place however it would be really nice if it was more programmable if we had a way for l1s and l2s or roll-ups to be more programmable so we also have to consider that with roll-ups this has to be scalable not just in the sense that there's like a thousand different instances of this setup but also in the sense that roll up devs only have so much brain capacity they can't be playing like these 5D chests when they're thinking about these things so shout out to skip if anyone from the skip team is here for pushing The Narrative of sovereign Mev now all I'm trying to say here with Sovereign mov over solving Mev is that there's many different solutions to capturing Mev there's not just one there's many we're picking winners and losers here all right so that decision is between like a community and their God that is not like a decision that you can make for everyone all at once that's at least what I believe so in order to solve this to make Sovereign mov you have to move it on chain because when something's on chain it's programmatic and when something's programmatic it inherently in the context of a blockchain is verifiable so so if we want it to be Sovereign all we have to do is choose to change our binaries by simply switching our binaries right we now have changed how Mev gets captured assuming that we can get it in protocol so in order to do this you have to break the proposer Monopoly this must happen so this is a meme that I stole from Elijah Elijah works at Duality he's done some amazing work in this area of ending the proposal Monopoly and if you recall the first slide right if we don't end the proposal Monopoly then there's always going to be some sort of censorship that they can do in the context of Mev to game the system so we can write whatever clever rules we want on chain but it doesn't really matter because the validator can always or the proposer can always accept a block that gets built to game the system so also shout out to special mechanisms groups a lot of this work is just like repurposing their work uh highly recommend um so we kind of have to think about different things differently instead of building a block and then coming to consensus over it we have to come to consensus over an unbuilt block and then we build it right we we build it using a deterministic function so there's two things necessary here we need to have a way to have for proposers multiple proposers include their input for what they want to be in the next block in the next block Elijah refers to this as Multiplicity so there's many different ways to do this one of the simplest ways or one of the ways that I um keep coming to is just some different flavor of narwhal and or tusk and um that is great because it makes the entire block censorship resistant there's other ways to do this so skip does top of block auctions they already have this implemented if you want to go try some of these ideas out you can literally go do this by building a cosmos chain right now thanks to skip and you have self-assembling blocks so this is the second part the second part is that you need a deterministic function to build a block and you can't just it's very important that the order of the inputs doesn't matter right it's addition it does you can add two numbers in any order and you'll get the same result that's the important part here once we have these things we are now free to Define Mev capture so this is again in the context of l1s at the moment where for the simplest case all we need to find all we need to Define is a less than or equal function of what a bundle is now what's the only thing better than one fire emoji three fire emojis correct so um if we have this if we have this we can do something that's similar to a four Choice rule but now we have a bundle Fork Choice well for so you imagine we have a less than function that's all you need for it to sort now we can now we can sort these transactions or these bundles and if there are any conflicts then we go back to that rule well which one has more fire emojis okay well we're going to pick that one and you can replace fire emojis really with anything but this is has a cost this has trade-offs this is not for every state machine this is not for every blockchain in the context of Celestia there's one thing you can do you can pay for data to be included in the block that's it it's payments this this means that there's basically no conflicts conflicts are incredibly rare so that dramatically that makes it so this it's like a very viable thing to do in Celestia now if you consider other chains like most chains today are like these permissionless Turing complete smart contract platforms that whenever you see a transaction you can't even know what state is accessed until you execute the transaction that's not really like a viable thing you can't just have like a deterministic function not only that is that if you have a lot of like Mev to be exploited then it turns out that you have something that I'm referring to as death by gas auction you just get completely overwhelmed unless you have some sort of private member that's not like a hypothetical that's like a well-tested thing that happens all the time so this is this is like it's very dependent on the chain fortunately for Celestia you can do this so now the proposal Monopoly has been broken we can Define how we want Mev to be captured on the L1 rollups should also be able to easily Define how they capture Mev and they can do this too right the proposal Monopoly is broken we can submit multiple different roll-up blocks as if they were a builder like in PBS to the same Celestia block and now it gets included right and now we can Define similar how do we Define a bundle Fork Choice Rule now we can define a just four Choice rule a normal for Choice rule except for it's completely arbitrary we're used to fork choicefuls with like hash power and stuff right this is just completely arbitrary what does heart means it could mean judging by Twitter sentiment people love to burn tokens I hope we get more creative than that but that is like a perfectly functional thing whoever burns the most roll-up token not the L1 token the roll-up token whoever Burns that that's the canonical block right four Choice rules rule because you can just have anyone build you can make it so that I can have like literally anyone can submit a block Roll-Ups do not have the same issues that l1s have where you have a limited set of block producers roll ups can have however many they want it just has to be defined in your four Choice rule so you can like again like you can this can be very arbitrary Rock beat scissors but the coolest thing about this is that if we ever decide that we want scissors to beat rock all we have to do is change our binaries right we can just do that and in the context of modular blockchains in the context of these uh we have these trust minimize like clients right these light clients are the ones that are verifying the chain the node operators right so they decide like clients decide how this actually operates how Mev gets captured oh and as a side note you know you can decentralize how your rollup gets sequenced just by simply having a four Choice Rule and relying entirely on the consensus of the base layer no big deal shout out to roll kit they're working on this if you really want to get your minds blown talk to a roll kit Dev lastly again not everyone can do this this is extremely limited it's almost requires privacy Tech you can ditch sequences entirely you can just have a bundle for Choice Rule and again and um it will the blocks just build themselves so there are trade-offs this will not work for everything okay so it has increased demand for Block space currently that's DOA it won't work but can we imagine a world where block space is abundant thank you Nick so if you now if block space is abundant this is actually more feasible than we think and increase full node requirements there's no way of getting around that this has increased full node requirements however it's very application specific if it's very dependent upon your fork Choice rule it's very dependent on so many different things so we can build around this if this is a property that we that we want really bad and I mean this doesn't really say anything new but like in order to have good Mev we need more privacy tools and um same thing goes for here so when Mev is defined in protocol and when like clients can verify the protocol right that means that like clients can determine how profits are captured in a system that's pretty crazy right that's pretty that's pretty damn crazy right power changes hands it is no longer just the validators the politicians the technocrats and yes even the token holders who are deciding these things it is like clients they are cucking all of these people okay so that is how I would like to end my talk if you're interested in anything else [Applause]
