hey everybody nice to meet you uh so I'm Agnes um first time public speaking for skip so we'll see how it goes if I crash and burn but uh when I was a kid uh I really like this game Neopets anybody played that before maybe when they were a kid yeah so little game um you know you basically like raise these animals and you did things with them I remember the first time that I tried to play Neopets uh I went home and I just typed in Neopets into my browser and it didn't work right because I missed the www dot and I missed the.com and I was confused I didn't understand like why didn't this thing just work like I went back to my friend I asked like how do you actually put this thing into your browser and then once I learned uh I was like okay I guess I just have to do that that's just what you do right in the internet um and then comes a time like later in your life when you understand the internet right you understand TLS and you understand DNS and understand the name servers and how they all route together you probably get a little bit too lost in the sauce so to say like you you understand it maybe too well but the internet still works right there's still that kid who just does that puts it in and everything just happens um understanding it isn't required for uh you know making the internet work um that is to say uh the internet has great ux right you have you don't have to understand it at all for it to actually work and I'm going to transition that into sort of like IBC which I would argue has ux should be clicking Maybe there we go IBC is ux trust me on it um and I'd say this is sort of the same thing for crypto in general right you really have to understand the tech in order to make it work you have to understand wallets you have to understand the bridging protocol has anybody ever done an IBC transfer by chance and I don't just mean like you know using osmosis which is like easy mode I mean like uh you know sort of like having to put in your channel ID and understand what paths it has to go through and you know basically having to know the underlying protocol in order to actually use it so one of the really really really annoying things about IBC ux is that you have to understand this concept of pathing right so if you want to go from one chain to another chain you uh might not be able to take the most direct route there so for example in this case if you know you want to go from uh Alice's Source uh to Alice's destination you can't go directly there you actually have to unwrap it by going initially through the token origin right and so it's very different than the internet and that you really have to understand the underlying protocol in order to use it properly and it makes sense why it's like this right like you're picking up the security assumptions of each underlying intermediate chain therefore you have to unwind it through those to sort of you know basically have it become the token that it once was so you end up with this situation right where you have all of these IVC genomes all over the place they're all interwoven with each other it's just like look at all those tokens right what are they all doing why are they there I don't need them I don't understand what they are so I love this quote by Chris goes it's uh do you think God stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created it's obviously not an actual crisp grows quote um but it is from Spy Kids and that's sometimes how I feel when you know I'm using IBC so we tried to solve this we tried to make basically what that neopets-like experience is for IBC where you don't have to think about you know the www the TLs the DNS the name servers you just use it right you just use IBC in the way that you want to right so this is that same issue right so if like starting on chain a you want to go to chain D you every path that you go through basically uh will change the token right it's like you and your friend are basically on the you know Upper East Side you want to go to a bar together I take the 4 train you take the six train does different number of stops and you end up as different people and you're just like what's going on um that's essentially what happens to IBC tokens as they Traverse they interchange different paths will actually change the token and that of course does not intuitively make sense and users will lose their funds if they don't follow this right they will end up in a denom that maybe has no liquidity uh and there's no decks and maybe they don't even have the gas token and so basically interchange ux is screwed by all of these different problems and it's true for Cosmos you guys can learn from Cosmos you know we've done many different things and we've screwed up a couple of them but when it comes to the roll-up world it's going to become 10 times worse absolutely because you'll have way more pathing and you'll have way more gas tokens and you expect users to understand all that and have all those gas tokens so basically One does not simply send over IBC you can't just use the protocol you have to use it very specifically how do we fix this well basically we need to do unwinding right so this concept of if I want to go in this case from chain you know B to C I need to First be Unwound through chain a and I can have somebody tell me okay here's a transaction that will actually unwind you through chain a or wherever you need to go automatically so that you end up in the right place and Abstract that into something super easy to use basically you know abstract that into a browser URL so that all the routing all the DNS everything else just happens underneath the hood that's what we've built at skip um basically this is you know somewhat of the structure of the the API the user gives the intent to transfer we send back this multi-hop IVC message oftentimes it does a massive unwinding flow the front end sends sends back the user signed receipt and then they get a success and so all they see on the front end is basically I have my token here on this random chain I don't know how wound it was I wanted to go there and maybe it's even a different token right uh and they just end up with that experience but wait there is more so uh the ideal experience in our minds and this might not be right but this is what we believe is you want to go in the future over IBC from any chain any token to any chain any token and that of course might require a swap right so now you've further complicated this workflow where you're not just routing the same token you actually have to at some point change into a different token and you want to do that in one click right you don't want to have the user have to go to different applications and figure them out and have to use them so you want to just have this sort of all done in one transaction so this also works for the skip API the way that we figured this out was there was some credible middleware Tech that was built inside of IBC called packet forward middleware which allows you to once you get to a chain it will automatically forward it to the next chain and you can chain this together so you have multiple chains in a row and then you use these things called IVC hooks that allow for arbitrary smart contract execution on any intermediate chain so in this case oftentimes it will happen is you know three unwinding flows a swap on osmosis and then more unwinding all-in-one transaction so this is basically what it looks like if anybody's interested in trying it out we built this fun little front end called ibc.fun and it's just what you think it is basically it will show you the different routes and swaps that it's trying to do and then it all completes in one transaction so I don't know if this is going to play um maybe looks like it's not going to play but this is a demo of me actually doing it going from osmosis to a different token and just seeing sort of like how fast it is it went over five different routes which is you know an IBC quite complicated and then you know it all sort of completes extremely quickly so we're trying to figure out these other ux problems that we think Roll-Ups and IBC chains already have right and we we argue that these main ones are these gas token issues where you have to have so many different gas tokens and you know that's like a big ask for the users to have um this concept of sponsored payers so basically you know you can subscribe to a wallet and they'll just figure out some of these issues for you maybe they give you like a gas tank model where you have all your gas in one place and they'll just swap it out into whatever you need um best price Dex aggregation then also instant cross Gene settlement you know there's been a lot of conversations I assume about intense I don't know what they are but some people seem to um and how those might solve ux in the future where you might just be able to give this intent of this massive cross-chain workflow and then a third-party actor might be able to come in solve that intent and you know basically give you whatever you need on the destination uh so if you're interested at all the API is free it's something that we made sort of as a public good um I think it might be technically interesting to just delve into sort of like the reality of IBC and you know what you can do with it um this is a problem that will be true for all bridges this this unwinding and winding Province will be true for hyperlane it will be true for many others and if we want to have a permissionless IBC standard um or permissionless bridging standard we really need to fix these issues right we really need to turn the internet into or when you really need to turn IBC into something like the internet where you don't have to think about all of these different problems you can just you know type in Neopets and that's it thank you so much appreciate it
