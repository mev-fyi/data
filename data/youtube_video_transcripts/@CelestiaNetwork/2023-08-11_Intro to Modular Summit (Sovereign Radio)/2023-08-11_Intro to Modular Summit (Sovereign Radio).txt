welcome to Sovereign radio a short form series that could become longer tailor made for the modular Summit in Paris 2023 this week fair enough shall we all introduce ourselves hey uh I'm Yaz uh the head of Deborah at Celestia I'm Kango and chained the host of the cosmics radio station entertain FM I'm Anna Rose the host of the zero knowledge podcast and for this series I'll be doing two interviews one withinoma and one with Celestia I will be doing five interviews with espresso risk zero hyperlane mantle and LaGrange labs and yes we definitely wanted to have you be part of this video because this was your brainchild maybe you can tell us a little bit about how it came together uh yeah I mean we can start with the Sovereign radio basically I wanted like the killers in the industry when it comes to like you know um important conversation in web 3 whether it's VK modularity sovereignty like in Cosmos and stuff to talk about the modular Summit yeah and like Sovereign radio basically is important exactly half those conversation about modularity because there's a gap there and yeah um it was part of many different things that we're doing for the module this Summit um including different facts that are curated a lot of good swag one of the best Vineyards in pairs um it's going to be really exciting yeah and now I'm curious what your what are you most excited about I'm most excited about pbsa so shout out to Tina from flashbars uh for organizing uh pbsa uh with a lot of interesting talk about proposal Builder separation one of the most important topics in Mev and modularity um I wanted to highlight uh Cox will be by vitalik um and uh there'll be a really interesting panel at the end called the end game which inspired also by vitalik's blog post it will have uh Anatoly from Solana and Mustafa from Celestia and will be moderated by Tribune so I'm really excited about that well I'm I'm selfishly excited for the track that we programmed uh we did the ZK track this time around we have I think six great talks and two panels and I will say I'm most excited for those panels because we're kind of taking this theme of modular modularization and applying it to ZK so we have modularization of CK systems and ZK architecture what about you um I'm interested in seeing how Celestia is going to align all of these bespoke ecosystems so uh but you know this is part of the course right we are talking about modularity and standardizing the whole Stacks so that we could have composable ecosystems not just adapts Within blockchains one one of the things about it is um when they asked us to do the modular Summit this year we wanted to make it modular right so how do you make them similar you have curated cracks so we talked about PBS today CK validator doing CK track we're at The Argus uh hacker house and our this is doing the gaming track as well so we wanted to make it modular and from a coordination point of view it's very fun you know yeah you pulled that up very well yeah what like the this concept of like the modular stack kind of where do you place this in the timeline of blockchain do you see this as the next step is this sort of like a combination of everything we've learned absolutely um I can get more context but you have any thoughts right so I think that that very obviously the third generation of blockchain tech so modular stack is a logical conclu is The Logical conclusion we would end up at given that we have blockchain v0 which is Bitcoin and then blockchain V1 ethereum blockchain V2 which is the Cosmos app chain thesis and then V3 is ultimately the modular stack and I think there's there's legs there's legs to this narrative because we have eigen layer polygon of veil these other chains that are trying to do d a so I don't think it's going away and this is a very important iteration like a step function Improvement for the entire space yeah and for scalability for scalability most importantly because it's the next paradigm shift in blockchain architecture like you were saying when it comes to scalability and also like a veil polygon or bail is giving a talk at the modular Summit on day one um eigen layer is part of the panel panel I'm organizing for um the dev well panel um so yeah we like there's a lot of different solutions for da and the space as a whole benefits because roll up can become really scalable and then we can Target the next six billion users I really absorbed the architecture and the narrative and what's possible I can't unsee the fact that over 90 percent of decentralized apps as we know it are going to be run on their own Roll-Ups I don't think you need to constrain it to be apps on uh Sovereign Roll-Ups I mean sorry apps on generalized rollups but rather they could each have their own Sovereign relive so that's very exciting to me exactly and if you think about it it's better for them because they can capture all their fees that can help sustain your ecosystem rather than giving it to like a roll-up operator where there's a clapping application there so it does create that element of sovereignty so that being said I'd be interested in seeing what vitalik's take on this is if none of that I think it's going yeah I mean here here's what we believe right modularism not maximalism right so we like people say they're you know competitor to celesteo like wait come give a talk you know like we're welcoming everyone because at the end the space wins with modularity we don't really not the Celestia Summit if the modular Summit and that's what's really important for us yeah cool all right so thanks and thank you for watching our video and hope you enjoy the Sovereign radio series thank you
