thanks guys for the intro I'm Matthew Caldera I think we all agree with this thesis blockchains are going modular and basically you know I think the best way to describe modularism is basically making it as easy as possible to build blockchains by abstracting out you know different layers of the staff um let's see this is maybe a little bit of a self-aggrandizing slide you know basically I do think there is like a bit of a you know through line through here you know I was grounded the Bitcoin Arrow most of you were talking about payments you know then people talk about general purpose computation then there was freedom of choice to kind of like choose which you know L1 choose from a small set of l1's you know which one makes the most sense for your application I mean there's modular blockchains again a little self-aggrandizing to have only us on there you know one Indian food Celestia the other da layers which will not be named and eclipse and Skip and everyone else um but you know basically it's like the freedom to really you know change anything you want on any layer of the blockchain um and I think that's super powerful um we'll skip this slide basically you know I've changed everything whatever uh yeah you know app chains people's freedom um you know you can do more whether that's throughput whether that's improving ux via you know certain aspects of customization right changing the gas token of your project moving gas costs entirely you know different levels of gas extraction account extraction um and as well of course as this get folks talked about you know different ways of extracting revenue or giving Revenue back to your community by a you know Mev or Bridge fees or transaction fees or anything like that um also I want to mention here you know permissioning access to the chain I think it's like a little against you know a lot of the ethos of you know a lot of you know kind of Hardcore crypto vaccine folks but I think you know the ability to you know to construct kind of like you know to kind of choose the layer of the level of decentralization you know will bring a lot more kind of like more like centralized web 2.5 actors in the space because it is you know on the whole pragmatically pretty important even if we don't necessarily like a lot of those inclusions um but of course options are just really hard to build um you know and that's not just on the like protocol Level side you know of hiring Engineers using the cosmos SDK you know figuring out how to incorporate tender bits where you know to various offshoots you know your state transition function figure out who's going to validate the chains it's also like a lot of the kind of like standard web to higher level infrastructure pieces you know figuring out who's going to run your notes how you're going to run your notes how you're going to orchestrate them you know those pieces of infrastructure that you know developers tend to expect block explorers indexers developer facing apis the graph all those things and you know the set of those Services is only increasing like you know if you were to go back you know five years ago a lot of people are just you know writing smart contracts and still deploying them now you know a lot of uh you know blockchain apps they have dependencies on the graph or certain centralized indexing services or you know opens up and Defender all these types of things and so you know we want to be able to provide all of those services to help teams make viable blockchains that developers can get certain pieces really quickly uh so yeah this is what we do we uh help people launch op staff optimism based chains um that are fully customizable all across the staff you know they can pick their da layer whether that's posting data natively on ethereum or polygon or whatever EDM chain they choose to settle on or using Celestia we'll cover that up um you know the evict their settlement layer right now we support basically any evm chain um we also you know allow them to make uh you know we allow them to add the infrastructure they need you know block explorers Bridge sdks nft marketplaces Bridge uis a lot of those kind of cable Stakes higher level pieces of infrastructure that applications tend to need um we also allow them to do kind of like node level customization you know whether that's modifying the gas token potentially adding custom evm pre-compiles that sort of thing and the set of you know capabilities we have there is expanded and then deploy you know they can deploy the chain on any as I said any evm compatible you know L1 or L2 and we handle all the dirty work when it comes to devops and orchestrating optimism nodes which is actually a fairly annoying problem uh for teams who are you know building that themselves um yeah again this is kind of salesy uh I will skip most of it basically we are based on the op stack the optimism code base um you know generally I think people have different opinions on this but for now it's probably the most robust open source optimistic role of code base in existence and we you know are really encouraged and excited by all the development that's happening on the op stack including you know face and mantle and you know us and other folks who are going to all contribute Upstream to that we're also live in production now so we can spin up a chain if you're interested in finding you know spitting up a chain for your project come find us after this talk we'd be happy to do that for you um and of course because we're evm compatible we're compatible with all existing developer tooling and I think this is one of the things that sets the op stack part is that it's basically running depth under the hood and so that means you know basically anything that depends on get get interfaces you basically get compatibility there for free um yeah again we are Engineers we're not graphic designers so you can tell um but you know basically we we just we want to be kind of like an all-in-one uh stock especially for like those higher level features apis Json RPC nodes sdks clock explorers you know interfaces for common utilities and as well we want to support those like Channel customizations as well uh yeah I think this is the last slide uh yeah we're working introduction with a lot of a lot of teams both on like the gaming side uh also on like the D5 side and also kind of more experimental gaming infrastructure on chain ctfs that sort of thing um so yeah uh we don't have a slide for this but um flux come find us if you're interested in launching a robot if you're interested in playing around with the test that Caldera roll-up and also we are hiring we recently just closed around hiring across systems product you know engineering roles and also just general growth and Design happy to answer any questions questions [Applause] um question from the balcony who are you uh partnering with with the onshine CTF uh that is waterfall Okay cool so yeah they're building that and we've you know we've been helping them you know do a lot of stuff on chain so they're currently using out some test net hoping to go to Mainland pretty soon any more okay so it's very much of a business-like question but how do you guys think make money that's a great question you know so actually currently some of these folks are paying us with a SAS model okay and so like I think there are some nice things about that like it allows us to you know kind of like align incentives or like you know it's it's kind of what you get what you what it says on the kid right like they pay a fixed amount you can have slas especially with how robots are architected right now that sort of stuff is really important that being said like we are it's certainly not settled internally and we might be thinking about other models one of the things we're like really try to prioritize is making this accessible for like hackathon teams and small developers to just like launch their own thing and so having like an Enterprise sales process is like the opposite of what you should do when you want to do that so we're gonna we're trying to find some model that you know makes the most sense um with regards to like tokens I think is like kind of the implicit question yeah I mean it's like an interesting question I think like infrastructure tokens have had like a mixed mixed you know sort of success rate what we don't want to do is like we don't want to for example like you know bolt on a token onto that and run like a pair of chain auction type of deal which like you know removes a lot of the kind of like benefits you have with running rollouts in the first place so tokens not totally settled for us um but if it is we'll do something that makes sense and you know stays true to you though have a lot smaller developers use the time yeah I have a lot of questions but one of them is um so Yuri is specifically uh it seems or I guess I didn't realize this but I thought you guys were only settling on ethereum but you're also settling that polygon is there a reason why you're choosing settled Roll-Ups versus yeah yeah that's a really good question I think part of it is just you know it comes down to like preference of Builders um and so like we don't take like a super strong chance on this either way the one thing we found is that um number one like a lot of teams they want that trust minimize bridge between the L2 and some base chain a lot of times you know the folks we're working with they don't want to necessarily be positioning themselves as a completely separate new chain they want to be able to position themselves as like you know we're still on this ecosystem that like made our app or like the you know they're strongly tied with the community of but they still want to kind of get the benefits of running the app chain um you know at the end of the day I think like you know we're talking to some other folks for who it doesn't really matter that much um and so there I think you know a lot of it just came down to us you know liking the op stack wanting to build with that and sort of you know wanting to help other people on top of that as well but we don't have like a super strong philosophical you know opposition toward software machines and I think it's mostly just kind of comes down to the user or somebody else had a question uh um what like what features do you think that we stack is clearly missing what would you wish that they would build like yeah well I mean this answer right I mean I'm confident they're gonna get to it eventually um or hopefully sooner rather than later I think you know that's the thing and you know that okay desperately needs um and as well like you know we would much rather there be fraud proofs because then we're not you know relied upon for security right and so we'd rather be able to use that and that would be super I think there are like a lot of other kind of uh products you can call the product level uh features that the op stack could use you know things like account extraction it's in really high demand we're probably just gonna build that ourselves um you know basic like gas abstraction being able to use other tokens for gas you know that's something that we needed to build in that that we support that I you know as far as I know currently the obstac at least when we built the future so like a lot of things like that uh also I think there are some things that are kind of against optimism's ethos that pragmatically some projects might want so like permissioning on the sequencer you know white listing on the bridge those are features that we can support for certain use cases and I don't think the options you know really be super excited to build out we have one more question do you guys um run the sequencer for those rollers by default yes we allow the projects to launch I have to run them themselves like we're happy to provide like a Docker container a terraform of configs you know basically made that as low effort as possible for them to do so um but you know we found for a lot of the the teams that we talked to like I think a lot of teams in web 3 they have like they know how to write some more contracts they know how to write like UI interfaces that interact with smart contracts and there's like a big hole in their team when it comes to like devops and infrastructure and Cloud especially about around like a lot of application you know level teams and so a lot of them just prefer to let us run and follow up to you guys have any regulatory problems because of that not currently this is why I mean I I think like we see like optimism and arbitrum and like you know all these all the other like general purpose Roll-Ups that have a lot more volume a lot more different use cases than we do like has kind of the canary in the coal mine like we think those will be the ones that are you know will be regulated first but obviously with like the recent kind of like you know enforcement action and everything that the SEC is doing like decentralized sequencing is one of those things that we're super interested in it's one of those things that we'd rather not build ourselves and so we're really happy there's like Austria and like a lot of you know other teams working on this problem all right cool thank you [Applause]
