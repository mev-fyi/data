thanks thanks for joining us guys I'm uh Waltz I'm an investor at Galaxy um we've got a panel talking about applications in Cosmos the over under on this guy taking that off is 20 minutes so you can place your bets in the back with but uh um to kick things off I'm gonna let everyone kind of introduce themselves what they're what they're focused on within the cosmos ecosystem or adjacent to it and kind of talk about um applications that they see today um that their ecosystems are focused on but also um have already built and then um kind of who they are as well so if you want to go ahead and kick it off uh hey I'm Dan Lynch uh founder of cosmology we're building the Adobe for web3 meaning we have a suite of products for the interchain and which our products are actually becoming the standard we're probably powering uh it's hard to give exact numbers but probably about 80 percent of all the front-end applications in the cosmos everything from low level encoding to wall interfaces all the top projects like osmosis do idx Juno and stargaze are using our tooling for everything and essentially our focus is really on just minimizing the gap between intention and execution helping developers execute their ideas a big fan of what you're doing um so I'm Elena I'm a co-founder of noble noble is a native asset issuance chain in the cosmos ecosystem we're bringing native usdc to Cosmos and also other stable coins and working with acid is Shores one-on-one to really enable that um on-ramp into the ecosystem so happy to be here hi I'm Albert I'm the co-founder and CTO of injective labs which is the development company behind injective the layer one blockchain so injective is a blockchain built around Finance focusing on defy at our core we offer a high performance on-chain fully on chain decentralized order book based exchange for spot perps Futures and binary options and have a whole host of other G5 applications and now we are looking into integrating with rollups to bring svm and evm compatibility as well Cosmos uh hello my name is I'm in charge of the head of partnership at the Crescent Crescent is the one of the spinal project by the B Harvest uh Crescent is the order book thanks I ordered a book Heidelberg Tech so we are supporting old Trend old Swap and transaction and D5 defy D5 protocol transaction and we want to build a nice to meet you and and last but not least I'm Deborah CTO co-founder bear chains evm compatible one built using Cosmos oh do I not have my mic on is it not working yeah I have a mic in I'm good oh is it good it's ridiculous but it's good um so yeah to kind of start again yeah uh bear chain evm compatible alone on Cosmos um what we did is we replaced proof of stake with what we want proof of liquidity it's the extension of delegated proof of stake that like aligns validators with providing liquidity on the chain and makes it so that uh the act of providing liquidity is what's basically giving you network ownership in addition to that we've also built out Polaris which is an evm framework that allows for True native EDM equivalents that's interoperable with Cosmos IBC and all of all that fun stuff and super super excited to be here to talk about Cosmos applications yeah and just super quick because I think we missed it if you could just say like where your protocol or project is at is it live is it on testnet so just starting back with you going quickly through uh yeah we're we're live uh we're currently powering uh stuff on osmosis Geno stargaze dydx I think they're using our tools but they're probably not launched yet the new Cosmos version as well as a ton of other projects so yeah we have about eight different products all live uh worshipers uh yeah so we have a mainnet uh with a validator set that is a hub uh validator set so it's a subset of the Hub um and we will be transitioning to Interchange Security in a few months yeah injective has been on mainnet since 2021 so about two years now so croissant have been launched since last year and it's been a year and a half and for the Harvest we're running a market maker and r d Center and toss as well so all of all of our Protocols are on mainnet will be entering testnet throughout Q3 and we have multiple teams starting to integrate Polaris into their devnets as well great so kind of um I think for the audience we're probably you know we're all at a crypto conference so we're all pretty familiar but um just kind of interested in hearing different perspectives you know we have like a general purpose chain we have a couple versions of like interchange security or or applied um some sort of like restaking or shared security and then um somebody touches almost every Every Chain in Cosmos so um and kind of like your words and we'll start with uh Dev bear who's working on something a little bit more general purpose where do you kind of see application design and Cosmos being different and and why is it different or if it's not different um why do you think there's such an emphasis on like application sovereignty and kind of like a tight coupling with consensus and the other pieces in the stack yeah I think having an app chain it's really interesting because it does give you that solverty as you mentioned right it allows you to Define your own rules it allows you to find how you want to build your your application not only at an application layer but in an infrastructure layer as well um and a big part of what allows for that is the ux the dead ux of Cosmos you know the ability to take something that's complicated like a blockchain you know bring it down into things that are simple to understand like modules and really break things apart I think has done a really really good job of that additionally I think what's a really cool interesting thing is the concept of like app chains that are built on top of VMS as well so things like op staff where they're like okay you know you can launch your app chain et cetera et cetera and write all your things in solidity which is like a framework that um that you know people know how to use really well and that's part of why we build Polaris as well as we see that you know we want people to build app chains we think app chains definitely the future but we want to make them more accessible to devs who maybe don't know go or arrest and feel that sometimes having a virtual machine is the way to go and we can just bring it back this way well I think like option concept is pretty interesting because I'm very new in Cosmos ecosystem uh I know customers has a like pretty long history but I was I work at channeling for of almost three years and I moved to here last year so it's pretty interesting so all the application on top of those app chain can fully enjoy the customer customization so it can pretty uh friendly for the protocol level so for example on the ethereum basis like it's really hard to use a fast fast transaction like the order book need a fast transaction but it can it has a challenge on the ethereum but on the absent we can customize it and we can use all the different the module so it's pretty interesting for the protocol and the apps level I think some one new area that injective has been thinking as an app chain as a solver math chain has been with regards to Roll-Ups um and you know mainly Roll-Ups you might see on more established layer ones like ethereum where you cannot make protocol level changes so it's restrictive to what you can do but something that we've been you know thinking through is like what if you could have for example a more of an enshrined roll-up where um and the reason for for doing so is to have more Atomic composability where suppose like each of the validators that of the injective blockchain were also part of the uh sequencer Network then they could just you know submit the the header and State Route data information to injective and for example that could allow for um bypassing a fraudproof window right and allow for more Atomic composability but you know these sorts of protocol level changes you would never be able to make be able to make on something like ethereum because you know it's just ossified and it would take years for anything as radical as that to to be to have to occur but you have this flexibility right alternatively you could also explore things like energy security um so if you want to use instead of roll up have you know something like a fork of fmos or parachain to have evm capability you can do so so there's a lot bigger design space that you can experiment with and you know that that's I I would say at all layers of the stack right and with people like skip you can do things like prioritize mempools you can with inject it for example you can use ethereum accounts you can support metamask So at all layers of the stack you have uh flexibility and um that you know really allows for chains to differentiate themselves and find a unique value proposition to offer to end users eventually yeah I mean I think for Noble we like love we Leverage The Cosmos SDK quite a lot and I mean there's all these modules that you know make a lot of sense uh you know for for Noble's use case and so we really leverage a lot of the open source sort of you know modules that teams like osmosis have built when it comes to things like token Factory or even things on the protocol side like you know the packet forward middleware so just really leveraging the open source kind of Primitives that exist is like why we think it's really easy to build in Cosmos to be honest I think that um the cosmos represents like the flagship representation of the third generation of blockchain if you look at the first generation of blockchain which is digital money like store value couldn't do much with it so we fixed that by creating the second uh generation of blockchain which is like ethereum and programmability and so the third generation represents interoperability um kind of like horizontal sharding where you can create your own app chain and customize things what's also interesting is it also opens up a whole new design space a lot of the tools in ethereum are very monochromatic because everything is just built on one chain and there's sort of you know one library for sort of interacting with everything Cosmos is very unique because now we have to actually look at all these different changes all their customizations and still try to come up with tooling to create these cohesive ways of working with their functionalities so that's actually really interesting challenge for us that we've also solved with you know compilers and transpilers um and and so it's actually really fun working with all the chains and helping them expose all these unique different unique features but then creating like a unified way to access them so I really love the cosmos and whatever's building yeah so I I think it'd be interesting to get everyone's kind of perspective um you know ethereum's 2015 Cosmos is 2017 really 2019 and uh right around 2019 you know ethereum kind of transitions away from plasma and starts thinking about optimistic scaling with Roll-Ups and then even kind of looking into the future with validity Roll-Ups so how do you I mean injective you've mentioned it you've also mentioned kind of this transition from money to programmability to kind of the cosmos third vision of like an internet um scale type system so how do you guys kind of see um Roll-Ups within this framework do you think it's all compatible or very differentiated so you can you can start um I've definitely heard some people talking about creating IBC connections to layer twos I will admit I'm not the expert and roll up so I'll pass it but I will say that I have heard some uh interoperable uh support well we're really excited to kind of you know connect with the role of ecosystem especially obviously with the Celestia ecosystem from from like what is currently kind of the status quo it is not a solved kind of question of like how you bring IBC to Roll-Ups but you know bridging protocols like hyperlane and kind of other examples are trying to you know solve for that so um I don't know if that like answers your question but I think that at the end of the day like IBC as this kind of standardized interoperable kind of you know protocol for you know permissionless like message passing you know at least for Cosmos like kind of bulls or whatever like that's what we see as the future of this you know message passing across different different layer ones and layer twos right now it's like not the case yet other than I guess poke it out to Cosmos but um you know I think we'll get there eventually yeah I would say there's a lot of engineering work involved here particularly um you know for IVC you have to currently wait for the fraud proof window to pass which in the case of you know ethereum is seven days so obviously these windows can be shorter but that really hampers composability especially from developers or users and Cosmos expecting instant finality because that's how it currently is you don't want to you know set back uh you don't you don't have to make that trade-off right so I think that's why as I mentioned before we're exploring ways to have more Atomic composability and the design space is quite quite large as a as an app chain because you don't you're not restrained by you know existing consensus roles or protocols that you have to follow um but yeah I will say that injective is still quite early here but we are partnering with um you know espresso and systems and many others to figure this out yeah actually like in 2019 and only of 2020 2020 it's like IBC and Cosmos is quite vague and it's pretty early to for me so I don't know what they're doing and what what they will going to build but after they launched the IPC and I ICA stuff I pretty understand what it is and it's pretty simple and easy to the retail not only for the retail user but also the developers so like thanks to the IBC like a lot of the developers a lot of the retail users doesn't need to worry about the bridge bridge risk and Bridge issue like recently like except the IBC a lot of the fridge they have a they still suffering from the rich Bridge risk so if we can utilize like IVC concept or ICA or old Christmas spaces uh technology that we can solve a lot of problem I think it's pretty good to good to start and with the modularity and intensifying the modularity technology we can break we can break through all the challenges I guess yeah I think at the end of the day like speaking about it specifically from like a roll-up context is is an interesting lens because at the end of the day I think it's important that people have the scalability and have the tools to build applications that they want and we can talk about like what's the best scaling mechanism is it roll ups is it things like ICS but at the end of the day like people who are building applications just want to build applications um you know people that are building with you know react for people that are building with Django they don't really you know care what they're using to get the job done it's just the fact that it works for their use case and I think we need to think about the descalability and these bridging solutions kind of in the same way where you know if I'm an application I need access to these other applications or to liquidity or something of the sort and like what's the easiest and lowest cost way to get that for them yeah I mean I think it comes down to like the path of least resistance and like what is like the most optimal path from getting from point A to point B and I think in Cosmos we see that like really simply with IBC and doing a token transfer like I mean it used to be kind of hard like when IBC first launched in 2020 I like I remember being like what what is going on like you know how do I like do like a manual token transfer like in Kepler with like the dev mode the developer mode story but um that has like greatly improved in terms of like the user experience in the past like I guess three three and a half years um you know things like automatic routing things like pack and forward middleware things like what skip is doing to just make it super straightforward to get from point A to point B without having to like do a million swaps in between which like used to be the case not quite a million but you got my point yeah so kind of coming from the sidelines I think um obviously developers love kind of like being in Cosmos land like it's very friendly it's great documentation there's a lot of things that you can kind of plug and play and and build how you want but um crypto broadly but also specifically Cosmos has struggled with adoption it's everything's pretty prone to like you know the financial cycle but um what are kind of the applications and also the changes to the stack whether it's ux custody something what are the kind of the next steps in the next you know six months to close out the year and then going into the future that makes you really excited both on the application side and then on kind of the user experience friction side uh yeah well I mean the way the way I see this is that um you rewind about a year ago and to build an application in the cosmos you know first it would have taken you you know between three to seven days to connect a wallet um and you'd have to manually write all your encoders um so this is something where you know you're you're trying to build an app you have this great idea but you get lost in the weeds with all these you know complexities around things that as a developer let's say you're trying to build the user interface and you're trying to create that user experience that will onboard these non-technical people or these lay people from The Real World into crypto um but but in reality the type of Technology skill set required was like a senior engineer that understood blockchain so after cosmology um came out of the scene we basically abstracted all that so we can minimize that distance to where now you have your ID you can actually build it and this is actually quite new we've you know only recently kind of gone through the full stacked where you know if you have a cosmos chain and or a cosmos smart contract all of the front end tooling can now be completely automated so they were kind of fighting this impedance for like the past you know year or a couple years now to where the user experience has greatly suffered because the developer experience has suffered so now that we've fixed that developer experience and provided you know a streamlined workflow for developers to the point where if you're a junior web 2 react UI developer you don't have to know anything about blockchain now to start building dapps inside of the cosmos so I think then we can bring in open the floodgates to all the web 2 developers who now have all these great ideas and they can build something and I think that's how we can create beautiful user experiences to have mass adoption yeah I mean I'll talk about it from like the perspective like a you know just like your average user and then I'll talk about it from like Noble's perspective but you know from the perspective of an average user I think it's you know a lot of what Dan just said like you know I think me is that uh my profile or kind of my Persona or my user Persona is pretty good you know I know pretty basic like HTML it's a markdown I can like read a little bit of go I like no logic but like I can't like you know fully code adapt but there's all these tools all of these like really like seamless ways of like interacting with like the cosmo stack so I mean this is kind of like back in the day this isn't necessarily a thing that is around anymore maybe I'm wrong but things like starport with like you know a couple lines of code you can like you know create your own Cosmos blockchain this is a tool that um the ignite team built a couple years ago so just making like extremely user friendly making Kepler you know um kind of more versatile making all these like different integration points just accessible uh Obviously good documentation I mean these are all things that um you know need to drive our ecosystem forward and I think we're getting uh lot better at it and I'm quite optimistic so that's like more on like on the user side just you know on your like Saturday night like what am I gonna do I'll kind of play with starport like why not um but then you know more like mainstream kind of like what's going to bring like you know thousands of people to you know it you know the next thousand people to injective or to osmosis or to you know all of these app chains um you know I I talk a lot a lot about this it is liquidity it is like the institutions it is actually partnering with them and being able to speak their language and actually being able to advocate for Cosmos like standards and the cosmos stack and like going through the motions of like explaining like what is IBC like you know what is middleware like in this IPC world you know how how do you know how do you mint how do you burn like what are the standards for you know things like acid issue and switches obviously what like noble was focused on so um you know in terms of like the application itself um you know I'm very excited and proud of what we're doing with with Noble and you know bringing native usdc to the ecosystem and uh just really making sure that Noble can serve all of the other um you know app chains that need this you know liquidity need these like you know more institutional focused um actors to kind of come in and feel comfortable with the ecosystem not to put you on the spot do you but do you see like other asset types for Noble down the line and and what does that kind of look like yeah I mean we're very focused on stable coins and we see like you know these Fiat collateralized stable coins as um having huge like real world like use cases and like one of the things that motivates like a lot of our team is Real World Adoption and I think we've seen uscc really do well in this space and so really we you know stable coins are like a big part of it and really just being an ambassador for that asset issuer within the space so you know not competing on D5 not competing as a Dex being just saying we are here to propagate your asset as far and wide as possible and making sure we have the right integration points and we can have people actually use it properly and not have these like concerns so um you know stable coins wrapped assets you know rwas we'll see where the world takes us yeah in terms of you know the next wave of adoption I think there's two things here to look at uh one is that there have to be sufficiently compelling opportunities and products for people to use um on chain that are are better or think that they cannot find in in trotify or C5 um and and two that we have to have infrastructure and tooling that can enable um a lot more experimentations a lot more shots on goal to do that I think the work that you know Dan does for example at cosmology is great um but even it's at all layers right it's from the RPC stack it's from even in Cosmos like the kinds of applications like making the bar Lower you know it's quite challenging for people to learn not only rust but you know Cosmos and all these Cosmos Concepts in order to just build a simple application right so expanding the even at the Virtual Machine level like allowing for evm and svm um and and having good composability with that is really important um yeah and I I think also that like bringing real real world assets um is very valuable here um usdc as an example but also you know on-chain treasuries and and the initial promise of defy right like if like I I just talked to a protocol I forgot their name um you know you can as a user right now Buy treasuries in your shop account sure that's great but you know this protocol was trying to do you know treasuries plus you sell like a straddle so you can juice your yield further and it's it's that sort of thing so instead of earning five percent you can earn eight percent ten percent right that's you know one example of you know how D5 can can offer more compelling opportunities yes maybe it's not as crazy as it was in D5 summer but it's it's these sorts of experimentations that we have to enable at a much larger scale if you want to have a chance I think at um greater mass adoption uh I think when it comes to the mass adoption the most important thing is we need to make it easy from the protocol level like for example when they think about the sushi sushi swaps like beginning they just add one code and one function from the unisa so it's really easy to make an easy to deploy to another Pro DF but on the Coast Music System they need to operate and they need to concern about how they can support the chain security so it is a very tricky part of the cosmos obtain perspective so not only for the running a like a protocol and DF they need but also they need to concern about how they can secure the chain security and how they can make a ballot their own validator set so it is a real tricky part but thanks to the Celestia so we can easily use their their module and their layer so they don't need to worry about the bootstrapping their own validator set on security or data availability so we can you utilize that kind of product very well and not as well as the Saga Saga Saga they support the app chain a lot so they can reduce the burden of the running a new app chain so thanks to this kind of the new protocol I think uh Mass adoption will be coming very soon yeah to get a talent I think a little bit of what every everyone said um you know obviously bias here is definitely coming from the ethereum ecosystem but seeing how easy it is for um people to deploy solidity and Viper Smart contracts on in that ecosystem and in retrospect or in in comparison to like cosmosm you know you need you need to be like a senior engineer to deploy a cosmosom deck but you know my 12 year old cousin can build solidity depths and you know send tokens to his friends and it's really easy so I think getting it more more simple at the end of the day right like people don't want to have to worry about maintaining a validator set people don't worry want to worry about like learning rust or having to learn new tools they just want to be able to reuse things that maybe Legacy and maybe old you know as you mentioned ethereum 2015 it's approaching you know almost a decade old at this point um but in in that sense it's kind of reached somewhat of the JavaScript Legacy where you know when people who are maybe doing a coding Boot Camp or people who are self-taught get into computer science like they quite often more than not get into JavaScript because it's easy it's you know start making fun things they can see their progress if they're building a little web app or a little node.js app or react app or whatever and that's kind of how I see solidity is that you know you can you know clone soul mate deploy a little token and it just kind of works right so it's really friendly and makes it really easy to onboard not only experience devs who are building crazy protocols with off-ching components and stuff but the next generation of Builders as well who you know maybe still in high school or Elementary School I just want to make a comment I'd completely agree um in general I think it's not a technology problem it's a people problem and um you're right like rust is a very difficult language and Cosmos is actually based on Rust and if you look at things uh languages like typescript there are millions and millions of developers uh so if there's a way to like open those floodgates to bring those folks into writing smart contracts that's like a huge uh lower uh barrier of Entry um actually I don't know if you guys know this but cosmology while we've mostly been focused on front end technology recently acquired the Taren one team and we actually have a compiler to Cosmos and that actually has a very sort of hybrid uh rust to end typescript like language is very simple makes the semantics of the smart contracts into the syntax so it's actually very simple and our goal with uh our Cosmos compiler is to actually onboard a lot of these you know Python and typescript developers that I see those languages as languages of the people and so that's a big part of our strategy to onboard more developers from web 2 into web 3. so kind of to wrap things up here do you guys want to each outside of the you know the project you're associated with uh what's one application you think represents kind of the cosmos coupling of consensus and application and kind of creating something unique really really well and what's something that could be within your you know your Project's ecosystem or it could be outside of it but still in Cosmos that you're really excited for and think could be a potential Catalyst or kind of um bring in more adoption I I don't remember preparing for this you put me on the spot I'm just kidding in terms of projects uh I think um the bad kids nft collection is pretty awesome uh because it's like super unique and like well at first I was kind of into the punks and all these other things because you know I was looking at ethereum for inspiration it took me a while to realize it but like the bad kids are so unique um I know it's not actually like a you know like a project that's powered by developers but you know the stargaze team did uh build the nft marketplace um you know and and I'm really excited about uh bad kids and just like kind of like the um you know what Joe was talking about with you know the art world uh yesterday to osmo con I just found like really inspiring to think about um and I'm really excited about kind of you know catalyzing more of a creative artistic uh Creations by just you know giving more tools so people can actually execute their ideas I think it's been so technically difficult to build things that as we lower the bar um just just giving creators what they need to do and and what they what they want to build so that's about it yeah I mean I'm having a hard time coming up with like one one example like you know I don't want to just say like one name and then have that kind of like you know live forever yeah um you know so what I'm excited about is actually like the components coming together so these different projects coming together and actually like powering something very meaningful so to you know to dance like point about nfts um we'll have a little bit more to share about this in a couple weeks but you know being able to buy you know and if a bad kid on stargaze one click with usdc um you know that's not possible right now there was a bit of like a Twitter kind of viral thing that happened a few weeks ago where a bunch of ethereum people wanted to buy a bad kid um they didn't know how they were like what are stars like what is this nonsense um well you'll you very soon uh it'll be abstracted away and it'll actually be very easy within your wallet to one click buy an nft with something like usdc or maybe even another currency so um things like this are just really exciting and I think will make people realize like how powerful like the cosmo seek system really is yeah I'm excited quite about the layer two work that we're doing with eclipse and also espresso actually having a decentralized sequence sequencer Network um and yeah having it in production with IBC as well so there's a lot to figure out there for interoperability and atomicity but I think these are solvable problems and it's just a matter of actually you know doing it so yeah um I think the link is taking protocol improve a lot of user experience I guess like from from the capital efficiency perspective like most of the crypto people they don't care about the capital efficiency and the risk management management they're not good at this kind of stuff but uh things to leak is taking protocol user can experience and the user can understand what is the capital efficiency otherwise the better better choice to invest and what is the risk management so I think it would be it was a great use case it was a great application for the user experience of about the D5 protocol and yeah and for the upcoming protocol but not the new protocol but I I heard that I don't want to speak the specific protocol's name but I heard that some protocol and some of app chain they're preparing The Interchange Curry Oracle right now so actually Cosmos ecosystem we don't have any specific Oracle protocol so we need it definitely also I like using your interchange query is very very important to the entire Cosmos ecosystem because we are like using IPC can make a delay so entertain query would be ideal so I'm looking for the and I'm very excited about the new Oracle protocol yeah a lot of what we're focusing on is figuring out ways to take existing ethereum things and bring them into Cosmos and onboard those users in a way that's really easy for instance one of the things we're working on with the guys at skip is a Road Extension based Oracle that will tie into bear chain to provide to provide pricing and those pricing will be exposed to the evm Via an interface that's identical to chain link right so we're trying to find ways to onboard users and bring users from other chains from the evm ecosystem into the cosmos ecosystem through things that they're familiar with you know when you have to reinvent the wheel when you add friction when you you know force people to learn what pack32 is when you force people to learn what cosmosum is it can add that friction but I think what kind of the in the angle that we're really approaching is like okay you know bear chain is an evm chain how do we you know bring evm users that's kind of you know it's very familiar to them et cetera and over time they'll still realize oh you know what's this IBC pre-compile you guys have oh what's this what's this and you onboard them into Cosmos in a way where they don't even realize they're being onboarded because they just see it as an evm chain that's something that should we're familiar with great thank you um we have about three minutes for any audience questions um it could be for a specific project or more generally otherwise we can wrap it up so any questions I think everyone's just building Cosmos applications so they don't have any questions well thanks guys um we'll stick around after if you want to grab contacts for anyone but thank you very much for joining us thank you thanks ABC
