today we have a workshop on all clear which is a role of a service platform that allows people to deploy application tailored rollups the agenda for today is basically five we'll have five things to discuss today one is we'll talk about a little bit about all Flair what we do and how we help people especially those who want to build application table roll-ups uh we'll show you a quick demo and you can play that to that as well so show you how to deploy a roll up using our dashboard that we have you do not try to write even a single line of code you still be able to have a role of that you could customize in all sorts of ways and we'll be deploying a fully on chain game called 2048 some of you might be familiar with this game it was developed long time back I think 10 years ago and uh it's developed in a web 2 context but uh what you're going to do is to deploy that on on this roll up we'll have maybe five minutes of gameplay for that for you to experience uh what happens when you deploy such a game uh on on a roll up and then we'll have about five minutes of q a if you have any questions so very quickly uh you know we all love uh every single General purposely out there including ethereum you know optimism and whatnot but they're not very they're not ideal I mean they're ideal for people who want to deploy quickly because all you have to do is to write your contract build a front end and then oh you're good to go however um when you are looking for uh you know sort of driving a huge number of transaction volume in a short span of time uh the we have seen that general purpose chains are not very ideal because they start you start to see a gas gas force and gas issues very soon and so it's a good idea to sometimes go and build application specific chains and in particular we're talking about application specific rollups and we have been building uh application specific roles for a while now even before uh op stack orbit from orbit or or some of the other sdks are out there with a thing and so um you could go to dashboard or technology this is one that's actually uh currently in production but we won't be playing with this today but we'll have a staging version where you can mess things around uh but you it basically offers a platform which is a no code framework where you can go and deploy a roll up you could customize your roll ups and you don't have to write any code for that so basically tax as a wrapper around some of the sdks that are out there in the market today uh why would you use something like outliers roll up a service because one is you can experiment so if you're thinking about building a fully Unchained game and you feel like if I put this on chain game on uh existing general purpose chain out there then it might create gas or like or gas issues for everyone so you want something that's easy to experiment with where you can deploy quickly and most importantly do not want to waste time uh and spend time on kind of putting out all the infra which includes for example your sequences your RPC endpoints explorers and so on so everything gets offered as a managed service for you so that you can focus on game development and building that and not worry about any of the uh tertiary things that comes by that the two types of Roll-Ups that we offer one that we call that's the persistent roll up so consider this as an instance of optimism arbitrum uh for your specific application you could customize it it in all sorts of ways the second one is a female roll up so these are Roll-Ups that you can spin up and you can host your application on that role of for as long as you want when you feel like you're done with it you don't need that anymore you can take it down and so it's ideal for applications that require a block space but for a short pf9 only so ideal for you know kind of mini games or games that you like Dark Forest that you spin up on you play for a while but you don't need that for a long term uh you could do you could use for example flashlight for games for nft mint events so you'd host for example your mint event on this roll up and when you all your nfts have been sold out or you have air dropped all your nfts you take that infrastructure down and when that happens all the assets including nfts or tokens that you had on the roll-off will be settled back on the base Sheen and this way you get all the benefits of an app specific infrastructure but also the benefits that comes from a general purpose here for example liquidity and and and composability um so I've skipped this one um yeah the main thing is that uh when the assets go back on the base chain you enjoy uh you know all the benefits that you would miss on if you're only on an app chain as I mentioned earlier it's a chain that exists there forever and you can use that for longer term applications like game five social five those sort of things uh yeah I've been talking to quite a few people out there uh mostly building games and they have come to us and they have they requested over time that we'd love to it's great that you manage uh the sequencers and RPC endpoints for us but it'd be good if we could run these sequences ourselves or we could Outsource this uh to our decentralized community and so we are kind of transitioning from Earth layer 1.0 to 2.0 model where it will be much more open and permissionless so if you wanted to say let's say I want to have five sequences and you want these sequences to be run by your company members that's uh that's possible that'd be possible to do so um this is kind of how it works today and by the way all the role of a service provider they work in the model on top so you basically have either an SDK like op stack or you have uh something like uh you know front end on top of that and from there you can go and deploy different types of Roll-Ups and you can use different uh DNA layers or supplement layers and I have um you know for proofability proofs and what's happening right now is we're moving from this architecture to more like this where you would have a layer that we call Beacon lay which is kind of like an interlayer between your roll up and the base chain or the based GLA and that acts as a network where you can find sequencers and it basically allows uh people to uh kind of provide some Marketplace for sequences but also other uh you know node providers for example if you launch different types of roll ups and you want interoperability across those roll ups this Beacon layer can be Network that that does it so basically it will state it will check the state of the roll up on one side and it allows uh the sequences to process transactions on the other side of the rollover uh we have been doing quite a few things um people have been playing with our flashlight and personal Ops in all sorts of ways so we hosted a dark Forest several times in the past and every single time we did it we had about 200k transactions on that roll up uh it has been used for all sorts of mint events uh you know both airdrop style mint events or free mints but also paid main events and so it's interesting to see how people are using this in in gaming and FD context uh the only ecosystem is expanding quite a bit so uh we're starting with uh you know supporting different types of role of sdks so if you are a fan of Celestia's uh uh you know SDK in terms of launching server and roll ups you could do that as well uh we are also in the process of integrating op stack arbitrum orbit and if you wanted some sort of a you don't like let's say the validating Bridge because it may come from come with a long withdrawal period you could go and pick external interoperability solution providers like hyperlane as well that allows you to have a much more modular and open infrastructure for interoperability and we have been working with a lot of game companies that are building uh using the stack that we provide uh one of the most interesting one is this company called double jump Tokyo they are game uh Studio based out of Japan with some of the biggest IPS uh you know in gaming for example Pac-Man some of the old school style games and they are building and using our stack uh for their game based Gene uh now so now we'll move to show you a quick demo of how this dashboard looks like and what you can do with it so if you want to play around with it here's a QR code you can you can scan it and then um you could go and play with the dashboard actually you know take over yeah sure how to switch if I don't drag it was still showing this room okay so yeah so everyone can just log into the dashboard so today for today demo right we are using this staging dashboard as I'm ready to show you right you can just log in where these uh sdg dashboard dot art dot technology and uh inside a right you have multiple I mean tiers to choose I received restarting trial free trial and started here and the developer tier so um like for the first row right like they are sort of the same it's the way for you to quickly spin off a flash layer so you can deploy contract on this flash layer and once the event your event right empty your game is done so you can call the protocol to basically roll up the states back to the settlement there and then the depth here is something we are finishing um like a few months ago is basically provide you uh multi-sequencer evm and wasm compatible roll up with flow proof and the same same here right you can select your settlement layer and either on ethereum beam Vision or even like polygon and some other Jewel apps like linear and for the settlement layer later I will show you and then as you can see right we also have the the multiple this functionality for you like manage your flash layer you can just terminate them or like sort of show the status and then we at the same time we are also providing the IDE so it's easier for you to directly deploy your contract into the ruler which you just spin off and then you can call this contract uh the cool part that we also have in Target GPT so you can you can sort of just like describe what kind of uh lo2 you want or the dollar you want and Define the fractionary name and uh and the the cool Paradise you uh and then it will generate the sort of the specs for your roll up and then you can spin off where this one I assuming you can also ask him to change the name to module or to something like that it will also like sort of how to change the name automatically using the GPT same thing you can also use it to generate a contract and deploy a contract on your dedicated L2 um yeah beyond that I I will just uh quickly show you you how to run something like a starter tier January one so if you really want to have a try as as I mentioned I I you can just ask for the promo code and once you have a promo code you can just type in the promote code and this is sort of like configurations you can have um so we have right now we have three modes one is the fair sequencing it's the first account for the serve second one is the gas list there's zero gas so you don't really need to pay any gas it's mainly for games and FTS which they want to onboard as many users as possible without any gas and beyond that we also have the normal blockchain gas or option right so um hair guys you can get a higher chance to have your transaction included into the block same thing here right you can just Define your uh like sort of flash layer name and also you can change like sort of gas limit and block time I mean we are also the native symbol or token you want and yeah and beyond that uh you can you can also have your native balance but before we incorporate the force Explorer into it after that you can just create button and create this flash layer typical it only takes a for two minutes for you to spin off a flash layer we can just wait for a while and then see how it works uh yeah beyond that I as I mentioned right we also have something very cool and you can also try out we call like sort of this divertier um the the cool Paradise so basically um when you choose a longer time uh element the the cool part of that right I as I can show you next uh is it's it's basically it provides you more or um like some type of modes to choose like you can choose the number nodes and for this one we have a native Bridge Incorporated and also you need to like select your settlement layer like ethereum uh let's use uh sepolia and by default because we are providing this fraud proof right so you need to uh select like sort of the checkpoint value and also challenge period for example longer challenge then you don't need really need to regularly post the data too frequently and beyond that you can you can also config like a native token symbol and all things uh yeah for this one we can also just clear button and quickly uh duplicate yeah for this one we need to define a new name it should be okay um because we have the proof system for this one right so you need to really uh uh deposit like sort of the tokens uh for the uh for posting the data to the L1 uh or the da layer so in that case we need to deposit some tokens there and uh yeah so beyond that right as as as we can see so um wait a second uh as I'm remissioning right we are decentralized protocol and there's also layer called Beacon layer to help us to um coordinate all the different Road apps in that case we also need to register on these layers we just deployed something like this yeah so once the uh once once this uh um is sort of the the deposit is done right so the network will automatically spin off the image transaction should be okay now takes a little bit time to confirm in the transaction on the superior test net and then yeah so we can just wait for it and I think our uh sort of flash layer one is already done right as you can see like typical it takes uh one or two minutes and so what you can see right you already have the four set so you can really uh deposit um I mean to get some faucet tokens if you want people to use your roll up right at the same time there's also block Explorer for you to use and yeah for this one as you can see right it's very straightforward and you can either use a free tier you can use a starter tier yourself and just spin off um and then like there's another one we set it up uh like yesterday this call linear this one is adapt here so uh it probably takes more time because we need automatically deploy the contracts for this one you can see right we also have the bridge ready so you can just Bridge the tokens from the uh from the I sort of settlement layer to your own to your own life to own L2 the one you just set it up for this one I'm not sure whether I have tokens let me check yeah once I moved to see Paul yeah for this one you need uh like sort of things is connected to the uh linear test that uh yeah connect to the linear test side you need some Tesla tokens and then you can basically Bridge down to your own like sort of roll up and later you can also withdraw um yeah but for the wtri uh there's a better Explorer as you can see um like you can check all the transactions and the contracts user deployed um yeah this sort of the current dashboard and we have and for all the developers uh you you can just use your own like sort of a single sound like Google right login to it and then you can launch uh whatever uh sort of uh self-defined um relapse yourself either it's for Flash layer or it's for a persistent roll up you want yeah if anyone you um I want to have a try it can can just contact us um beyond that right as Armory mentioned um because we're building our own test deck so we put a lot of efforts on improving the performance for dedicated like these show Labs so in that case we have this as a dimension right we have the multi-sequencer system with uh flow proof so uh it's quite decentralized and also secure right at the same time we also made the performance as as fast as possible so one example we provide all the infrastructure we provide for our gaming Partners is this uh fully like uh game optimized your labs and this is just one example as 2048. uh everyone can just use your mobile phone or your laptop you can just use your mobile phone to open this social link is 2049 and um let me show you give me some time it is slow read the way again yeah so you can quickly uh like go to it right so the thing is uh the the rule for this game is very simple so you can swap uh left to right up and down uh once you have the same uh once you have the tiles with the same number and then you can merge them for example two two right you can merge them into a larger number like double A and then um and then the goal that you basically combine as many details as possible to quickly reach uh the number 2048 so the cool part that as you can see right we can quickly uh like uh if you are using laptop you can quickly use your keyboard left the right time and app down and quickly switch it and and basically it will for every move it's a one transaction on the roller so that's a really cool part so it's a fully answering game and it's super super fast so basically you can you you couldn't see any latency right it's a regularly some Network issue but anyway this is something we we provide for our gaming Partners so we achieve this latency less than 100 milliseconds so you can build whatever um it's a fully answering game as you want you don't need to change your code it's a fully VM compatible you can just deploy your solid contract but at the same time that I show you right so you can really enjoy the super fast execution provided by our test stack um yeah you can just have a try um as as I just show you why it's it's quite smooth and every basic every move is a transaction on chain so you can just click you can see the transaction here so um so that's sort of like um on our side right we see we've made we made a lot of progress on the performance of the execution layer so previously if we want to build some fully launching game right we have to wait for a lot of time for example there's a constant block time two seconds or even 15 seconds so in that case right you really couldn't build I mean um that's not a freelancing game providing for web 2 users so in that case no web to user really want to use metamask click click and whip for another few seconds right for one move but here since we are having this game focused your lab or this test stack so you can just quickly you can quickly like sort of run it and and basically all the users can enjoy this low latency or almost no latency for launching game experience yeah so everyone can just have a try either have a try this uh game or just have a try our Soto dashboard yeah U1 okay I'll try to close off um thank you so um the game that yaochi showed it's uh it's uh as I said it's a fully Unchained game uh it might seem very simple because uh the moves that you're making are basically four moves so you are you can either go up down left or right but this is the uh contract that corresponds to the the on-chain game logic so it's uh well you have um uh starting from the storage part you have basically when the game has ended you are just a simple Boolean uh you have the owner so basically every single game is a new instance within this map so you when you start you are one of the owners so basically a player in the system and this uh scores keeps track of which player has Harmony how much score and you have this board which basically this four by four tile Associated to each single each single player and then um mostly after that you just have you start this is when you start you basically create a new um you know a tile for a board for the player and you assign the person who started the game to be the sender to be the owner of the style and then you initiate with some randomness and then you have these moves going up uh moves going down up so this is down you will have a left and right which is basically the mathematical thing which is basically if you move the all the slides move until they hit um the next style and if two trials have the same number and they're close to each other they will add up so that's kind of what the logic here is and then um lastly yeah these are some of the basic uh functions to get the board and scores and so on so one cool thing I mean one this contract basically there are two ways of implementing this contract where you could have one contract per player so basically when you start a new game you get a new contract but in this one it basically combines all the contracts and all the boats into one single contract so you basically keeps track of all the different users that might be playing at the same time so this allows you to for example to run a competition or tournament if you wanted because now you have one single contract tracking here taking tracking every single game instance out there um yeah that's that's mostly it um you know we'll put back the slide in case you want to have um sorry oops yeah and if you have any more questions or any questions afterwards we'll be around or if you could go just go check on the talks page and this is the link for the game thank you very much [Applause]
