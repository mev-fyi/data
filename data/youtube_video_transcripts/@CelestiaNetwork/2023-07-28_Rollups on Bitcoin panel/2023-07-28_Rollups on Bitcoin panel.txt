all right so I don't know has there been a lot of panels about Bitcoin or any talks about Bitcoin so far at this conference so has anyone seen any Bitcoin talks not specifically about Bitcoin uh so Sunny uh I want to go to you first uh I saw that you wrote a completely insane tweet a couple of weeks ago um I want to give you a chance to elaborate on that um and you feel free to introduce introduce yourself also um you wrote that proof of stake was a mistake could you was that a joke or is that something that you um it was a little bit of a uh just in a moment of frustration I guess but uh it was mostly just around like I was frustrated with like staking derivatives at the time where I just saw that like we built or like how these like stating converters Protocols are evolving is we're effectively turning our systems into proof of authority systems and because like the staking derivative providers are just basically hand selecting the validators and I was like you know we spend so much time designing like security mechanisms into proof of stake and like slashing and like making sure like there's bonding programs like we've just like undid all of them and it's like there's what is especially frustrating was like the fact that the core protocol developers are pushing these things and it's like wait why did we spend all that time on proof of stake we should have if we wanted to we could have probably just built a proof of authority system into the protocol like actually maybe have token holders use governance to vote in uh validators and stuff like that so I think that was like the main point I was trying to get across no I think it's super interesting um because we have in crypto um lots of proof-of-stake systems and we have the largest cryptocurrency is Bitcoin and uses proof of work and I don't think that any one of us can for sure know how the economics of these proof of stake systems are going to end up and how these centralization due to staking derivatives are going to impact these systems so even though like you can approve a stake as your preference uh you can think it's much better than proof of work but it it's kind of it's kind of nice that there's a proof of work system there is there that we can use as a backup plan if there turns out to be some issues with with the proof of stake um I think though like at least when I and look to myself if I think about Bitcoin and I think about how is that system going to reach like Mass adoption or scale it feels like the Bitcoin Community to today have significantly tied themselves to the Mast of the lightning Network so the lightning network was invented by in a white paper in 2015 by Taj driver and Joseph poon um that basically connects a bunch of payment channels together and leverage that system to Route payments across the network and I was I was listening to a podcast with David Marcus from um who worked who was the president of PayPal previously and then worked for Libra for a while and now has a company called light spark where they are trying to make lightning work and one of the things that he said is that in light spark they have a functionality called light spark predict which uses AI in order to figure out how you predict which path you should try in in lightning to make a payment and I would kind of I would kind of say that if you're if your payment system requires AI in order to just find a pass that you can send the payment that's not necessarily this doesn't sound like a functioning payment system um so I want to maybe maybe we'll um is there is there anyone here that sort of has a do you see if necessarily a future for lightning or do you think that there's if we want Bitcoin to work do you think that there is actually a good reason if we want to take the biggest cryptocurrency out there we want to make it usable for payments is there a reason to perhaps explore other layer 2 Technologies on top of Bitcoin I I will uh yeah have an opinion about that so I think I think lightning and payment channels generally speaking makes sense for high throughput kind of use cases fast um you know gives you fast really fast High throughput payments and I think it would be good for payments that the whole world doesn't need to know about because like with any blockchain whether it's a layer one blockchain or a roll up you kind of have to tell everybody in the network about this payment and they have to store it forever and so for payments like maybe machine to machine payments or other kinds of micropayments something like lightning or payment channels specific you know generally speaking I think maybe makes more sense for that kind of use case um but yeah it still remains to be seen what that model really gets product Market fit for I agree with that especially because I don't know like about lightning technical problems and like the um the progress on that too well but definitely when we're talking about in the context of Roll-Ups on bitcoin at the end of the day Bitcoin has a maximum of four megabyte data throughput every 10 minutes and there's a limit of even if you use leveraging a rollup there's a limit of like number of transactions you can compress squeeze into that as a result of that lightning definitely serves a pretty interesting purpose especially in the case of Bitcoin payments are the original use case for cryptocurrency it's the least speculative proposed use case for cryptocurrency and payment channels have some amazing properties they can be extremely low cost they are good as finalized instantly as soon as you receive it you don't even have to wait for a block time even though in ethereum and the rest of the blockchain scaling research has sort of started to focus on things like Roll-Ups now and we sort of Left Behind payment channels those properties are lost on Roll-Ups and it's certainly worth trying to make the technology work if we can to get them back to be fair if you can scale data throughput to the levels that um your payment like payment Network can like Leverage it really well and we know that we can scale data quite well in a way that we can't scale execution so we can still have similar throughput like systems with data scaled da layers ba layers like Celestia but especially in the case of like Bitcoin you just can't have to you just can't do that so Sunny uh do you care about Bitcoin at all these days is it something that I mean I know that you work in the cosmos ecosystem and like is there a sort of a Vibe um in that Community that's you know Bitcoin is a lost cause or are there actually people that care about improving Bitcoin and coming up with solutions to improve the system and how do you feel about it personally so for me personally I like spend a lot of time thinking about Bitcoin I still you know I got into Cosmos because I wanted to build the app layer for Bitcoin I was like you know what I was working at consensus for a little bit and I was like ah they're doing all this like this all this ethereum stuff is cool but like what is this Easter coin and like we got to build for Bitcoin and you know Bitcoin is an app chain I was like oh okay good this is simple like we're gonna do payments and issuance here but then you know blockchain was the one who came up with the idea of side chains and that's never really shipped it right and like I just saw Cosmos was the like place where people were actually building side chains and app chains and like so okay we're gonna issue Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain and then the BTC asset is going to flow off into the causeless ecosystem and be the money of this like ecosystem and so that's kind of you know five years ago that's how I got into Cosmos then you know got busy with shipping and building all the product and stuff but now I think it's time for like I really I personally really want to show shift Cosmos back towards that like original Mission that was there for a lot of us and so I I really do think that like the ethereum ecosystem like it it has this like base money and it has this like huge ecosystem applications around it I do think that the cosmos ecosystem has the second biggest ecosystem of applications but we lack a base money and I do think that this is like if I I do think the future of Cosmos is to figure out how to bring Bitcoin and be and and build this like application ecosystem around Bitcoin that's where we've been working with like uh we're working with oxlar to build like a a property centralized Bitcoin bridge that like Bridges not just Bitcoin but it will Bridge ordinals a little Bridge brz20s um we're talking with the light spark people about making so you can Bridge via lightning and stuff so I do think that that I personally think that Bitcoin is the future of Cosmos obviously causes a very decentralized distributed group of people um in communities so different people have different views though I love that answer is it possible that I could get you to where um a Bitcoin Builder have 100 percent thank you thank you so we we used to have a culture of like Innovation and and fun and building in Bitcoin I know John do you wanna you wanna wear one too I gladly accept I I think like honestly the whole ordinals thing was really exciting to me not because of like the technology behind it it's not that like crazy or anything but just the fact that I like brought this like renewed excitement to the Bitcoin Community again and like I think it's the first time in years I've seen bitcoiners be excited about things and I think it's just restarted this conversation that like I I can reasonably see that at some point in the next two years we're going to see more soft Forks into Bitcoin get new protocol upgrades which I just I I'll admit I did lose faith in like this the rate of development on bitcoin core in the last couple years and I do feel this like sort of renewed excitement and like cultural shift in the community honestly the big part thanks to like the work that you and Judy have been doing yeah I've heard a lot of people say that there's like a sort of a Renaissance of building culture coming back back to bitcoin and one of the reasons that I want to talk about Bitcoin roll up specif specifically here is because we have this like massive modular ecosystem now where there's executioner environments and there's proof systems and there's all these different tools that's being massively invested in innovated upon that like if Bitcoin can just tap into all that Innovation and try to bring some of that home then we could sort of LeapFrog the Bitcoin space several years into the future so on the topic of Bitcoin roll up I think it's maybe it's a good idea to sort of give a lay of the land so that people understand uh our rollups on bitcoin even possible so we've had this conversation in different formats and different podcasts like 15 times so I think we can just summarize it super quickly um so in Bitcoin what what you can't do for example is that if you have one transaction that says x equals five in another transaction you can't multiply that value by two so X becomes ten Bitcoin doesn't have like State and and variables and values in that sense the only thing that Bitcoin has is unspent transaction outputs so when you what you can do in Bitcoin you see you can reference an on-spend transaction output you can combine it with a script and now you have a new on-spin transaction output but you can't really reference other variables in Bitcoin so you can't really build like a roll up on Bitcoin today but what you can do with Bitcoin so for example we put jpegs on bitcoin so that means that Bitcoin works as a data availability layer um all you need in order to build a sovereign roll up on a blockchain is that you need some space to put that data blob so in the context that we're talking here it's uh initially we're talking about using Bitcoin as a data availability layer in sort of the modularity sense we can build Sovereign robots from that and then there is this whole body of discussion around okay what upgrades would be necessary at the Bitcoin base layer in order to enable Roll-Ups and then I think the um the consensus it that we would need some some way to sort of store State on the Bitcoin chain either through a covenant construction or something else and then we would need a way to validate the fraud proof or a validity proof so we need we would need like in Bitcoin right now for example you can't look at the Merkle root and verify that a value belongs in that Merkle root you also can't validate a your knowledge proof you can own Bitcoin is like a super primitive calculator you can only do like add two values together and you can't even store that value anywhere but you can use it as a data availability layer so we're going to talk a little bit about Sovereign Roll-Ups so for those of you who don't know the difference between a sovereign roll-up and a real roll up like arbitrum or Stark net or optimism it's basically that The Sovereign roll-up doesn't have a bridge between the layer 1 system and their layer 2 system uh maybe we shouldn't even use those uh layer numbers anymore I think that the modular space trying to move away from that but you basically can't Bridge Bitcoin trustlessly into the second layer the Bitcoin asset and Bridge it back but you can use Bitcoin as a data availability system to store um a bunch of transactions and execute the state from that uh and and create expressive layers on top of Bitcoin basically so um if we put ourselves in the situation that okay we think that Roll-Ups on bitcoin are interesting and the first step to get there is to build a sovereign roll up and then build some type of bridge some trusted or crypto economic Bridge into that second layer uh how so I think it's more interesting than going back to the conversation like how is it possible to build Bitcoin rollups it's more interesting to talk about okay giving given the tools and applications that are out there today if you if I gave you like a challenge and I said okay well by the end of this year we need to have a first Sovereign rule up on bitcoin how should we how would you if you have that like as your mission right now that's what you have to do and you will get fired if you don't deliver on that um how would you what would you what tools would you leverage from the sort of the existing domain uh uh of modularity or or whatever in crypto in order to reach that goal we can sort of start here and then make our way to the end of the end of the row uh okay perfect uh to start I want to de-emphasize the idea of real Roll-Ups versus solver Roll-Ups solvent Roll-Ups just don't need a smart contract or any execution at the base layer to verify your fraud proof or your validity proof but that only means that uh at the start without like verifying that bridge it doesn't have like it doesn't have that bridge however the security guarantees of a smart contract roll up and a solvent roll up are the same we just create a proof of the sort that we read all the data from the base layer and we processed all the transactions correctly um later on these uh like solver Roll-Ups can also have Bridges so you can still derive all of the Bitcoin security and build an application on top of it and the only thing that you would be lacking is the ability to bridge Bitcoin and to be fair that's a big like that's a big missing Point um so yeah [Music] um about the stack that I would use to build a solver roll upon Bitcoin I'm extremely biased we at Sovereign Labs we work on Sovereign SDK um so there's already that are already teams working on a Bitcoin adapter to make Sovereign SDK build rollups Deployable to bitcoin and so I would definitely go with that and I would choose our ZK option we provide both optimistic Roll-Ups and ZK Roll-Ups using ZK single round fuel proofs or ZK ZK Brewing everything but I would go with ZK because the block times on bitcoin are quite long so you don't take the full advantage of being an optimistic rollup so you guys are already you already are working with a team that is building an adapter to leverage Bitcoin as a data availability layer correct so maybe to you Connor um perhaps you could give a little bit of an intro to what rolekit is and I think that you are you also working on a similar similar problem uh yeah roll Kit's also a SDK for provisioning Sovereign Roll-Ups it's it's meant to be quite customizable you can put in any kind of virtual machine that is compatible with the ABCI interface which should be any VM you could conceive of because it's a very flexible interface uh roll kit also wants to support all different kinds of proving systems we have fraud proofs for Cosmos SDK already we hope to add different kinds of ZK proving schemes as well um and also we have a integration into Bitcoin already we we developed a implementation of The Da interface for the Bitcoin Taproot witness that was done by Javed Khan on my team who should be here and unfortunately couldn't make it but we miss them um and as for design considerations for a sovereign roll-up on bitcoin what features would you want what token would you use what kind of VM would you pick ideally you would use Bitcoin I think bitcoiners want to use Bitcoin I don't think they want any coins uh but you can't trustlessly do Bitcoin up to a sovereign roll up like we talked about so would they accept some sort of trusted bridge I'm not sure if the answer is yes then that's what you should do you should have some sort of trusted Bridge or ecosystem of trusted Bridges to get Bitcoin up there so that they can use the money that they believe in if they don't want to trust a bridge or a committee to attest to those Bridge transactions then you've got to make sure the token on The Sovereign Roll Up is something that aligns with Bitcoin do something without a pre-mine do something without insiders maybe even airdrop it to the Bitcoin utxo set when you launch the roll up for features there's a bunch of things you could do you could add payment channels you could give a lightning Network to this thing and it would have more capacity to open and settle those channels than Bitcoin does because I think it has more block space with the four megabyte Tap Root witness that's enormous that's bigger than this it's not bigger than a Celestial block I can't remember but it's pretty huge you can do a lot on there you can add privacy to it you could add a zcash style privacy that Bitcoin base layer doesn't have uh and it would have the security of Bitcoin a sovereign roll-up is basically an app chain but with the with close to the full security of whatever it's deployed on so I just I just want to stop here for a brief second and reflect over the fact that there are two modular Builders here that have already built hooks into the Bitcoin protocol to start leveraging that as a data bank so all that stuff that is happening like out there in the ethereum world in the cosmos world in the modular world because we have these hooks into the Bitcoin base layer as a data storage all of that stuff can start creeping back in to uh the Bitcoin ecosystem now so like Bitcoin Builders they're gonna have to um you know they're gonna get challenged by this whole other ecosystem that has been practicing and building applications for these layers for years now um do you guys sunny and light do you guys see any risks with that is there is it maybe in bitcoin's best interest to just stay as pure and as far away from all that staking derivatives and the Mev and um serial knowledge proofs and complex math like is it is there a risk that as we bring the Innovation that has happened sort of outside the Bitcoin space that we also bring with us the issues I I think the point is that like you keep the Bitcoin core chain like as simple as possible uh there's a few upgrades I would like to see mostly around making bridging a little bit more trustless but beyond that I think like all all this stuff like should be experimented with at the edges on on these like new chains yeah from from the research that I've seen um Mev tends to be um stay on the layer that the transactions are actually where the transactions are actually executed so if you have like Roll-Ups on bitcoin the sequencers might be capturing Mev but there is uh not a really opportunity for the Bitcoin miners to get involved in that um you know directly like as the mining Network um and so I'm not too worried about Mev in the context of either Sovereign Roll-Ups or even like Layer Two Roll-Ups on bitcoin um and like sunny I think the changes that we want to make to bitcoin um would be relatively minimal just to enable like trustless bridging um and then beyond that I think that the application design space that is opened up by rollups is um huge and and would be really valuable to bitcoin whether it's more private transactions like Conor was talking about or um you know whether the focus is on scalability because you can do like massive like witness aggregation into zero knowledge proofs um and get transactions down to like you know just uh like a dozen bytes or so um which would be huge for um throughput and improving scaling um so I'm not too worried about it um in terms of like your original question about the stack um I think you know what these guys are building is it would be a really great foundation for like a sovereign roll-up I also think that there are interesting possibilities that are opening up like if we don't have trustless layer 2 Bitcoins uh or Bitcoin Bridges we do have things like crypto economic Bridges like what um threshold network is built or nomec which is a a Bitcoin sidechain in the cosmos ecosystem once you can get Bitcoin onto let's say nomec you can use IBC to connect Bitcoin to any other Cosmos chain and so you could either you know build like a modular system there um where you know you move Bitcoin into the cosmos and then you could use you know Celestia as the data availability layer um to have an even more you know High throughput chain on top of that so I think there are a lot of possibilities that are either already here or like just around the corner like as these systems start to mature so suddenly I saw that you were nodding a lot is there is there any connection between this and sort of IB is there a way to connect IBC to bitcoin using a roll up um yeah I mean I mean I thought about like what what IBC on bitcoin look like and really the point of IBC is to bring the trust assumptions of your Bridge as close to the trust assumptions of your consensus protocol as possible and I think I don't know I think the direction that that I'm most interested in right now is mostly around Drive chains I think it's basically like you know it I think Drive chains are the proof of work equivalent of IBC where it's saying hey let the bridge be operated by instead of the validators of the appreciation but let it be operated by the miners of your proof of work system yeah we I know that we have at least three fans of Drive chance uh on this panel um so I want to talk about something uh slightly different which is the that the um I've at least made an observation that if you look at the roll-up space in the ethereum world these days you see that for example uh uh optimism has the op stack and ZK sync came out recently with a ZK stack and at the FCC events darknet announced the starknet stack I think what is basically happening is that these different Roll-Ups that um accessed on ethereum today are trying to modular modularize their specific Stacks so that other builders can deploy app chains and other instances of the same roll up which we have seen with example for with binance launching BNB op stack and coinbase launching base which is built on built on opstack and I think that the reason that these teams are doing that is because they want other builders to sort of use their tools so that everything that they built everything that coinbase builds on base everything that binance builds on on this BNB obstacle chain will become compatible with sort of the Mother Ship so everything that happens there optimism will just be able to integrate with no friction at all so I'm thinking that is that is that is that is that a trend that you guys have seen also that these sort of Stacks are emerging and is that maybe something that we could leverage for Bitcoin like could we do something like uh taking op stack and putting it on bitcoin to could we take ZK stack and putting it on bitcoin could we take the start net stack and putting it on bitcoin and how would that is that like a direct uh like orthogonal thing compared to what you guys are building with these sdks that are building solvent roll ups on bitcoin or are there synergies here like could you take ZK stack and then use roll kit to put the data into Bitcoin or how do how would how could you take like a stack like that that I think May emerge as really powerful software Frameworks could we leverage those with with the types of tools that you guys are building um so you can totally take these stacks and modify them to work on bitcoin the key part is roll kit and Sovereign SDK is inherently being built to be like for Sovereign Roll-Ups to start and then you can add Bridges to them and that makes it really easy to integrate into Bitcoin because we're just using Bitcoin as a pure data ability layer with optimism even with the Integrations op stack even with Integrations they did to Celestia so far ethereum is the settlement layer and then Celestia is like the data layer they still require that smart contract interaction so to derive full Bitcoin security would not be possible at least like unless they do heavy modifications to the op stack in a way that might currently might introduce like security vulnerabilities because they're trying to stay as close to get as possible but over long term it's definitely possible but they need to get out of the smart contract roll-up framework um I'm gonna I'm actually like personally like a little bit less interested on like using Bitcoin as a data availability layer for everything it's like I I see the Bitcoin proof of work is actually a really good data availability system because what it does is you put data on there and miners are incentivized to broadcast it as widely and as quickly as possible because they want as many people mining on top of their block as possible so it's really good as this like incentivized Fast propagation layer but also as this like hard time stamping layer and I think like using trying to put all your it we're trying to put all your data onto Bitcoin is to me at least right now seems like not a good use of like Bitcoin block space and resources but I think putting the types of data that you want the sort of hard time stamping for is what's more important so um I I'm an advisor to Babylon and what what they're doing is like say like hey okay what can we actually benefit from putting on here why don't we put our proof of stake blockheaders on here and that way we get this like strong time stamping system and we basically make it so we can by putting proof of stake block headers on there you basically can solve these like long-range attacks that you get in proof of stake get the best of both worlds off proof of stake with proof of work um and I think like being a little bit more smarter of what kind of data like what I think different data availability Solutions have different benefits and like being smart about what type of data you put where it and so yeah block headers I think that belongs on bitcoin putting your entire block data and I don't see the point yeah Bitcoin ordering is is very valuable to people we've had uh Stacks which is this thing that checkpoints its blocks onto Bitcoin and Babylon which is doing something similar and uh when role could announce the Bitcoin Sovereign roll-ups a lot of people were confused on what the difference is and the difference is roll kit puts the full blocks in the witness but kind of you know what's the point of that uh it's it's not not so clear data availability is talked about a lot in regards to roll-ups um Sovereign and settles where there's an on or off-chain like client where you have a commitment to the results of the state transition and some sort of proof that it's correct and then you want to verify somehow that the data is available and if you can verify that a lot of data is available without needing to download all of it then it can be described as very scalable uh you Bitcoin doesn't have sampling so if you want to verify data availability for Bitcoin you have to download the whole block that's the whole four megabytes so it's not like Celestia where you can verify the whole block is available with only some small samples of it um so there's a good argument that it's really the ordering that we care about and not necessarily the data availability and I like what you said previously Connor that um if we're TR if we wanted to build a roll-up system and natively for bitcoiners for the Bitcoin ecosystem like maybe you would try to do this even without introducing a new token so are there other considerations like if you were to build specifically for the Bitcoin ecosystem um are there particular use cases that would maybe be more interesting to build for bitcoiners like are there perhaps something on the Privacy side but maybe there are some things that doesn't have all that negative connotations that some bitcoiners are worried about like what are some if we had if we had let's say we had an execution environment today that had expressiveness that was Secure uh was either had the full data on bitcoin or had some of the data but was basically secured by Bitcoin and used the Bitcoin native asset what would be some interesting use cases for that if we start with you John while assuming a good trusted bridge for BTC um I think the use cases that are already popular on bitcoin just being able to do those maybe in a more scalable way um so like a lightning Channel management roll up where opening closing rebalancing your lightning channels is like super cheap that could be interesting privacy is also a I think a significant pain point for Bitcoin users like if you've ever you know tried to make your Bitcoin private there's like these guides on the internet that are like 10 pages long and if you screw up any of the steps then every all of your work is for nothing um and so you know having like a zero cash you know just easy button for privacy that just encrypts all your transactions I think would be pretty useful and then can't underestimate I think the utility of Bitcoin D5 it's it's a pretty big use case I think over one percent of the Bitcoin Supply is being traded or lent or borrowed against you know on different chains and so yeah just doing that in a way that where you also get the full double spend security of Bitcoin through the you know Bitcoin da slash you know settlement layer I think um could be useful to a lot of people what about like a a Bitcoin backed stable coin like uh USD that's backed by Bitcoin do you think that could be something that would be interesting to bitcoiners yeah I I uh I think it could be because right now the stable coins that bitcoiners have to use are like Fiat stable coins you know backed by money in a bank somewhere so if we could if we could actually use stable coins that are backed by Bitcoin in a smart contract instead I think that would be better like we actually built one of uh you can kind of consider it like a proof of concept of this on the rusoc side chains The Sovereign dollar um it's a Bitcoin back stable coin and that's that's with over collateralization right over collateralization we're not getting into like a Terra Luna situation with us where it's going to end up with billions of Bitcoins getting sold because there's an algorithmic Peg that sort of detaches yeah yeah it's over collateralized there's like efficient liquidation mechanism so it always stays you know over collateralized um at least that's the design right like there could be a flash crash and maybe Black Swan event but um yeah it's it's not like a partially backed stable coin it's a fully over collateralized stable coin but being able to do that on a chain that you know gets the full double spend security of Bitcoin unlike roostock today which has its own independent security budget can be reorged like independently of Bitcoin you know I think it it brings that kind of um utility in a more I think Bitcoin native way um totally but also to be fair in any like yes these little roll ups will introduce general purpose programming to bitcoin like using Bitcoin security and I think the Bitcoin crowd as I've seen at Bitcoin Miami is extremely excited for that but at the same time since bridging Bitcoin will definitely introduce new trust assumptions um any Bitcoin back stablecoin will definitely not have the um attractive attractiveness as like it would have had without any trust assumptions for sure um I think what's more like a bit more interesting like something that like excites me is that an unsolving roll up since you're reading the whole data space of like Bitcoin and applying rules from there you could also read into like usdt transactions and represent usdt trustlessly on the solver rollup itself and introduce liquidity in that way and build a defy ecosystem um I'll be a little a little bit contrarian maybe we shouldn't do a general purpose VM maybe you just want in Shrine defy so that way you can avoid smart contract bugs the fear of smart contract bugs uh the upgrade authorities that people introduce as Central points of failure to deal with those bugs and have something that's more Bitcoin aligned and without all the things that cause bitcoiners to push back so hard against defy on ethereum that's such a great point I actually wish that we had spent some more time talking about that that when we're talking about building ZK Roll-Ups and optimistic Roll-Ups on bitcoin we don't necessarily need to take the entirety of the evm we could actually go back to that thing that bitcoiners used to say that we're going to analyze what all these other altcoins do and then we're going to take sort of the best parts the things that we really like about them and we're going to integrate them back home so maybe we wouldn't necessarily want to take the the all the complexity of solidity and the ethereum virtual machine and try to cram that into Bitcoin not only because there's sort of bugs in inherent with that but also because it's really difficult to prove the evm if you're using serial knowledge proof like they're basically it's basically a system that's hostile to be serial knowledge proven and there are other virtual machines out there like Cairo for example I had a conversation with vitalik and I asked him like what do you think would be the best sort of virtual machine and language to run on on bitcoin and um I don't want to put words in his mouth but I think he sort of was trying to point me towards Cairo as a better language to be Serena serial knowledge proven so we don't necessarily I think it's sort of a mistake if people think that we're talking about taking all the complexity from these smart contract these ecosystems there are sort of narrow versions of that that could be more focused on privacy or could be more focused on payments only taking those uh with that we're we're kind of out of time is there some thing is there anything that you guys felt feel that you want to say before we wrap this up okay that's it all right thanks uh thanks everyone thanks for coming to the panel uh if you guys are interested in building on bitcoin uh I'm definitely in the business of um hearing your story wanting to introduce more Builders back into Bitcoin I also have a company we're hiring so if you want to build uh Roll-Ups on top of Bitcoin try to find me after this this panel and thank you very much for coming foreign
