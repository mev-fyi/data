a celestium is essentially taking the best of both worlds from celestia and ethereum and using them together synergistically where celestia can provide highly scalable data availability throughput and ethereum can serve as a solomon layer and a liquidity layer because as we all know ethereum currently has the strongest liquidity mode you know it's the most liquidity out of any other blockchain especially like programmable money blockchains or smart contract blockchains you know it has the most by far so this allows uh applications on ethereum to leverage what celestia has to offer okay so what does this last time look like in practice you have a execution layer just like you had before which you can think of like a roll up right so you could have one or two or however many you want and then rather than you that using ethereum for both settlement and data availability his execution there uses celestia for data availability and uses ethereum for settlement in other words it'll post its roll-up block data to celestia where celeste the celestia chain will guarantee through its consensus protocol that this data is available and users can verify that this data isn't available through the consent through the celestia protocol which used this as novel technique called data availability sampling that allows any node in the world to verify that data has been published without fully downloading that data i don't think any other blockchain does this or even close to this other blockchains especially monolithic blockchains require you to fully download data in order to verify it's available which is part of the reason why monolithic blockchains aren't very scalable in this case celestia through his data availability sampling allows anyone in the world to verify that data is available without fully downloading it and then this uh celestium this roll-up essentially would use ethereum for settlement which means it would post fraud proofs or validity proofs to ethereum to adjudicate to handle deposits and withdrawals of tokens okay so how is this accomplished it's accomplished through this new technology that we're developing and it's all public and open source the entire celestia stack is public and open source now this isn't like some you know secret thing that we're hiding it's all it's all out there this quantum gravity bridge uh technology works as follows that you have your roll up here listed as an l2 operator you have your roll up and it does two things one is that will produce some sort of proof or some sort of new claim or registration on what happens in the roll-up in other words the effects of the transactions and then simultaneously to this it will also post the actual transactions that cause that effect right and again these two things don't have to be placed in the same layer you can use different layers for each of them you can use a separate data layer and a separate settlement layer and this is what this does so the transaction data which you can see on the right here gets posted to celestia and the celestia val data set will attest to the availability of this data and if you do not trust those celestia validators as i said before anyone can run a node to verify that the data is available or not and it can verify this without downloading all the data thanks to data availability sampling uh then the this attestation this sig these signatures over the fact that the data has been published to celestia are relayed to ethereum through our quantum gravity bridge contract in the form of a data availability attestation and then downstream roll-up contracts can use this bridge contract to query for the existence and the existence of a valid attestation essentially it's like a light client relay just a fancy like client relay so in this scheme rollups will post their proofs to ethereum and post their data to celestia and the bridge contract is essentially a drop in replacement for a data availability mechanism which traditionally roll ups will either post their data directly to ethereum so it can replace that or some rollups have have used a technique called volidium where you actually leave the data off chain but you use something called the data availability committee to attest to the availability of the data now you might say well why don't i just use a data availability committee why would i go through all this hassle of using an external consensus layer instead of just seven guys seven large corporations signing off that data is available the issue with a data availability committee and what we're trying to avoid is that a committee has no penalty for lying so if the committee lies and they attest that data is available and it's not they don't actually get any penalties there's no penalty whatsoever they just get away scot-free the only penalty if you want to call that is the reputation gets hurt that's not exactly very robust in this case if this celestia valve data set lies about data being available when it's not they will get slashed this is a slashable offense in the celestial consensus rules which means potentially billions of dollars is getting burned through the slashing it's a very strong crypto economic guarantee the second reason that celestia the celestium and quantum gravity bridge approach is superior to a vanilla data availability committee is that with a data availability committee users cannot verify that the data is published they have to completely trust the committee or they have to fully download the data which kind of defeats the whole purpose of some external person the testing to the fact that data is available if you have to fully download it yourself with celestia users can actually use data availability sampling to verify the integrity of the bridge before using it and even during using it so at any point they know if the bridge is compromised and then they can enforce the slashing conditions on celestia with the data availability committee you don't actually know that the committee has been compromised they've compromised you but you don't actually know it so this is strictly better than a data availability committee in those two axis okay so now okay this is more secure than a data availability committee but why would anyone use this scheme over just using ethereum for data availability right well it's largely the same reason why people use data availability committees and why all these royal projects are exploring alternative data availability options because of this chart sorry if you post data to ethereum you're looking at something like a swap being two dollars on a good day with low transaction fees this was taken this morning or maybe last night oh this was taken this morning on l2fs.com made by david mihal i think so even on a good day with not too bad transaction fees a swap on a roll-up that posts this data to ethereum will be two dollars if you use an external data availability solution like celestia that cost essentially drops down to nothing it's just a fraction of a penny so this is why roll-ups have been exploring off-chain data availability solutions this whole time because these costs are simply not sustainable they're going to get worse over time as ethereum gets more congested because there's such a strong demand for ethereum and block space and that demand will only increase ethereum gains more adoption you know we need a solution and posting all the data through ethereum even if you try to do some fancy compression stuff you're still going to get numbers like this and it's only going to get worse and celestia through celestium through the quantum gravity bridge offers something that's essentially as secure as ethereum but that provides you the low cost of a data availability committee
