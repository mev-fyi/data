we need to do something to get the slides up there we go we've had a lot of slide skipping all right let's get to it so today we're going to talk about modular interoperability or sorry modular blockchains and interoperability specifically permissionless interoperability so if you think about why you guys are all here today we are here at the modular Summit because for whatever reason and we'll get into that very specific reason we think that the modular construction is an ideal solution to a lot of the issues that we face with blockchains so over the next uh 20 minutes or so we're going to get into that we're going to cover the different moving Parts what needs to happen what is feasible and what is not and so at hyperlane we like to talk about this concept of The Interchange Highway what's that it's kind of like a big word it's something that we like to think of as a safe somewhat fast path to connect between the ever increasing and ever expanding Universe of chains and the modular universe is one where we're going to have an increasing number of smaller chains smaller than the monoliths that we've become accustomed to over the last few years specifically we're going to talk about how permissionless interoperability and modular security help us create this concept of the interchain highway so with blockchains we have these really cool internet computers right they let us do all sorts of things from starting with Bitcoin that gave us um Sovereign and permissionless money moving on to ethereum that gave us permissionless access to computation right I think it's one of the coolest things in the world that pretty much anyone here can access this permissionless substrate and run any computations they want on it there's some magic in that but with these internet computers the way that they do this magic it's primarily by introducing the concept of scarcity into the digital domain we've never really had scarcity in the digital domain before blockchains became as common as they have in this visualization here we have on the screen is something I really like it treats each block as a bus and I think this is a really effective visualization because if you think of about uh of a block Well there's almost so much space in it and if a bus has a certain amount of seats so does a block has its size well so every little person you're trying to get on the bus it's an incoming transaction and they take up a seat but unlike a bus that has a fixed number of seats and once it's full it's full our buses introduce a mechanism of surge pricing and so what does it mean for the bus to get filled up it means that the thing that by and large all of us are here to bring about right like to increase the amount of demand for these internet computers well if we end up looking like the bus on the right side right we got a lot of passengers to get on we're going to introduce the surge pricing and so this is where when that magical scarcity introduces a big big problem and all of us probably sometime in the last years have felt the anguish that comes from the surge pricing right when you're trying to do a transaction and suddenly you're met with like a seventy dollar uh fee on ethereum just to do that 21 000 gas of a basic transfer underneath right the gas just gets too damn High in modular blockchains seem like an ideal solution for this again if we're here it's probably because we think there's some some efficacy in this premise of ins you know we need more buses we need more seats and instead of just creating creating one massive bus that would be some magic monolithic chain we're gonna have a whole slew of smaller buses and smaller bus lines think of each one of these as being a new roll-up a new chain and that's where uh something like hyperlane comes in right so here the modular summit we're talking about all the different ways that it's becoming easier and easier and easier to launch your own chain to launch your own Roll-Up in fact with some of the participants who are here today folks like Caldera and conduit and eclipse and ALT Lair they're making it as easy to create your own chain you know such that you could really get something going within 10 15 minutes but if you've done that in 10 15 minutes how do you connect to everybody else you need something that you can support yourself and this again is where hyperlane come in I like to think of hyperlane as something that through its introduction of permissionless interoperability acts as the final layer the layer that completes the modular blockchain stack right if we broke up execution settlement consensus and data availability for us to actually have practical benefits from that our modular chains need to be able to talk to each other if to enable that talking to each other you need to go and convince someone on a permissioned interoperability team to add your chain right so you spun up your new chain in 10 minutes but then you need to spend the next 10 weeks convincing someone to add you that's doesn't really cut it and that's to the extent that folks have been playing around in the cosmos ecosystem the magic of IBC is its permissionless nature it's the fact that you can spin up a tenderman chain you can spit up a you know chain on the cosmos ecosystem and through IBC you don't have to ask anybody for permission but it's become harder and harder you can't really do that outside of the confines of IBC and so we need to find a way to extend those confines and there's a number of people working on this problem so what is this problem really when it comes to modular blockchains it's this problem of permissioned interoperability it's the fact that you need an interoperability provider to add you uh to add your chain so that your chain can communicate with other chains on their Network I think and certainly other people might disagree but the reason for this is that by and large most interoperability protocols they have coupled the product that they're providing right the ability to communicate between chains or the messaging interface they've tightly coupled it with the security model they've made those two effectively into just one thing but it doesn't have to be that way right it could certainly be decoupled you can have that product the way to communicate between chains that interface on one hand and you can have security be provisioned on the other hand and that's what we do with hyperlink really believe that modular chains need modular security so we're going to get more into the specifics of that but at a high level imagine most of you have had this experience of going to your bank when you try to get a nominal sum say a few hundred dollars out the ATM will let you do that with just your PIN number don't really ask any questions beyond that try to do something a little bit more intense try to withdraw uh forty thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars try to make a large wire or if you dare try and close your account at the bank and get all the money out of it in that same day they're gonna run you through a much more serious line of interrogation they're going to want to see your ID they're going to want to know who else is on the account with you they're going to ask you do you recognize the last 10 transactions um see or I you know see your social security number and if the U.S if you're in the U.S so what does the bank really doing the bank is looking at the context of what you're trying to do and they're running you through a different security protocol and that seems to make sense you know most people don't really object too heavily when the bank is trying to run them through a much more stringent process when their action is going to have a much more significant impact on the account don't really do that in crypto crypto you try to move a hundred dollars or you try to move a hundred million dollars we run you through the same the same exact system might want to think about what that why that is it's something that often doesn't really get questioned for us we didn't think that necessarily needs to be that way and so the introduction of module security really really lets us do that and so we could talk briefly about like different forms of interoperability to understand this concept a little bit better the best way to verify state if you can is to leverage what some people call native verification in this case you're just leveraging the existing consensus between the connected chains I'd say IBC is probably the gold standard in inoperability until today and IVC gives you native verification when you connect two chains through IBC you're really just trusting the two chains that you're being connected which generally is a fine assumption right like if you're connecting between you know say ethereum in an arbitrum let's say or say ethereum and Avalanche if you're using both of those chains you're probably comfortable with the security models on both so the fact that you don't need to introduce anything else is terrific but the issue with Native verification it is that you need to rec uh it's a very costly method because you're basically replicating the consensus of one chain on another and doing it in a place where that was not constructed for that as is the case in the evm world is incredibly costly the other mode is external verification not too complex right so we're still trusting our a and RB our ethereum and our Avalanche but now we need to introduce someone in the middle and hence the name external verification so this kind of looks and feels like an oracle if you're familiar with the Oracle problem I imagine most of the people here are and that's because right like external verification for interoperability really it's just a narrow scope of the Oracle problem instead of oracleizing any type of information in the world you're just oracleizing state from another chain that makes it a slightly easier problem to solve but it's still at the end of the day it introduces a third element of trust and this is where a lot of things can um can certainly go wrong so now let's move on to modular blockchains right again we're here the modular Summit because we believe in this concept and I personally believe that with modular blockchains we're not going to have a singular hub we're going to have a number of hubs from which we see an increasing number of smaller blockchains smaller computers again I think it needs a small smaller buses smaller bus lines and so ethereum becomes a hub Celestia becomes a data availability hub Cosmos is already a hub think of these little guys here in in optimism and base and arbitrary they can become little hubs too well we're going to have these hubs everywhere and more and more chains that come out of them would be there we go um they need a way to connect with each other and every time you create another another new little computer not a little bus how does it communicate with everything else so you do need permissionless and are probably you need a way that this increasing Universe of chains can connect to each other and can do that without having to ask anyone for permission without having to ask anyone for help we're in this space because we value our sovereignty we value our freedoms and we want to be able to act without being gatekeeped and so a world of permissioned interoperability where we're just waiting for people to add our chains to get the support it doesn't do much for us it doesn't do much for anybody and this is what we built hyperlane for so how does it work this little schema here shows you the life cycle of a hyperlane message as it goes from a chain a to a chain B let's say again Ethan Avalanche Ethan you know pick your poison there are three critical parts to hyperlane there's our mailbox simple contract that just sends and receives information transfers bytes and codes them helps verify them then we have our security modules think of it as like some logic to run to run a test on to basically say how do I how do I get comfortable with what's been relayed to me from a different place to that we could use system of validators we could use an optimistic system with some type of Watchtower you could use ZK magic when it becomes available because who doesn't love DK magic it's the best I'm a big fan or we could even use some type of committee based approach and lastly we have a real layer relayers open roll you just heard Jim talk about all the difficulties in relayer systems uh there's a reason why they they are working on it because it's a hard problem and the relay on hyperlane is no different right a lot of those open questions are things that every system with real errors need to needs to think about so how does it really work you have a contract or a user starting on the source chain they send the message to the mailbox they tell it they have the message body the bytes that they're trying to transfer around in those bytes you could reason about oh I want to move this asset I want to deposit this thing in that liquidity pool I want to borrow from this lending pool the mailbox takes in the information about what needs to happen where does it need to go and then come in one of our security settings so in hyperlane we talked earlier about this concept of modular security so instead of being forced to use a specific option you're always able to choose from a set of security modules don't like them you can build your own not everyone wants to do this it's not a easier fun thing to do but it does open it open the door to a security Marketplace in fact where we are today is that external teams teams outside of the hyperlane core team are building different security modules talk a little bit about ZK magic in fact there's one team already leveraging their ZK proof mechanism to create a hyperlane security module and so once your chain oh sorry once you're message is ready to get to the destination the relayer comes in and the relayer always observes the mailbox really is a fairly simplistic operation think of it like just a basic bot that looks at the mailbox and sees what you're trying to do it sees that the message is there and it's waiting to be processed it sees that maybe you're kind and you want to pay them for this service so you've included a little tip in there for them maybe you didn't and maybe then the only reason that they would relay our messages because as Jim talked about earlier is you might have some Mev opportunities for them to take take advantage of as they take your message to the mailbox on the destination chain they ready it for processing and during the processing is when the logic is tested Against The Interchange security module so there you can do some really fun stuff we talked about the bank example where the bank treats me different when whether I try to withdraw 100 or if I'm trying to wire out 50 Grand you could configure your app in such a way that when a message is received you reason about the message a little bit and what's this user doing well they're just trying to send say 100 in a small swap great send it through the fastest um running through the fastest module that we have no need to have maximum security because it's a hundred dollars what's the Worst That Could Happen 100 could be lost someone's now trying to move a hundred million dollars let me ask you anyone ever see a nine figure transaction that wasn't actually an exploit rarely happens it's always an X4 so a transaction of that size we can now run it through a very slow path a very secure path Maybe the optimistic path which doesn't allow for the message to be processed for a very long period of time set by you as the integrating app and during that time anyone can observe that transaction and if it doesn't look kosher shoot it down you don't have to take it and once it's passed through this the ism The Interchange security module it's ready to go arrives at a destination and so what did we just see we just saw how we use hyperlane to communicate between chains in the interest of time I won't spend too much time on this slide here but the the key concept is that with hyperlink you can choose how you want to secure your messages because there is no insurance security module you're able to leverage Economic Security in the form of staking you're able to leverage that optimistic security that we just talked about and when you're just getting started when the stakes are low you could just have a multi-sika mini and you can imagine that multi-sig option it might actually beneficial even when the stakes are high maybe there are certain actions that you want specific set of people to have to approve maybe it's your team your company maybe it's the key portion of your community the folks who are emerged as the most influential players think of this as something that can be used like the emergency switch in makerdale right we all hopefully we all know that there's an option in maker to shut the system down never been used but it's there you might need to hit that switch one day and so how does hyperlane compare to kind of regular bridging generally speaking most bridging today is done through this form of like an Omnibus Bridge you have one contract and it takes all the assets from all the people and they all sit in this thing and it kind of looks like a nice honey pot and this is how we end up with more than two billion dollars in different Bridge exploits because the more people use it the more appealing it becomes because they're all there in the same place but if we're talking about modular chains like why do we need to have this Honeypot shared between everybody so why not use this concept of modular bridging why not leverage when in hyperlane we call the war proud concept that lets you to have individualized path for each asset and each path can have distinct security settings so you might want to have different settings coming into your chain whether it's usdc or maybe when you're bridging your own native asset you want to treat it slightly differently and that's something that you can do once you leverage modular bridging so what can you do with something like hyperlane so these are some of the obvious fun things that you can do you can have interchange swapping right so why do we do bridging for the most part because we want to have the asset go from one place to another and we want to do something with it at the edge but if the thing that we want to do is swapping it might not need to move it after all if the thing already exists on both sides why not just transfer the logic of that action and say hey John is on ethereum and Dave is on Avalanche and Dave's got 500 USD usdc and he's willing to use it to buy some of John's ethereum well great so John you get rid of your ethereum Dave you get rid of your usdc and we send that logic with something like hyperlink there's also the concept of interchain accounts which will be familiar for anyone who comes from the cosmos world hyperlane recreates that in a broader context some key differences there that we could get into if you want to talk later could also bring inner chain Oracle so we just released this just the other day with hyperlane now you can bring chain link feeds to your chain permissionlessly so this is a problem that a lot of modular chains a lot of Roll-Ups face because they need access to chain link data or other trusted oracles and so you can do that another use case I like talking about but I'm running out of time so I'll be kind is The Interchange margin now what does the end game look for something like hyperlane we could think about internet inner roll-up networking where we have created all these Roll-Ups well they need to talk to each other more easily and like what network effects can you create from that then relaying services that security module Marketplace that I mentioned and ultimately this concept of interchange intents but that was all the time we had so if you want to learn
