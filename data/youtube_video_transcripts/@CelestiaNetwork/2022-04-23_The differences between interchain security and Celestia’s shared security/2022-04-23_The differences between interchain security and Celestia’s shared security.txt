[Music] i mean i think ezekiel and i agree on this but we've discussed it before but like in the interchange thinking module i see the interchange taking module and celestia security model having different purposes and so i guess to recap the cosmos hub interchange taking module the way it effectively works right now at least it works the way it works in v1 is that you can set up a chain where the validators of the cosmos have are also the values of your chain so effectively you know the cosmos hub violators are also evaluating other chains so they're valid validating multiple chains and they're also executing the transactions in those machines and processing the transactions so this is quite similar to some extent to the political dot shared security model where there's power chains and the relay chain takes an interest in the validity of those paragraphs and um so the problems model is that it doesn't scale to let's say like thousands or millions of chains it scales to like an order of magnitude of maybe like 100 chains uh which is like you know political dot has you know it has to auction off um like power chain slots there's a hundred power chain slots and they have to auction it off because obviously the validators in media chain can't validate you know every single chain in the world now celestia like our aim is like we see a world with millions of blockchains so we're kind of catering towards the kind of tail end of blockchains like imagine you can just deploy a blockchain uh like maybe you wanna maybe explore a small project and recruiting the cosmos hub validator set is too expensive for you and then you can just like you know they deploy on celestia and you celestia has data available later the the advantage of that is um like and one interesting part of that is like if your roll up does not initially have a lot of activity then it's not as if you have to post blocks on that chain like every single epoch so you can just post blocks as long as you need to so it's like you pay as you go data available in ordering and um something that i echo with exactly what exactly i said before i think the interchange taking module and it's kind of useful for like uh as a value accord mechanism for the atom token so like let's say the cosmos hub um want you to kind of like acquire or deploy new chains that are like uh in the same vertical as the gospel top so for example in the future i see like a world a potential potential where the cosmos hub might want to deploy or launch its own settlement layer for roll-ups and like they're using cosm like using cosmos for example you know a community might decide they don't want to actually you know deploy like actually integrate cosmos into the hub itself so like they might deploy a custom one specific hub and then there's two chains in parallel but their interchange stick with each other so it's kind of like a way for the hub to have a suite of chains zaki same question please well i agree with everything mustafa has just said um and i think that i think the the biggest way of thinking about it is is it's like um cosmos shared security is a sort of expensive solution to the deployer of a chain that hopefully gets them a business benefit which is like this tight partnership with atom holders a value a like a solid value accrual mechanism for this like tight partnership with between this like new chain and atom holders um and hopefully this gets is is an opportunity to create value and it coexists in an ecosystem where you know uh you can you know start a validator set with three machines on aws and just go for that um like you know the cosmos net model is permissionless in iraq um and so shared security is this like very specific point solution
