we're here at modular Summit and I'm interviewing mantle what is your name and how are you involved with mantle right so first thing thank you for having me uh so I'm Arjun I'm the head of ecosystem at mantle um so I've been at crypto for some time I started in 2016. I was I started doing crypto uh you know I read the Bitcoin white people got into that then I started working full-time uh in 2020 where I joined polygon at the time it was called Matic Network and I was at obedient growth I had polygon for about three years last November I joined mantle um and at mantle we're doing something like really very interesting where we're building a modular layer 2 stack on ethereum where we're using eigenlayer as data availability so it's uh and then we just went live three days ago awesome yeah why did you get involved with mantle and why do you think the modular stack is compelling so Mattel was born out of a dow vote right it is it doesn't it doesn't come with BC backing or it's not a like a typical chain like you know your Dao voted so bit down voted to create a piece of infrastructure and matter was born and that's how we hired the team so I found that like I found the Genesis story very interesting we also have access to uh bidal's funds um all of our funding comes from the Dow and we've got about four billion dollars on chain uh in in assets which we can use to mobilize and grow the ecosystem we also have the support of by bit The Exchange who can help us with listing high potential projects so as ecosystem player having a very strong community in the Dow uh having now having a piece of infrastructure and having an exchange as well with which we can accelerate and and create distribution for projects felt like a very compelling play to me um also I I love the zero to one Journey from bit of a junkie zero to one junkie that way so that's kind of why I wanted to uh start this uh I think with why we chose to build modular I think it was a very obvious choice for us like if you look at just the future of how blockchains will be built it's very clear the design is going to be modular um we've seen this kind of characteristic in web 2 as well where web2 was all about monolithic architecture it was all about uh you know large pieces of software where and we've gone from that to today where the entire sort of software industry is run with microservices and apis so we've seen model modularization in web 2 as well and in web3 we will see the same with the all the different let's say layers within a blockchain are going to be split up into into sort of different let's say pieces all of which are interacting seamlessly with each other and with every piece of that let's say Pi you would see then interesting Innovation happening so on the on the data availability SCI for example we're working with eigen layer but we are also actively you know in conversations with Celestia with polygon Avail we're looking at if if it makes sense to have multiple DNA layers possibly sometime in the future and similarly you know with respect to finality we're on you know on ethereum but in terms of um consensus or in terms of execution like you know there are so many other Innovations happening in that space as well so in the VM space for example um arbitrim is doing a stylus which is a new kind of VM polygon is developing Maiden so that could be another space where there's like multiple VMS possible for change to use on the finalities on the consensus side we've got uh we're running a sequence ourselves but decentralized sequences ZK avns like the like there's so much Innovation happening there as well so when you open up the layers of a blockchain you kind of tend to also spark innovation in all of these different layers and I think like this will lead to uh some amazing blockchain configurations right where I feel that we will get closer and closer to solving the blockchain trilemma as as we continue to modernize so so I think I'm very excited about about modular design philosophy okay right so a mantle is is a modular layer to uh scaling solution we built on top of ethereum we use eigen layer for data availability and in terms of Technology we've gone to the modular stack in terms of ecosystem we have our own liquidity we've got our own piece of infrastructure now and we also have a have a closely Allied exchange so we have the ability to take a project all the way from zero to 100 which is uh you know take a project all the way from zero to Grants to Investments and all the way to listing on the technology side fully evm compatible we've gone with the op stack and we're running the ovm so all so if you're a ethereum developer or if you're a polycon developer arbitrum developer optimism developer you are automatically a mantle developer so super easy to use a super fast very low fees and at the same time massive ecosystem to back it all up so that's that's mantle okay great all right let's let's talk about the technicals a little bit so what is the direction of the ecosystem so this is very interesting so in terms of Technology we so we just spent life like three days ago um in terms of the technology currently we're running OBM so we're running the uh you could say not the Bedrock version the ovm of uh the original optimism version uh which has been live for almost 18 months we're working with eigenlayer and we've gone live with eigen with eigen da um eigen data availability so um currently uh it's it's a configuration which um which the mantle team has put together uh using eigen DS technology I think once eigen Da goes into production later this year then it will be sort of full-fledged run by the eigen layer infrastructure um and and I think it's so interesting right so when you look at the space so their Innovations happening on the um on the fraud proof um sort of side where we see um like compression in in sort of roll up data so what we saw when we went from ovm to bedrock the gas costs for example on optimism went down by 50 so there's some interesting Innovations there we're also actively been researching ckvms and trying to see that in the next let's say evolution of our Network maybe sometime next year it doesn't make sense for us to you know go ZK and and you know we've been in touch with all the zkbm teams in the space um and trying to get a sense of suppose we have to do it how would we do it what's the best technology out there which is compatible with most of the most of the op codes Etc so we're doing that research um on the on the data availability side we're working with eigen layer uh eigen layer right now but we're also looking at all the other different Stacks trying to see how the data availability space Also evolves with different configurations with node setups data availability committees so some some interesting kinds of ways of putting together and solving data availability in terms of chain execution and VMS as well like like I was explaining earlier there are now like there is now Variety in in the a sort of VM layer so earlier you would have possibly evm right and you try to basically maybe build some customization into it now you can sort of build a custom VM which supports evm and could support potentially um other languages as well which would offer more flexibility in terms of the kind of smart contracts and the kind of building you could do right so evm stops being a limiter so that's like you know something which we're also studying and we're trying to also actively you know engage with with the folks at ethereum Foundation trying to get a sense of where evm is heading as well so this is there's like a lot going on at the same time um but but we're very excited about this journey um you know at our core we want to bring the best technology to Market which obviously means you know we have to keep a track of everything that's happening in the space so we have a full stack Tech Team a full stack research team we are also hiring more uh more folks on our technical teams as well so when the time to come expect like you know more interesting sort of configurations with respect to the blockchain and this will continue you know push the envelope of scalability right in terms of blockchain scalability and extensibility via the modular architecture um how do you expect to use multiple dealers like Celestia you know do you think there's a future for using something like IBC as the communications protocol what are your thoughts about that so I think IBC has been sort of the inspiration right for like everything cross-chain um in the space right so right from tender men to IBC like everybody seems to be learning from Cosmos or what what has to be done within the evm space we've seen some interesting cross-chain applications now coming up now that we have things like layer zero Wormhole and like I would say cost efficient generic message passing protocols where you can send liquidity nfts and and sort of or rather just past messages between chains very easily um could be for example uh use other data availability layers and what that would look like the reason I bought that up is because I do feel that ultimately the data availability layer also will have its own economics right so so currently when the user pays for fees he's also he's paying obviously for you know fees for on L2 fees for uh the transaction because it has to land up on L1 on ethereum but then he's also paying for the data availability uh cost here and and what that means is at the data availability layer you're going to have fee generation happen over a period of time now there are various ways in which you can create value in this layer and how and I feel that as data availability matures as a technology different layers will compete not just for chains but also for um for for these fees uh from users and ultimately could even provide let's say rebates in some sense right so you could have for example a situation where if for example we use x data availability layer right we could get a like a rebate on the data costs Indian sort of maybe a token or something like that so they're going to be you know different economic models at play here and this will lead to like this kind of arms race in the data availability layer side so that's kind of why I feel that if you follow let's say pure modular design philosophy you know in some sense you want to be able to give this option uh to the user or to the let's say a smart contract developer it doesn't matter so much would it be bound to a chain I think we have to give it some more time before you know seeing these kind of configurations but I fully expect like a lot of competition in this sort of data availability and not just in this layer and all of these different layers and this competition would mean that offering more options could potentially be better for the user in the long run like that's kind of what I visualize when I see how these things are evolving over time okay last question where do you think the space is headed with respect to having data layers as the norm but if we don't solve decentralized sequencing is it headed towards more centralization oh spicy question um so this is this is very interesting like discussion right and I'll try to summarize it assistantly as I can um do I expect more modern modularization uh yes of course are there going to be more data availability layers in the future of course right can we find a way to mix and match configurations and provide options yes we can but sequences is a very interesting sort of space because ideally for the sake of decentralization you would want decentralized sequences but in some sense I feel it also breaks the revenue model for blockchains so for example if a blockchain is running a sequencer and accruing fees you know the blockchain has a revenue model the current generation blockchains don't have very strong Revenue models um and and when you have a revenue model then you can run a chain then you can generate funds for you know continuous sort of improvement otherwise you're continuously gambling on the token price um right to be able to sustain your company now when you sort of decentralize the sequences does it break the revenue model or or what should the revenue model of a chain look like ultimately the chain has to be able to generate value in order to be able to distribute that value to its sort of token holders or potential stakers or whatever have you so I feel that decentralized sequences and and what the maybe the value accrual for the token and for the chain would be something which is maybe not very clearly Mis understood but I do feel that you know decentralization is sort of the um the end goal or the end state so we would have to figure out what these economic models would look like but should we should we become you know should we move towards decentralization when it comes to the sequences of course we should and it's a very complex problem to solve but I think with all the different teams now uh looking to solve this problem I'm a fairly confident it'll be solved quickly so yeah the action and the reason why we need the modular stack is to scale to the next six billion or so users like mainstream users right everyone in the world the same as almost everyone in the world has access to Internet somehow and if we're able to achieve that then the idea is to get decentralization technology in the hands of everyone however the problem is if it re-centralizes then if why not just revert back to the centralized Norm which is already scalable to worldwide no you're 100 right I think it's such a fine balance right one has to achieve where you need to be able to so so the way okay so let me explain it in a slightly different way ultimately you want value creation and then you want equitable distribution like so the web two business models create not just centralization in terms of Technology but centralization in terms of the distribution of that value so whatever value is created for example in any network or in any business is concentrated to a very small set of let's say individuals or parties and then and then the rest institutions and then push retail to the periphery and for retail to access it they are gay kept by the institution through the institutions right and and build web 3 we want to break that right so not only are we looking at Collective ownership but we're also looking at equitable distribution right and and and which is why decentralization is so important these are the problems we're trying to solve but at the same time for every blockchain right and and for every let's say piece of technology you need to continuously improve it evolve it you need to like continuously improve security so which means that you need the ability to run let's say teams right these could be globally distributed but in some sense tightly in their teams whose whose sole focus is to ensure that this technology continues to serve the utility which for which it was designed right so equitable distribution is important but being able to have some model wrapped maybe let's say within that equitable distribution is is very important right this is kind of where we feel is The Sweet Spot of how you can create this technology continue to evolve and build it and then continue to sustain it right and and so that decentralization never stops like I would hate to be in a situation where uh you know we're not able to find these economic models and then you know it becomes total although it becomes like all about token value uh sort of a token value sort of play right where token price matters the most and then decentralization would then fail and then people would be like yeah this is why you should not build this this is why you should do web web tools answer so idea to get there which is kind of why we need to like collectively work together and and figure out a solution to these problems absolutely and with that thanks for coming on the podcast all right thank you for having me
