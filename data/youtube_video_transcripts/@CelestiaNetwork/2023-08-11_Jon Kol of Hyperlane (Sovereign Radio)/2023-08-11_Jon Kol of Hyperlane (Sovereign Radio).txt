so we've got John here from hyperlane welcome to the show thanks for having me yeah so you've been telling me about your background but let's get it on record you know how to get into crypto and how to get started with Viper Lane great question uh so that's uh we're just talking about the offline I got in the crypto stupidly as a miner started mining Z cash in early 2017. and the thing I found appealing about it is like well pretty much all of us had encounter Bitcoin for some transactional use case like like buy something from some dude on Reddit uh you know a few years before why did we do that we thought like oh this is an anonymous currency and then you start learning more you're like actually no this is not Anonymous this is the most public thing that's ever existed right this is like it's there forever and someone will eventually figure out who it was and then uh so I'm Israeli and then I hear about this you know group of Israeli professors from a university close to where I grew up and they have devised a private cryptocurrency Z cash and Monero exists at the time but I don't I'm such a noob I don't know anything about it and I'm just like this thing it's it's gonna go off it's going to be huge yeah yeah that's right who doesn't want private internet money so I gotta get in on this and I gotta benefit from its rise but at the time I'm a bond Trader Morgan Stanley like I difficult family situation I can't be too risky with my cash and Mining felt kind of like crypto bun it's like I'm gonna buy I'm gonna put my principal down on the equipment and then I get the the returns back it's kind of like these recurring cash flows and it's going to be great it's a low risk way to getting into crypto and boy was that stupid um so now not a fan of mining but spend the entire of 2017 just getting more and more and more crypto pills was lucky to be in the Bay Area uh where you know a bunch of us were and just like it was probably the most vibrant crypto ecosystem in the world oh yeah I was there that it was that was the epicenter of crypto at the time because block stream was there purse was there all of the relevant crypto companies that you know Bitcoin companies were there lightning labs yeah I mean there really was like epicenter's the right word yeah it was buzzing that was where it was happening I remember the digital garage yes that's like right yeah Terry Lewis would host the Bitcoin meetups uh and ethereum meetups and everything was happening there all of the ICU I mean not all of them but like 90 of the IC Xerox you know everything was there and you know just spent that year being mocked by everyone on my Trading discount like oh the crypto guys you're the crazy guy in suits yeah you know it was just not a place for me and by the end of the year one of our clients was getting into crypto they're like hey John there's there's a group there and uh you might just be crazy enough for them like they're they're opening up a crypto fund you should really talk to them and two weeks later I got started there what fun was that uh it's called passport capital I mean it's still still around it's called passport it's been a macro hedge fund for 20 something years and I was their first hire for the crypto team and that was like my first real break first legitimate opportunity in crypto and uh stayed there for a little while and then late 2019 joined the Galaxy Mike Nova grants's firm and then co-ran the investment business there for a few years before and late 20 2021 the idea for hyperlane started to kind of come together and now and all this time so like like I mentioned before I grew up in Israel and I got an internet connection very early like within my friends and family group and only had one other friend that had internet connection and we were on different isps so like not everything worked between us and then when I learned about blockchains like someone said hey these things are not going to be able to talk to each other I'm like well super cool internet computers I remember when I first got into like my buddy who was on the different ISP like we couldn't really see the same websites all the time we're on like different portals as they called back then but different servers yeah within like a year and a half that got fixed you know and so it felt like this is just going to be a problem like a problem that's solved very quickly and then another year goes by another year and it it really wasn't happening especially outside like in wasn't really happening for EVMS very much right for the ethereum ecosystem wait let me stop you there why do you think that this was so accelerated in the what two world and in crypto it seems to be like the the uh duration that's the best question anyone's ever asked me about this I I if I if I really think about it I think it's because and this might not be something a lot of people like to hear but I think in the previous World things were not no one was religious about like isps right there was no Dogma when it came guys people weren't tied to it it was very strictly like these are business operators and it just made more sense to have a more open web and the moment that the business proposition was clear that like portals are not it and you should have just a much more open web everyone converted but I think in crypto because we have these communities and we have assets tied to those communities and people Beyond just yet they put their life into it so first they put their layer their life energy into something but then they have an asset that's associated with it and sometimes that acid due to its appreciation when it really changes their life so there's a bond there that probably never existed right and just you know like and the other world just you know cables and servers this year it's cable servers and like and immense emotional one person like identity culture even a religion Titans currency exactly right like no one thinks like well AOL you know yeah my life is a name one felt that uh but there is someone who's like I'm an ethereum and I don't want to leave ethereum right ethereum you know Time Warner Cable yeah exactly think I'm even just saying that like now you're saying I'm like hearing it I'm like that sounds like a ridiculous thing to say but yeah no one would blink it out you said that in crypto but like oh well I'm beneath Maxi right like that's the everyone might not like it but yeah you would be surprised if someone said that so I think that's it because I think the engineering Pro like the engineering problems are part for sure but I don't think that was it I think we had Solutions you know semi-workable Solutions and Engineering problems as early as like 2016. right and yeah similar to that I mean the closest thing we the closest analog we have to maximalism in the web 2 world is oh whether you have an iPhone or an Android but even that that's kind of not yeah like okay whatever you use an Android I don't care but here it's like oh your Bitcoin Maxi get out yeah yeah I don't even want to talk yeah so it very much feels like religion right you know like it's uh there's kind of like me trying to go to my cousin's house so it's very religious person back at Israel and trying to bring something not Kosher into the house he would he wouldn't let me in yeah like I don't care my costume you so here's like whoa whoa you're a Bitcoin like just yuck just yeah yeah so that's gotta be it but that was such a good question I've never even thought about that before today yeah interesting comes yeah I mean this is this is one of the first times I've articulated this phenomenon too so yeah that does make sense why these things are more protracted than other Industries anyway going back to hyperlane yeah exactly and you know before we even started this uh podcast I was like okay you're a direct I've seek it better aren't you idle you know like why should I be interviewing it exactly right like it's that same reaction it's like wait there's you know it's almost like you know foreign organisms coming in and like the antibody and they're like What's this here yeah right and then you have you also like to to appease me you're like well we're not trying to replace you know the IVC connections with that you know but for everything else that doesn't have it yeah meanwhile it's just a protocol right it's just software but why do we feel the way that we feel right I think I've thought about this a lot just you know like why do people have these strong bonds and I think a part of it is for a lot of people myself included maybe it's the same for you like crypto changed my entire life oh yeah I grew up bro you know like I will tell you that we were running out of food but like we didn't really take vacations growing up like we you know uh I was a big nerd really into video games like I have the bust my ass off school and then like once a year or twice a year like they buyed me a video game and that was like the Highlight once a year one swear I got it I got my first birthday gift from my parents like when I was like 15 years in yeah so there you go yeah I had to beg my mom for the n64. they're already like 13 or whatever that's I remember getting it it was like the best my dad came back from a trip to the US and like invited and I was like oh my God yeah the coolest thing and so and like now really since like the last three four years uh it's the first time in life that I'm not living like month to month and it's thanks to the crypto yeah right you know like that uh you know I was pairing paying for my parents mortgage I was doing stuff like that and and still take care of my mom's house but now that's not I don't have to worry about that right it's all thanks to this this industry that I chose to spend time in and so now I personally might not be very dogmatic about like specific ecosystems but I am dogmatic about crypto like if someone comes in and like I'm sure you know I go to some dinner and someone's just like very Anthony crypto I get the antibodies immediately it's just like I want to you know it's like do you know you know so it's that same reaction because this thing it changed our lives and how can we not have like an emotional connection to it so I'm very sympathetic when someone has you know an emotional connection that's specific to one ecosystem it's just just all makes sense yeah the last cycle it benefited the Millennials a lot in my opinion a lot of the Gen Z like the new blood that came in post 2021 a lot of them blew up if they were short-term speculative Traders especially if they just listen to all the YouTube the YouTubers ready like yeah whatever so the Gen Z money really um dried up so yeah what if in the next one we got some Boomer money in well the Boomers have all of like everyone who is living you know they have like more than instead of the wealth of everyone who is alive today so that money you know once that money gets into crypto hey if some of it can come in and then that could create a more generational distribution like I'm all for it because like you said I think I have you know anyone who's paying attention to seeing those graphs where it's like wealth accumulation by generation it's like silence Boomers Gen X Millennials and yeah huge yeah it's it's quite a chunk right they've they've lived through basically like the largest Health accumulation period in history especially if they were Americans yeah they're rich even had some savings as a boomer you're probably relatively yeah so that all you even have to do is just like buy a house and a semi-metropolitan area right and you're you know everyone knows someone there's like oh yeah we bought that house in 1973 and like it was yeah 27. they're like a thousand next whoa yeah that happened and so you know there's you've seen those memes where it's like oh my parents are 30 and like they have the halfway me at 30 and I'm like you know living in a white apartment yeah living in a closet of an apartment betting on speculating on like a hamster basically like people were doing the other day yeah so so now you know if you're trying to survive if you're trying to thrive in that world in a nine to five you really aren't going to and if you make a an asymmetric vet in something like crypto like you know you're making make it plays like uh like Charlotte Russ Charlotte Fang says from the lady right then then you're gonna make it yeah I think that's part of why like the language and they found the soft feeling because it's like well I need to I need need these asymmetric events because things outside don't feel like they're going in my favor I think as a movement like crypto is very subversive and I think it's a lot of us who are kind of railing against this like I used to work it as I I've hated the banks since I've been a teenager because I've been by banks in multiple countries I've been  by the banks in Israel then I come to the US and I really like the banks here they treat me nice and then I'm a Wells Fargo client in the LA area so if you remember that Scandal I'm one of those accounts they stole 900 for me and you know they have to pay a fine but guess who's running it the saddest part guess who still has a Wells Fargo account me because it's so hard to get away from your bank account yeah and so when I like came across crypto years ago I was like wait a second we can build like a new Financial substrate sign me up yeah can we the banks for this thing like I'm all in like there's no else no other thing in the world I want to work for no other industry like how do I get into this thing right and you know going back to the hyperlane thing right now or a couple years ago it felt like for the crypto economy to really expand to kind of take that next step the cosmos thesis was always the right one instead of like one big massive computer we're going to have a whole lot of small ones and so if that's happening like how are we connecting it and it was clear by 2021 that it was not going to be a single environment or a single ecosystem so how do you create that connective tissue and um that's when we got together and sat with you know incredible folks like um you know Zaki and nominee so are not my co-founders and came with you know what a snap hyperlink okay well excellent so uh you know we're gonna we're gonna close up real quickly so the last one the last question would be okay you're not you you are an IBC competitor however you are addressing interoperability similarly to like layer zero in the evm ecosystem that's right yeah and the the key Insight with hyperlink is the same key principle of IVC why is IBC so unique because it's permissions because anyone can connect it to any chain that's suitable and that that suitable part is like the main restriction of the really the reason why we even felt compelled to make hyperlink if IVC was easily extensible to any environment we just go from that but we wanted to create something that has that same permissionless aspect anyone can use it to connect any chain and they can be very extensible so let any chain tar was very important and so whereas things like layer 0 and others let you just they have to deploy to your chain they're kind of the Arbiters of which chains get to talk to each other hyperlane brings that same concept from the spirit of IBC of just you should be able to decide then you should be able to bring it to your chain because again if we're going to see and this is what I firmly believe we're just going to see an explosion of these changes the number is going to be gargantuan but it's going to be a lot of smaller chains again less generalized and much more specific and in that world you need to be able to do it yourself and you need to be able to have that Sovereign connection and so that's really what we're going after and that's why we want to be able to support as many environments and let people connect between those environments so if you spin up your app chain tomorrow great like you can put hyperlane on that app chain the the cause and was the module the cosmos Decay module those will be done basically by the end of summer run those and now you can connect with anywhere else where hyperlane is at so you know the focus is certainly to go between environments and help people do that permissionlessly but people could use it between uh Cosmo chains I don't know why they would when they have IBC but they I guess they could but yeah that's the that's the spirit of what we're doing okay and we're going to have to bring you back on to Inner chain FM please later on for a full interview where we break all of that down to understand the technical idiosyncrasy between all of these different uh transport layers uh this is just you know like a little little teaser you know so you get the 20 000 foot view idea about what hyperlane is um and we'll see you next time thank you for coming on thank you for having me this is great
