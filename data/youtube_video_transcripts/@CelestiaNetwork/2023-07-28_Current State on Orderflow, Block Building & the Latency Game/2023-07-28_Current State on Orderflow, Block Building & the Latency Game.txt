hi everyone my name is Danning unfortunately I cannot be there in person but I'm really glad to be here to share this analysis or more like a data review about our current state of order flow blog building latency game um so I'm a data scientist at flashbots um cool I'll go through my agenda next um so I'll go through how a ethereum's transaction lifestyle code today look like with an Mev supply chain Theory or you can call it transaction supply network and then the next is I will look at how the order flow market look like with the PBS or like Meb boost I mean your supply chain structure today and then we'll look at how the block building market look like and how different Builders their behavior look like in data and also the latency game and time aspect of the block bidding Market next so we have two diagrams here um so quick intro about Mev and I assume everyone heard about Mev and PBS since you're in PBS day here today um but what is me supply chain um in the past in the proof of work day if you're making a trade The Miner had the full control about if they want to insert your trade or if they can insert any other Trader of their own or per their benefits to before to be before yours or behind yours in the proof of stake date nowadays with a even more concerning problem about Mev can cause centralization on stake and therefore call centralization of the network we introduced the PBS proposal Builder separation proposal and Mev boost is a implementation flashback from flashbots about it and the vanilla model of it is basically splitting the minor row into three rows from Searcher they will send bundles to builders and and then they will send and there was in the Builder uh the builders were built for the full block and then proposed to the validator validator will pick the highest value and then basically get the header of the block and then um settle it to um the chain and then nowadays with another thing called order flow auction this structure can even look like um like the one below where Searcher is sort of separated from this chain um basically they take a neuro as a bidder of the order flow auction but again the flow goes like user submit a transaction to the wallet wallet go through RPC potentially broadcast it to a bunch of Searchers or bidder and then they will try to search for the maximum extraction of this order and then submit a bundle to Builder and then to validator so this is a very how to say important structure that we should remember about the analysis because I'll go through each layer of the market um next one please and so um How does a exact a user's transaction or order look like on a concrete example of an order flow auction we can use flashbad's math share as an example here so you either user or wallet can submit in representation of user or a RPC provider they can basically send to a flashbot protect RPC basically an endpoint where you submit your transactions through which then actually make your transaction go through a private mempool and then it will broadcast to a bunch of Matchmaker Services which is the Mev shared services which will then broadcasted the transactions information based on users privacy setting to a bunch of Mev Searchers and they will try their best to see okay I'm trying to background this transaction without basically hurting users price and see if I can make any profits from making another transaction behind yours and then they will compete to send bundles to to the math share services and then the service will try to compare what's the highest value so to submit it to the builders in the past flash brought started with submitting the bundles to flash floods Builder but for improvement on the inclusion of the transactions we also recently released a feature about allowing user to submit to any of the Builder their of their preference um in this case it will make the users sediment to be faster and better and then the Builder will broadcast to a long-term relay and then relay will then see who has the highest bid and the value they're going to take the highest one um even next one please another example to make it a concrete concept on a DEX orders life cycle today here's a lot of interesting things to point out so when the user comes into a Dax or a dexa aggregator what they will do is back basically they will will try to check across the different liquidities on chain and of chain from their professional market makers that is quoting and making the RFK order for for the user they will compare the price with unit swap they will check what's the high what's the best price for new swaps which is why all the other MMS and then they will compare um okay this is the best order I'm going to send this to the public mempool likely as in the past how we operate the amm orders if they send into public mempool then will be broadcasted to everyone who is listening to a node and so here there's a bunch of math Searchers or basically you could call them whoever is like accessing the public amm orders will try to Arbitrage you or search search on this and submit bundles to builders another route is that if now Dex aggregator or basically the applications are submit their orders into a private mempool AKA ofas um then they'll have their OFA Searchers trying to background you you know in a much better informed and actually protected way um and then submit through bundlers and to the block Builders um so what are we what are we seeing here all these highlighted Red Blocks here um if we go next slides turns out today um in our current state is that pretty much the same entities the RFQ providers are market makers who are like professional trading firm um the toxic flow that is taking the Arbitrage on ammo liquidities are market makers map Searcher block Builders are pretty much from a bunch of big trading firms um it doesn't sound so good um next slide please um and with the coming change in our um ethereal Network potentially account abstraction bundlers and maybe uni swap X fillers can again become the same players um that's some psyops next one please so yeah one conclusion or first observation is that the order is Flowing right now through a bunch of monopolies who are basically accessing each layer or basically they are touching the order flow in each layer of the markets um next please right um so another observation here is that um with some data analysis we collected in the past um earlier this year we were um trying to do a monitoring on the public mempool and we saw that um there are a bunch of transactions that got settled through different block Builders were never seeing mempool or in the public mempool which means there's a adoption going up for the private order Flow by different Builders we can pretty much see from January to March it grew from like one two or four percent up to seven percent per block Builders and this data I assume will be only higher after all OFA launch in April um next slides please another angle of this data set is that when we look at different OFA order flow auctions transaction flow percentage out of all the evm transaction percentage we can see that pretty much like map blocker and the flashbots protect or flashbots map share are having around like five six percent of Mev sorry evm transactions um out of um out of all the transactions call Libra also have a few thousands every day getting settled um so yeah another observation is that private mempool will have adoption um going up along with the adoption of order flow auction um next one and then we look at the Block Builder market share um here the current summary will be basically it's a 2080 Market where basically a few leading winners are taking the majority of the blog inclusion share including rsync Builder Builder 69 Beaver build flashbots Builders and along with them there are a lot of new um small and uh how to say strategic Builders coming out including like Thailand f1b we also have block Sprout and blog native being playing in the blog bidding game for a while as well as important players um so pretty much we can see a diversifying of the participation of this block building game and then if we would summarize their behaviors in the next slide as a different type of Builder so we will be able to see that next slide please um so we'll be able to see that we pretty much can see a bunch of Builders they can Define they can be defined as neutral Builder flashbots runs non-profit Builder which means pretty much it's a very uh naive setting in terms of how you are transferring the profits in the in the line we're basically transferring everything to the proposer and include everything our bidding value it's mostly basically a bundle merging algorithm as of today there's also strategic Builder who are also neutral but they they may take more approach to be more competitive for example they may keep some profits from some more profitable blog when they know that potentially they're bidding higher than anyone else they may subsidize the block value when they know they're maybe slightly lower but they can win by just subsidizing a little bit they may attract also private order Flow by subsidizing and become better at inclusion rate and and we also have another big type which are I would say like the most competitive today as a block Builders which are Searcher Builder if you remember earlier we introduced this concept of like um in the math supply chain there's Searcher who are basically checking all the order flows and Mimi value or potential extractable value and then trying to bundle transactions with them as as their own private transaction flow um and then the next they will they will basically be able to submit their order flow to their build their own builder and basically to have a very exclusive amount of transaction which are highly immediate valuable so to compete with a Blog value which means those all those things are making them very competitive compared to others um next slides if you are trying to analyze or analysis their behavior on chain they may seem different for example if you are a typical Builder you're pretty much going to put your address on chain as a recipient first and then you will appear as a minor basically for this block and as of today and but then in the end of the blog you will try to transfer as much as profit you're bidding for the validator to receive um as a transaction in the end of the block but if you are a zero profit Builder you pretty much don't even need to touch any of the profits you would maybe even just set the validators fee recipient as the miner of the block basically let them to receive everything to basically also save some gas next please and when we look at the open data set that EV boost is streaming for um everyone from each relay we can pretty much see that Builders um they have different behavioral preference in terms of which really they are connected to or submitting their um blog bidding to but pretty much every Builder would want to have a higher or better coverage of different relays and then most of them submit to the three major relays like flash files and Builder 69 but we also see rsync and the blocks route there are submitting to five or even seven pretty much like every relay so to you know make sure they're competing as they're at their best um next please so there's a few more metrics here that's very interesting which is like when we talk about the time aspect of the bidding um it's a whole latency game for you to be competitive and taking the the basically like sniping at the very last uh second right before the validator is checking which block is the most profitable um so we call this validators get header timestamp which is basically whenever the validator is checking okay what's the available best uh bit I'm I'm getting right now um and they're checking with the relays and it's very interesting to see that different validators here they have different behavior in terms of when they will prefer to check the get header some may have very consistent data points of when they're going to check it and that actually very interesting uh very interestingly a result into Builders Behavior which is basically they will never actually bid from the very beginning of the slot but only at the very few minutes of a very few seconds which is when the validators will check the get header um our flashboss builder in the past were pretty naive to check since the very beginning of thought but we made some improvement after this you know realization and we updated the bidding time to be um let's say as same as wrong like minus three seconds pretty much um next one please and another aspect is that if you check um how frequent each Builder can update their bids um as basically their bidding latency next slide please um we pretty much see that this is a block box plot of different Builders updating time for the latency basically a bit updating latency chart if we Zoom to the next one we can pretty much see the number here that on the very left on the very left and on the very right beaver and rsync are the one that has the highest performance where they can update their bits within 200 milliseconds or 100 milliseconds which makes them to be able to react very fast towards the market whenever they see a price shift say on centralized exchange their Searcher will be able to prepare a new bunch of Arbitrage transactions and then update their blog from their Builders this also caused a very interesting observation in the next slide is that with some improvement in some relay like optimistic relay from ultrasound which is basically allowing the Builder to skip a few hundred milliseconds by adding some collateral deposits we are able to see that Searcher Builder especially can benefit from this Improvement large safety if we see here the blue line is a wing rate of their optimistic submission and then the orange one will be the normal one so it can be even like seven or eight times higher um when there are so many optimistically um but yeah again like right now today only Searcher Builder can benefit from this Improvement because there are only one that can react this fast and update their strategy um yeah a few last metrics about the relays relay also um as of today they are supposed to be the one that's not taking any profits from the Meb supply chain but also taking uh taking a very important role of validating the blocks they are receiving from the builders um as of today a bunch of players are running a bunch of relays the the biggest one are flashcards gnosis and ultrasounds we can see pretty much how the Sun is the leading one here with a bunch of improvements I'm taking a quarter of market share and then it's flashbots next please one very important thing is uh for Relay is that the adoption from the validator side basically how many validators are checking the bids from the relay is pretty much a metrics here to show flashbots has the highest adoption as a relay and then blocks around Max profit ultrasound analysis um next please on the time scale we can also see that like across different slot time we can see like per every 100 slots uh we can see flashcards having around like 90 and a little bit higher adoption by all the validators across a 100 slot um and then the next is blocks route Max profit and canopies and ultrasound um one last metrics here is that we can also see that the diversity of how many diversity of the builders basically how many Builders are submitting the bids towards a relay matters in terms of like how many total submission you will get naturally and also we can pretty much see ultrasound and flashbots are leading towards the right and also are leading towards the higher market share so you can see a pretty strong signal here of the correlation um yeah so next please um yeah that's a data review of all the layers of the market structures and my final note would be if you're if you're a user I should definitely check out the flashboss Protec RPC today and so to avoid uninformed Mev and potentially get refunds from our OFA service I mean share um if you're Emily share Mev serger I have a few memes for you in the end um yeah so um if you're a mini Searcher please send us bondos um if you click through the next four slides okay cool thanks
