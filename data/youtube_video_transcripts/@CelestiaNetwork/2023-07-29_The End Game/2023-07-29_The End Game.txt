hello everyone um I think we'll be joined shortly by uh floating Avatar in the universe um oh there we go okay great hand Tony yeah I hope you're having a good day Avatar sorry I haven't watched your second movie yet [Laughter] I I mean it's pretty good it is true that Anatoly does look like he could have been an extra in the Barbie movie but you know I'm not I don't know what else to say about that right now but nice nice this is my favorite cosplay for Oppenheimer yeah well you know uh as we learned today uh vitalik prefers Bob the Builder and uh maybe we'll we'll have Bob the Builder next time but um as as many of you know this panel is uh the the end game panel uh and I think uh you know part of part of this panel actually stems from last year at the last modular Summit which was sort of April 2022 so before Luna when we were all you know felt safer more comfortable less annoyed at people in the world I felt less safe before the Luna collapse that maybe that's also fair fair it's safer as in uh you know I think the debate was actually quite different at that time yeah at that time I think there was a lot more hype about monolithic architectures and modular architectures were sort of coming from behind and I would say Obviously some of the stuff that happened the last year made people people Flip or you know things change the Luna stuff like it had lots of moral lessons for me but like totally nothing to do about monolithic versus modular so I'd love to hear that kiss yeah I think that's more like app Chain versus yeah right but like okay I guess to me like Luna was not bad because all you know was monolithic versus modular or like on ethereum versus on bitcoin versus on um you know Cosmos versus Ursula or whatever right Luna was bad because it was a fundamentally bad design like the exact same design carbon copied onto ethereum would have been just as big a a collapsible failure for sure I I I'm more pointing out that at this time people were much more living in 2021 land okay this is true and and like that was when you know I think the psyche was broken right so I just wanted to say like give some context of like the last time we did this it was sort of modular was really the underdog it's like if you look through like a lot of arrows right like remember the scene where like Boromir just like gets like shut down by a bunch of work arrows at the same time and it's like you know first you have Luna and then like you got the Celsius arrow and then yeah but um and then you got the the big FTX zero and then he is kind of dying and then there's just like one extra Arrow from like what was it I guess like dcg or whatever just like shoots in yeah so so there's been a lot of arrows indeed more than three uh well all of our future arrows being beautiful diagrams there you go exactly commutative diagrams only uh you know we were all secretly category theorists I don't know I prefer non-communative because like you know we want to have progress right like we don't want to just like go from the same place all right well click clearly clearly there's already even debate about whether anything has changed since last year so maybe maybe Anatoly and Mustafa let's start with you know in the last year what uh what in the monolithic first modular worlds has changed from your minds yeah so I think like um one of the biggest changes is a year ago there wasn't really um any kind of like frame roll-up Frameworks you know those like optimism Arboretum all are kind of like optimistic Roll-Ups but there was no kind of Frameworks to to kind of create your own roll up now we have you know upstack we have arbitrim orbit roll kit as well and I think um kind of last year a lot of emphasis was the main reason why you need Roll-Ups is scalability which is true but I think there's been a what I've realized over the past year is that um one of the most underappreciated aspects of of Roll-Ups and modularity is that it gives developers more choice on freedom over the execution environments and that lets you do really cool things that just haven't fundamentally been possible before you know you can modify the evm and other ZK op code so you don't have to you know use you have it can be more efficient in the CK verification than just growth 16 and that's really good for privacy or for example you know Courier has modified the evm game engine to add their entire game as opcode on on the app stack which can be thought proven on their mips before breathing system so I think this kind of like this flexibility of execution environments um is really unappreciated and I think like might be as just as big or as as important um for impacts of the space as as the scalability aspects Anatoly I think um it's been really cool to see the development of Roll-Ups and having them ship and actually seeing their performance numbers and from my perspective I've never thought of them as scalability Technologies because fundamentally you're still limited by the bandwidth of the layer one and uh if you can't exceed that you can't really scale beyond that we can do all sorts of other tricks but that's kind of like the bottleneck and when you start scaling that piece we haven't yet seen folks go beyond what a monolithic architecture that can provide um so I think that's coming I actually am pretty bullish on uh things like like clients giving pretty close to better than honest majority assumptions between shards and all these other things so I'm excited to see for that next iteration in like the actual base layer but uh so far from my perspective like actually the the main use case for Roll-Ups is that like giving new execution environments giving new ways for devs to to build you know I a full game as a fraud provable thing I think that that's a really really cool thing vitalik any anything it's interesting because I think like pre-2019 in vitalik was fully on board with the idea that Roll-Ups are not real scalability Technologies but then like that was when I moved pretty decisively away from that Paradigm like if you read my 23 2019 stuff like I was talking about how like Roll-Ups aren't real scale because like they're not a uh like they're not a Big O notation improvements right like you know I talk about how regular blockchains are ofc like their capacity is like linear in the capacity of a computer but then like shortening is ofc squared right um but like Roll-Ups are o of c times like somewhere between 10 and 500 right and for a long time like the mathematical Purity side of myself got really hung up on that but then at some point I was like okay yeah fine like a factor of 10 to 500 is still a big deal and that like that was when well I guess and at the same time a kind of exhausted you know State channels in plasma and all of those things um that uh you know just to realize some of the fundamental limitations that they have in terms of health plasma requires every object have a logical owner and like the whole you know defragmentation problem that I mean I'm sure of Carl first was here you could tell even more about because they tried to even Implement like actually Implement that uh but uh the basically yeah like a gain of 10 to 500x is still a gain I think it is true that like in practice we've been slow on getting there one of the reasons why is because like close to half that gain comes from data compression and Roll-Ups have been pretty slow to actually Implement data compression and uh you know there's like all of these reasons of like oh well you know we don't want to have L2 nodes have to be archive nodes and like all of these things but these are they're issues that like can be engineered away and like like even evm parallelization it's like you know can be engineered and there's a difference between sort of solved in your head and like hard engineering slog solved and like that's been one of my own big big warnings about the ecosystem um so I think like to me I still look at this from the perspective of like what is this going to look like like even three years from now right because we're definitely not nowhere close to the frontier of what even currently known approaches can provide right so so with that actually uh a great great thing to talk through you know there have been multiple end game blog posts all over the internet but all three of you I'm sure have very strong views on your views of what the end game should look like um so you know maybe in your own world words Define what you think the end game of the Technologies you're really interested in should look like what kind of things should they offer users what kinds of things should they offer sophisticated actors to to who maintain them what should they not offer them and um you know I think having a having an eye towards you know where where you really think the long far future is I think vitalik's talk today ended with a very good picture of what he thinks the future is at least in terms of you know the big proof proof thing yeah yeah I mean like my view on the future is definitely that like you know we have proofs out and I think like I've used the analogy that um you know zero like succinct zero knowledge proofs are to cryptography what Transformers are to machine learning like they're like the or to AI like they're this uh one single technology that is just so powerful all by itself they just like completely you know like sweeps across Decades of hard application specific work by thousands of talented people and just says like okay you know bye bye you're gone and uh replaces with a vastly better alternative right and like that's just something that we have to adapt to right like anything that gets built today should be built with the assumption that like it's that like proofs exist as an ingredient and like that was not really part of the mindset a few years ago and like a lot of things change when that becomes part of the mindset right I mean obviously I mean like projects like you know were I think pretty early to that and uh you know had the evm been conceived even five years later it would have looked very different had I mean even the beacon chain been conceived even a few years later it would have uh I mean I worked it worked very different right like even when the beaker chain was built it wasn't really built with this uh Assumption of proofs in mind and so if we yeah half a world where we can just like assume that you know things can be proven and there's going to be a lot like everything that can be computed is going to have a light glance of it and all of those things like that in some sense like simplifies a lot of things and but um you know it still leaves open a pretty interesting design space of What kinds of things are going to exist and there's a lot of details that you can talk about yeah so typically to piggyback on that previous aspect and when I kind of like think about the end game I think about you know what is scalability and I Define scalability as three ports divided by the cost for an end user to verify the chain and so for the end game I think like how can we maximize throughput transactions reports without without increasing the end cost for the user and that's only possible thanks to you know proofs um you know data availability sampling food proofs Decay proofs um and and that should be the case even in the world where um the centralized block producers because we can still achieve the properties of a blockchain because you can still have you know censorship resistance and um verifiability even in the world where the centralized block producers um by using things like PBS and CR lists but to kind of go further I can to me the end game I see a world where the it will be easier in the future for developers to create the decentralized application by deploying a rollup chain then deploying a smart contract simply because in a world where there's proofs there's simply there's no there isn't a good strong reason for um apps that are not to directly connect with each other to be to be sharing computational resources when the computation can happen on their own environment and simply have a proof that happened correctly all right I think the biggest exception to that is composability right like yeah yeah Anatoly with that I think I think we're ready we're ready for for your end game yeah it's uh kind of interesting how different it is so I even going into the space you know five years ago I always thought that the biggest challenge was the available equal and fair availability of the data itself and this came from my experiences as kind of like amateur Trader through like interactive brokers and all these other systems whenever I had an algorithm that I thought had an edge my trades would always be a little slower and the data that I would need would always arrive a little later and I would always kind of lose and that's because I was playing in an unfair system um and the way that I designed Solana was with this idea that we have a single Global message bus and it tries to propagate all the information around the world simultaneously as fast as possible at the speed of light with this kind of like end State being that you know imagine some crazy trade event happens in Singapore that news virus Solace to travel Speedo light through fiber to a Bloomberg terminal in New York but by the time that Trader looks at it a state transition propagating through Solana already adjusted for Price impact and the price information at nizi is exactly the same as in a market running in Solana because all that data is propagating at the same time so this is a system that I Envision you know back in the day and this is kind of still what we're building we're trying to reduce block times from 400 milliseconds to 200 milliseconds we're trying to make sure that there's multiple concur block producers so you can send your transaction to the most geographically closest one there's competition for math all of this stuff gets better and better and faster and in that world what's cool is that like I think Solana obviously needs to have a lot of Hardware to do that because you're sending a lot of data you're trying to keep it all together and Roll-Ups are not going to help you you know like you're not going to improve that system by splitting up the state logically um it that those effectively create logical shards and you're not sending information globally to everyone you're sending information only to some of the folks which kind of breaks the whole point so but that system that we're building actually helps roll ups like in my ideal world all of these settlement chains that have roll ups should be all atomically sequenced in the swan giant super optimized hyper fast synchronizing engine right that's one giant Global Atomic State machine but obviously we still need trustless computation we still need to make sure that users that can't afford the hardware have some guarantees that about like honest execution of these systems and like I think the research and like clients that have been done by the folks you know like the teams on the stage has been awesome and I think in the future like Solana for Solano to function has to have those capabilities as well but the fundamental problem that I want to solve is that Global State synchronization as close to the speed of light as possible as open as possible to everyone in the world okay so let's suppose that we uh we end in a world where there's only really one settlement layer and you your chain of choice becomes an L2 of the other chain I only asked this question because anatoly's been writing a lot of tweets about putting uh you know making Solana uh making Ethan Alto Solana how how how does that I mean first of all Antelope maybe you want to explain your tweets because I I I'm I'm I personally was very confused when I read them but I was trying to uh create a I guess a straw man to demonstrate that what an L2 is is there's a mechanical component to it which is a trust a bridge was better than honest majority assumptions that functions because all the data that you need to prove that the smirkle root that's on your L1 is correct is also on the L1 so you can then run the fraud proofs you can basically or whatever a computer a ZK proof whatever whatever it is that you need to do you have all the information to validate this Merkle root which the root itself does not have anything else right it's just a just a hash um so that's kind of like you can do that with anything you can actually take ethereum L1 data right now dump it into Solana dump the state route that's computed from that ethereum data and then run an optimism style proof right to to check if fraud has occurred and then do the bisection and stuff like that does that make ethereum a Solano too mechanically yes socially no reason why is because like you know there's a saying that like you know the Sovereign is the one that decides the exception and in blockchains the exception is bugs and 51 attacks and the question is always like what what happens if ethereum hard forks for example right like if ethereum hard Forks then there is a few possibilities right like one possibility is that the Solana bridge and if we assume that it's a you know perfect ZK bridge then according to the old ck rules the ethereum chain will just start being invalid and like that bridge will just basically create its own version of you know basically its own ethereum classic 2.0 right um so that's like one but then the question is like well and you know do the assets like like what do the assets follow right and realistically in this case the assets would follow ethereum right um but you know if you get into a world where like the majority of assets are rooted onto Solana and then bridged onto ethereum then like that would that would look very different right or in other world in which right and in that case then like ethereum would not actually be capable of hard forking unless there is like some kind of Unchained governance right or a possible third world would be a world where the assets are all based on Solana but at the same time the Solana Community is willing to hard Fork whenever ethereum is willing to hard Fork right and in that case that's like a construction based off of I guess some kind of some sort of like more deeper version of on-chain governance and in that case like you could you know you would still be able to call ethereum and and L2 but it would be part of this ecosystem where sort of like things are basically yeah you know like willing to be part uh be part of the governance of each other so I think like yeah like you basically just have to look at you know like what happens if one chain or the other chain gets 51 attacked and what happens like what happens if one channel they're changing 51 percent Act and the community decides to do a like a user activated soft Fork to kill the attackers right so not like an easy slashing hard Fork but like a censorship hard Fork where the community responds by picking the minority chain and on the minority chain the uh you know the majority would have to either skip being on that chain or get slashed and if they skip being on the chips they get leaked yeah and then like what happens in that case right so the thing is though that there's always going to be subset of users that are hardcore Cipher Funk censorship resistant maximalists that will always pick this the right hard Forks they will always Fork Solana and ethereum to towards the right state so the real L1 is inside of all of us and yet another theater of the debate we've been having since 2015 you know which chain is the real ethereum who's here at the exterior classic is the real ethereum Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin yeah I think this kind of like gets too into the means of like how you define L2 or and so on and so forth versus it was a side chain but like that but this definition is aside I still think it's an interesting composition or useful to um like have a validating the bridge between Solana and ethereum would be validating like because most bridges between trust zones are not validating they just have a committee based assumption but like if if the Solana Bishop ethereum at least verified um this alone estate video I think you could and then even if the d8 wasn't on ethereum and the D A waslam and there's a committee assumption I think that would at least be um as far as I can tell the same security properties as a validium or an optimistic chain which is like a kind of like a much better scenario for like a multi-chain ecosystem so one thing that did come up in in all of these answers to to whether it's possible for one settlement layer to usurp another one and make it an L2 is uh the role of governance in these Futures in the the modular or monolithic Futures and so you know I think we've we've seen a lot of different variants of what qualifies as governance you know I think choosing a hard Fork following certain people is a sort of weak form of governance we just heard John's talk about POG which you know I I don't even I I haven't fully processed because it was spoken at high speed uh to be honest um but uh I I think like where do you view the role of governance in your preferred modality in towards the end game like how much you know how minimized is it how important is it where does it where is it necessary where is it only sufficient where is it non-necessary yeah I mean I feel I really feel like this upgrade thing Roll Up upgradability is the kind of like quote like the the core Nuance that has been a lot of debate about like um you know like um Kevin from from optimism it's arguing that all Roll-Ups are sovereign and there's kind of a very controversial statement and the reason why he argued that is because jagu is that well all roll ups can just the community follow-up can just uh upgrade the roll up ultimately what a roll-up is is what the community defines that roll up to be not the bridge but I think there's some interesting Nuance questions about like um how do we have upgradable Roll-Ups while keeping the security properties of a roll up like the only kind of like way I know about that I I know about doing so is to have an upgrade delay and allow users to mass exit which is not clear if it's not clear how practical that would be in an actual um practical scenario yeah this is a tough choice right because um I think like right now we'll Layer Two Roll-Ups are I guess there's like two camps there's sort of the more activist side and if you're on the more activist side then like I think the safe and responsible way is to like choose a delay number and like it could be somewhere between 30 and 365 days probably and uh if an upgrade happens and if you're not happy with the upgrade or if you know governance gets taken over by evil people in the upgrade involves stealing your money then like you just have to leave which is good enough for most users but it's not good enough for like really long-term applications that want to base themselves on that roll up right and then on the other side like like I know like scroll for example you know it really values the idea of like neutrality and like sticking to ethereum principles and kind of seat mirror like seeing itself as being a kind of an extender of uh ethereum land and uh like something like that would be what might be willing to like say like hey you know we're in an ad code level we're not going to be willing to like deviate from anything but being a you know a copy of the protocol spec and like if they do that then that doesn't like it takes away that risk for applications but then it also opens up this interesting question of like if ethereum itself upgrades then like how would scroll end up copying that and then this gets into like protocol questions like I know this is one of those things that's why controversial within the ethereum research team even right like there's some people that are in favor of uh in shrines Roll-Ups or like or Indian shrines like free like roll-up assisting pre-compile like basically imagine a pre-compile that just does evm validation and it just does whatever evm validation means during the specific block and like maybe you could let it like do either the current hard fork or the previous hard fork and then like in the back end clients would just Implement that by like waiting for you know like whatever their preferred zke VM proof is for example right and like if you do something like that then like you can preserve that kind of like that tight coupling for the projects that want to do that and then if you don't do something like that then like layer twos would basically need to have governance for the like Unchained governance for the sole purpose of keeping at the very least for this whole purpose of keeping up with uh whatever layer one does right so that's uh like that's one of those trade-offs like and then obviously the uh you know the the other side of this is like this kind of underexplored class of like crazier ideas where like someone creates a uh layer one where that layer one is like intentionally willing to be more um you know like activist and uh or or and like basically yeah hard fork in such um in such a way that like even while you're too like like assisting Layer Two is with um you know like um hard-working along with those kinds of changes so yeah and you know there's like a big set of possibilities in offshine governance there's a yeah obviously a big set of possibilities what's on chain governance as we see it and especially once you start like properly moving away from the coin voting stuff and uh and then there's like a a whole set of debates about use cases of governance like are you protecting against tax and that's it are you improving the protocol are you doing public goods funding right um and then if you do public goods funding then like do you do it um kind of by enshrining an Unchained mechanism or you do this kind of like retroactive off-chain thing the way that zcash does right it's like every four years they basically as far as I could tell so far they like decide you know who the public goods funders who the top level public goods finders are and then they get and then they do a hard Fork to give them the block reward and then that gets Revisited every four years which is like kind of cool in its own way right and Z cash has made the choice to be a more interventionist than ethereum and Bitcoin are but yeah I don't know it's a big design space but do you think do you think there's a way for to allow Roll-Ups to have a great upgrade mechanism but the same security properties as a roll up but without coin voting and without enshrining that roll up into the L1 because that's one of the reasons why some people are interested in solving Roll-Ups right yeah right right well I guess the challenge with Sovereign ropes is like if you start using any assets that where those assets are not registered within that roll-up right then it's like well for those assets that you can't be Sovereign right unless the uh unless you have like hyper like more activist off-game governance yeah for sure but I think like even though L1 is truly softened like you have you know usdc and usdt which is kind of like a you know a non-sovereign bridge between ethereum and circle or tether so it's definitely you know sovereignty is a spectrum yeah there's definitely a trade officer between solving Roll-Ups and not sovereign right that is true I mean you definitely could get every application to have um you know separate instances on all of the different uh Roll-Ups and so you don't like even cross roll up or kind of bridged assets don't exist anymore and then everyone can be Sovereign but uh well if you do that though like you would not be able to like eth would not be usable on Roll-Ups right because ethias uh like by definition home.etherium it needs I mean like the the major problem are zero days all these systems are too complex to not have some really fast path to upgrade and deal with this your day bug that's kind of like the end of the day like you have to I don't know how long it's going to take for us to construct something that is so simple that everyone agrees this this can be upgraded with a 30-day delay we're okay with with uh um and if you have a fast path for zero days you're kind of introducing honest majority assumptions and I think that's mostly fine if that if that's what we're dealing with I think we then have to be very very careful about how we construct those majorities should they be like well-known security firms etc etc like kind of the the proof of governance talk I think went into a lot of those considerations but but like I think it's really really tough to to avoid those I think like a couple nuances on that like one is you technically don't need like you don't technically need a fast pass to upgrade you need a fast pass to freeze and and arbitrarily solo path to finalize whether or not you're going to upgrade and then the other thing is uh like I definitely do not think that upgrade buttons should merely be a majority right if it's merely a majority then like whatever proof system you're doing technically has no votes right and you know you might uh it's uh like I think you need to have at least a 75 threshold so that says uh I mean the thing that I've been pushing for the stage one definition obviously um but like I do think that being greater than 50 greater than 50 is uh important because otherwise like it's mathematically true that the code itself has no votes um and then well the other thing is I guess one of the ways that the ethereum ecosystem is doing this as they are doing this kind of like inversion thing right like where like I know some of the Roll-Ups want to do this right they want to have multiple ZK VM implementations and then the security Council only gets activated if at least uh what like one of them disagrees with the other or something like that which is I think an interesting path too as long as the implementations are being built independently enough yeah I I I think like at some level it seems like everyone thinks that there is some necessity of governance at the bare lease and bare minimum but it may be sort of to summarize like in some ways synchronizing multiple chains in the case of the modular world or in anatoly's view of the world kind of response measurement now maybe let's take a tiny tiny detour uh imagine you had to can come up with a compliment for the architecture that's the opposite of the one that you like like you had to find some something really fair like you know you were just your your your your your life depended on coming up with a really good compliment for the other architecture what would you what would you say to your to your fellow developer I mean speaking of Salon specifically I mean the way I see it is that is trying to build the way I see it is um scalability ultimately has a has trade-offs between scalability and composibility and um so like even you know ethereum Centric roadmap you have liquidity effect but some liquidity fragmentation let's say like optimism and orbitrim but the way I see it is like Solana is trying to trying to see as much how much throughput we can get as much as possible without any compressibility sacrifices whatsoever um you know that's why Anatoly doesn't see Roll-Ups as a scaling mechanism because it defeats the properties of the system he's trying to create which is like basically as if I understand the vision is like you know decentralized version of the New York Stock Exchange but so I do appreciate well you appreciate Barcelona is that you know they've made some great advancements in kind of execution environments you know the parallelized execution environment you know that's a massive um Improvement um and I do I appreciate that um like Solana is actually taking trust minimization a bit more seriously over the past year you know there's been some work and some proposals over trying to create like clients and Implement Ford proofs for Solana and you know even some proposals to to see how we can add data availability something to the Lana yeah I mean I appreciate that you know there's a strong Tactical Team and I appreciate the uh willingness to just like say here's a subset of use cases that kind of we understand we're passionate about and you know we're going to like basically optimize and like we'll be willing to make the be willing to make trade-offs to do the best that we can for them and totally um well I think the data availability sampling and the whole fraud proof construction is like beautiful design it's awesome so and that actually is like I think came out of the research of both both of the the teams here so pretty cool and like uh the really cool thing is that like everything's open source as soon as those folks had really good ideas I was able to understand them and start thinking about how apply them to the Solana stock if we if we fast forward you know to kind of applications that you find interesting uh either within ecosystems that you're working in or uh sort of maybe even in the other ecosystems what are some applications you're you're interested in in 2023 and 2024 that will be used you know I think a lot of ECC this year at least from my perspective has been quite a bit of infrastructure seeing a lot of updates on you know how certain proving systems are working you know understanding how those developments have have moved on but we do at some point have to have to find some other applications on them you know obviously you all probably have tons of examples of these that you're most interested in what are they yeah I mean I think um like in the short term there's kind of like being some really crazy progress in like gaming kind of Roll-Ups you know like cure your managed to kind of like run a real-time strategy game with a 0.5 second take engine using a modified evm that adds that part of the game as opcode and there's okay all of stuff like you know August and all the teams are working on interesting game engines now I don't think you know gaming is the kind of like ultimate you know purpose or like the most you know real world case of crypto but I think historically what we've seen you know even in competing a lot of advancements in Computing has compound gaming you know for example the concept of sharding actually originated from gaming so yeah I'm just kind of interested in following those developments there and I think in the long term they will have you know significant impacts on applications outside of outside of gaming as well um I kind of like want the OG application to come back like I want people to like pay for coffees with like if you know yeah like remember back in 2013 when like this was the whole the big thing and like I would I remember this was actually the very start of like my Bitcoin trip around the world um where we would uh have uh like I went to Boston and I went on a pilgrimage to a veggie Galaxy and Thelonious monkfish because those were the two restaurants that accepted Bitcoin and then you know we had the Bitcoin Keats over in Berlin and like York plots are got like 10 restaurants and a block to accept it like I want that culture to come back and I think a big part of the reason it died is obvious which is like these got too high but like you know the original pitch back then is like hey this is cheaper than PayPal but then it stops being cheaper than PayPal but it was a roll up so like it actually will be again which is amazing right and like I would love to see some of um you know those amazing OG things that we did back then come back now that you know the world is or the ecosystem is starting to be ready for them yeah I think I think that will definitely happen like we're seeing Banks already using usdc for settlement I think that will eventually be exposed to the end user um like it's being used kind of on the back end but it will eventually be exposed to the end user I'm impressed need none of these applications so far have had any Advanced cryptography so uh Anatolia the payments privacy preserving but okay Anatoly yeah I would say like simple things like payments and defy I guess D5 can be very complicated but I think both of those really serve the two fundamental things that crypto provides and that self-custody and this idea of a global source of truth right for pricing or the ability to transact I think those are very transformative at scale if you have everyone in the world that now has cryptographic keys that they know can move value around everything else can be built on top of that you know like real world governance right like if you if everybody knows that like we can all communicate and coordinate with cryptography we can actually build very quick fast Global political movements that can take on action and solve real world problems I think but the foundation is that like cryptographic base of users that get self-custody get what they're doing they know like what this thing means so yeah the simple things I'm on vitalik's Camp here well I mean you know we are in France and uh D5 is the French word for challenge okay fine it's pronounced but like come on like more generally also interested in experimentation around bells and kind of like form ways of organizing people on chain there's like this there's um a lot of different kind of proposals defy refi disco dials um a lot of interest I'm kind of like excited to see how that goes as well my last question which is a false trichotomy but you have to pick an answer anyway which is Barbie Oppenheimer or you think it's really bad that we're lionizing Oppenheimer via a movie I choose Bob the Builder I'm sorry I forgot Bob the Builder I forgot Bob the Builder I want to see like the the crypto space come up with its own like epic you know like you know like we've had songs right like uh you know remember there were Bitcoin songs Back Then There was um like that that uh um love you like like a Bitcoin parody that like continues to be one of my favorite songs to this day like it's actually good as a song despite being a parody there's uh I think I didn't like Simon De La Revere write a novel at some point that like yeah like I'm like I would love to see just like us come up with a uh a movie that is like you know uses themes from these you know that we care about but it's like actually good as a movie at the same time I unfortunately saw that there was an online TV show about SBF so maybe that's not the right type of movie but uh it is it is that is coming out it's an animated short I see it in Oppenheimer for a different cause yeah the price is definitely you know Anatoly I mean you look like you're ready to be in the Barbie movie so like you gotta have some opinions here this is me cosplaying famine so definitely Oppenheimer all right well thanks everyone for joining us it's been a great day of talks we talked a lot about the public broadcasting system of the US I mean sorry proposer Builder
