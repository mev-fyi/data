everyone's talking about intense but I think there's still a bit of an information Gap you know it's like the early stages of people figuring out and understanding what they are and um you know the the three speakers that we invited today all gave talks at research Day in May and if you haven't watched those talks I'd really encourage you to do so and I think I don't know if they coordinated this or not but I would say that they successfully nerd sniped everyone that was at the conference uh on intents and something that was kind of something that people were already talking about became really the topic of the hour and so I'm really excited to have these three speakers on with us today because they each have a really good view and luckily we also have Henry from a number who I guess just joined and hopefully we can include in parts of this conversation I first encountered the idea of intent so I picked up the a copy of the Noma white paper in uh at Cosmo verse last year and then I I re-read it on the flight home or rather I tried to read it and I remember the idea of intent stuck out to me as something that was very uh novel and made a lot of sense but like just I only understood the surface level and then like when I try to go deeper I got completely lost um and so I've been you know learning a little bit more about intense over the coming over the last few weeks and months as I think everyone else who's probably on this Twitter space have been as well but I think the goal of today's Twitter space is to answer the question you know WTF are intense and like why do they matter like what what what do people need to know about them especially all the builders in the audience and so yeah I couldn't think of a better guests to have on to answer this so why don't we go ahead and do a round of introductions uh from each of you and then we can dive into the the meat of this uh conversation okay um zucky long time Cosmonaut long time blockchain Builder co-founder of familiar uh yeah one of the people I gave a nice like 10 minute uh intense talk at uh at research day which I think is a fairly digestible um like what the are intense talk yeah I can go next uh I'm Uma I'm one of the co-founders of succinct we're a company focused on more secure and more General interoperability uh and I also give a talk at research day talking about cross-chain interop bridging and intense and how it all comes together and Zaki was actually one of the big original Inspirations for my even starting thinking about intents oh that's really sweet I didn't know that yeah it was all from your uh group chat telegram messages about intents and being excited and I was like oh yeah I should look into this and then we have the OG nerd sniper of all Chris uh well I that that is that is a title I do not deserve I I credit myself only with abstract philosophical nonsense and then later on other people assign coherent meanings and I just get to claim that I was right all along um yeah I'm Christopher I've worked previously on IBC for the cosmos project and I now work on anoma which does either use the word intent although I guess I'd like to like you know we in no way aim to assert a monopoly over that word um you know we've been using it for a while because it's a helpful design concept for us but I think one reason the intent meme is is so popular is that it ends up being kind of a way to describe uh commonalities between a lot of these systems and what they're trying to do in perhaps different specific ways so you know we just want to contribute to that discourse amazing okay so let's jump in um I want to start with the the most basic basic question which is what are intents like what would a good definition of intents be and what problem do they solve I'll take a shot um though so my uh my Okay so I like to start with what problem they solve rather than like what they are because I feel like the best like that's the clearest explanation of the of the of of what an intent is is like why would you need this like hey uh you know millions of people are like sitting there with their meta masks uh clicking through transactions happily uh uh and like using blockchains and it's great um you know when when I like when we you know three four years ago is like there were like hundreds of people using blockchains and now there's millions and that that does seem like progress um Okay so but like and a lot of this to me came from so similier is this uh sort of uh app that's designed is this is this framework or or protocol or application for making defy easier to use um especially like complex D5 things like uh providing liquidity on a decks uh um running like a leverage strategy that kind of stuff we try to make these more accessible and I think we've like succeeded assuming someone can actually get into one of our smart contracts um and that seems to be like the hardest usability barrier that we've that we encountered uh when we as we were building some Lea is it's you know you you you start out with a user and the user is like I have some coins somewhere they're like I have a coin on a centralized exchange I have a coin on an L on ethyl one I have a coin on uh item coins on l2s I have a coin on I have Adams I have uh usdc on any number of chains like the answer to the question is like okay like cool I have these things and they're like I want to use like I want to use your app I want to uh get the benefits of having my money in real yield eat uh you know turning you might eat into more eat um but like people are like how do I do this uh all right now like depending on where you are you might have to like send your money to like a wallet on chain you got to send it to the right chain you got to have the right type of coins uh you might have to use a DEX or a centralized exchange to swap this um you might have to bridge your coins between chains um you have to use the right bridge to end up with the right asset um you know you might have to use IBC inside of Cosmos like any of these we have all these different answers um and basically you know there's been a bunch of problems with that one is just like how do I navigate it's like it's amazing to me that anyone successfully does this um you know we just like I remember I was helping last night um someone from uh the eats Community who wanted to buy a bad kid on Twitter and he was like how do I buy a bad kid he's like this is the hardest problem with computer science and I like I showed him some apps and stuff like that but he just wanted to buy a bad kid he had eat and he was like how do I do this and it was you know a totally unsatisfactory answer you know we have meme coins where like uh you know large numbers of people come on you know they hear about some meme coin they want to buy it it's only available on decentralized Exchange um and like they get they lose money to Mev Bots uh they have to know about gas uh it's a it's like you know this is this is to me like oh like we've built all of this amazing infrastructure but like this is the usability story that we've presented people with and it's like clearly a fail so okay Chucky though like this is the problem the problem is like we don't have good enough uis we don't have a good enough UI Frameworks meaning we don't have enough services like we have all these Mystic pieces um and so like we tried to build that for stability a we tried to build like routers to Route people into our contracts we spent lots of money on this they kept losing money on slippage it was like it's been a never-ending nightmare there are certainly better routing Frameworks from teams like enso coming out um but like it's still it's pretty difficult and then like when you add the cross chain piece to this it becomes like an unsolvable nightmare okay so that's the problem statement the problem statement is all right we built all these amazing blockchains uh you know they're scalable they're fast they can handle large transaction volume but no one could use them how do we solve this um and the idea is that we could build infrastructure where people could say I I'm willing to trade X for y I'm trying I have some usdc and I want to buy Pepe um and like I'm willing to trade it for at least like you know I want a minimum of this much Pepe for my for for my usdc they would be able to like sign a statement and then if and some off-chain actor figures out how to get uh uh Pepe into their account provides a proof like over a bridging protocol um you know something that is identifying your knowledge proof something like that that is available to a Smart contract smart contract reason it says yep as promised you like provided this much Pepe you can claim the user's usdc and the idea is the user doesn't need to know about gas and then if we can construct these things correctly maybe the user gets a refund for some of the Mev that they created um that's that's what what kind of a simplified description in my mind of what intents are was that a financial advice by the way buying Pepe uh no I I have no idea about what meme coin I am I am bad at trading meme coins I don't know how I do believe that that is a legitimate use case for a blockchain I do believe that that like I think we should like meet our users where they are and if our users cannot buy their Pepe and that's what they want uh we have failed them absolutely okay so it sounds like that's a that's a really good motivation for intense it sounds like you see it as a way to solve a lot of user experience problems that like coming from a completely different angle than the traditional approach which is like you know we need to build better wallets uh Etc it's like well actually just build a system where the users actually don't interact that much with the guts of blockchains but that's the same just to like quickly say this is it's like I get I I become frustrated with the idea that like oh like ultimately like you're you're describing a wallet that basically knows everything that like a market maker knows knows about tracking prices it's tracking gas it's tracking Arbitrage opportunities it like knows fair prices for things and like I'm skeptical of anyone's actual ability to build that okay so oh Henry you sound like you want to say something but I guess I was just gonna jump in and say like they're sort of your cone I think draws to this question of like okay what is a wallet right um and one of the things that I think is kind of interesting to do in this ecosystem is like imagine you're like looking at it and you just kind of like defocus your eyes and like let things like blur a little bit and see like what are the areas where things blur into other things and how could the boundary like there are all these if you take any component of the system and zoom in on it there's going to be a bunch of complexity there and if you like zoom in you can say oh it has the XYZ internal parts right but it's an interesting exercise to kind of like let your vision blur like lose sight of what are the boundaries between these different things and how could those boundaries be possibly reconstituted right like what what is a wallet even and could it be that if you build this whole kind of like intense settlement like system um where oh well it turns out that means you're effectively like building in like the capabilities of a market maker maybe that actually just is sort of a part of this like bigger like wallet assemblage um interesting I mean it sounds like I think that's the common through line there is that we need to kind of like take just take a step back and and re reevaluate some of like the base assumptions of like how we want to build blockchains and like what what the different components do and should be responsible for um I want to ask like uh I want to turn over to Chris and Uma to also take a stab at like describing what what our intents and and why they matter yeah I can I can also take a shot at it I think Zaki motivated the reasoning for him getting into thinking about this really well and I also had a really similar experience so it's succinct we're trying to do like interoper better more secure interoperability and we are fundamentally right now building this like really secure messaging protocol and for myself to operate our protocol we need to like run relayers across a bunch of different chains and I would say it's like a fairly sophisticated user I would dread managing all my balances across all these different Roll-Ups and that was me as a fairly sophisticated user there's all these problems around which bridge should I use which is the fastest like where do I go for each different chain and then I think moving towards this app chain world or app roll-up world the problems get so much worse because it's unrealistic to expect any one company to maintain all these Integrations so say you have a bridge aggregator coming out well how are they going to maintain in this really long tail of Integrations and it feels like fundamentally some things something's broken here uh I think in terms of defining or starting to Define what is an intent I think we've already talked a lot about the problem and I think the fundamental problem is today transactions are very declarative so if you think about something like I want to buy a particular coin on uniswab for this price that's saying I'm going to specify the venue at which I trade I'm going to specify which chain I traded on and I'm going to specify like my other parameters and and there's like very multi-domain World say you're trying to get like the best execution price across across a variety of venues as a user like you shouldn't need to specify like oh I want to do this much of a trade on this roll up and this much of the trade on this other roll-up because the liquidity is like better for these reasons and so I think an intent is where a transaction is like declarative and specifying like all this stuff like what then you want to do stuff on how much you exactly want to do an intent is like saying you're specifying what you want your outcome to be so basically like I have some coins now and I want these other coins like I want my puppy coin and someone else basically figures out like the best venues the best execution the timing wherever that is and then they do all that stuff for you they're a sophisticated actor and then they help fulfill your intent so I think like going towards kind of a definition that's I guess not very mathematically precise but more like philosophical is transactions are declarative and the onus is really on the user whereas intents are users expressing what they want the end state to be and then other people figure out how to get there it's interesting that I feel it sounds like a lot of the people who are most bullish are on intense uh or have encountered them are the people who have worked most closely with cross chain systems and like we can talk about that more uh later on but it's interesting to notice that pattern you know I feel like maybe people who only you know live on one chain don't don't experience these pain points quite as acutely Chris you want to take a stab at uh defining intents yeah uh so you know I think Zaki and and Uma did a great job going over sort of the Practical ux reasons why you might want to think about system design this way and I am a big fan of of what Henry mentioned you know zooming out and blurring your eyes or so to speak so to do a little bit of that I mean personally I guess I came at the concept of intense originally from just thinking about what coordination systems do and the you know the like OG coordination system that we all exist under the Aegis of is natural language right and if you think about like in the Noma one of the inama papers which contains lots of mistakes please don't treat take its Canon but I think we use the example of hunters trying to encircle a deal a deer which is maybe not something many of us do in this conversation and I'm vegetarian but like in principle um if you are trying to encircle a deer with other Hunters what you need to communicate with them in order to coordinate your action is a bunch of preferences and plans right you need to communicate all these internal states that aren't visible in the external World which you all observe so you're communicating something about internal States in a particular you're communicating what you want and kind of what you are able to or plan to do so that you want to like kill this deer or this other deer and that you're able to shoot this Arrow or you know move in this direction your current position is X right stuff like this so you know typically those in in just English as far as I know would be referred to as intentions or something like this or a shortened version intense so that is how I got the word um at least personally when I was writing with it um you know I think different you know the re intense can seem probably nebulous and abstract and maybe even like marketing um and I'm sure that sometimes it is that as all words are but um to me you know to kind of generalize over what people seem to be using the term to refer to uh I would say Intense or or you know commitments that are incredible commitments to preferences over the state space of a system and there are different systems with different state spaces right so like ethereum or ethereum plus some Roll-Ups or you know Celestia or some Cosmos chains you can kind of Define the boundaries of the system in different ways and then to say like to to view that system from an intense perspective is to say that okay intense Define some preferences a user has over the state space of like future possible executions of a system um and then what we want to do in matching intense and settling is to find ways that we can satisfy multiple users preferences that also you know satisfy the constraints of the system itself uh you know that like the signatures are checked or kind of the linearity we want to be enforced for forced and then settle those appropriately such that we can make a credible promise that the user's preferences are respected right that if they said X and Y and Z and intent that the system actually does X and Y and Z or it does something that satisfies the preferences they've described or nothing right so we want this kind of uh correct atomicity guarantee and I I mean here not Atomic in the sense of like Atomic multi blockchain or something that is related but a distinct concept just Atomic in the sense of either the intent is settled and the user's Express preferences are respected or it's not right and you can you know anoma I guess takes uh takes the view of this definition that also includes privacy so our definition of intent is something like uh commitment to a credible commitment to preferences over the you know also over the state space of the system but where the state States the system here is kind of redefined to include who knows what right so it's almost a commitment to information future information flows in the system um and that's I guess we're kind of going after the general definition because we think that's an interesting question but I don't think it's uh you know that's not the end-all BL I think that the concept of intent is uh useful because it allows you to describe the relation between a user of the system and the system itself very well uh in that the user can say what they care about specifically as opposed you know they care about things that they can measure and the intent can express the measurements the outputs they care about from the system and they might not care about a lot of details of execution or they might care about kind of you know properties of those execution traces but not the exact traits right you know in a system like uh uh oh I don't want to front run Henry but as far as I understand in the system like penumbra users might care about something like the fairness that all intents settled within one batch however that's defined uh gets like the same price as the price is calculated fairly is the midpoint something like this so that's an example of a property of an execution path but not an exact one I think that would be my definition I like that incredible commitments of preferences over the state space of a system uh I think I got that right um I think that's a really that sounds like a very um kind of complete and like specific definition um now we have that sort of the ground you know ground kind of covered background established I want to ask something that I think a lot of people have been wondering and I've noticed people bring up a lot in the the Twitter sort of discourse which is uh what is the difference between intense and things like account abstraction that you know a lot of people have been talking about for a while or things like pay masters like or also some people say oh well you know limit orders are just intense like why do we need this new term like how how are intense different to some of the things that like already exist or people have been talking about I think um I spoke a lot about this in my research day talk about how account abstraction and intense are related so I think a town abstraction basically is this way or it's this protocol and it can help enforce like very specific intents so like take a really concrete example of I want a rate limit on a smart contract wallet like for example I only want a thousand dollars per month to leave my account that's like an intent right it's not a declarative transaction you're enforcing some preference over the state space to go back to Chris's terminology uh you're saying like oh any state space which like at the end of the month has more than a thousand dollars living in my account is like not acceptable to me and then the smart contract wallet has like logic in it to enforce that intent so I think account abstraction is just a spec for a smart contract wallet and in particular like it can enforce very specific intents that relate to the state of your account so it can enforce like a rate limit or things like social recovery and then it has this concept of like a pay Master to help deal with intense around gas so hey say you have an intention that's like I don't want to pay for I want to pay for gas in usdc and I want to reimburse someone else for gas well you can enforce that in this way with like the account abstractions spec but fundamentally I think account abstraction is a spec and it's a protocol in service a very specific intense and so it's pretty limited and for anyone who's looked at erc4337 I think the spec is very long and winding and complicated because basically I think the creators took real like let's say five common user intentions that they want to enforce like rate limits social recovery gas abstraction and then they stuffed it into this protocol and then they for each part of the protocol like the paymaster or the smart contract wallet validation enforces each of those intents specifically and it's not like a very general system like it's kind of brittle and I think if you look at all the account obstruction diagrams it's really complicated because they kind of worked backwards from Hey I want to enforce these very specific intents how can I make the protocol do what I want to do in a way that's compatible with like ethereum so I think in that way it's kind of ugly and like not General enough and for example in a con abstraction it does not help you solve the problem of okay I have eth on ethereum and I want to get the best price as much Pepe as possible trading across a variety of venues and across a variety of l2s roll ups app chains whatever I think like the biggest problem with account abstraction is that it's a single domain protocol and I think a lot of what intents solve is actually like dealing with multi-domain stuff so I think account abstraction tldr is like in an intent specific app is what I called it in the talk and I think it just doesn't solve a lot of the problems with multi-domain that I do think intents do solve because that account abstraction was designed in this very single domain way so I don't I think intents are like a very useful abstraction and even more useful in the cross-domain world in a way that account abstraction is like I think very fundamentally flawed so yeah it kind of Attraction is sort of like a a limited like subset of like intense intense is like a much more General wider uh concept that can Encompass a lot more user experiences and uh is like inherently like cross-domain rather than single domain um that makes a lot of sense anyone else have any takes on this question um uh Eli krinsky made a really good point to me which was one thing that it might be very familiar to like at least defies to other users is like the concept of a liquidation right and so uh a liquidation is basically uh like you you know when you have like say uh like a a vault on maker right and you're like hey I've I've locked up some eth I've been some die basically you bind that Vault to an intent that says that like if the price of eth follows below a certain place like you have the right like someone has the right to like take the eats out of my Vault um and sell it for die uh to pay back the debt um and like what were what what I think has gotten people excited about intense is that we've been like you know from like seeing you know billions and billions of dollars of liquidations happen in D5 successfully to you know seeing these like off-chain actors that are in the account abstractions back to seeing like how much stuff is happening in the Mev space with like uh actors like uh uh uh inferring intents from users transactions uh and then acting on them and bundling them and extracting Mev from them and all this stuff we real like there is this whole Rich ecosystem of off-chain actors and the question is is can we align those off-chain actors with like users goals such that like we can make the entire blockchain ux you know 100x better I like that yeah and in fact uh I I kind of like did an overheard tweet uh basically that was like something that you had said which is that uh intense turn toxic order flow into like non-toxic order flow and they turn bad Crossing ux into like good crash into X so I think yeah that um that all really like checks out um Henry you were raising your hand did you want to jump in yeah just to add on to something that um Uber is saying about um and also you mentioned about uh sort of in a cross chain world the problem appears more naturally one thing I would say about that is I think the reason is that if you're in a kind of like mono chain uh paradigm fundamentally the idea is okay my transaction is going to specify here is the execution that I want to happen and I know that that is going to all get executed at once and what order it gets executed in okay people can you know mess around play games with me but like within that execution and I'm specifying that very uh directly um and in a cross chain context uh you you suddenly have all kinds of asynchronous execution where some stuff has to happen in this part of the system some stuff has to happen in that part of the system maybe those different parts or different chains that are communicating asynchronously and so you don't get the same kind of uh either this entire transaction succeeded or failed and I like locked the entire world uh to make it happen and so the reason that this sort of like intense predicates uh solution kind of naturally appears in that context is that that's the way that you kind of recover from the introduction of asynchrony yeah the intense is sort of a way to uh you don't when you don't have atomicity maybe there's a way there's still a way to sort of like guarantee that what you wanted to happen does end up happening even across all these domains is that kind of what you're saying yeah like um you know taking suppose I'm executing a transaction on ethereum right in in some sense I'm like buying too much I'm like paying through gas to stop the entire world and everything has to stop hold on I'm doing something hey everybody else to not do anything so that I can get the property that I want out of my transaction but I'm I'm I'm paying for way too much synchronization there I I don't actually care about like did somebody like mint an a penis T at the same time that I did my swap no but because there's no way for me to express any kind of um sort of criteria about what executions are acceptable as a as a user in that type of Monolithic system the only way for me to get predicates that I desire is to pay everybody else to stop the world um yeah I like that I mean when you frame it that way it makes it sound just like it kind of crazy that that's how things currently work um I haven't the next question is for for Chris which is um now we we have an idea of like how intense like what they are how they're different to other things that exist now like what do we have to change in the way that we build blockchains or build the systems around blockchains to make this possible um and I know you at NoMa have been working on this for years now so I'm really curious what how you see that and like what what are the pieces that are missing what needs to change how deep does this change need to go do we need to go all the way to like the very core of like uh you know how these systems work or is it something to just kind of add on to the surface right it's a good question I mean I think one interesting aspect of you know the way the the intents are playing out at least at the moment is it seems like they're kind of at least this Frame is kind of inevitable that even if you start out you know ethereum for example was originally designed under the banner of uh you know a world computer and I think that it's easy to actually kind of underestimate the importance of that concept like I think that concept framed a lot of things that happened in ethereum and a lot of like where it draws inspiration from in terms of you know building a sort of annoyman virtual machine how it thinks about politics in terms of building a kind of single Central you know not that everyone thinks this way necessarily right I just mean in Broad strokes but in terms of building a kind of a single group of trust and then a hierarchy of different trust domains which all kind of settle to the root I think that you know that concept very in uh very uh was very relevant to how the structure of that ecosystem and protocol ended up evolving over time um but despite that uh it seems like an intense system is coming to exist on top of ethereum or in the ethereum ecosystem more broadly um so I think that to some extent uh you know this is perhaps dictated by uh you know protocol political economics or something like this like people are always going to use these systems when they have preferences that's just what the value of coordination is in the first place if you didn't need to agree with other users on settling your preferences together you don't need you know a a coordination system like a blockchain so I think that the Sun the kind of economic structure of it is a little bit inevitable but there can be many different uh you know that still what actually happens and what order is pretty path dependent um in one you know for us it's very important that like we end up with an intent implementation as in we broadly you know Humanity ends up with access to an intent implementation that is uh compatible with privacy or that doesn't require that information is always revealed to the world so let's put it that way um and many of the current Phantom limitations just don't have this property which is totally understandable because privacy is hard and it wasn't perhaps so clear initially that it would be such a key problem but I think that it's essential if we want the assistant to actually work and depending on how you define intent it actually becomes part of the definition but um so to my mind that's kind of one thing that uh the current systems typically don't have of course you know something like penumbra coming soon uh is an exception to this uh even something like like you can think of something like Z cash is like an extremely extremely specific implementation where the intents are only I want this other person to have more money in their account right transactions are intense they're just intents that have like an exact constraint on the path um so I would say privacy is one thing that has to change um to give a you know I think many things like that exist in the world like the evm are kind of actually orthogonal to intense Centric architecture designs as far as I understand them like they're not correct or bad they're just sort of specific implementation choices like their equivalent to CPUs right so you might have different programs and those programs are written for some you know in some uh typically more abstract language that provides or promises higher level properties and then you compile them down to specific sets of CPU instructions and those are physical systems they have some like you know very specific physical trade-offs and costs and stuff and I would see something like the evm as kind of like a CPU it's virtualized but it plays the same as the same relation to an intent architecture as uh you know something like a Haskell program does to an x86 chip that you could also make another C CPU and it would like execute some programs faster if some programs slower or something like this but it doesn't change what the programs mean and it doesn't change what has to be done in order to execute them correctly as in you could take a program and execute you know write a compiler for a different CPU and then you know it might be faster or slower but it would still be the same program so I think a lot of stuff is kind of like that one area and you know might be supplanted by things that are slightly faster but isn't really you know is like sufficiently compatible that it will work at least for a while and maybe the optimizations aren't necessarily important for everything although I think for privacy the sends it being yeah not easy to make privacy APM compatible but um the other just to highlight one other area that I think needs to change a lot is peer-to-peer Network designs um if you look kind of zoom out at least it's my my impression if you zoom out of where different parts of the blockchain research literature are in relation to kind of where they need to be I think the thing that is furthest behind is peer-to-peer Network designs uh you know cryptography is pretty clear how to do general purpose programmable privacy it's pretty clear how to do distributed consensus distributed systems it's pretty clear how to do you know distributed database optimization and special case roles and stuff roll up architecture and different kinds of modular scaling and I think peer-to-peer networks have just been kind of Forgotten and unfortunately the state of designs is not very good when you want to think about a heterogeneous security kind of privacy preserving intense Centric World in particular there's this sort of dichotomous framing in the literature between structured and unstructured networks so structured networks are ones where you have some specific idea of which nodes are connecting to which other nodes and unstructured networks are ones where every all the connections are random right like a DHT it's typically an unstructured Network and ethereum for example the ethereum peer-to-peer layer the tenement peer-to-peer layer basically all blockchain peer-to-peer layers in existence as far as I know are unstructured and assume that all nodes receive all messages and this doesn't make sense in a heterogeneous security intense Centric world or even just across domain world you don't want all nodes to receive all messages you want some nodes to receive some messages and you want them to kind of discover network topologies over time but also maintain as a discover optimize topologies over time but also maintain some resiliency so you kind of need to exist you know as far as as far as we think at least you need to exist in between these structured and unstructured designs and there just is no research precedent for this uh that we have found it needs to be kind of designed from scratch it's more of a cybernetic networking approach I guess I found this old thing called the recursive internet Network architecture that was someone's alternative proposal for tcpip and it seems kind of related but that's the only thing I found so I think that's one area to maybe give some more attention to well there's a lot to impact there but I know that uh and we should definitely talk more about privacy too especially as intenders here but I see uh Zaki and Uma are raising their hands so either one of you feel free to jump in yeah Chris that's really interesting that you think the um P2P layer needs the most work so I guess one question for you just thinking through this is do you think a design or the proposal kind of or discussion for a Suave like structure where it seems like the design is that you have one network that is surfacing kind of all these preferences and intents for all these different domains do you think that's kind of untenable uh and is the concern there that basically like the amount of volume and throughput that would be required for one network to process like all of the intense intents across all domains is just not possible or yeah I'm curious how you um given what you said about the network topology not yet be needing to be different what do you think of like Suave right um I mean two two I guess can't figure out this I am not an expert on Suave and I get somewhat different Impressions sometimes when I talk to different people so perhaps the version I'm that I understand is not the one true Suave I mean um I think if if Suave is kind of one specific Place One location uh perhaps you know operated in a decentralized fashion but one logically centralized location where all intents get matched and then they go elsewhere for settlement yes I think that design is untenable um or that topology rather is untenable I mean I think because you know kind of to Henry's point because you're paying for this all this like in some sense you're paying for this uh Central logical centralization that you don't actually need because many intensors have nothing to do with one another right many intents are dealing with completely you know they're dealing with different security domains they're dealing with different parts of state they're dealing with different capabilities different users uh you know that just don't need to ever interact with each other like in principle and if you make them interact with each other by trying to have one central location then you're just paying for all this like you're paying for the intents to be broadcast to all of all your intents to be broadcast to all of the SWA validators or something like this and you're going to be limited by the throughput of that system and there's going to be one like Central Target even if it's operated in a decentralized way for for you know someone trying looking to co-opt the system to go after also it just seems like if you think about the Practical implications it just seems weird to me like if if you are settling intense in some specific area like I want to have my conference Burning Man conference right I shouldn't call it a conference but I want to have my my you know local events and we're going to create our own uh way on for the event and we're going to do some you know intent settlement for like exchange of physical food or something like this like why would I send my intent to to some global settlement system or the global sorry Global intent matching system it doesn't make a lot of sense to me yeah so I I don't think that like to be clear I think SWA what Suave actually proposes to build you know building maybe a a faster system for ethereum and designing it in a way or designing like ways to map the idea of an intent to the evm I think that's very useful I just don't it's not it's not like it's not going to be the one true place where all the intents go if uh you know as I understand the economics at least it's going to be like maybe there's a you know Suave has a nice uh Network and kind of a nice language for intense in a way that it's evm compatible which you know that seems very useful to me and I would imagine like lots of intentions way there but not everything and in particular one you know I guess maybe a practical challenge at least you know the way that we've kind of thought about things as far as we know is that it is really hard to make long-term privacy ethereum compatible or evm compatible uh because the ebm just didn't think about this from the get-go and it's it you know privacy is not a feature that you can add onto systems after you've designed them uh almost ever uh it's something you have to include from the get-go and I think Aztec for example also has basically decided not to build not to try and build a private evm as far as I know nobody is so I think that's very difficult um but you know what Suave suave's like temporary privacy for intent solving in sgx uh I think is very helpful and is also compatible in principle with privacy launcher privacy preserving systems so I hope to see kind of interoperation there the only other thing I would say is that um you know to kind of uh perhaps provide a tangible aspect to the part of a peer-to-peer networking that I brought up earlier um one the reason I think it's important to come up with a good General protocol for for peer-to-peer networking is that it would allow these systems to compose more cleanly so at the moment there's like the ethereum mempool and there's you know the cosmos have mempool the osmosis mempool and the you know blah blah there are like a million different mentals and they're all separate uh unstructured networks they're like separate if you think of the system is a bunch of circles they're like separate circles and then there are specific lines in between which are sort of specific Bridges or relays or nodes like in ibc's terminology relayers but nodes who are copying messages from one Circle to another Circle um and that is when you zoom out and and squint uh you see that this is kind of just really a Venn diagram right and you have all of these cement pools and people are sometimes sending messages to one mempool that doesn't impact another mempool and sometimes they're sending messages to one-man pool that uh sending a message that does impact another man pool rights you have this all this kind of partial overlap and I think if we design the peer-to-peer networking part well we can get a protocol that does all of this so instead of there being uh uh you know 50 million men pools or whatever there's one member protocol that handles these kind of partial overlap scenarios and handles heterogeneous security and maybe even you know some stuff related to privacy and then everyone can configure that in the way that they want they can configure that with their validator set or their specific like intent acceptance criteria rules for which messages to accept from whom and how to relay them and stuff like this but they can agree on the protocol and that would make it much much easier to compose these systems so I hope that we can you know we aim to work with flashboss for example on 12 and anyone else who's interested in this question on standardizing is at this layer yeah I think the P2P layer of intents and I really like the abstraction you mentioned about these like shared or kind of partially overlapping them pools I think that's not often talked about so that's super interesting to hear wow um I'm getting very very deep and this is extremely interesting I feel like this is probably the the Leading Edge of all like uh research on this area and um I think there's there's so many unanswered questions and so much like knowledge in Chris's brain to like mine um but I wanted to go back a little bit more high level again just because I think there are some other details about how intents work that maybe some people listening including myself don't have like a fully clear picture of and I just want to get those like covered as well which is I know that like in these intent architectures are there are some like new Concepts that don't exist in the standard blockchain world so there's like this concept of an actor called a solver there's also you know the these proofs which you know I think uh Zaki alluded to of you know it can be a proof of optimality of your trade or maybe it's a proof that that you know something happened on a different chain so you can settle those intents um and there's also sort of this this notion of like a credible commitment that um Chris was was talking about earlier like why what does that mean I I kind of want to I don't know if anyone can can sort of unpack a little bit more of these details and maybe maybe do it via like an example of of maybe that cross-chain trade like what is happening who are the you know actors in the system and the different like moving parts I'm happy to take this but I also don't want to talk too much so I would be happy to yield to somebody else until if anyone else has thoughts um I I mean I have a super simple example uh maybe Nick you're kind of looking for something that's maybe more relatable for or relatable to the things that we have today I think for example a cross-chain RFQ looks a lot like a proto-intent system so you know I'm a user I have some ethon ethereum I want some like I don't know op token on optimism I broadcast like that desire to the world and then some I kind of request a quote uh and then someone else is like who's a sophisticated actor or Market maker is doing a transaction on optimism to send me my op tokens and then they're like taking my ethereum that maybe I've like locked up in some contract after there's a proof they've sent me the op tokens and maybe they like participate in some auction for the right to like fulfill my quote uh and then we already have people like doing this today there's RFQ systems I think they're generally the options I'm not sure like whether they're conducted on chain or not and generally they seem like a little centralized but I think that's just like a very concrete example of how a proto-intent system working in the wild today um to make things like more concrete I like that Henry Henry's raising his hand oh go ahead Chris actually whichever one of you guys no no Henry oh well no maybe Chris should go because I was going to give an example that is kind of a different flavor okay um well uh I was just going to going to address specifically the solver part of the question um because I think it's helpful for understanding the intent frame um I mean in general if you if you take it tends to be some kind of preferences over the state space of a system many most of these systems are quite flexible and so in in the general version of the kind of intent matching problem the problem is in NP right in the complexity class and B uh so it's a sort of search problem where you have verifiable Solutions the intents of course Define what uh valid Solutions are um but you you know don't have polynomial time algorithms in the general case for finding Solutions at least not so far as we know if P equals NP everything breaks and we can all go home or do something else with our lives or something but uh for now it doesn't end uh the uh there's part of this problem that is like kind of unbounded search right and unbounded search is something that you do not want to do in like replicated computation right you want to to have someone do the search and then verify the results of that afterwards once you've found some solution that satisfies the requisite criteria it's that you can cheaply cast right um so in our lexicon at least uh you know from another's perspective solvers are the entities doing the search um they are not you know so they have some Choice perhaps over execution paths they can like come up with execution paths that satisfy the criteria of intents over those intents Define those criteria um but mostly uh you know mostly what they're doing is just search and if you define your fairness criteria clearly or something like this or your welfare maximization criteria clearly then solvers are kind of done quote unquote or so to speak or they're like they're they're entities who you're paying for specifically doing the search like you're paying them for compute in a way that at least we tried to design things so that solvers are basically fungible like you're creating a market for compute and you know maybe you want some resiliency properties so you're overpaying a little bit or one you know a few solvers to submit Solutions or something like this but because you can verify the results of that compute you don't need to trust the solvers at all uh you know if you're not disclosing information to them and sometimes you might be disclosing information to them and then this equation is a little bit different so it depends on what roles end up overlapping but um in in the purest definition solvers are just doing uh the search Problem so I know that the solver let's say I say I want to trade you know this thing how do I know the solver actually gave me a good deal and I achieved a good price or you know obviously I can verify that like the state the outcome is is like within what I stated as I as like my my boundaries my constraints but what about the other aspect of it is that just auction mechanism that kind of guarantees that right I mean there are different uh you know at least I don't think there's a like Universal mechanism here that gives you the best properties in all cases I think there are different specific mechanisms that give you different properties so you know an RFQ system or a kind of order flow auction system is based on auctioning uh you know with intense basically based on running an auction um a uh another thing you can do is just the nice thing about intense is that they're cheap so you can like send a lot of intents and gradually change the price over time or have a price curve and an intent that goes down as a function of time you know you need some some reference clock perhaps signatures from the validator set and then you can just like especially if you don't know the price this can be helpful you could say you know depending on your time preference you can say like I'm going to start with this price high price that I like a lot and then gradually lower that price and see you know who picks up my intent that seems like it's almost certain to happen in kind of a dark Forest world where a lot of liquidity is private um then you can also do something where you basically restrict the role of solvers to only compute by having first a commitment to ordering as an intense you know typically encrypted in some fashion are ordered and then that you're decrypted and then solvers search for Solutions but those Solutions have required to satisfy fairness criteria uh these fairness criteria might be something like fair market clearing price or a batch a m they might be something like Pareto efficiency improvements or sort of slightly more General version of the problem they might be you can have other welfare metrics like you could make your welfare metrics localized to some community and then it would be like Improvement along you know the the welfare function defined for this community basically um and in this case uh because you've separated the roles so the validators or something or ordering intents while they're still encrypted they don't have any information on them then there are threshold decrypting them or witness decrypting them and then solvers are just searching for solutions that have to satisfy the strict criteria including processing all of the intents in that batch right so solvers don't you know they don't have a lot of freedom to optionally include or not include things um Henry you were going to give an example too yeah so um this example is like a little different um for penumbra I guess we have a kind of a I think a different sort of approach towards the same goals in that we haven't really started off with like here is the like the overall Vision it's sort of like let's try to solve a problem and then like stumble backwards into a good idea um and we actually end up having sort of like two different intent systems um one of which is actually not even like never touching a chain never doing anything and we use that just to um paper over the complexities of having a like utxo like uh system for managing notes or or doing other stuff if you imagine making a transaction uh even just like a simple send transaction if you're in an account based system you can say okay like debit like X tokens from my account and increase X tokens in this other account but if you're in a shielded system you have to be saying like I'm going to consume these little State fragments that are recording this balance which are effectively like shielded utxos and so actually like planning out your transaction involves doing utxo management and that sucks like not even from a like usability perspective but from like a Dev ux perspective right if somebody's trying to write a front end they don't actually want to be doing you know for the most part fine-grained management of utxos and so we ended up kind of basically building a sort of Proto or a trusted intent system where someone can specify here's like a high level description of what I want this transaction to do and our own like sort of client stack can translate that into okay here's a specific transaction plan here are the specific notes you're going to consume here is like you know the the change notes that you're going to make to yourself to make the whole transaction balance and so on and so on and I think this is sort of an example of a thing that I mentioned at the beginning of like sort of blurring your eyes like seeing this sort of fractal nature of reality and distributed systems where if you think deeply about any one component of any of these systems it ends up actually having a lot of similar problems you know in inside of that micro scale as the the full system writ large hmm whoa yeah that's uh it sounds like you guys are really thinking about this in a deep way in the way that it will affect users and um I think you're baking in a lot of like very very cool approaches to solving these problems um I think so we're kind of up on the hour here I I think we're gonna go maybe another 15-20 minutes or so so I want to start like wrapping things up one one topic uh I mean I want to talk more about privacy and mbv and stuff one thing I want to make sure that we also just touch on quickly uh selfishly is sort of the overlap between overlap or not overlap between intense and and modular blockchains because yeah at Celestia we're really you know we do believe that this modular blockchain architecture is going to be um you know a big way that we scale these systems and onboard uh you know more applications and I saw a lot of the the core problems uh of blockchains and it sounds to me like there there is like Intense or another really big part of solving these problems and so I'm curious on like the overlap and I guess for me the thing that really jumps out is that a modular blockchain future is one where the number of chains really proliferates and um it seems like intents are very necessary in that kind of world where you know like um was saying if there's you know just even just a handful of Roll-Ups it's really hard to manage all of your accounts and wallets and balances and all that stuff um if you're also if you're interacting with a bunch of different chains like you know these apps are living in different domains and you want to like compose them from a ux perspective um you know bridging is one thing but even just just the user experience of trying to interact with all of them at the same time even knowing like what bridges are exist and and what liquidity is there is like basically it becomes so complex like the the complexity just explodes and I feel like you need to offload that complexity to more sophisticated actors so at least that's the way that I'm I see that this overlap I'm curious uh if you like what what your guys perspective is there and last but not least another like small tidbit that I want to touch on is like you know intense is definitely something that's not built into the Celestia data availability layer I don't think it's really necessary for something that is just so simple as just like hey I want to post this blob of data but I'm curious if there's any reason that you guys would see for having some kind of intent like thing within a a lazy blockchain like Celestia I think uh something you said earlier uh about cross domain people kind of arriving to intense and like there being a reason for that as I think crossed uh having this super modular stock solves a lot of problems um and I think you know how does it has a lot of Pros but then the cons are also created because it is like way more fragmented and users have to keep track of a lot of different things across a lot of different Roll-Ups and then intense is kind of this way of solving that and you know keeping helping keep most of the pros and then also getting rid of the cons so I think that's why people in the cross domain space think a lot about intense and I think that's why it comes up in this like with the rise of the modular stack I think that's why this has also become more prob popular to talk about because the problems are only now being created by having so many roll-ups okay so I think like one of the one of the things that has become an increasing part of like my framing of blockchains is probably there are only two layers of blockchains that are like actually accrue value one where is like we sell basic commodity like we sell data availability we sell like you know execution in a shared state with a bunch of other things that you know are valuable and then there's like you know my my joking phrasing of it is like artisanal organic non-toxic order flow um these are like the these are the things that are are valuable in a blockchain um and Celestia is like canonically like a vendor of like the base of like a base commodity uh and potentially you know a shelling point for uh shared State execution that might be valuable um and then you know the the the real goal that like we all are trying to build do is to like you know build the farmer's market of of artisanal organic non-toxic order flow I'm loving this analogy yeah so I mean I think you know like my general view of this is is you know we're gonna see you know like the other you know the other thing that has to be like I guess re-emphasized is intense are not a future concept to a large extent intents are already here um you have cow swap which is um this you know phenomenal mechanism by which users sign intents to perform a swap uh and solvers uh and like you know I probably first talked to Martin koppelman about Cal swap in like 2017 um so you know like the the this intent idea is not remotely new um and you know like Visionaries have been working you know visioners and the spaceship and working on it uh one inch Fusion is another example of an intent system um you know even something like the open c order book um which is you know based on you know Chris's prior work on Project wyvern uh is an intense system so basically many many many people who have you who've used blockchains also uh Mev share from flashbots another great example and like they're doing the like programmable privacy thing that like is like kind of like another Frontier of it which is like you know it's done in a centralized setting but like you can um you know like not all like everyone who's trying to figure out um to like essentially bid on your order flow um can see your entire order they can only see some aspects of your order um and so like you know we just keep seeing proofs of principle and I think these like proofs of principle uh and yeah I could go on there's like so many examples like we have these like we have these things that we do in Cosmos where we like delegate we're like a user signs one transaction but actually multiple steps have to occur asynchronicity across multiple blockchains and like you give that to the IBC rail reware um so we just keep Building Systems like this intense are already here um intents are going to be a big part of successful systems built on top of the module or architecture um and ultimately you know the goal of like intense systems is to like really Elevate that like you know organic order flow beautifully said Chris yeah I guess uh yeah I I I'd second both of those sentiments I think to me another uh maybe common intuition in the concepts of modular blockchains and intensive design they're also related to Henry's Point earlier about kind of seeing Intense centricity fractally or sort of in different parts of the system uh I mean I you know I don't work on Celestia I don't know everything about it but as I understand the the idea of modular blockchains uh it is to kind of separate out the functional components that uh different parts of this distributed system are providing such as data availability maybe or long-term storage or compute or sequencing or execution and uh come up with interfaces around those components that kind of Define them in a sufficiently general way that you could put together these different building blocks uh which are you know compatible with the interfaces and get lots of different configurations of system so it's like you know block like our blocks for blockchains something like this that's how I understand it and I think that there is uh you know a a one thing that is you really want to make sure you do if you're trying to build a composable system of Primitives is Define interfaces that specify at the right level of abstraction that are not too specific as they don't you don't want to Define interfaces that like include details about how sub component some sub-component does something because that restricts the freedom of people implementing that sub-component uh by preventing them from doing something but you want to include interfaces that define the properties that you want the sub component to have right so you want like a very declarative interface like prologue style um I think there's actually direct precedent for this in unrelated research literature in something called denotational design by Canal Elliott who's like a really really long uh long running and uh skilled programming languages researcher did a bunch of work in Baghdad and some other stuff that has kind of a more mathematical formulation for what it means to design a system this way but it's like at every layer of uh you know you have sort of a dag of definitions for example and at every layer you define what you want the underlying primitive to do from the perspective of an observer which in this case is like the code that is calling it so for example with data availability uh the way like you know architecture thinks about data availability is that uh you know someone who is seeking data availability wants some data to be stored for some period of time uh where that data will be retrievable subject to some trust assumptions right and the person the consumer of that interface has basically like a data availability intent like they want to get data availability in a way that is compatible with the things that they've stated but they might not like they might not care about exactly how it happens as long as it's like compatible with their preferences they might be fine with Celeste you're doing it or like some subset of validators doing it or they might be fine you know they might want ethereum to do it and they might want the data to be stored for 15 days or 30 days or something like this so they're like one side of the market right for data availability and on the other side of the market the providers as occupant of this this commodity uh would be you know like Celestia for example the celestial validator such or the ethereum valid intercept I mean most blockchain systems that are actually running can provide data availability for a fee many of them are not designed to do it but um uh it's it's it's readily available in some sense um so I think that if you architect a system in this intent-centric way you know we're trying to kind of come to a pretty clear mathematical definition we can even input into ACTA or something like this which actually checks that our site accomplishes this but you end up with like intense centricity at every layer and I think that that's really like not maybe not exactly the same thing but but a prerequisite maybe for the kind of modularity that you might want out of a modular blockchain system that that's my understanding of the relationship I see so you're saying that we could there could be sort of an intense layer even for for each service to some degree like even data availability where like and so it makes it kind of like hyper modular in the sense of like there's multiple there's so many different options for data availability and you just sort of set your parameters of like maybe security thresholder like yeah you said the the duration Etc and then you put your intent out there and then someone else is like okay well this is the right solution for you and they sort of like uh bring the supply and demand together yeah I mean sometimes you won't you don't necessarily always need like a distributed Market over the network I mean in Henry's example of a transaction plan you the the intent matching is happening like on Gore machine right in one trust domain and with you know exactly what the counterpart is but you still want this kind of interface because it allows the user to kind of say what they want at the level of specificity and abstraction at which they want to say it it allows the system to do some work on behalf of the user figuring out how to do that and in the case of the transaction plan API as far as I understand you know selecting which nodes to use uh to consume a transaction for example so I think the interface pattern kind of holds generally maybe another another way of articulating it is that I think designing things correctly in this way for example ensures that enoma and Celestial will be compatible without even trying like if we design things in this way and you you design things in this way maybe the mod you know I think the modular blockchain like way or you know when I talk to people from Celestia I talking about dependency inversion or something like this I get the sense that we have like very similar uh uh you know ways of thinking about about modular design so I think that if you if people agree on kind of a clear way of thinking about systems this way you end up with uh because you have thought about how to define the interfaces in the sort of maximally General way for the function that's being provided such as data availability uh there's a one there's kind of one unique maximally General way like data availability is a thing and you can parametrize it in certain ways like who's doing it what your trust assumptions are and how long the data is stored and like uh you know what the data is is just an input to the the function right so then you end up with compatible interfaces like magically right like you didn't need I didn't need to go talk to Celestia and I think that's very first sort of permissionless or kind of a coordination of an ecosystem of people who are building different components uh coming up with a way that to have compatibility that doesn't actually require the people to talk to one another is really powerful it's like a huge sort of Boon to our ability to build systems that compose with each other mm-hmm cool so uh we we got to wrap up here pretty soon so I have one last question and then we will wrap it up um and that is it Zaki gave a few an outline of a few of the systems that are live right now that uh already kind of have some some sort of version of intense um implemented I'm curious to hear uh two things one is you know what is the current state of intents uh like the different projects building them so this is like a chance to chill a bit about anoma and and also penumbra and other other projects that are out there and like like swab for example um and then I'm curious like to to sort of project a little bit into the future let's say like you know three years from now or so when the the whole intense architecture and like actors and this whole like I guess stack is built out uh more robustly and and people are actually using it like what does it look like and like what kind of world will we be living in um and even you know I'm I'm curious like as a user what does it look like do I just kind of like do I even you know open up my wallet and like am I switching chains or do I just have this like Master view of like all my accounts across all chains or I didn't even realize that there's different chains and I'm just like you know saying saying things and they just magically happen like is it one portal like what what does this actually look like three like you know in the future if if this all works couldn't remember if it was directed towards me I sort of vaguely remember it being toward me anyone I think I want to hear kind of everyone's take Okay um I kind of view my my suspicion is that like intense are like the Capstone of like the last you know 10 years of blockchain like infrastructure building um is is basically like my my point of view on this question which is like you know we had like a lot of of we've had a lot of problems that like needed the team insolvable you know consensus data availability bridging uh the um you know like what should your smart contract be written in like what language like all those things and like lots of progress and privacy um all of these things like actual like concrete progress has been made of but I think like the the last you know especially this like you know the pandemic period right where we had all these people come under uh blockchains I think to me it was very informative just like oh okay like where is this whole system going to break down um and so yeah I I think the intent world is ends up being I think there are like I don't think people will do everything with intense I don't you know I'm I'm not I think the full you know you do everything with intent like sometimes it's just not going to be worth it um it's just gonna be especially if you're just like if you have like one of one kind of things if it's like I want to like breed my crypto Kitty um it's probably just easier to to like specify the transaction there's only one path to do it you're doing with the Singleton object um but like the future wallets will be able to abstract over so many workflows that like confound users today and the workflows that like are the most popular workflows like token swapping buying nfts all of these things like you know in an intent world you don't need to know whether or not your uh the NFP you want to buy is on uh like open C on ethyl one or Solana or stargaze um which I think is like one of the things that the intent world is going to do is it is going to abstract over uh uh and like uh commoditize a lot of the differences between ecosystems like people were like people who have their sports teams they'll have their favorite thing they will like be there will be communities around tokens but if you're a user you're going to be like yeah I open up a wallet it speaks this intent language like I want to I see an nft I want to buy I buy it like didn't didn't have to know anything about what blockchain ecosystem it was part of it's like I I saw the I saw the picture I could buy anyone else yeah I think the state of intense today um Zaki actually talked about it it's already here there's like a bunch of apps I think that already service these like very app specific intents whether that be like Dax aggregators or one inch fusion with the RFQ which I guess is a DEX aggregator um and so I think there will continue to be more app specific intents and I think in particular it's succinct we care a lot about making interoperability better and making the interoperability ux today much better than the current bridging ux like the current bridging Paradigm is super broken and I think we want to create a future where users don't even know what a bridge is like that's a concept that will be long forgotten things will be happening behind the scenes and they can just take the actions they want to take and I think like the step to building that is going to be have another kind of proto-intent or bridging specific intent system and I think that's what we're kind of working on and thinking about right now and hopefully as we're all building these different app specific intents we can also talk more about like a more General abstraction so it's not like everyone's building their own intense language and you know settling these intents or having solvers for these intents in a centralized way and there's like a more decentralized platform and or decentralized order flow auctions to like help solve these intents and there's gonna need to be some coordination there if there is going to be like a more General solution uh that everyone can coordinate on and I think the general solution will have a lot of benefits including decentralization and more competitiveness um for the solvers and so in the end it also is important for users too I like that Henry or Chris you guys have any thoughts on this yeah I mean I I agree with everything Sacramento sakinuma said there are already intense systems um I think that some parts of those systems are inefficient in ways that maybe don't matter so much and some of them are inefficient ways that matter a lot like the peer-to-peer part of those systems is just really inefficient at the moment you know when they're sort of used for intense because it wasn't designed with that in mind I think the um you know the the nice thing about um you know thinking about systems in this intense Centric and modular way is that if you if we kind of do it well it ensures a certain kind of future compatibility like if we build these sort of nice well-extracted intent-based systems for bridging for example uh or you know State machine verification stuff like this then we can have our current batch of blockchains which have a lot of valuable state right they have assets and different smart contracts and things that people you know people people value and they will want the future in a future world to be able to reference that state and kind of build upon it um and that I think uh will be possible by starting to build these kind of Proto or more specific intent systems and progressively making them more general or able to interface with those systems in more General ways uh you know one kind of one thing that we're working on in our Noma that we hope will will help with this uh is a good sort of general or general abstract definition for intense so like the equivalent kind of to like the turing machine is like a nice abstract definition for what a computer does and it you know very few actual computers Implement Turing machines like they don't literally have a tape that would be ridiculous but they do something because Turing machines are sort of universal in this way that is it's relevant they do something that's uh equivalent like you can translate between different specific implementations of this General thing um and we're trying to come up with such a general thing but for intent systems which includes uh sort of privacy or it's kind of a more General a cousin which is I think better described as information flow control um so you could think of that as an intent language yeah and also sort of a model for what like a way of defining what it is that an implementation of an intense system must do in order to be correct um just as sure you know you can Implement something that will like Faithfully execute a program program for a turing machine if it simulates the tape or something like this and then you can specialize your special machines for different specific programs written in different specific ways and I think that will continue to happen like there won't be some you know maybe some things can become over time more and more compiler problems instead of uh instead of sort of human design problems the the optimization Frontier will move to algorithmic choice but um I still there are still going to be lots of specific different things uh we'll just move you know or can move towards more General things over time the only thing that I'm like specifically kind of still a little bit worried about is that I think it is difficult to make systems uh in some cases difficult to make them compatible with privacy or if you are if you embed you know transparent verification as a implicit design assumption into your Proto intent system it may not be compatible with privacy preserving intent systems so I think that you know thinking about that at this stage is is perhaps important and helpful yeah I love the idea of um creating a definition that is sort of like Universal kind of like the the turing machine for for intent basis I thought about that a lot in the context of modular blockchains too how we try to break down these different functions and like you need a minimum set of these functions of data availability you need ordering now you need some kind of like agree socially agreed upon you know validity rules um for like to to implement like a blockchain essentially so I love that and um I'm interested to see how that goes we're kind of up on time so I just want to uh you know I want to open up for you guys to give some like last closing closing thoughts um before we uh uh yeah wrap up so um Henry maybe you want to go first and anything that you want the audience to take away from this conversation um you know about a tense or about um what you guys are building at penumbra um go ahead yeah I mean I I don't want to show too hard I don't you know I I think we're building some pretty cool stuff if people want to check it out uh I would definitely recommend it but the the thing for this context um I think the thing um that I think people should take away is that um intents are already here in all this sort of different manifestations um and also that it's really sort of interesting and important to look at systems both in a kind of component by component approach as well as a ballistic approach that lets you ask like okay what are actually the boundaries between these components and the reason I think that's important is that if you think of this sort of full stack concept of protocol development of like from a user like how do I trace a user's ooda loop as their decide like they're seeing what is going on in the environment they're deciding what to do um they do some actions they observe the effects of those actions um that flow you can trace through some system and as you trace that through you'll you'll discover what you know the actual scope of the protocol is um and and through that whole stack um at each individual layer you can see um intent systems already uh uh in place um and the thing is just to sort of like take this sort of like raw material it's like you know under the marble or whatever and and flesh it out and chisel away the the pieces until we get this sort of beautiful future I love that anyone else closing thoughts um yeah I guess my my closing thought is uh I do think that like this does represent like a pretty big change of like over like what like you know layer one protocol designers have like considered their like priorities and importance they're like okay like you know we need to have you know we need to have transaction privacy we need to build encrypted mempools we need to build um you know uh ways in which users can like read what state what like what the effects of the transactions that they're signing are going to be uh you know I think there's been like uh like it does represent like I think the reason why this thing is interesting is because of the like shift in priorities right it's like a shift in part priorities as like what is the most important piece in like making insult in like making blockchains that solve actual users problems Chris or Uma yeah I mean um I I would second both of those sentiments particularly Henry's which I thought was beautiful and maybe he won't show up penumbra but I will I think penumbra is the like uh you know a an amazing example of a sort of near-term privacy preserving intense solution kind of optimized and designed around one specific use case of private trading or privacy preserving trading but designed to such a level of precision and kind of a careful reflection on what it is that that product does and for whom and you know the UDA Loops of the users Etc that it ends up you know being this kind of uh specific Incarnation uh that illuminates the more General concept right um so I'm very excited about that both using it and kind of seeing the whole through the lens of the part in this case um you know to me uh I guess I I think to echo on zaki's point a little bit one reason that I find intense helpful or that we found it helpful in our design questions is that they provide a good way of framing the general problem of what it is what is it that these systems are supposed to be doing like what what is the problem that blockchains solve right now intents don't provide they don't provide a like specific answer to that question right they don't answer the question of you know do I want this asset or do I want this other asset or is I think as Sam Hart put it uh the you know the thing about intents is that you assume that users know what they want uh well yes I mean the users don't know what they want maybe they know what to only a certain level of precision that could be modeled but if users don't know what they want that is just not a problem that economic systems solve right so I think a general concept can be helpful actually because it illuminates uh what a system can't do if it's if it's sort of sufficiently genital or what like all systems of this sort just can't do like it it defines the boundaries very clearly um uh so you know I think that uh as we think about things in this intent-centric way it can give a useful lens uh to which parts of the stack are perhaps under prioritized from that perspective like I guess today I should have made the case for a peer-to-peer networking as being as as a part that's been sort of under-prioritized from this intense perspective um I think that's VM design is another part that's been kind of under prioritized from this perspective you know the talk I gave the research today was a little bit about that um I think that uh yeah maybe maybe thinking also about what privacy means in an intense Centric world uh and you know whether maybe you know to me I'm not sure privacy is actually the right world word for what the systems are doing but I think that you know examining that question was also important and kind of helpful uh you know using intense as a lens through which to understand these like different components of the sign problem as Henry mentioned so I just hope that you know if we think about the components clearly and kind of uh you know as as an ecosystem of people working on these many different specific projects which Implement different specific parts of some potential intense Centric feature stack uh that we kind of keep talking about things and come to a good you know good sort of social consensus uh that that achieves a kind of appropriate distribution of Labor across these different components of the whole problem would I like initially started like when I was thinking about this initially I was I was I really questioned whether or not the Privacy component was essential to uh the success of an intent system and like whether or not we could roll something out that would like meet some like practical use cases without having um some form of of privacy involved and I like have mostly run into the wall like really challenging problems when you don't have privacy like your ability to like you know you wanna um uh you want to like reveal when you're like doing an intent like hey like you don't want to reveal like here's the most I'm willing to pay because if you reveal the most you're willing to pay you will always have to pay the most um and the um and so like you know this is the this is these are the um so like if you don't if you want to have like sort of not highly interactive processes where like you know a user's like device has to be like online and interacting with the with its counterparties and adjusting its uh you know bids and offers and pricing and stuff like that like pretty much the only way to build non-interactive systems is with privacy so really really become convinced of the importance of privacy in building intent systems very very interesting and I I just want to say that since Chris won't show a Noma I will also just plug I know that you guys are launching nomada soon um and so people should definitely check that out Uma do you want to offer any closing thoughts yeah I feel like we've been over quite a lot so I don't have too much more to say other than I think the most interesting thing to me here is like the intersection of kind of the research and Theory Community like lowercase our research with like actual focus on ux because I think that is like one of the biggest problems in crypto and I think I just hope I feel like with intense it's been this really good shelling point where those two groups have met and people who normally don't talk have started engaging and so I think at a metal level um yeah that's something that's cool to see and I hope more of that keeps on happening okay well we covered a lot today this ended up being longer than I expected but uh I think it was like hard to avoid that because there's just so much to unpack and I think intense are going to be such an important topic going forward and like across the whole industry and so I'm really grateful that we had you guys here to to explain all of that to us and um I think there's a lot more conversations to be had clearly and so I hope the conversation continues on Twitter and also I want to say that um we will be definitely having a lot of intense content at modular Summit this year um in Paris so I encourage everyone um or the people should look out for that I would definitely have a lot of speakers like the three uh that are here and um yeah I'm looking forward to continuing the conversation in Paris with all of you guys so thanks everyone for coming and we'll see you next time thank you for having us
