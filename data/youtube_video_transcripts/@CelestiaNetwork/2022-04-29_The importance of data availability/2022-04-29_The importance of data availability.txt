[Music] so there are a couple of things in which uh data availability is like designed to solve the problem for you so what what's what's cause what's what i i typically like to explain this in terms of like the optimistic roll-up model and the um and the the optimistic roll-up model and the um uh and the um so and the and the sort of validium zero knowledge zk roll model but like one of the most important things about um uh uh about these um systems is who can propose a block and who can verify the state um so in a in a in an optimistic roll-up model you need to have both a broad set of people who can uh uh you need to have a as broad a set of people who can um uh you can who can uh propose who can verify the state um because you are you need people to detect if there is an invalid state transition and then in play the interactive verification game um and then the second uh uh uh in the zero knowledge world the zero knowledge proof provides proof that like every state transition is valid but you need data availability to enable other people to propose blocks um otherwise you have like a com you end up in a situation where a single centralized party can censor so really the the core properties of a of a blockchain censorship resistance um and uh uh auditability are like entirely dependent on this actual property which is data availability if you want to operate in like this sort of hyper-scaled million blockchain world um and that's why data availability is like the fundamental problem of blockchains go for it mustafa yeah so i mean it's an interesting question because like it sounds very counterintuitive and that data availability is like the core primitive that blockchain provides like we've seen like you know tweets from ava you know and like uh on their team saying that you know data availability is just some random problem that's like they don't understand they don't understand why it's even relevant in the first place and so it's very constantly intuitive to understand why if you're if if you've been looking at blockchains in the old model uh that has where bitcoin has that bitcoin has introduced um where consensus and execution are coupled together effectively but where we have a model where consensus where the consensus nodes don't execute your transaction then it starts to become clear why you know this availability is important and so like like before celestia was you know created or before it was close celestia it was originally called lazy ledger and the reason why it was called lazy ledger was because i was trying to figure out like what is the most minimal minimum viable like blockchain you can make um or in other words what is the least what is the least amount of work that a consensus nerd could do for that chain and how much like if you took it to an extreme think how much you know computation and work could you actually push to the end user like clients and make it so that the consensus knows how to do it themselves and the conclusion i came to you was if you wanted to take this in the stream you basically unless you wanted to build a version of bitcoin you know with this you would basically just need a chain um where you can dump arbitrary data on it and every single transaction is allowed so imagine a version of bitcoin for example where invalid transactions are allowed to be posted on chain like you can store people's money on chain like how would that be secure it will still be secure because you just insert a a rule on the user's nose to say we will simply ignore invalid transactions that have been purchased on the chain and in the case let's say like there's two transactions that are trying to do a double spend and those two transactions are trying to spend the same coins and then obviously you just ignore the second one but in order to know which one came first uh like if you have two conflicting transactions like in order to know which one came first not only do you need ordering over the transactions you also need data availability because obviously you need to know you know the complete set of transactions that have ever been posted in order to know which one has is the first transaction with a specific property like for example which is the first transaction that spent the ctxo so this is kind of intuitively why if you look at it from first principles by data availability it's kind of a core primitive of blockchains and this isn't anything new by the way but even back in 2014 before ethereum you know bitcoin developers were kind of arguing about this and discussing this and when one developer is a there's a mailing list post where peter todd argues with gregory maxwell um about what a blockchain fundamentally is and peter thought was the first person to realize that you know blockchain is fundamentally a data availability layer and he refers to it as a proof of publication system effectively you're proving this to people that you've published data
