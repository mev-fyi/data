all right Jill welcome to the modular summit we're here right now and we're going to talk about espresso thank you it's great to be here yeah good couple days oh my goodness um so Jill and I haven't seen each other since five years ago indeed I've gone through a Rebrand since then yeah that's me yes Jill I mean I confirmed this is Jill Carlson it is yeah same person same for Carlson now Gunter yeah yeah so now you're working on espresso tell us about in what capacity you're you're working on it and what is it yeah absolutely so espresso systems is a company that I'm one of the co-founders of we got started about two years ago we actually started out building a privacy oriented L1 and we've since pivoted around and explored some new directions uh one of our key insights was that ethereum and the modular future was where it was at um and what we're now working on today is building a decentralized shared sequencer I'm gonna throw out a lot of buzzwords here we'll break it all down a decentralized shared sequencer that Roll-Ups can plug into in order to get better interoperability still maintain great scale and also have the security of decentralization again I just gave you all the buzzwords we should break it down yeah before this this interview started we were just making fun of how wow there's all these made up terms that we talk about as though they're real yeah so seriously yeah and it will be real it will matter it's coming it's all happening but yeah child's modular future the modular interchain of Roll-Ups they're all going to be braided together yeah to create one super decentralized emotional Network relationship application actually that's the next thing yes Sonny's been meaning at mesh security so that's the next thing you're gonna be hearing about oh God if Sonny's been memeing it or yeah I'll put it in my in my buzzword soup yeah just pay attention for the the next few years when it pops up perfect I'll add it to the marketing on the website good yes uh okay so espresso is a decentralized shared sequencer yes let's break that down uh okay you know what why don't I frame it for our audience first of all first of all first of all first of all because ethereum needed to quote scale came up with the roll-up concept which is an evolution of plasma which is real Roll-Ups are working yeah lives are working we've made t-shirts for this conference that say Roll-Ups aren't real it's kind of like a tongue-in-cheek riff on a blog post that went viral I don't know a couple months ago whose blog post was it John Charbonneau okay brilliant mind you should all follow him but um I do think Roll-Ups are real like I I go in and use Roll-Ups oh yeah they they are scaling right uh however however if there's a but however it does trade off a bit of decentralization because it's not actually inheriting the security of the each layer one right exactly it's like one sequencer you kind of have to trust that sequencer so it's now because now we've kind of reverted back to um a trusted setup and you know all of these roll up projects you know firstly it's a huge undertaking to develop and launch a roll up got a lot on their plates but they all have decentralization on the roadmap this is not a trade-off that is sort of like intentionally being made or that we're thinking about as something that's going to have to stick around for a long time we all accept that decentralization will happen and so what we've done is we've gone and said hey all right let's tackle that part of the ethereum roadmap and build a solution that in our vision of the future any roll up we'll be able to plug into and take advantage of um and get that decentralization back without compromising on their scale and then there's all kinds of other interesting things that happen around interoperability when you do that right so to help myself and the audience uh create a better framework around this thing so a sequencer is effectively the consensus Slayer right they're the ones that are ordering blocks or orders and then creating blocks yeah and so the status quo is that there's only one right now and if you're creating a shared sequencer Network that allows anyone to come in and become a sequencer in a trust minimized way then that improves the decentralization of this whole roll-up Paradigm exactly so what we've built is a consensus mechanism and we're over the coming months going to start onboarding nodes externally to it we're still in development we just released our second test net actually yesterday uh at the conference big news um but we've developed a new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism so you can think of it as akin to an L1 blockchain the big difference is that what those nodes are coming to consensus on is really just the order of transactions that's being submitted to them by the roll up [Applause] um they're not executing the transactions it's a much lighter weight thing than a fully fledged blockchain the execution of transactions is still being done by the Roll-Ups themselves but indeed it is a decentralized network of nodes again running this consensus Okay so can you go further down a level on about the consensus coffee too okay don't take me too far into the weeds but I'm happy to go level for them fair enough um proof of stake consensus so there must be a token involved and it's put up as collateral for slashing and how do the nodes that run the software decide how blocks are ordered I mean transactions are ordered yeah so it's it's not that different from The Proposal role that nodes play on ethereum today um so if you think about ethereum today uh I mean traditionally we've sort of thought of ethereum as okay you know you create transaction the transaction goes into a mempool those transactions then get picked up by if you're even validators those ethereum validators build a block they decide what order to put the transactions in and then they propose those transactions a proposer is selected for each round through this consensus sort of election mechanism proof of stake and uh the proposer then puts that block out to the world broadcasts it and that becomes Final on the L1 as ethereums evolved there's this idea of we're getting back into buzzword land proposer Builder separation that has emerged where there are more ABS PBS my goodness we're on day two of PBS day at modulus that's right it's PBS day today it's only fitting that we talk about it um wherein you have for at least some speaking of buzzwords I just I can't I just can't okay another one okay wait so so let's talk okay proposal block separation composer Builders composer Builder the biddler separation so you have these specialized entities builders that come in and the way I think about it is basically they're super smart about the order in which they put the transactions and they're smart about it okay in the sense that they figure out the optimal order to be able to extract value from those trans oh so now we're intentionally front running I mean in a sense but I mean validators have been doing this since the beginning of ethereum we just were released I was a little bit naive about it right but I think about my first sort of experience of this was trying to participate in the 0x token crowd sale and like all kinds of games were being played in terms of like fee markets and like you know you had to put in like a sufficiently high gas fee in order to get your your bid in I got nothing I was totally naive about you know the games the optimizations that validators were even making their transaction ordering validators were themselves front running people's transactions and putting in transactions yeah especially that's right in ethereum land yeah yeah it's hard to solve for that way so optimizing for more valid again now it's just these specialized entities coming doing this and then there's all kinds of methods actually that become enabled to try and minimize the harmful effects of all of this extracted value which is a whole other conversation but so you have now builders on the one side building the transaction order they pass that off to the ethereum validator set via probably an auction mechanism and then whoever the elected proposer is on the validator side for a given round basically takes a little Kickback from the builders and then takes that Builders you know whichever Builder has won the auction takes that order and broadcastses the network now this is all relevant to us because it's important to understand that when I say that we're building a shared sequencer I'm talking about the proposer side of that we have not built a builder that is going to be super Savvy about ordering and is going to you know optimize the order and extract value from folks Etc we think that probably in the roll-up landscape in the modular world that we're going to those types of entities will emerge um but today we've just built the the proposer side of that equation okay where where do the blocks actually get composed and finalized so that's still I mean finalization there are different definitions I suppose the finality but true finality yeah you just I would say is still happening at the on the ethereum L1 if it's an ethereum rollout plugging into espresso we have a smart contract ourselves as part of a product right that runs on the L1 that then you know propagates uh the the transaction order back to the roll-up contracts Etc so you know true finality is still happening at the L1 but part of the beauty of Roll-Ups how they operate today and also of what we can offer even with decentralization is faster finality in the form of soft confirmations or pre-confirmations whatever you want to call it which is something that users of decentralized applications rightfully you've gotten used to um but today we're getting there through some kind of shortcuts being made again on the decentralization side and those are what we're trying to remove yeah okay so one last question about this before we move into the greater the modular narrative yeah the so I tend to wonder if PBS was born out of Mev right so so you know did was there a need to separate what used to be one role right proposing and and produce a block um into two separate roles because any League was so rampant in ethereum land I mean it's still like in tenement plan it's still one roll yeah right but yeah I I don't think it's something that has sort of emerged by Design necessarily and I'm not an expert on sort of the history of Mev so someone from flashbots or something can correct me if I'm wrong here but I don't my understanding is it didn't emerge by Design but it sort of emerged a bit more organically that these types of more specialized Builder Searcher filler entities uh started to crop up but the fact that we now have this Paradigm of proposer Builder separation does introduce some ways to potentially mitigate again kind of the harmful side effects of the Mev the sort of rent extraction from users um again I mean I think that flashbots and others are are working hard on these problems to not only create paradigms that will continue to further mitigate Med um or the the bad side effects of it but then also thinking about ways that you know that value can be redistributed back to users I know the ethereum foundation nation has their own kind of enshrined enshrined proposer Builder separation that's another great buzzword and shrined uh of how to start to think about that being more fully baked into the ethereum protocol right I mean okay it's just like one last thing about decentralization does it at all concern you that the majority as in over 70 even up to 80 percent of the proposer tends to proposers tends to be flashbots or the Builder the Builder okay well so flashpot's also it's not quite the Builder flashbots again my understanding is running a relay but various entities um Can can use to sort of play this function or role for sure though I mean I think I I made this joke to someone yesterday but it's not really a joke it's actually totally serious when I first learned about these Dynamics a few years ago I was like everything I know is a lie like is this all smoke and mirrors like decentralization oh but I I I don't think that firstly everything I knew was a lie to begin with though anyway because of this same Dynamic I was just talking about we're like this was happening anyway it was just the ethereum validators doing it right right and that has its own kind of centralization side effects um that are arguably worse and harder to make better if you don't have this separation um I think in terms of like the role that flashbots specifically plays I think that they are great Advocates and I think that as I've observed so far anyway like they've done a great job of really living their mission of like no we want to we want to mitigate the harmful effects of this we want to create open systems that are permissionless where anyone can come in and play and like like anything else does that have to start out in a more centralized way just like Roll-Ups have had to start in a more centralized way to then decentralize over time I'm I've gotten to a place where I'm comfortable with that but certainly if we're talking five years from now and these are still the Dynamics still like a bunch of single point of failure I'll be more jaded than I am now okay great our next five-year reunion since we haven't seen each other in five years okay yes we will um okay last question before we wrap up how does this in turn lend itself to the greater interoperability ecosystem as it pertains to either Celestia D.A in general maybe using IVC to communicate these transfers yeah yeah so shared sequencing helps with interoperability we think quite substantially it's not a silver bullet though you can't achieve decentral or you can't achieve interoperability excuse me just through having multiple Roll-Ups plug into a shared sequencer you're still going to need whether it's Bridges or other kind of communication protocols across Roll-Ups what is or builders in fact can actually help with interoperability um but what a shared sequencer can get you is great efficiencies operationally for example if you're a builder you wouldn't have to coordinate across five different proposers for five different Roll-Ups you'd be coordinating hopefully just with one the espresso sequencer um similar Dynamics with Bridges and other types of communication protocols I'm not an expert on IDC but I all of the smart people around me I think take a lot of inspiration from it that's something that we're very interested in [Applause] um and I think that again interoperability and composability and this is something that I think the ethereum ecosystem is really learning from Cosmos is is a huge part of what these permissionless decentralized systems are all about and today it kills me again that we don't have that in the roll-up space because Roll-Ups are real and I'm using them but what a pain it is to have to like withdraw from optimism and then deposit into ZK sync and blah blah and again we have things like you know hot protocol or like you know more kind of like centralized Bridges or else yeah these communication protocols which do help but it's not there yet again in terms of like the operational overhead of it the ability to have these things be decentralized at their core and have you know good sound security guarantees as well so those are all the types of things that we feel strongly assured sequencing is going to help with in the roll-up ecosystem okay ten thousand foot view macro perspective about this thing five years from now okay so now 80 to 90 let's assume of decentralized apps are their own Sovereign Roll-Ups yeah you know why would they do shared so have their Sovereign Roll-Ups and they're using a shared sequencer layer yeah a shared sequencer layer I like where your headset is integrated and speaking to like any da layer that is maybe optimally suited for the Roll-Ups needs uh and and that's what the space looks like or or yeah so we do have our own da approach that's sort of baked into the sequencer like all of the same nodes that are running the consensus on the order are also participating in data availability but the beautiful thing about data availability and the beautiful thing about the modular stack is it's free to developers to choose so the developers of all of these sovereigns to choose what da they want you know if they want to use the espresso sequencer we welcome that you should get in touch but uh you can use that alongside using ethereum for da or Celestia for da and we we totally welcome that and we're building with all of that in mind okay for sure yeah all right yeah very exciting yeah well thanks for getting on the show Jill thank you Chango thanks for putting up with the buzzwords today oh yeah I love it man this is the buzzword podcast awesome thank you
