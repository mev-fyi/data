all right uh yeah so welcome everyone to another uh celestia community call uh this is celestia community call number three we have a lot of exciting updates for you let's go over the agenda for today um so for today's agenda we're going to go over optimum and how to build sovereign roll-ups on celestia and then we're going to give our overview of the modular fellows program and we're going to highlight their translation efforts on crowdin by our community members for both in french and mandarin translation and a way for other people to um you know join um the african translation adapter and like instructions on how to do that and then we're gonna go over any kind of future updates you can expect from uh celestia both from developer and the roadmap and finally you know with enough time we'll have a q a the way q a works is basically you just raise your hand we'll unmute you and then you can ask a question otherwise if you're more comfortable you feel free to um type down your message and we will um answer it you know in the order we receive all right so let's get started so uh let me try to find uh the southern roll-ups uh so as you can see here um we just announced um like a few weeks ago uh an introduction to seven roll up to developers and the way you can build a southern roll-up currently on celestia is with a tool called optimum and with optimum it allows you to um basically it's um a replacement uh for like would cosmo de sdk um it's like an abc i wrapper uh with a replacement around tendermint to create um roll up on top of celestia sovereign roll-ups and in this example with optimum we created two different tutorials um a wordle tutorial so if you want to play the wardrobe game um um an introduction to that and like it will show you how to get started with optimum and wordle the other update uh the other tutorial we have is uh the cognizant overview um so qasim wasm is a web assembly um uh execution environment um to allow it to build like rest smart contract smart contracts on top of um cosmos sdk application and with this example it allowed you to integrate cosmosim directly into optimum so in other words you'd be able to build qualcomm wasn't smart contracts using optimum on top of celestia now um i believe tomas is here tomas you want to give an overview of like a more in depth on optimum and what people can do with this yeah sure so first of all as a disclaimer optimist is very alpha or better stage right now so we're we will welcome all the bug reports or issues found because we're pretty sure that there are many issues that are just not discovered uh currently optimist allows you to create a roll up on top of celestia you can there are many limitations right now because of the early stage of the project so first of all you can create a network with a single aggregator node so there will be only one block producer but you can have multiple full nodes and that can sync with the uh and create a entire network to to serve your to operate in your role um other than that optimum is using it's implementing abci is integrated in the cosmos decay app so it's almost seamless and you shouldn't see any difference except timing uh which is related to the timing of the test net right now so except for the block times you shouldn't see any important difference between using optimined cosmos that pay with optimine and using just plain vanilla cosmos sdk apps so optimint is has its own p2p layer so it propagates transactions on the p2p layer between the nodes then the transactions are are passed to a mempo and the mempo in the latest release it's the it's prioritized so we have something that was increased for the short a more period of time in the latest tender wind and yeah i i will welcome everyone to and i will encourage everyone to test it test test it out and report any bugs or issues you can you can find i'm also available in you can always mention me in in dev discord and i will try to to help with everything nice uh thank you tomas for the update um we have a question from mayo um while we're on the topic of optimum um uh so mayor saying are these chains fully customizable tokenization wise if i create an optimum underlying chain will i use the celestia token for gas use our own or both so right now for to be able to submit uh transactions uh to the da layer so to celestia you need to have uh a note that is configured to pay for data so you need as a sub aggregator as block producer you need to be able to store your blocks in the data availability layer so you need to have celestia tokens and on top of that while you're creating your own uh [Music] roll up your own i would say chain or but it's it's a roll up and so it's like every other cosmos sdk app you will have your own token that you define so uh you need celestial tokens only for uh submission to of the blocks so only the aggregator only the block producer has to be needs to use celestia tokens thank you um also for everyone like you know things to look forward to right now you know it's like you know tomas was saying is still in alpha stage we have a couple tutorials one is a simple like uh kog'maw sdk game that you can play um the other one is like just the basic cosmos tutorial how to integrate it over time we're gonna have more cosmos sdk tutorials for different things you can do with cosmo sdk on optimum and we're going to have more cosmosome specific tutorials and over time after um things to look forward to like any kind of cool application that you've seen in cosmos sdk will have over time available tutorial on how to integrate it with celestia using optimum and this is only the beginning there'll be more cool things happening with optimum after that and we look forward to showing you a lot of them before we move ahead anyone has any more questions questions about optimum no questions um you can always raise your hand or you can ask directly on the chat if you have questions and if you don't have any questions now we can come back to it later if you feel like it okay now moving ahead with the agenda the next thing we want to talk about is the modular fellows and for that um i want to make sure that another co-host uh yeah neither now you're a co-host you should be able to unmute yourself whenever um so yeah now they're gonna cover like the modular fellows program and you know what to expect in the program and stuff another oh yours cool awesome thank you for the intro and i have a little presentation that i'm going to give so i'm going to try to share my screen okay let me stop sharing and allow you to share okay okay cool all right so i'm gonna try to share can everyone see yep okay cool yeah so um hello everyone and i'm matter i work with the as developer relations so i've been with celestia a little over two months and i've been working on a program along with yaz and nick and a few others who've been helping me out and it's called modular fellows you might have seen us talking about this we announced it officially a couple weeks ago and we just closed the application process and i'm going to talk a little bit about it today so what is modular fellows it's basically a program that we have put together to really kind of facilitate the building out of applications infrastructure protocols and as well as maybe additional uh improvements or not really improvements but you know expanding the community of celestia and it's kind of described as a program designed to empower modular builders with the right resources to build out the future of scalable and sovereign blockchain networks this is a paragraph that i took out of kind of our announcement but really it's just a program to kind of give a really good experience to developers that want to kind of start building out on celestia now and giving them access to people within the community a little bit of funding and stuff like that to kind of maybe give them additional support where they might not have had it before so the modular fellows program is going to be a three month program and we're going to be doing it probably uh in the future as well so this is kind of like the first cohort and we're thinking in the future we'll have more more cohorts but it lasts for three months so the participants will receive engineering support and mentorship i'm going to talk about what that looks like in just a moment they also receive a monthly stipend of three thousand dollars per month to build out the project of their choice this three thousand dollars is meant really just to kind of you know facilitate people to where it gives them enough to maybe um just get by and pay their bills and stuff it's obviously not going to be enough money to maybe um replace someone's full-time uh maybe salary or anything like that but it's just hopefully there to kind of give them a little bit of boost and help and stuff like that and after the program is over they'll continue getting support through the celestia ecosystem and celestia community as well as the team and we're gonna then hopefully help them land uh additional monetary support as well in the form of fundraising and grants so uh we have a couple of milestones that we'll be focusing on throughout the three-month program so at the end of the every month we'll basically have a milestone so for the first month it's essentially them kind of diving into celestia and trying to figure out what they want to build a lot of the people that are in the program already know what they want to build but some people don't so we want to kind of give people a little bit of extra time to kind of figure that out at the end of month two we are asking them to then present what their initial ideas as well as a prototype for that idea so at the end of the first month they should have figured out the idea in the second month hopefully build out a basic prototype and then continuing in the third month building out that prototype into some type of functional product and also building out a blog post or a white paper or some type of documentation that we can then help uh share and kind of get people interested or excited about possibly investing or receiving a grant or living in their building so through this program we're thinking that people will be able to kind of like foster and build up some of their ideas or crucial parts of the celestia ecosystem um that we will hopefully see come out of it so the first the first cohort uh the applications ended on august 27th we had around 390 total applicants a lot of very very high quality applications came in from some of the top protocol engineers developers and founders from some really really successful projects that are already currently in existence so the the quality and the number of applicants that came through definitely was beyond our expectation so we're really excited about that um and the official start of this first cohort will be happening at the end of september so in about a month so between now and then we basically are kind of like going through these applicants interviewing a handful of them and trying to kind of like uh you know figure out who are going to be the the first cohort because it's quite a few applicants and then after we figured out we're going to basically be setting up that timeline and getting communications out so everything kind of smoothly um the support that the modular fellows will be receiving in addition to the monthly i mean the three thousand dollars a month they'll also have a private telegram group for them to communicate with each other as well as with a group of modular mentors which i'll talk about in just a moment we'll also have a weekly office hours for them to attend and maybe be able to ask questions and bounce ideas off of each other and other celestial team members and then in discord they're going to be receiving a special role and we're not sure exactly what we're going to be doing with that role we kind of um like obviously it'll kind of give them you know a little bit of i would say standing out like oh i'm a modular fellow it's pretty cool but also uh we we decided to not create a separate group within discord because i think a lot of the technical questions that are going to be asked through this program are going to be helpful to the community as a whole so we don't want to kind of like box those away from everyone else we want that to be part of the main discussion so like a lot of people that are developers you know and and doing anything really in any protocol at this point or using discord almost like a stack overflow or using discord as like a github or even a google where you go in and you search for challenges that you had and hopefully you have the answers to so we're hoping that a lot of the discussions that happen in discord will be helpful to the community as a whole and not just the modular fellows the modular fellows will have access to a group of modular mentors and these modular mentors are really um experienced technical people as well as founders and uh just people not only within celestia but outside of slush as well so people like zaki uh manian eric wall um are really really you know knowledgeable and experienced with a very great track record and obviously the people within celestia like mustafa john and ismail and evan are also going to be helping out so uh there isn't really i would say a better group of people that could be helping developers build on slash other than this group so we're really happy to kind of have this group that's been put together and also kind of agreed to be part of the program so once they're through with the program we are then offering additional support after that hopefully for uh the pro for the participants that kind of uh have built something that they want to continue working on and building so that will be coming in the the the type of uh support will be grant grants and funding and then we'll also be having like an alum alumni network so if someone wants to continue building out their idea we can give them a grant or help them plan a grant or if they want to kind of like found a protocol or a project and receive fundraising like we're going to also help facilitate that so that's kind of it and i will then now pass the screen share back to yes uh thank you nader for this awesome introduction to modular i'll let anyone if you have any questions about mario fellows you can always raise your hand um or um you know ask inside the chat room um you know any of your questions and we'll have it answered um and at the same time at the end of um like the uh community call we'll we will have a dedicated q a so um we can always do that as well um all right so let me go back to sharing screening um yeah let's see okay so the other cool thing that is happening at the same time that we wanted to raise awareness for everyone is there's been a great community effort in um translating the documentation currently in french and mandarin and this has been spearheaded by like an awesome fellow um core contributor uh uh gunter and at the same time who's leading the french efforts and the whole structure of how translation kind of work effort and to support them they're paying for doing uh mandarin translations um so to give you an overview um let's um so currently uh we should let me just merge this for requests um but if it's gonna go live soon but it will give you an idea of um the documentation where you get started um you're gonna find it here under community and docs translation um this is going to get updated right now just because i get murdered the pull request um and the whole idea to get started with it is on crowding um so if you go back here let me get you the link so there's a link for the crowd in here that you can see um i'm gonna try to share that link as well here um so yeah while it loads i'll try to share it as well in in the chat um whoops um so that yeah thank you media um translation activities so as you can see um currently we have uh six languages um and like the mandarin translation is in um at 45 completion uh french is at 36 completion um they keep like varying in terms of completion because as you can see the documentation keeps getting updated from time to time so that kind of changes the bar a bit um and we're also creating um currently um methi i don't know if it's live yet but on the discord channel we're gonna have like on discord server for celestia we're gonna have our community translation channel so if you're interested uh yeah so we'll have it live soon if you're interested in translation efforts um go on that channel once it's live and ask about how you can get started um uh yeah i mean igor if you want to get started with russian um reach out to gunter on the community translation channel um i'll write down his username and uh he'll help you on board you get you started and stuff um joining crowdin as a member and like understanding the structure and how to like submit translations uh for your respective languages uh and yeah and soon we're gonna have like we're gonna merge it uh uh you know all the different translations we're doing it uh step by step currently we're going to murder what is already available in french and chinese and uh soon after that the others kind of progress they rely on community efforts um yeah thank you gunther um feel free to reach out to him on discord and he'll help you on board um and uh recently uh yeah definitely talk to ting if you want to trans help translate mandarin and um it's a it's great to see because as you can see the community effort happening um over on that um it's fun like gunther is saying um and you can see how people like you know there's so many people like supporting and translating um and like for example yeah um i think they updated the ui as well here for um the translation um and yeah i mean dimitrov if you want to do it for ukrainian would love to have ukrainian translations as well um so yeah like uh soon we'll we can get started um you'll find a link here updated on community under doc's translation um once it goes live i think we'll be going live um in a minute or so um this hasn't been updated yet but you'll find the updated link for how to join crowd in here and join the uh community translation uh channel on discord and that will help you get on boarded um if you if you have any questions about that feel free to ask otherwise we can move on to the next topic on the agenda and if you want to ask you can ask and like you know overvoice raise their hands so we can unmute you or ask directly on the chat otherwise we can move on to the next um items um and the same ever say can help with ukrainian translation love to see it please um it's a great community effort um and like you know you know it's a great thing because you get to see um different people translating different items on the documentation and soon over time we can expand it to uh the celestia.org website and and you know continue translation effort across our repos so on future updates for developers on the roadmap so one of the major updates um we haven't really announced it yet but it's like a work on progress for the time being is we're going to launch a devnet a developer network um this one is not going to be there's not going to be any validator participation in this one because the focus of it is to continue having to have a network that is specifically focused for a developer using the latest build from celestia um core components um and we're gonna have more updates on that um within the coming weeks um and with that we're also gonna have a new kind of uh roll-up uh uh that you can also get started to build on and there'll be a lot of great content for developers to um experiment with whatever smart contract in either cargo museum or in evm kind of smart contracts and they will all be connected to the new devnet and mamaki which is our existing test net will be continued uh to be used for anything related to validator operation at the same time developers can continue building on mamati um and one thing to look forward in mamaki if you're a validator on mamaki is we're going to have a hard fork around october and uh that hard work will coordinate it with the validators on mamaki and that one will be the first upgrade that we're going to do on mamaki and that will open up a lot of doors um in terms of what is possible on mamaki and allow you to build new kind of tools and um sovereign roll-ups and anything related to that um other than that i'm gonna i'm gonna allow i'm gonna get the floor to the celestial lab engineers if they want to talk about any exciting update for a developer to look forward to maybe i'll give it to evan if evan had any kind of updates on like the hard work what to expect and stuff i don't want to put you on the spot evan but if you want to talk about it um well we should have an upcoming hard fork for milwaukee at in the beginning of october this hard fork will be a little bit different if you're running a node than a normal hard fork um it's not fully specced out yet but effectively the upgrade will involve just running a new node so it's like you're taking the state some of this state of the old chain and moving it to a new chain um and that new chain i i think will be named something else other than mamaki and then um mamaki will actually after that upgrade assuming everything goes well i think we'll actually shut down my maki but i'm not 100 positive on that cool thanks for the update evan um any other updates from the engineer that you know for people to look forward to on maybe [Music] whether it's qgb or celestia core or celestia node um now's your time if you guys want to talk about any cool things that are happening on the roadmap oh uh let me make you a co-host um uh glib you can you can unmute yourself i believe okay i'm just raising heads so you see uh i think yeah i just want to do a quick note that there will be a celestia note release very soon so like please take a look at it once it done it's like once the the disney devnet that he has mentioned is is um released it will also have a new releases list and also everyone are welcome to play around and enjoy it and um run a full node which was not um in the past release but it will be in this one and we will have a lot of feature improvements thank you um yeah and this is kind of like our update so far um [Music] if anyone has any kind of questions not the time to ask but now we're going to q a so so mamati is actually a testament we classified and marketed the testament which is more focused on validator um operations so that validator can participate in it and the new devnet that we're focused on there won't be any need for validator participation because to focus more on continuous updates to the new devnet we don't have a name for it yet but hopefully within the next few weeks we'll have an update on that and the documentation will be updated to reflect that so then you'll have two different networks as a developer one is mamaki which is you know it has like a unique set of validators um 150 validators and you can build on that and that one you're gonna go undergo a hard fork like evan said early october the other one is going to be a devnet with no external validator participation and would the aim a bit to be um with the aim of it to be focused more on developers building the latest uh roll-up using the most up-to-date um releases um from all the different celestial components what is celestia core celestia node or celestia app um so a question by d mars uh does celestia support educational initiatives for non-developers um can you expand on that um like what do you mean like is it more like are you asking for um educational initiative on how to become a developer on top of celestia or more related to how to interact with celestia if you can expand on that dvrs we can wait for you to type yeah just raise your hand so i can unmute you you know how to raise your hand or maybe you can just do it right you're okay yeah okay aston you okay all right go ahead hello hear me yep thank you what i mean by educational initiatives for non-developers is more like explaining the concepts because you know most people don't know about modular blockchains they just know about blockchains and sometimes they don't even know like more about that so like educating people like with articles or videos or meetups about what a modular blockchain is and how celestia works but not on a developer level but like at the conceptual level do you know what i mean yeah totally um i think for that like um we did speak about it like when we first um neither feel free to correct me if i'm wrong but we just speak about when we designed the modular fellows program that maybe future iteration of the modular fellows program can allow for um non-technical projects but more like educational stuff but maybe you can help clarify that another yeah that's correct we're planning on um in the future possibly doing more around that but i think that like our main focus right now is building out all of the applications and protocol level things that we need to allow developers to build stuff and as people are building stuff maybe we'll then try to expand on you know maybe broadening the funnel of people that were um bringing into the ecosystem to like more non-technical people i guess so i don't think dmoz is asking about modular fellows i think he's just asking about uh educational initiatives in general uh i just uh we do have a we don't have we do have a section on the website called learn modular which i just linked to in the chat so if you go to celestia.org learn there's a bunch of art there's like six articles on there targeted towards non-developers to explain the basic concepts of them of multiple blockchains which i would recommend checking out thanks mustapha um and also on our like documentation page um let me show you guys we have a section called concepts and in it it goes deeper into how celestia work but that is more like technical but then you also have a link to the learn module or like that mr talking about and the glossary so it's like external link that if you go it will take you to the learn modules section and they have exactly what you're looking for in terms of like um explaining modular blockchain versus monolithic blockchains so hopefully that clarifies it um a question by eddie b so we can plan ahead are there a spectral hardware consideration for validating on celestia such a gpu secure guard enclave i think that whatever um and htsm so we do have a specification for how to run a node if you go to validator node and hardware requirement i'm going to link it to you here eddie um that will give you an idea on the hardware requirement for running a validator node on top of mamaki of course my pleasure um can you put up the link on the non-dev and for okay uh mustafa already did that um let's go to the next question um yusun lee i have a question i'm not a devon this is very broad will celestia ultimately be compatible with all three other consensus date availability layer um so in a way yes uh where if you think about it like um all the other layer one chain as um like a settlement layer or an execution environment then in theory any any any kind of any of those chain as an execution environment whether it's a train that executes move smart contracts or evm smart contracts or like the solana smart contract i forgot their names um ultimately they can plug into celestia for data availability and that is kind of like the like division for us right um and but whether those actual chains would migrate to use celestia for data availability versus projector execution environment being available for developers to connect to the celestia data availability or two separate things um but dance area questions um it definitely would be able to be compatible yes um next question by ron beirut i know rod from university out of interest from what you've seen so far from the modular fellows application what types of project are engineered into stated buildings so far so that is a question for nader now do you want to answer that one yeah so we've seen um really a lot of different types so we've seen protocol engineers people that have actually helped build out other existing protocols that are like being used today and successful some of the the ideas have to do with things like indexing so indexing is an unsolved problem and there also doesn't really exist in indexing solutions for celestia we've seen people that have proposed building various types of of execution environments so that one of the things that we want to happen is to have different execution environments so seeing a lot of uh of those types of proposals coming in was really great um we have people that want to build out i would say like almost similar products to what would were already like existing on other protocols so things like debug protocols and and maybe nft types of smart contracts and stuff have been proposed people have proposed building out sdks and tooling for for celestia and improvements around you know um how developers might deploy and build and kind of like the whole life cycle or maybe a sovereign roll-up so some of those ideas have come through um but there's been really all types of types of ideas gaming has been um one that i've seen a handful of times in fact we have someone that has a very very successful track record in gaming uh that is part that is uh submitted to be part of the the program that i can't really probably obviously say their identity until we kind of decided on who's going to be admitted but um really really successful uh protocol developer of a web 3 game as our it's probably going to be part of the program so yeah i mean a very a very wide variety of people cool thank you nader um hopefully that that answers your question um i'm going to allow people a few more minutes if you want to ask more questions i don't like we can um you know uh close down the community call um earlier if there are no more questions maybe in the meantime we can like you know oh uh so a question by hc can someone please explain how layer two will benefit from data availability and celestia that are not currently supported by layer ones like eth anyone wants to take that question um let me just read it again how alternative yeah i don't really i don't fully understand the question um l2s that aren't currently supported by other ones like these uh i don't know um yeah i'll try to clarify with hc um yeah yeah please raise your hand and we'll unmute you just so we can find you okay now you should be able to unmute yourself yeah hey thanks for allowing me to ask questions i'm totally a newbie and not developer so maybe i'm asking you know probably the wrong question but my understanding from reading some of the stuff and it's very preliminary is that um you know celestia offers data availability um and you know there's some benefits you know especially with regards to having uh you know light um you know light nodes or not non-fully nodes but i'm just trying to understand like you know as you guys are positioning yourself as the um the uh you know that layer for say the l2s why would they want to come to over to celestia that i mean what are the benefits that you guys offer that say ethereum doesn't isn't already offering them and i was under the assumption that ethereum is not offering data availability but and so but you know obviously optimism and arbitrage i mean they're working they're running uh what would be the benefit for them to come over to celestia does that that question makes sense well the main the main immediate benefit is higher their port like ethereum does offer data availability but the 34 is basically like 10 kilobytes per block right now until five eip1559 so like arbitrarily can still only do very few transactions per second before the transaction fees go very high uh but i mean 1559 is already launched it's been out there for yeah sorry i mean the other eip eip four eight four four uh uh okay is that that dang sure okay got it got it okay so you're saying that basically um but then once that thing gets launched then what is the advantage of celestia over ethereum at that point uh well we still want to have greater their throughput than than that eip as well but also more generally um celestia is the overhead is a is a specialized data layer which means we only do data we don't do settlement or computation which means that we don't have like that we don't have um the baggage the baggage from the avm which means we can kind of uh specialize more on that and that means we're more of a credibly neutral overhead minimize the a layer for sovereign roll-ups as well which is something that we're trying to kind of push okay too so no i appreciate that partner but do you mind explaining how does the uh the lack of throughput relates to how ethereum does currently does data availability versus how you guys do data availability well i mean the main reason right now is because ethereum kind of couples the pricing for gas and data right now which means like uh yeah you have this you have this concept of gas on ethereum and it's like uh the cut there's no separate free markets for data and computation so right now because applications are on the theorem right now uh technically like this on average about 10 kilobytes of actual cool data space on ethereum firewall correctly so like we're because we don't do computation you're only those only do data availability uh all the block the entire block is dedicated and then plus we also use techniques like data availability sampling to allow us to use kl data without sacrificing security got it got it okay got it and then what's the relative comparison in terms of advantage that you guys have once um ethereum launches dank sharding the main advantage is uh well we first of all we still want higher there if we put than the end goal thanks for charging which is thanks for watching have 16 megabytes per block we want to have higher than that like 100 megabytes per block and secondly there's still the fact that because we don't have a enshrined computation layer where more fluidly neutral and uh overhead minimized the air layer for solving roll-ups got it yeah let me certainly make sense i mean obviously as you know as pretty much all the industries across the tech sphere um as you know as they go through mature go through maturity cycles and specialization becomes more prevalent to remove the bottle next um just but you said earlier that you said that once tank charting um shows up for ethereum it's 16 or 60. i'm just trying to understand that 16 okay so you're still a lot more relatively factors of like six times more than they than they their capability is yeah that's that's the kind of angle of already okay got it thanks very much for taking my question really appreciate it thank you for asking uh great question great conversation so far um another question by eddie b um i don't know if it's a question or comment but i'm gonna read it out anyways if the encryption used by the chain is not supported by an hsm etc bls um svx then it might not be then it is not up to the operator and horcrux might not be usable for a selector without major overhaul since it uses uh celestia core instead of tendermint um does us it's all good um does anyone want to comment on that um because i don't have i don't think i have context on whether horcrux is not might not be usable for selected without a major overhaul since it uses celestico instead of tendermint they give him at least comment on that um our changes to tendermint are very minimal and you we use the same keys like the same key type so you should be able to use four cuts okay hope that clarifies it eddie um nice okay cool um okay another question by rod uh how would celestia work from non-custodial wallet perspective would the wallet need to support celestia somehow or would a wallet just need to support the execution train and act as a light note to the data availabilities uh sampling celestia um so i can take a crack at it and maybe the rest of the team can um answer um so on the celestial data availability side uh like the data availability layer you still have like non-custodial wallets um because um on the celestia network you combine both the validator set with the data availability layer so you do have um non-custodial wallets that you can generate um but that only it for validators um to order transaction you pay for block space and that is the function of the you know the celestia specific non-custodial wallet on the settlement layered or execution change they would have separate wallets and each one would be separate and you know specified by each sovereign roll-up or settlement layer i'll give the floor for anyone else to add on it or like you know help clarify it more okay um any more question anyone um okay so question by michael pro because there are three layers to complete an entire functional blockchain how do new dev build on celestia that is a great question so um as a new developer it depends on what part of the layer you care about now a lot of like in in web3 a lot of people um focus on the application layer like you're building apple like you know decentralized application on top of their favorite um smart contract um execution environment the predominantly right now is evm where ethereum is uh change for evm specific smart contracts so if that is your focus um then all you care about is building on top of that settlement layer and the settlement layer itself will connect to the data variability layer on its own but you as an application developer you don't have to necessarily worry about that um because you're building maybe you're building on a layer to roll up like an optimism or arbitrary specific roll-up that kind of connects directly um to a settlement layer that on celestia that also plugged into the data availability layer so you as an application developer that's what you care about you don't have to care about the underlying layers because that is handled by the other layers themselves but if you want to build a sovereign layer like a sovereign roll-up that connects directly to the data variability layer um then you um either have to like you would have to spin up your own sovereign roll up your cell and then build that specific kind of uh application specific um components of it and that is more like if you're building a cosmos sdk chain at the sovereign roll up then you would have to um both quick data like um you know worry about like you know spinning up that network um and you know building those components at the same time plugging it into the celestia data availability layers so that you can submit transaction um do uh for block to be submitted uh to the date availability later um so because it's so modular you have so many different approaches that you can take depending on what kind what is available to you as a toolkit um so it the like to summarize the answer it depends on where your focus is um and if your focus is lower on the data like on like the lowest level like building maybe api or developer tooling for solicitor data availability layer then you can just interact with that layer if you're if you care more about spinning up your own layer to roll up on top of this existing sediment layer that could be your focus um and you don't have to worry about the other components or if you just want to build an application on top up and like an optimism or arbitrary type of roll up that connect to celestia then that would be your focus like you wouldn't have to worry about the other underlying um hc uh well actually let me go in order um i hope michael i hope that answered the question let me know if it doesn't um for everyone that wants to learn more about one okay um hc if the cosmo destiny the only template for the sovereign rollout at the moment yes but that doesn't mean like that's going to be the only template so this is just the one that we have integrated so far so if you go here to optimum um it's just like with optima it's just an abc i wrapper and currently the abci wrapper is around cosmos sdk but you can build an abci wrapper for any other kind of execution environments so it's not limited to cog mode sdk but that's like for the first version because it's super alpha uh an alpha stage optimum um we should have it right now for cognos sdk but you're not limited to cloud modification okay i would like to ask some things first of all you can use abci without cosmos decay it's possible so you are not limited to cosmos is decay this is the first thing and second thing is uh in the future maybe not near future but in the future we plan to make optimint more agnostic so it won't right now it's only we're only providing abci interface but in the future we would like to provide other interface so you can integrate different execution layers directly into uh directly with optimum or use optimism as more like a library for your roll-up so this is the plan for the future but right now uh this is how uh how you build your sovereign uh roll up on top of celestia and of course you can always use you can always use a celestial node api directly and try to create something from from scratch so this is the the hardest way thank you um another question by hc is what is abci interface so abc i stand for application blockchain interface um i think there should be like i can try to pull up a link for you on application blockchain interviews um yeah and here's maybe some reading on it yeah okay i think um yeah thanks evan um and and josh i don't want to miss on anyone um and let me go back to the community and see if the new link is updated okay it's perfect so gunther new uh uh link is updated so here's um just for link for the translation you can see the crowding project link here and and you know everything i was like you know explaining like um you know what what what how do you get onboarded onto the documentation translation so check it out let us know what you think if you want to participate in translation um hang out on discord go to their community translation uh channel reach out to gunter and he'll help onboard you for whatever language that you want you're interested in with that we got six minutes left um there's been a great amount of question being asked um i'll give you guys another opportunity if you want to ask more questions otherwise we can end it earlier ah h c go ahead you can unmute now hey sorry i don't want to dominate too many questions but since uh no one else is asking i was curious so i mean obviously from a total newbies perspective um you guys are making a much more efficient blockchain and you know obviously with reduced costs and better features what not but at the end of the day um you know if i was out there developing an application i want to go where there are many users and many other applications that could potentially develop from a composer you know just take advantage of composabilities and whatnot and obviously that's still going to be ethereum you know in that world what's your plan in terms of getting that that adoption you know the the kink in the adoption curve where because if i can go up and develop an application but no one's going to come to my uh to my chain or sovereign chain or whatever it may be but you know if i develop on ethereum obviously there's there are already many users and many other apps that may want to be you know trying to be composable to my app or whatnot what's your thinking and that what's your strategy i can take a crack at it but i think i other might also have other input so one cool um project that the team is working on is called the quantum gravity bridge so if you if you follow the thesis that you're describing that majority of the users are on ethereum right um or maybe on different roll-ups on top of ethereum then with the quantum gravit as an approach you as a roll-up with a lot of users can still settle on ethereum but get data availability from celestia because again celestia is a data availability network and settlement layer can integrate with it or not or um roll up can use celestia or not um and i can try to get you like a link to that but that is one approach because like you know celestia followed that modular structure and architecture um the quantum gravity bridge is one approach for that and would with a thing that we call celestiums but won't that i'm sorry but won't that's i mean because i'm still using ethereum won't that also when i continue to incur ethereum costs i mean obviously there's a lot of traffic and users or whatnot but what is the savings in that case or is there enough is there some kind of a carve out where by using celestia my total cost that the total cost being paid on ethereum is much less and there's a net savings or net benefit in that case evan you want to answer that question yeah sure i mean we do have a blog post on this that i think goes into a lot more details that would answer a lot of these questions probably like uh a lot better than i could here but um yeah where you the cost savings come from data availability costs and from celestia being a very scalable data availability layer so is it possible go ahead sorry no sorry i mean can you please um can you please submit the link or publish the link for the blog post yeah sure i'll post it okay thanks thank you yeah there's a lot of users in uh material more but there's also a lot of users in entire i would say cosmos decay ecosystem and because of the ipc inter-blockchain communication you can gather a lot of users there are great lots of lots of great app specific chains and you can easily communicate between them and send tokens between them because of the ibc and once you will have your sovereign roll up ipc compatible you will be accessible for all of those users and this is also a huge [Music] huge impact i would say because it will enable creating it will give the uh easier i would say onboarding experience if you can for example go to osmosis and swap your token or to some up specific token and then send it or use another dex in the ibc world and then go straight to your to your specific roll up it will be super super nice yeah there's also like uh again we we talk about some of this other this stuff on our blog but it's celestia is very much made for um it's made for a lot of things just data availability in general but also sovereign roll-ups which if you want to use a smart contract and a settlement layer then that's cool um but there are benefits to sovereign roll-ups that you can't get any other way and like you can't use a settlement layer so if if your project wants those benefits then i then there really isn't another option okay i want to be mindful that we're currently at time and you know um i want to end this call um you see if you're available on discord um join our discord like the team also is available there if you want to ask questions um whether in general or developers where we're happy to answer continue to conversation if you have more questions um and yeah thank you so much for your question and thank you everyone for your time and for attending the call um and uh we'll we're gonna have another celestial community call in the future to talk about any future updates that we have and be on the lookout for new cool things that we're gonna uh release and like for developers and things that you can play around with and yeah thank you so much i'm gonna stop sharing the screen now and i'm gonna start and i'm gonna end the recording take care everyone
