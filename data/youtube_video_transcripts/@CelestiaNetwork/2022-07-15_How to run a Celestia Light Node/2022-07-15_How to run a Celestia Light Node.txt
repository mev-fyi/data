in this video you will learn how to set up a celestia light node which will allow you to do data sampling on the data availability network light nodes ensure data availability this is the most common way to interact with the celestia network to get started we'll visit the docs at docs.celestia.org here we'll click on developers and then node tutorial let's get started by checking out the hardware requirements by clicking here as you can see the hardware requirements for running a light node are two gigs of memory a single core cpu five gigs of solid-state drive and 56 kilobits per second bandwidth it's also recommended that you be working from a linux environment next let's go ahead and set up the dependencies we can follow the tutorial for setting up the dependencies by clicking here the first thing that we'll do is copy this command to update and upgrade the operating system next we'll download and install the packages required to run the lite node by copying the next command and running it in our terminal finally we'll install go on our machine by copying the commands here and running them as well next we'll configure our path and then we'll check the go version to make sure the go binary is ready to go now that our dependencies are set up we'll follow the installation guide for installing the celestia node by clicking here next we can install the celestia node binary by copying the commands here and running them in our terminal we can now check to see that celestia has been successfully installed by running celestia version now that celestion has been properly installed we can now instantiate a celestial light node by running celestial light in it you can optionally create a wallet and request testnet tokens if you would like to send transactions to the network but in this tutorial we'll be simply reading data from the network and we will skip this step next we want to connect to a public core endpoint you can find a list of the public core endpoints listed here and we're going to go ahead and click that link and we're going to grab the endpoint that is listed first here rpc-mamaki dot pops.1 and we'll be using this rpc endpoint in this command here we can now run the celestialite node by running the command listed here along with the rpc endpoint that we copied to our clipboard now that the celestial light node is running we can start testing out api calls the first thing that we can do is query the balance for the default account this balance should be zero unless you've requested test net tokens to the address for the account here we see the response as amount being 0 which is what we expect next we can request the block header information by running the following query if you've requested tokens and would like to submit a pay for data transaction you can also scroll down and see the instructions on how to do so here for information about additional node api endpoints check out the node api documentation here
