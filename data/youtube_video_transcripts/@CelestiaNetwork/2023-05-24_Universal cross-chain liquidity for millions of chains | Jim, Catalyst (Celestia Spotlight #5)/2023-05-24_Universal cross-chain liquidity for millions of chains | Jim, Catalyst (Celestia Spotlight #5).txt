once we lay the foundation of unified Capital efficient permission list slash automatic liquidity for a world of millions of chains then we can start building more building blocks on top of that what's up modular Fam I'm here again with another episode of Celestia spotlights um I have Jim from Catalyst here catalyst is building cross-chain liquidity for the modular future and as you guys know you know in the modular future the vision is that we're going to have millions of chains the thing is when you have millions of chains they're going to need some way to bridge assets across from each other so that they can interoperate and and users can use all these different apps and so bridging is a really really big part of the modular future so that's why I'm really excited to have Jim to tell us all about Catalyst and how it's solving that problem and so Jim thanks for coming on uh tell us a bit about yourself yeah definitely and thanks for thanks for having me on um happy to share more about kind of what we're building a catalysts and uh and kind of give a high level overview of what we're thinking for the future um but yeah so it's like what you said catalyst is basically built for this kind of Vision that uh I think a lot of people have have come to consensus around which is you know the modular blockchain thesis and how that kind of um you know what are kind of the implications of having like you know a modularized kind of sets of tools and Primitives that developers and now you know uh individuals can can use and I think one of the implications is very much like a proliferation of chains and essentially you know uh the breaking of kind of a lot of the existing infrastructure we use in that new world right and so right now we have Smart contracts or we have kind of like defy or nft protocols that kind of work in a multi-chain context of like five chains right or six chains or what have you uh but what happens when there's like thousands of chains or tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions right like you can't just keep deploying the same thing and using the same kind of uh like Governor like governance contracts or coordination contracts we're using we kind of need to scale that right and so uh those are all the questions and the general through line that Catalyst thinks about and I would say like broadly that's our mandate and right now we're trying to solve what we think is the most pressing issue uh within that kind of problem statement which is bridging like what you mentioned right like very kind of foundational and and uh and Baseline is just like okay how do you actually move value between uh these chains in the world of proliferation of chains and so that's kind of uh our our mandate got it so it's uh bridging is the first step but the the long-term vision for catalyst is to solve all the various problems of coordinating applications across this really vast uh multi-chain future yeah absolutely and we could talk more about that uh later later in the in the chat but yeah I think like right now 100 of our focus is uh on this kind of bridging piece like we see ourselves as like a like our team uh are we're mainly like cross-chain experts right like we love cross chain we love interoperability and we think about all the time uh but we're kind of also applying our D5 background to uh kind of solving this really foundational problem right now cool well uh yeah why don't we dive into the slides I think you prepared a presentation um and then we can go from there like what we said catalyst is uh cross chain liquidity uh for the modular future uh and so basically what we're going to walk through quickly is kind of what is the modular future kind of what is the problem statement that uh kind of lines up with that and why we think uh you know catalyst is the perfect solution to solve the liquidity piece uh of that and so yeah the problem um you know I can kind of Breeze through this because we already kind of talked about it in a more truncated sense earlier um but the future will have millions of chains um we think by you know modularizing what was previously a monolithic kind of um set of functions that a blockchain did into the four different disparate pieces allows for a lot of scalability ease of deployment and customization uh at you know various levels especially the execution level and so when we look at it from an execution sense um you know we think that every application will essentially have its own chain or have its own roll up right it'll have its own execution environment that's tailor-made to perfectly do uh the exact things that um that this application wants to do right it's going to have the right gas prices it's going to have a native gas token it's going to have optimizations on the opcode level it's going to have Mev capture et cetera et cetera right and so don't need to kind of go down that rabbit hole necessarily but this is something that we think is um kind of like a consensus take at this point that like we want to customize and optimize these execution layers using the modular blockchain stack and because of that since every application have its own chain and we think there's going to be you know thousands hundreds of thousands millions of chains therefore you can kind of come to logical conclusion that you're just going to be a lot of chains and so that's awesome right I think we're all very excited for kind of this future of of a proliferation of chains uh but unfortunately there are implications that come from that uh that we need to be thinking about and so in this kind of modular future world what does that kind of look like and so the first thing that happens uh once you know we have a world of millions of chains is that we lose kind of the connectivity that we used to have when we all had kind of applications on a shared State machine uh and so that's not really kind of a good thing right it was kind of the the drawing point of crypto kind of the ethos of crypto to have the sense of connectivity uh and and to kind of be able to share the states of one another uh that was kind of the drawing point of ethereum at least when it started with its World computer narrative and so losing that by having kind of a proliferation of chains is not ideal um kind of analog I'm kind of um you know related to that is uh the composability piece right with defy summer with The Narrative of money Legos we did see the power of what it means to permissionlessly combine different Primitives together or have some form of atomicity when you when you create transactions in the form of flash loans or what have you and so we also lose that right when we move to a multi-chain context we're no longer able to have those guarantees um which is which is kind of defeating the purpose of the magic of crypto as as we've seen it um and we also lose existing infrastructure and so this is kind of a really important piece that I don't really see a lot of people talking about um but all the things that we enjoy in kind of Monolithic uh blockchain environments uh do break in kind of this context and so you know the wallets that we enjoy the the data indexing slash block Explorer slash analytics dashboards that we enjoy aren't able to kind of keep up with the pace of continuous deployments of chains right same said with uh with kind of our PC nodes and and governance kind of Frameworks and oracles and so this kind of is a bit of a a snowballing effect so to speak when we have a lot of these different chains and they break kind of the existing structures and and standards in place that allow us to you know actually access the information interact with the information from these chains and so that really bodes the question of okay we have a world of millions of chains lots of things are going to break we're going to lose a lot of the magic of what crypto is in this future so how do we actually building for the modular future and I kind of lay out three really important principles um so the first important principle is automatic which kind of makes sense right as there are more and more chains kind of spinning up it becomes incredibly trivial to the point of you know one click two clicks of deploying an execution environment you want to actually automatically integrate them as they go live right and so right now that isn't necessarily the case right when a new chain goes live there's a whole kind of process in which you know the these new chains need to be integrated into a lot of existing infrastructure and in the future we need to change that we need to have automatic inclusion of these new chains and so things that I think are are really exciting are modular cloud of course right um formerly known as Celestia scan is kind of thinking about this from a data indexing perspective and then metamask is not quite automatic but I think as good of a automatic experience that we have right now in the sense that okay if you're following some sort of gen General specification you have a chain ID you can kind of just add it to metamask but we do need something that is a bit more scalable in the future as it pertains to the wallet design space um we also need to be permissionless right it kind of doesn't make sense if we have this world of millions of chains and um you know you kind of need to go through a belabored kind of governance process or have some sort of you know offline or off-chain BD meeting in order to actually deploy you know products or or actually connect These Chains together um we need that to be you know as easy as possible so that you know it could be kind of an open cross-chain economy so to speak uh that can transact with one another and so things I think are really cool from a permissionless perspective are uh you know joke Dao and and Caldera as well which is a role as a service project um and then we need to be extensible right I think you know the the notion that we live in a or what we can enforce kind of a single standard in which execution environments or just modular blockchains in general uh can operate in it is a bit naive I think kind of the Genies out of the bottle there and so how are you actually building Primitives that are flexible enough to adapt or to easily expand to this heterogeneous heterogeneous environment uh it is super important and so um you know right now we have kind of a world of different VMS you know different consensus mechanisms signature schemes Etc we kind of need to move to a world in which we have some sense of of not quite shared standards but a way in which you know um or an adaptable way in which these protocols can go into these different VMS and consensus mechanisms quite trivially and so our solution when we think about this design space is how do we take these three principles of what building for the modular future looks like and actually applying that to to to what we think is one of the most important problems in the space which is just connecting chains together and and moving value to to and from them and so the first thing that we're doing is uh automatic chain connections and so the power of catalysts that I think makes it very different from any other kind of liquidity layer or any kind of bridge uh out there right now is that as new chains come live catalyst is built in a way in which you know uh the connections to these chains actually come out of the box right if you have Catalyst and you're a new chain that's being deployed you can automatically start swapping with any other chain that has Catalyst and I can talk a little bit more about how that's possible uh the second thing that we have is is permissionlessness and so we have permissionless cross-chain pools and so kind of similar to how chains are automatically kind of connected through Catalyst we also have the ability to permissionlessly create new pools on any of these chains and so let's say you know you're a new polygon modular chain and of course you want to support Matic but you want to facilitate swaps from ethereum as well again once this polygon modular chain is deployed it can actually connect to any other chain that catalyst is deployed on uh but you still need a pool to be created right you need some sort of value to be deposited so that these tokens can start swapping and so in this case you can just connect to the Catalyst smart contract on ethereum connect to the eth pool have your Matic pool on the polygon modular chain and you can start permissionlessly swapping again this is all straight from out of the gates upon initialization of this polygon modular chain and then lastly we have an extensible protocol design Catalyst essentially is built in a way that is so lightweight and extensible that it kind of spans uh or kind of it can be deployed into different kind of um virtual machines or different kind of other specifications of an execution environment quite trivially and again I can talk more about how that's the case um and and that's really powerful because again we're kind of seeing this environment of different virtual machines different standards different ways in which data is communicated and propagated and catalyst is again flexible enough to kind of navigate all those things uh actually quite trivially and so that's something that we're incredibly proud of because again we're building for this modular future of a lot of different standards and environments and we want to make sure that we can capture them all in a very lightweight and extensible way and so I talked a lot about how we've built Catalyst based on those three principles and why we think that's really well fit for the modular future but I think I should actually say what Catalyst does and so Catalyst uh is essentially an amm uh you know that's the mechanism design that Catalyst deploys in order to facilitate these kind of cross-chain swaps uh and they do so by essentially having uh assets that live in pools but on separate chains and so in this instance you know we have again that similar example I use we have eth on ethereum and we also have Matic on this polygon modular chain what Catalyst does is essentially allows for the swapping of these tokens by using something that we call the unit of liquidity and essentially with a unit of liquidity is is it's a calculation of how much kind of liquidity that's been added into the origin pool and you kind of calculate that into kind of a shared number or shared standard that every Catalyst smart contract understands as a universal form of liquidity and then upon receipt of that message on the destination chain they can then withdraw the necessary amount of Matic uh into the uh the user's wallet and so let's walk through this specific use case let's say a user deposits one eth onto ethereum you can see here that now the eth which is C in this case has increased into the pool what Catalyst does is it just calculates how many you know units of liquidity have been deposited and they send that as a cross chain message and so in this case you know let's say three units of liquidity have been deposited and they send it as a message and so once the Catalyst Mark contract pool receives that information on the polygon modular chain they then convert that into how much Matic needs to be deposited or withdrawn from the chain oh sorry we're drawn from the pool into the user's wallet and so again that's actually how Catalyst works it's pretty simple user deposits assets catalyst is basically calculating this mathematical value it gets passed as a message upon receipt on the destination chain again the pool sends the Matic into the user's wallet and so from a user's perspective they just sold one eth and they got the liquidity equivalent amount of Matic uh and their in their Wallets on a different chain and so that's kind of interesting in a one-to-one use case right kind of interesting I think what becomes more interesting is thinking about it from a one-to-many use case and so Catalyst can kind of connect to you know not just a one-to-one relationship but a one-to-many relationship right and so in this instance let's say the user wants to swap their eth but doesn't actually want Matic from polygon modular chain they actually have the option to you know redeem essentially their liquidity units from any other chain on the Catalyst Network so to speak and so in this instance they say okay I actually want dydx on the dydx app chain which is in Cosmos in this case and they can absolutely do that and receive the idx on their dydx AB chain wallet sorry I said dydx a lot of times um yeah so that is at least at a high level or somewhat of a 202 level how Catalyst works but hopefully that kind of explains why we're building what we're building the values behind what we're building and a little bit of a sneak peek a sneak peek into kind of how it works from a mechanism design perspective thank you Jim that was uh fantastic um there's a lot to to dig into I have some probably just some really super basic questions first uh for for the audience to kind of like help understand a little bit better so so that you mentioned there's these pools on these different chains is there are they all kind of unified into one pool or they're separate pools between each chain so the way that Catalyst works is there are assets that live in Chains right so like there there would be a pool per asset for each chain and they're connected to other pools of assets on other machines and so like each pool is kind of like has is doing accounting about itself saying like this is how many liquidity units I have in my pool and I like as a user I have a certain certain number of those units of liquidity belong to me and then at any moment I can say hey I want to you know redeem my this unit of liquidity on a different chain uh to withdraw like an asset somewhere else so it's so they are kind of like one unified pool but they're they're uh they're living on different chains essentially they speak the same language yeah exactly you can kind of think I think there's two helpful ways to frame the unit of liquidity one is that you know you use the word counting it's very much just an accounting abstraction right it's like there is a unified kind of um like metric that all the Catalyst Pools use in order to communicate how much liquidity there is and essentially you were just kind of moving them around such that you know in the in the composite system view the liquidity remains equal right that that's how we ensure like that's how we ensure like a competitive price and an accurate price between these cross-chain pools of of different assets um so that's like one good Framing and another framing you use is like it's basically like a receipt right it's like a receipt that you can kind of redeem in any other Catalyst pool in the destination chain got it and uh yeah I know that you that like you guys are still you know in the process of releasing the white paper so you can't necessarily share everything so feel free to like just you know uh say that you'll answer certain questions later but um when uh uh when I like so how is it possible that the chain knows the amount of liquidity it has does it have like an oracle like how does it know the value of those assets to be able to like manage the accounting part yeah that's not something that I can provide too much detail into at the moment okay um but I will say that uh it's non-oracle um you know we don't you know we don't rely on oracles or to price these assets um we're also only using native assets so there's no form of like rap token or or virtualize liquidity so you're just using the native assets um but essentially like at a high level catalyst is a math librarian that you know ensures the uh the synchronous like the synchronized accounting of the entire system and how that's done is uh will be revealed uh with our white paper in the coming week that is Juicy I am excited to hear how that works um all right so some one last like really basic question so what are the components of catalysts right so obviously there's the like the sort of like pool contract where I can like deposit things but then is there some other contract that is managing you know passing messages between the uh different chains is there like are there is there like a relayer uh kind of uh I guess responsibility or a role in in the protocol or do you use some kind of existing message passing service that that handles that side of it for you yeah so there's three pieces the catalyst excuse me um so the first piece is kind of what we were just discussing right it's like the the pools that that hold the assets um and basically communicate like the units of liquidity um or calculate units of liquidity Within These pools and then eventually communicate them um the second piece is um our like cross-chain messaging interface and so we don't have our own like relaying Network to pass this information what we do instead is we essentially leverage or you know said differently like piggyback off of existing kind of arbitrary messaging protocols in order to pass this unit of liquidity message right amongst other metadata that's important like destination address and and some other things um and so like that we're basically leveraging like ambs um which is why kind of where we see ourselves as is very much like a pure liquidity play as opposed to like uh you know competing in like the general message passing space um so that that that's kind of the second piece and then the third piece is basically we have um like security mechanisms right uh and so in addition to the security that we you know inherit from our arbitrary messaging uh protocol kind of Partners we also have our own or like the protocol has its own kind of uh opinion on what security should be and so that's essentially you know said intuitive ways like rate limits at least to start right um as a form of training wheels and then the second piece is even with the train wheels off we have an anomaly detector and so an intelligent way in which we're able to detect you know erroneous transactions essentially and again can share more about that uh in the coming weeks but uh we want to have many layers of security because we are operating in a very you know scrutinized space yeah absolutely and I mean they're you know a lot in the theme of last year I feel was uh you know major Bridge checks and so uh it's really smart to to be cautious and I mean rate limiting is such a no-brainer I don't know why that hasn't been implemented you know more often um because obviously like it's got you think it's like there's there's kind of a common pattern among like Bridge hacks where it's like oh all of a sudden all the liquidity is gone and like uh maybe it's not a good idea to allow someone to just you know in one transaction drain everything um so I'm very happy to hear that uh okay now the basics are covered I want to go into some uh slightly more juicy topics so um the first one I want to talk about is Mev specifically so I you know last time I had Josh uh from Austria on and you know they're they're doing shared sequencing and a big big theme there is like cross stream Mev and so uh I feel like a lot of that's Arbitrage between different liquidity pools potentially I mean there's lots of different forms of it but uh it sounds like Catalyst would be something where Mev crosstain mov is going to be a very big part so how do you guys think about that yeah I will preface and say that cross chain or sometimes called cross domain Mev is definitely like a emergent research topic and so we spent a lot of time working with a lot of members of just the broader Mev broader crypto Community just thinking about what does it mean to you know simulate measure cross domain Mev and eventually with the hopes of you know mitigating it or harnessing it or what have you right like some sense of like control over the Mev generation slash leakage within within a system right so so that's kind of like the the preface that we're kind of all figuring it out together um yeah with that said um uh you know I think any kind of um like D5 protocol especially if you're thinking about like swaps uh needs to think about Mev uh and kind of the Mev that's being generated in the system and I think historically what we've seen is um you know the way that amms are are constructed uh is that there's a lot of kind of Mev being created in the form of like toxic order flow or or Arbitrage um and that's being kind of leaked out and retained by external parties right whether it be Searchers or what have you um and now I think there's a lot of conversation around okay like that is kind of value that's being extracted from other parties and who's kind of taking the short end of the stick there and that's you know LPS right um and so our perspective and I think there are you know a few other you know next-gen projects so to speak thinking about this is okay how do we actually capture the value of this Mev that's being generated and then leaked out to external parties and have it retained within the system right and so you know proto-rev uh with with the Skip and osmosis team is something that comes in mind so we're definitely of the camp of kind of that Narrative of harnessing Mev that's being generated in the system and and kind of redistributing that back into the people that we think are are taking on that price Discovery risk right which is which is LPS in this case but it doesn't necessarily need to be the case I think we are as it evolves we have the flexibility to also give it to users right that are kind of um getting you know taken advantage of and having Mev taken from them or we can give it to the you know the the protocol broadly and so we're we're kind of on the camp of like um you know I think the word that's being utilized like Sovereign based on kind of the mechanism design that we deploy yeah I think I mean it's been kind of a uh a problem that's emerged for MMS generally that LPS Get Wrecked uh and so uh but they're so vital to the system so what is their incentive to participate and I think really the solution is that you have to somehow redirect um some of the Mev to to subsidize uh them and incentivize them um so that that's really cool and I'm excited to see where things go there and also of course a big fan of skip and uh I also uh kind of reminds me of another project duality that's also working on like new new forms of amms that that try to internalize Mev and distribute it in different ways it's a very interesting like uh research uh area so that's cool um what do you what is your thought on like cross chain ux because obviously uh I think that's it's going to be a big part of what you guys build is like making it seamless for users you know I I want to see a future where I don't are people using App chains or whatever all these modular blockchains don't even know that they're separate chains really um and and it just feels like one kind of unified ecosystem of apps um and I think catalyst is going to be a big part of that so how do you guys think of how do you think of that yeah so ux is definitely something that we we think a lot about um you know I think I think there's enough design space alone in just like the the the the user flow of just bridging an asset or swapping a token that we are really excited to kind of push the boundaries on uh but then you kind of add in the cross chain element and there's just a lot for us to do in kind of the ux department right um you know we're kind of bridging between different environments that might have different wallets that might have different kind of token specifications different data indexing and so um we spent a lot of time thinking about like how do we actually not only like abstract that from the user but also build kind of scalable or extensible kind of architecture underneath the hood in order to allow us to expand into new chain environments right this is kind of what I was alluding to in my presentation um so all that to be said like when I think about cross-chain ux like of course the first kind of the general theme that I'm trying to um kind of like Implement against is abstraction right it's like how do you have some form of an overlay such that you're kind of only exposing to users like what is necessary and kind of like you know obfuscating the rest um and right now like let's say we were to integrate like two chains that were like disparate right like ones like evm and other ones like a wasm chain um like that would be pretty hard I think to to um like it would be a pretty harsh user experience uh said differently for a user right like you know different tokens different wallets et cetera et cetera like a lot of different signing and token approvals what have you um the blanket answer I have is solving that is like abstracting that using kind of a lot of the emerging narratives that we're seeing right now which is around account abstraction which is around using multi-party computation as a form of you know odd programmatic transaction construction um but instead of doing that I think a lot of people are doing that within the context of like one chain and so once you add like different chains to it it becomes a lot more interesting but essentially using like those Primitives in addition to like some form of like a decentralized key management system in order to abstract that away into one sort of like unified wallet right and so we're not really in the wallet business right we don't necessarily see ourselves in that space But we're thinking a lot about partnering with wallets and working with Wallets on how to abstract away a lot of cross chain complexities and and pain honestly uh and by and exposing that to the user um and so that's kind of like our idea of it and maybe like the taebo on top of like kind of what I'm saying like essentially it's it's essentially like smoothing the edges of an existing cross chain experience but eventually kind of what we want to do is of course what you mentioned like take away the chain element in itself and you basically just have a an interface in which people Express intents of like you know wanting to be on a certain place or wanting to do a certain action or wanting a certain asset and then we're able to actually do that and then you can actually take that you know it's fine but maybe maybe we'll pause there and I have a little bit to add after that no I mean you literally took the words out of my mouth I was literally about to say uh I mean the the sort of unification of this ux and also the Mev piece is like intent based uh sort of like transactions or I'm not really sure what the the latest like phrase for this is but the stuff that's being pioneered by anoma and also uh now now flashbots with Suave where users basically just say hey this is the end state that I want and then uh you know other people fulfill that and and they kind of like make the state changes that that make that happen and the the cool thing is that also solves uh you know it makes it so that Mev can be captured in more creative ways and people can bid kind of on that Mev that that could be captured through that that user's intent and so it's kind of like this unification of like it's all so many problems at once it's like another really beautiful uh sort of insight that I'm looking forward to seeing so I don't know that maybe that's where you were going to go with it yeah yeah definitely I mean uh I think it ties really nicely to kind of the Mev narrative as well um of like intense I I didn't even mean intense in that perspective I agree it's like intense in the formal definition of like users expressing their like end State and having like executors like bundled transactions in order to achieve it um and we very much see Catalyst playing like a very integral role in that because uh the way catalyst is constructed is you can essentially have um like a sense of cross chain atomicity um around like not only swapping acids cross chain but actually doing actions like post like arriving in the destination chain right so it's like buying an nft or performing like or voting on governance or doing XYZ right and so we very much see Catalyst as like that like uh like resource essentially for these executors in this like future Mev landscape that's developing a last thing on um ux across chain ux that's that's been a pain point in in um ecosystems like Cosmos where there's lots of bridging happening um is this issue of of the proliferation of different asset representations so you know depending on how a chain how a acid is bridged or by whom to a new chain like it's it's they're not fungible they're like actually something different and then it's like oh well now I can't like make a liquidity pool or just like then it becomes confusing uh and so I think that's a really big problem I I'm wondering you know what is catalyst uh doing do you guys think about that problem is there a way to solve it from your perspective yeah we think about it a lot um I think our perspective is that like that was kind of like the the the the notion of like wrapping an asset and issuing some form of like synthetic uh representation of it was like a like a V1 or like a generation one solution to to cross chain and we're kind of proposing like a a augmentation to that and so when you look at like a a wrapped representation whether it be you know an ICS 20 kind of token that's floating around different chains in the cosmos space or if you're looking at more of like a like an actually Bridge asset right like uh like an axle like an axle asset right with axlr or a x asset with like Wormhole um they all kind of like run into the same problems that you're alluding to right they're different assets and and that's a major pain point that we see in the space of people are saying like Oh I thought I was getting usdc on this chain and I did get usdc but it's kind of like someone's IOU of a usdc now I don't know how to swap out of it um and so our solution and you kind of maybe saw this when I was explaining how Catalyst works is it's just native assets right like we're not like V1 one Bridges was like okay we're gonna store assets on this one place and then mint more apps like like minute IOU on another place we're just saying no let's just leverage the native assets that live on each chain or to do the swaps and if you need the case in which you have to have Capital injection into a new bridge right because that's kind of like what token Bridges have originally been solving it's like how do we inject more Capital into kind of like a new environment um you have something more like a cctp right we have like a burn and then some form of like an off-chain attestation for a mint and I think like when you look at other native Bridges like the dye Bridge that's being developed um that's very much along the lines of where the world's moving towards and then we look at like noble like that's something that they're doing as well with like you know their form of of asset issuance and so we're we're working very closely within that kind of uh with those people mentioned but also kind of within that through line of like okay how do we emerge out of this world and create that new bridging experience that kind of mitigates the problem that you just described very cool yeah so the solution is that you know rather than having to even move assets uh just use keep the assets where they're natively issued and enable people to sort of like move the value across the chain and redeem for for other native assets um that's super cool um yeah the last question that's okay maybe like oh sorry maybe like in in an addition on top of that is like maybe there's some economic value that could be um like a lot of bridging uh is is to do an intent right to kind of tie it back to our previous uh like conversation topic so if you have some form of bundling have some form of atomicity around what those intents are to do on a specific chain you can kind of just eliminate the need for bridging in general and so we're also like approaching it from that angle can you give an example of what what that would mean or look like yeah sure and so let's take an example of like I want to go to a new chain and take advantage of some yield farm right the agent baby um of course yeah let's it's a standard standard uh we gotta speak everyone's language um so I have you know like one eth and but that I wanted to pause into this pool right um but I knowing that like this is such an arduous process and there are kind of a lot of fees that can be taken along the way and there might be some other pools I want to take advantage of I actually don't just Bridge one e into this new environment I Bridge five eth right I'm you know rolling yeah in this use case yeah um and and so now I just have four eth or you know like four rap either what have you that's just sitting in this new environment but I'm only using one and so now I have this like weird inventory problem where like I'm anticipating more Farms but they're not there yet but I have money on a place that is higher risk than I would feel comfortable with whereas with Catalyst I can execute a different intent where I'm saying hey I just want to deposit on this farm and take advantage of it like I will swap one eats worth of value and acquire one eats worth of value on the destination chain right so it's like essentially like you're you're taking like before like when you bridge your intent may be it may have like a maybe predicting future intents but we're essentially saying hey you don't need to do that projection anymore because like of the mech design we employ in the economics we deploy you can just do your original intent and you know if you have future intents you can just execute them on an as needed basis wow super cool thank you for that um last question on the technical side is it related to Celestia and the notion of you know sharing a data availability layer between these different chains um what in your view what's the significance of that and how does it help with all this cross-chain bridging yeah I've ridden a good amount about bridges uh at this point um but I think one of the things that I keep coming back to is um around what are the trust assumptions that need to you know be inherited when you move across different um when you move across different uh different zones of sovereignty I guess is the word that people people like to use or different domains right and so different trust assumptions also means different thresholds of finality or different kind of definitions of of soft confirmation right and so if you're moving across data availability layers you basically have a lot of trust assumptions right and basically what that translates to is a pretty high bar for finality because you don't want to pass a message that isn't going to be included into the canonical chain right in fact like that would be detrimental for the destination chain because now they're basically just lost money um and so and so we have a high high definition for finality which also means you have a lot of latency right and so that's the reason why when people are if anyone tries to swap out a polygon why you have to wait 20 minutes is because you know polygon is known for their you know 150 200 block deep reorg right so you have to be absolutely certain and that's 20 minutes and you can imagine that 20 minutes is I don't know I rarely find anyone in this space that thinks 20 minutes is an okay user experience to wait for a cross train swap um and so when you have a shared data availability layer um you kind of mitigate a lot of those right you have less trust assumptions which means you have a lower bar for soft confirmation so if you have the da proof you're basically in here you're basically only operating the latency of the Celestia block time right and so that is a much better user experience and hence why we like to work with you know Roll-Ups building with Celestia why we like to work you know are working with the roll kit team in order to enable Catalyst to facilitate swaps and have that kind of really streamlined user experience because of kind of that that mechanism that I just described yeah the way that I uh like to visualize it uh is that the the Celestia of long time is sort of like the heartbeat of the whole like ecosystem of Roll-Ups on top because that's that's kind of when they synchronize you know that's when each like the the new sort of Estates and the transactions for those Roll-Ups get all kind of like uh finalized essentially and so that becomes sort of the heartbeat of like the the cross chain uh uh I guess like interactions between those roll ups too and and sharing that common heartbeat and that common like security uh uh the data availability layer is like really really powerful for interoperability um so yeah I could not could not agree more speaking my language um and that's a big part of like why the modular stack is so uh transformative um yeah definitely if I could just add one last thing there I think maybe like a few weeks ago there was some conversation around how do you build like trust minimized Bridges across different like zones of sovereignty and I'm of the camp that that is not possible like you're always inheriting my understanding is maybe you know maybe that might change right strong strong opinions weekly held but that you will always be beholden to the honest majority Assumption of the origin chain um and that's just the net of you know going across like if you're not sharing anything you have to have those trust assumptions and you have to have that kind of finality delay which is where I think the next I mean I can't share too much but I think that's where Catalyst can play a key piece as well if you have to do that yeah amazing uh well yeah it's such a it's a really interesting problem space and I've been thinking about that a lot lately but I haven't I haven't really I have some thoughts I haven't been able to like formalize them yet but I want to write like a forum post or or a thread at some point about this this problem of like true trust minimized bridging um but that's transitions really well into my next question um which is you know kind of uh moving on from the technical piece what uh and more into like the vision of of catalyst long term and specifically uh I wanted to say because you mentioned the beginning you know bridging is just sort of the first step but you're you're like long-term vision for catalysts is much deeper and broader than that it's about like you know building for this world of millions of chains um so what do you think is the next most important problem to solve uh in the cross change stack once you've sort of built out this you know liquidity thing uh and maybe it's maybe it's this governance part or that you talked about um you know the coordination between these zones of sovereignty or I don't know just tell me what what is like the next big thing on your guys mind after this first uh solving this first problem yeah I will say solving this first problem is already like a multi-year uh Endeavor um because you know we we're kind of starting from what we think is the most foundational which is we want to have chains connect to each other automatically and we want to be able to facilitate like economic activity between these chains permissionlessly right but there's a bunch of different augmentations that we want over time for that right we want to make this system more Capital efficient I think it behooves the entire crypto space to be more Capital efficient um you know there's it's not number go up forever we have to find a way to ensure security and liquidity is is being wisely used there needs to be kind of more improvements on the kind of like ux side the more improvements on um sorry ux as it pertains to like latency and finality between different chains and so there's there's a number of things to do right I look at my road map every day I'm like wow like got a long journey but it's all about just like the the drum beat you know I've kind of learned that in my time and product um but afterwards like we are like I said interoperability lovers first and foremost and so once we lay the foundation of unified Capital efficient permissionless slash automatic liquidity for a world of millions of chains then we can start building more building blocks on top of that right like then we can start building things around um you know I don't even want to give examples so to speak but that's kind of the foundation but then you know thinking about like what does I always like to use the analogy of like World Trade right it's like what does World Trade look like with like free-flowing like movement of of value between different like Nations and that's things like um you know uh that's things like uh like access to liquidity up front against collateral right like trade like or like trade agreements said differently uh or it's like this like the the the promise of some you know like commodity for another commodity or for another value right and so that's that's that those are like the foundational pieces that I kind of Envision and I can I think that analogy kind of helps uh a lot as we look at like Roll-Ups and chains yeah I love I love the analogy of World Trade uh and in general there's a lot of analogies you can draw between like like Sovereign blockchains and then like you know sovereign states and and the there's the a lot of things translate over and there's a lot of like metaphors that that uh sort of carry carry over I really like that uh it's exciting just think about the future of blockchains uh with the framing of World Trade um cool uh so I'm curious then uh just one other question uh it is like where do you see the modular stack itself five years from now um what will change what is what does the user experience what is the developer experience what's where do you see this space going oh man I can give a very long answer um yeah like I could literally go down every piece of the stock and say how I think it's it's gonna unfold um but I'll try to keep it like to like maybe three three hot takes okay so to speak um I think on the execution layer like it's going to be um like almost like I think when you look at an execution layer there's a lot of debate on what an execution layer is uh but I think everyone agrees that it's at very least a virtual machine and you can probably argue maybe block space as well and so that becomes like very commoditized and not commoditized but like it becomes very distracted right and so you're kind of interacting with it not too different to how you interact with uh you know AWS compute instance right um and so that's kind of how I see that unfolding and you see a lot of these like rasp projects are kind of going towards that right it's like okay you're pricing this like Saga like prices it based on like some form of some notion of like usage right so that kind of mirrors the the kind of AWS Docker kind of uh business model uh and then you can customize a lot of things with it right it's like uh and it becomes quite trivial to kind of change those different parameters it literally just looks like a config and yeah sorry that's too long of an answer but like that's kind of how I see that unfolding uh it's like it becomes just like really trivial and customizable and very easy not too much pot take but that's how I see it um I think um for the other parts of yeah maybe I take number two uh for the other parts of the stack um I I kind of alluded to this but there will come a time in which maybe we don't hit like a asymptote so to speak of like the money in the system in crypto but it gets very slow right the increase of it and in that sense it needs to become less Zero Sum in which we're leveraging uh this money for things that we need to do which is I think right now like security right in the form of POS um and also liquidity and so that's why I think a lot of people are very excited about restaking very excited about uh lsds because they provide some notion of capital efficiency in order to allow us to use this kind of finite amount of money in the pool to do things that we need to do right and so when you look at like security uh you know right every kind of primitive within the stack needs some notion of security that needs to be reused somehow and I think you can find really interesting coordination that occurs once you see like you know who's you reusing whose which layers we're using which layers security or which layer is liquidity uh for for security right and so that's kind of uh how we see that unfolding we got to get a lot more efficient in that perspective um my last take is that I think we're going to see maybe like one more stack emerge honestly um I don't know exactly how that's going to slice uh but if I had to say I would say that um like where baby decoupling I mean it depends on how you feel about settlement layer but you're maybe decoupling settlement into two different pieces one is like the the validation of a transaction from like an execution layer and the other one would be the validation of an outside layer like an outside execution layer interacting with a native one so said differently it's like basically like a bridge verifier right I think like a bridge verifying and verifying of a x like a roll up execution layer on top of a settlement layer looks very different and I feel like that needs probably needs to be split apart um yeah that's those are kind of my unorganized thoughts I love it on the future I love it yeah I mean this is my favorite thing to talk about uh as you can probably tell um well Jim it's been awesome to to learn about Catalyst to have you on where like where what's your like upcoming road map what can people expect uh from you guys in the coming months or the next year um like where where are the big Milestones you guys are working towards yeah so um let's let's go in chronological order so white paper nice eagerly uh in the next few minutes awaiting that yeah maybe then I can come back on and actually ask questions instead of deflecting um test Nets in the summer uh so get excited for that um we're gonna we're a cosmos project we're proud to be a cosmos project so we'll be launching on Cosmos end of this year uh and then we'll we'll come home to ethereum uh next year nice cool um well a lot of a lot of stuff in the future for you guys and so maybe at some point uh we can have you guys back on for for an update um where can people you know learn more about what you guys are building and follow you guys progress yeah I would say if I had to give a pithy answer just follow us on Twitter it's Catalyst amm on Twitter you can also you know check out our documentation you can go to our website you can sign up for our wait list for our testnet um but all all roads lead back to our Twitter so just just follow us there yeah and I I think people should also follow you um I love your insights and you've been writing a lot of great blog posts and stuff on on the subject um well Jim thank you so much for coming on um this was really really an interesting conversation um bridging is one of the most important problems I think that we need to solve in the modular stack so I'm I'm stoked that uh team as talented as yours is working on this and um you guys are really taking a new uh you know Direction uh and approach to solving this problem so um it's just very exciting all around thank you so much yeah thanks for having me I think more and more as as the modular kind of blockchain thesis that kind of pervades uh throughout the system um is that a word throughout the system uh bridging becomes super important right I I had this like Revelation a couple weeks ago I'm like wow like bridging is incredibly like more important than I thought because you need to coordinate all the layers and you need to coordinate different layers with shared layers and it gets quite complicated so I'm even more excited than I was a month ago about building and bridging which is I didn't even know that was possible as am I as am I well uh thanks again for coming on Jim and uh we'll be following you guys closely yeah thanks for having me
