hello hello good to see everyone welcome to modular Summit 2023 about a year ago at modular Summit 2022 we hosted an event in Amsterdam where we tried to tackle a problem that has plagued Us in the blockchain space for over a decade which is this problem that monolithic blockchains don't scale and we've end up in a We've Ended up in a constant endless cycle of new monolithic a1s every single cycle that fizzle out and don't live up to their promises so to recap I'm going to explain what module blockchains are and what their benefits are they're not going to talk into you a little bit about the progress of the of the modular stack today some open problems on what the destination is that we should all be aiming for so you know when the Bitcoin white paper came out in 2008 it introduced a model of blockchains that kind of stuck around for the next decade which is this monolithic model of blockchains this monolithic era this model where a blockchain couples consensus and execution a model where every user has to execute every transaction of every other user which we all know doesn't scale a model with that limits flexibility because you're enshrining specific execution environment and you can't experiment with different execution environments but in 2019 I propose lazy Ledger which is like a very simple blockchain that only does consensus and data availability and in that model um you have a very roll-up Centric model model where you have a data and consensus layer that is only responsible for consensus and then an execution layer which could be a roll up that posts its blocks to a data layer and inherits consensus and security from the from the date layer and this basically ended up in a module in a modular blockchain ecosystem where consensus and execution are no longer coupled so what are the layers in a modular stack let's let's quickly let's very briefly go through them to recap so the first layer is consensus that's the layer at the bottom and with consensus provides an ordering over arbit free messages so developers input messages or transactions into the system and the consensus layer simply decides what the order of those messages are and then once those messages have been ordered users need a way to verify that they've actually been published the network because what could happen a validator could execute a block or data withholding attack where they only publish the metadata of the block header but they didn't publish the actual data and in that model in that it was that attack um people no one will know what the actual ordered messages are and then no one will know what the state of the chain is and be able to generate food groups or progress the chain and interestingly if you actually go back to the original Bitcoin white paper the solution the prepared solution to the double spend problem was this idea of a Time stamping server and I'll just read that here out here which is a timestamp server works by taking a hash of block of items to be time stamped widely publishing the hash such as in the newspaper or using that post the timestamp proves that the data existed at a certain time obviously in order to get to get into the hash and this is basically describing what the core property or what the core thing that a blockchain provides are which is all the data that is made available and timestamped and if you have this basic primitive which is a timestamping server which is basically a consensus and data layer then you can pretty much build anything on top of it using any kind of execution environment and because we if you understand that data availability consensus are basically the core primitive is a blockchain we figured out scalable ways to kind of scale that using a primitive called Data availability sampling with data availability sampling you have an over 99 guarantee that almost all the data is available by only downloading a very small portion of the data and with this primitive that basically means that we don't have to live in the world anymore where users have to download every other user's transaction and so now you can scale blockchains more directly and more and um in a more practical way and then finally or the law finally there's something after this but you have the execution layer and the execution layer sits above the data and consensus layers and what execution layer does is it you know takes a bunch it takes a bunch of transactions and it outputs a state so for example those transactions you know could be payments and the state is what what people's account balances and that's what a rollup does for example or layer 2 does it provides an execution environment to process transactions and to create a state commitment to what people's balances are and in the modular in a modular blockchain model the consensus and execution layers are decoupled as I mentioned and then finally you have the settlement layer and a settlement layer is basically just like a special case of an execution layer that is used to bridge other execution layers or Roll-Ups together so for example if you look if you look at ethereum as an execution layer you have on chain light light nodes for Roll-Ups on ethereum which act as Bridges for between rollup and ethereum you can Bridge assets between them and they can verify and the on-chain like client accepts block headers from the roll up and verifies vote proofs or ZK proofs so putting that putting that all together like what is a modular blockchain there's something wrong with the sides well what is a modular blockchain a modular blockchain is basically a blockchain that fully outsources at least one of the four components of a blockchain um but as I mentioned it consensus data availability settlement or execution okay there we go so what are the benefits of modularity the first one is obviously scalability so for several reasons I'll just goes like two two reasons here the first reason is that as I mentioned you know users don't have to execute the transaction of every other user because now roll ups because they have they have their own execution environment that means they have their own dedicated computation resources like if you spin up a roll up the roll up has its own computational resources so even if another robot gets busy or has a high computational requirements that's not going to affect every other roll up in the system and secondly thanks to data availability sampling and you have this Loop where the more light nodes you have the more block space you can have in a secure way because the more like clients you have that are sampling the bit the more data they can collectively reconstruct and the bigger the block size that you can have because in a system that does data availability sampling the light nodes are collectively storing and making the data making all the data available instead of just like one or a few nodes secondly you have the developers get the freedom of choice so you know like with ethereum um instead of being limited with the ethereum virtual machine for example over the past few years there's been a lot of new developments and advancements in more efficient and more more practical execution environments for different use cases whether that's for scale or for privacy you know there's execution environments that add certain ZK op codes and um it's not really practical to deploy a new layer one just to make a modification to an execution environment and so with with the modular blockchain stack you can now just modify evm a little bit you know either up code and just deploy a roll up for that instead of having to deploy a new um layer one from scratch and this is all this is also what um so various projects in our ecosystem have done as well and you also have different types of Roll-Ups that you can use according to your use case like solvent Roll-Ups settled robots Palladiums and celestiums and specifically with Sovereign Roll-Ups are an interesting case of robots that have kind of green traction over the past year that effectively give the community if that role up the freedom to Fork that roll up so you basically get the freedom of a layer one but without the overhead of a layer one without needing to create a new consensus Network or token necessarily from scratch so let's talk about what the modular stack looks like today and because we've made a lot of progress over the past you know 12 months this is what the modular stack looks like a year ago in 2022 um you know a year ago it was you know mostly theoretical you know there was various projects in the stack but it was still very underdeveloped ecosystem you know like ethereum was the only settlement layer you know very very few execution layers not a lot of infrastructure around it but we've made a lot of progress in the past year and this is what the modular modular ecosystem looks like today we have various new data availability consensus settlement and execution environments but more also interestingly we have a lot of new infrastructure that's surrounding that modular stack you know we have infrastructure like block explorers you know analytics providers and so on and so forth we also have a certain interest in sequencing providers shared sequencer provider shared sequencing and essentialized sequencing and that Roll-Ups can use that makes Roll-Ups more sensitive resistant or more have have better self-commitment finality and then you have various roll-up Frameworks which make it you know very easy for developers to deploy their own new role up without having to Define to to write their own roll up from scratch um you know Stacks like obstacles labs and sovereign you know those Stacks make it very easy for people to just you know write their application and they'll tell you roll up and then we also have roll up as a service providers um that use these roll-up Frameworks and provide a hosted service for people to deploy their rollups so instead of having to maintain your own structure just like you can go to AWS or digital ocean today you can deploy a virtual machine in the cloud in seconds in the future you'll be able to deploy a roll up in seconds you know with a hosted provider with whatever with with your code and the goal here the optimal goal here should from engineering perspective should be that deploying a roll up deploying your decentralized application as a roll up should be more easier and more convenient and more practical than deploying a new smart contract and that's what that's basically what we've seen in web 2. like in web 2 if you create a new web application or you deploy a new website you don't you don't use WordPress usually or you you don't use like a host provider you deploy a new virtual machine in the cloud you create you have your own virtual machine so in the because that gives you more flexibility more scale more and more choice you don't use it you don't use a shared hosting provider or a shared platform necessarily in many cases um you know like a WordPress or or a blogspot and then finally we have a various number of you cross-chain providers um Mev providing bridging across Roll-Ups across different Frameworks but the goal of this conference today is to get everyone to make connections and to talk and to discuss um the future of the modulus ecosystem and then so who knows what's in store for 2024 and what new layers in this or what new types of tooling and infrastructure that we might have not even thought about today might exist in 2024 you know like like a like a year ago people weren't really talking about shared sequencers now the older age a quick few highlights um over the past year in the past few months I mean a few months ago upstack was the first you know uh kind of ethereum focused roll-up framework to either modular data availability API and we can we actually contribute that data availability API and that made it possible to use to uh create to deploy op stack chains using Celestia as a DA layer and other layers as well and to me this is like really the meaning of modularism and not maximalism because this is like an example of different ecosystems working together and interoperating with each other in a beneficial way we also have Manta which is which is deploying opsack roll-up based on this interface and then calderas also wants a test net using this op stack interface and we have like a year ago about a year ago I we introduced the concept of sovereign roll-ups which are still controversial in certain communities but um the idea for sovereign you know you have it like Roll-Ups don't necessarily have to be a scaling mechanism for L1 they can also just be a new interesting and more efficient way to deploy a new blockchain or Sovereign chain like instead of deploying a cosmos chain you can just deploy a cosmos roll up and a year ago something Roll-Ups didn't exist like there was no implementation for southern rollup but now we have many projects actually building and working on certain develops um which is really cool to see you know we have Sovereign Labs building Sovereign SDK they recently launched an alpha release of sovereign SDK which is a toolkit that lets you deploy and create sovereignty cable apps and we have Eclipse which is a role as a service provider for southern rollups and we also have a roll kit which recently was able to deploy the first Sovereign roll-up on bitcoin which is really cool because you know Bitcoin has historically been one of the most maximum of those communities and this is really kind of like uh when when that was published that was kind of seen as a way to kind of foster across cross-chain collaboration we also had Dimension releasing the first IBC enabled roll up using the evm which is really cool to see as well um and they also have a test NET LIVE as well but there's many more highlights which I can't list all in this talk we have a very Celestia has a rapidly expanding ecosystem we also have here um various applications including gaming providers gaming chains after this talk I know that Scott is talking from August about the world's engine curio did an interesting demo recently where they run a real-time strategy game on a modified evm roll up on Celestia and there's many other as well many other interesting pieces of infrastructure and applications on the stack so we have made a lot of progress over the past year and we're reaching the inflection point but there's there's still like a lot of open problems that we need to solve to get to where we need to get where we need to go and to really make to really defeat maximilism and to have a you know positive sum mindset instead of a zero-sum mindset and this conference is um is meant to kind of like Foster these conversations and try to you know discuss these open problems and progress the stack it's one of the open problems is you know your user ux for bridging um there's a lot of work to improve your ex in bridging especially in the cosmos ecosystem that users need multiple feed tokens for example to bridge across chains I know there's various people also working on that like skip I think they recently did a demo recently um you can go ibc.fun it's like a it's a website that has a demo we also need to tooling for custody and payment systems for Roll-Ups and to access resources across the stack so for example you might have to roll up that uses that that needs to pay the da layer or settlement layer and there needs to be a way to kind of hold these different tokens or do exchange or do um kind of like token exchanges in a easy way for developers without them having to maintain too much like wallet infrastructure and you know pricing mechanisms and so on and so forth there's also a lot um it's kind of like a good problem anyway but there's a lot of choice for developers and that can be very hard for the developers to understand the trade-offs between those like different execution environments different element layers different da layers and so I think we need like do a better job at trying to kind of like educate developers or explain the trade-offs between different between different components in the stack we also have a lot of dependencies across the stack um you know like a DA layer has to connect to an execution environment and you know so on and so forth and there isn't really any common interfaces you know like for example op stack has a specific da interface um different their you know as a specific data interface um you know tender mint has this ABCI implementation interface that interacts with Cosmos and these dependencies can be very hard to maintain if there's a breaking change any of these dependencies so I think we should have some discussion around if there's a way to create some common interfaces or to have better dependency management across the stack so things are less likely to break when improvements are made better prepping systems or more work on proofing systems so like fault proving systems are still underdeveloped because you know like there there isn't a single permissionless deployment of a fraud pre-follup except for field V1 obviously and then ZK proving systems are still slow there's still a lot of kind of optimizations need to be made they need to be made faster I know there's a lot of work in Hardware acceleration and um fpgas to to to make ZK proving systems faster and also at privacy um like one of the reasons why the current blockchain does not have privacy is because you often need to enshrine it into the execution environment but now we have the opportunity to do that because instead of having to deploy a new layer one just to deploy a new execution environment people cannot people can now experiment with previously enabled execution environments I know that I know it's going to be talking about some of these topics um later today and tomorrow so like what is what what are we trying to achieve like what is the destination we're trying to get to so so what like let's discuss like some of the values of materialism and what we're trying to get achieve with the module blockchain is like so first of all users should be first-class citizens of the network this is like an ideal in crypto and web3 that seems to have been seems to have been forgotten over the past 10 years like the whole point of blockchains and the whole point of Bitcoin is that you don't have to trust middlemen you know like and that includes validators and miners you shouldn't have to trust middlemen or or centralized RPC endpoints and apis because that's just web 2 all over again if the main way that users are interacting with web 2 is just to centralized apis that's not like fundamentally different to web2 you're just interacting with a database so like one of the things I appreciate about Bitcoin is it has very good light node support like client support you can actually install like client on your phone and that connects directly to the to the Bitcoin Network and can get data out of the Bitcoin Network um and without using any centralized API endpoints so I think we kind of like need to go back to this ideal um and that's what that's why data availability sampling like clients are important to allow users to get back to the roots of web free and to really make allow users to not have to rely on centralized middlemen endpoints which could be which on which are prone to censorship and Corruption secondly um uh like modularism and the maximism is one of the obvious important ideals of modularism and this is pretty much what this whole conference is about and the reason why this is so important is because over the past decade we've been stuck in this endless cycle of new layer 1 chains every single Bull Run you know like you had ethereum in 2014 then in 2017 you had EOS you know Tron cardano and they promised the world and then um 2021 we had salon on Avalanche and then this time now we have Aptos and suey but this is this is not sustainable because this is just creating uh it was equating in the cycle of new tribes and new ecosystems that are not collaborating with each other you can't have it it's a very zero-sum mindset and that needs to be replaced with a positive sum mindset where incremental improvements kind of it can impact everyone that uses crypto and we can replace the zero-sum mindset with a positive sum mindset by adopting a modular ecosystem or modular stack where people can you know for example there's there if people make a more efficient execution environment like Aptos and so you have you can just deploy you can just replace that layer in the stack you can you can replace the execution environment in the stack without having to deploy a new layer one because it's simply not sustainable to have a constant graveyard of new layer ones that are sucking up a lot of funding but eventually like extract value then fail to get traction um like crypto is never going to mature with this with this cycle and it's really important that we escape this endless cycle as soon as possible to have a more positive sum crypto ecosystem that actually kind of develop develops into worldwide mainstream developer adoption and finally um one of the important aspects is of moduleism is that communities have the choice to be Sovereign if they want to they don't have to but like if they want to they can and sovereignty is basically the freedom to Fork because like one of the fundamental things that blocked crypto and blockchains allow that previous systems haven't allowed is the ability for a group of people to with a specific shared goal to kind of Thrive through self-organization and Collective action by effectively having a creating a contract with each other that for the first time does it does not need to be enforced by you know phys like um physical law or like you know police or courts but can be enforced cryptographically and in on the peer-to-peer Network um whereas previously you had to if you wanted to create a shared agreement we have to do so under like a specific jurisdiction but with blockchains you can kind of bypass all of that and have a direct top level social contract on the top level social contract gives people gives you the freedom to Fork if the community decides that they want to change the political rules so to recap the three values of blockchain modularism users should be first the user should be first class citizens of the network um by focusing on light nodes and allowing people to run light nodes secondly modularism and not maximalism because we need to escape the it's really important that we escape the layer one you know blockchain monolithic Loop otherwise crypto will never grow up and finally communities can choose to be Sovereign because they have the right to Fork if they want to so I really hope that you enjoy the conference and a lot of interesting conversations happen I'll be around and many of the Celestia team and other teams on the ecosystem will be around thank you [Applause]
