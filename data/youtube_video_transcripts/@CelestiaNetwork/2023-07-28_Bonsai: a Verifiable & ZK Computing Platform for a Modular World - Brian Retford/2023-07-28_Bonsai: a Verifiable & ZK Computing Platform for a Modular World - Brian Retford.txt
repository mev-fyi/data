okay yes so I'm going to be talking about uh Bonsai it's a verifiable and ZK I'm trying to use the new terminology here um platform for a modular world so Bonsai basically lets you prove massive computations um for all kinds of applications we're going to talk about a bunch of those in this talk um yeah we are also it's now actually available for testing and if you want to if you want to get access to it there's actually a link at the end and please feel free to apply and waking if you're out there yes we will we'll get you a key so I do want to mention briefly Bonsai is built on top of the risk zero ZK VM or vvm and I don't want to explain exactly what that is because I'm sort of assuming most people know what ZK VMS are General ideas it takes a program and produces a ZK proof um and in this case there's zero zkvm is a risk five chip sort of a virtual risk 5 chip which lets it run any kind of normal program and people built a whole bunch of interesting sort of hackathon applications on top of it and we've just recently added it's pretty amazing uh capability we call continuations this lets you split proofs into any number of chunks and prove them independently which lowers memory requirements and um yeah lets you roll things up in parallel and prove arbitrarily long computation so there's no longer any kind of cycle limit so one of the things I was trying to think before I made this talk you know what are the themes of the modular Summit and what's why things going on in blockchain right now and this thought that came to me is that an ecosystem of any kind can be as decentralized as it as it can be and so I think I started me and my friends started the first uh the first maker space in Seattle like 15 years ago and the amount of sort of tragedy of the commons that went on in in that situation and how difficult it was to manage I really see it as a lack of collaborative tooling and ways to assign values to things that are you know a lot more fluid than the current tools at the time uh supported so I feel like the more we can all do to you know build capabilities in this ecosystem and especially focus on ones that allow us to collaborate with each other uh I think the more decentralized we can be and the more we'll be able to benefit from uh the advantages of those things so these are things that I think the modular ecosystem benefits from sort of roughly interoperability capability the ability to you know do anything and run multiple execution layers diversity having lots of different projects different clients for the protocols that are out there Etc and then obviously customizability so Bonsai is a general purpose verifiable and ZK Computing platform uh which turns out is very useful to sort of enhance the capability of any system or protocol to do those kinds of things obviously ZK is a huge part of many of the interoperability projects that have come out recently on and you can see how critical ZK technology has been for allowing multiple chains to actually communicate with each other in a low friction and efficient manner obviously ZK has brought all kinds of capabilities to different ecosystems with all of these sort of ZK coprocessing that's going on and the kinds of things you could do with Bonsai uh you can build more clients with ZK and uh you can also build the fraud proving systems uh without doing any work which I think lets people have a lot more agility when it comes to getting you know systems that might be too complex for ZK currently out onto the market in a way that um yeah they can really serve their users so all all of the great things that you can do with ZK are obviously only useful if they're actually accessible to Developers so Bonsai is really focused on making the most advanced features in ZK and advanced cryptography available to all of the developers in the modular ecosystem across all blockchains and and also off chain so we sort of always known we were going to build um some kind of network uh and or platform as a service type offering but I think the thing that's really crystallized to me over the past 18 months of being in this space has been how important it is to actually you know build an ergonomic platform for developers especially when you're dealing with something um as difficult as ZK so bonsai's goal is to make it as easy as possible to do the most things that you can with CK so what that means for now Bonsai is going to be a lot of things over time initially uh this reversion that's available for testing now and will be uh sort of 10 status in the fall uh the sort of core of it is a high a high speed proving service that lets anyone submit proof requests for for instance running Linux programs on top of cartesi on top of risk five um so you can actually verifiably prove the execution of Linux using something like Bonsai now you can do this on your own computer it's just very slow uh so bonsai uh has a much like a very very optimized machine in front of the singular executor part and then uh can spread computations out to thousands of machines uh and with that very recently I think the prior fastest risk uh zero VM execution speed that we've seen was about 100 kilohertz we're now up to 2.5 megahertz so it's about 25 times faster um and we'll we really expect to see that number continue to go up over the the near term so it's really amazing how quickly you can prove some fairly out there things and we'll talk about that in a bit so we also have built out a proof relaying system this is effectively it was focused on ethereum chains for now but this is a full Foundry integration uh and template that lets you instead of smart contracts that let you easily interact with Bonsai from uh from your smart contract so along with that um in the past we're a stark based system we always have been this produces proofs that are too big to economically verify on ethereum so we've built this is brand new and I'm very excited about it a start to snark translator for our proving system so you can uh actually just post a single growth 16 proof for any risk zero computation in the future we'll also let people save money by aggregating a bunch of proofs and sort of posting that for people and then we'll still integrate completely with the sort of relaying infrastructure um yeah that will be coming up soon we'll eventually probably make some kind of proof Market uh we already have a bunch of like client and eth proving stuff uh in the pipeline yeah so there's gonna be a lot more okay these are not just they're not really case studies it's uh some of our partners and uh and some of the I guess example applications and spaces we've started exploring on the application side the first one I talked about this Sydney Denver a little bit was a central limit order book that utilized Bonsai to run uh all of the matching logic off chain So currently the version of this that will eventually release after we clean it up more um basically works by having people place their vote they're sorry their orders on chain and then the smart contract does literally nothing with those except call out to Bonsai where Bonsai ingests whatever orders have been placed uh whatever orders are open uh computes whatever matches exist and then sends back effectively a set of settled orders or orders that are no longer valid Etc and so by doing that we actually found that you know using this pattern it's about 100 times cheaper than sort of a pure evm club would be and actually cheaper than uniswap V3 bio two to three times so uh of course you know people always ask why on Earth would you build an order book in ZK it's going to be too slow obviously you know latency is a factor and is kind of slow but this is runs you know pretty quickly and you're also I'll talk about um one of our partners that's doing some Innovative work uh to to combine ZK with some other techniques to resolve that foreign so this is uh this is now available at uh on our get Hub page under examples uh slash voting I think or Governor um we just posted this uh this is a full app built on top of this Foundry template I mentioned that integrates with existing Dow voting Frameworks so it's kind of a it's an example of how you can use Bonsai to effectively replace gas intensive components of any application and I was I mean I was when people wanted to do this I was kind of skeptical that it was going to be worth a time it's actually 3x cheaper than than the original application and I was really surprised yeah to see that if you then take this kind of concept and start integrating something like Celestia to store your votes you start to like reach the capability to do a bunch of things on chain that were difficult before especially when you couple you know okay with uh with the account abstraction coming online I mean there's hopefully people have seen some of the amazing demos people have built with this um I really think there's going to be a lot more capability to build applications that actually use blockchains and people use them so I'm really excited about the ability to have more information from people in a sort of ZK and pseudonymous manner uh coupled with identity feeds from sismo or anything like that um yeah so a nice thing about this we were able to effectively build something that would interoperate with existing uis and applications uh in about three weeks with one person so this kind of demonstrates the efficiency gains of being able to use general purpose language for your ZK development and this is this is a recent one that we've been very heavily working on as part of our our proposal to optimism to help them with ZK which I'll talk about in a second and where we've gotten to now is that you can run an entire ethereum block there's still like this is missing some optimization for pre-compiles this is using an existing evm I think we support revm and Sputnik and we'll support the rest at some point as well um and yeah so you can actually run an evm that's been fully audited and as in use in many other places directly on top of risero now uh it takes quite a while like the two to four billion cycles yeah takes about 15 minutes uh on Bonsai but that's going to go down uh pretty rapidly I think so yeah we're going to be in a place where we're looking at you know 20 cents maybe to ZK approve eth blocks uh for um yeah for full full-size youth blocks without needing to even think about writing an evm or about compatibility with um other smart contracts hmm yeah and we expect people to start integrating this into various uh rollap Frameworks nobody's doing that quite yet though and I'm excited about it okay so we do want to talk about some Integrations that we've been working on uh and this is sort of a general category here and I was on a panel Monday I think and people one of the questions was uh okay it's you know 10 years from now or five years from now and ZK has lost to optimistic approaches why what happened and I think I don't think it's a it's an either or kind of question at all I think optimistic approach is coupled with ZK approaches um can produce a lot of value for the user in terms of supporting livelier applications um and then obviously throwing Z hand top of that supports a fairly quick liquidity in and out of whatever sort of applications you're using um so yeah so layered and the team over there actually built sort of example of a actually they're pretty far along of a fraud prover uh for their uh order book and they basically didn't have to do any work you just run the matching engine yourself on data and produce a proof that you know the results that got posted on chain aren't the actual results so this lets you run your order book or any kind of application sort of at the frequency that you desire and then gives an opportunity to kind of use ZK to to tie it all up and give give everyone confidence that everything's in the right shape moving forward and yeah and indeed this is a lot of what optimistum wants to do with the sort of ZK support for optimism very excited that uh us along with uh the awesome team over at omlabs were both selected to work on this so very very excited about that um one of our partners uh from sort of the earliest days of of our company and theirs has been The Sovereign team they're building The Sovereign SDK which is a roll app framework that's highly aligned with the modular ecosystem I really love what they're doing they basically made a very sensible way to program blockchain applications pure rust has tons of flexibility and then they kind of take care of all of the difficulty of figuring out which parts of the modular stacked to use where and um yeah and which ones so risero is going to be one of their first adapters that actually supports doing ZK computations for Sovereign apps very excited about that and yeah what is what I want to say uh also one of uh uh our great uh sort of Partners and people we collaborate a lot with it's the team over at Eclipse they're building a roll-up framework as well uh the work we did with them uh so far has been limited to a pretty amazing project which is turning um yeah effectively doing zk's Lana executions by turning uh risk zero into an ebbf um prover so we got pretty far with that I'm really looking forward to you know starting to give people the ability to migrate code from Solana to whoever they want it to run or doing Roll-Ups on Solana even though you know in theory you don't need them so one of the most recent uh sort of hackathon winners I think this was yeah this was at eth Waterloo um built really amazing and fairly once they it's not simple I mean they did it in a hackathon and it's effectively a demonstration of using some new authentication standards along with ZK to let you immediately sort of make a wallet that's based on a biometric identifier okay yeah thanks drive two minutes um yeah so this lets you make wallets without worrying about seed phrases or anything like that and you can see this is a sort of amazing entree into making crypto accessible for a lot more people and that's um yeah that's pretty much all I have there's a bunch of links here if people want to get to know more about Bonsai what we're doing and if you want access to the Bonsai API you can go ahead and apply at that link up there thank you [Applause]
