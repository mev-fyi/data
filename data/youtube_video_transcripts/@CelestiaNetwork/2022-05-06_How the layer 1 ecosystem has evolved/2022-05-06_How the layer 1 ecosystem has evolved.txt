[Music] there was a period back in 2017 2018 when there was a lot of new layer one projects that kind of raised big realms and you know like avalanche lana near vertical and so on and so forth and a lot of them are kind of based around like a similar premise which is like ethereum but more scalable or like you know a more scalable share smart contract platform and in the sense that you have like a you know you have a synchronous execution environment where all transactions kind of run within this you know world computer model that you know ethereum has kind of proposed in 2014. like where is this there's this world internet computer where all transactions are processed and but now we've kind of seen the results of that play out like we can see you know 2022 that does not really work um like you just cannot have a single synchronous world computer uh chained like as a shared smart contract platform like you know you've seen uh you know issues with avalanche and solana and bangladesh chain all had struggling to keep equipped with demand even though you know they claim to be more scalable than ethereum so i think the biggest shift we're seeing now is this idea of a multi-chain world and like it's no longer a world cup it's no longer a paradigm with a single blockchain that can synchronously process all transactions and now people are realizing that actually you have to have a multi-chain world and that's like similar to the it's effectively the cosmos vision that was kind of introduced a few years ago and ethereum is also taking this approach because roll-ups themselves enable are basically a implementation of a multi-chain world because rollouts themselves are chains so effectively ethereum's heading heading towards this direction as well where old execution happens on roll-up chains that connect to you know the main chain is kind of hub so i would say that's kind of the biggest shift like this shift between a single world computer model to a like a mini computer model where you have multi-training world like where the chains communicate with each other but obviously like you know there is no perfect solution um like all scalability solutions have trade-offs um and like the biggest trade-off of this like multi-trading ecosystem paradigm where everything is a roll-up and all the execution happens you know of chain and is this kind of issue of composability um like the great thing about this wealth computer model where you know just just run all your transactions on solana is that you have you know synchronous uh compulsibility and yeah you can just write a smart contract that calls any other smart contract so but with this multi-chain model even though it's theoretically more scalable the the main drawback of it is that it makes composability more complicated not impossible or not too difficult but more complicated and more cooling is required like for example like we haven't like ibc was only launched somewhat recently um and only people are realizing that uh so let's say they don't know ibc is cosmos is entertained vertical and we're only kind of starting to see that and flesh out and see the potential of that
