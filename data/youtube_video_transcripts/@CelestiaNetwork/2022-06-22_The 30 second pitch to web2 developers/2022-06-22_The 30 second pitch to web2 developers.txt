let's suppose each of you uh were kind of stuck in an elevator for 30 seconds you had a 30 second pitch and there was an engineer who just quit netflix because well i mean stock price crashed and uh they're like i wanna i wanna like understand like why i should build something um either on salano or celestia what's your 30 second pitch um and mustafa me okay so this netflix this former netflix engineer is presumably a web 2 engineer so i would use a web 2 analogy if you're a web 2 engineer and you wanted to build a web application um you wouldn't want to build it on a shared hosting provider like let's say if you're familiar with dreamhost or geocities or google pages if you use a shared web hosting provider you're restricted in what you can deploy because you're stuck with the same execution environment that's provided to you by that shared execution provider and also because you're set you're sharing the same server as everyone else you're also limited uh scalability that is what that is very similar to deploying your application on a shared smart contract platform which that is that is a monolithic blockchain nowadays web 2 developers build use virtual machines on on on systems like amazon ec2 or aws and that allows those developers to have full have their own virtual server and have full control over the execution environment and scalability of the application and that is what building a rollup is like you effectively have your own blockchain that you can do whatever you like on it and have any execution environment you want on it and you can scale better because you're not sharing the same execution resource pricing as everyone else
