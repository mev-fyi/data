hello hello hello everyone happy saturday this is overpriced jpegs podcast about nfts and the metaverse and what's going on in this space i am carly riley and we are going to kick off our weekends right with some information and some recaps of what has happened in the world of nfts and the metaverse over the past week i want to get right into things so we're going to do a stats update today projects are up is the upshot of the stats update that's exciting for folks uh apes were up big especially last weekend they had a crazy weekend we'll talk about why i want to highlight a project called blitmaps which did pretty well this week talk about what's going on there we're going to dive into some of the mainstream coverage of nfts in the metaverse from this past week i think it's fun to see what people outside of our bubble are saying about our world and we can talk about whether or not i think they're doing a good job or a bad job there were also some controversies i would say i would i guess you could call it that in in our nft metaverse world this week we're going to dive into those a bit and then we'll just get into some of the general news about the metaverse so stay tuned first a word from our sponsors everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axiom infinity decentraland eluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse xerion is the perfect place to view the entirety of your crypto portfolio all in one spot not only does xerion aggregate all the

wallets into the xerion interface and supercharge your defy experience and enrich your nft lifestyle that's z-e-r-i-o-n bankless okay a stats update you all know i pull from zenika 33's spreadsheets zenica 33 great influencer i mentioned him literally all the time he was my guest on the show this week he does a google spreadsheet every day that looks at what's been going on with nft projects and tracking their floor i don't think we should be obsessed with floor i'm a long-term holder type of gal but it is instructive to sort of track how things are moving along week by week since we do this show weekly so i am relying on that here for this information okay uh projects are up this is exciting uh are we out of the bear market i don't know i wouldn't be too confident about it yet but things are starting to surge again in particular board apes and mutant apes had a really big week weekend uh i want to talk about this and really talk people through why they had this big surge um so last sunday i was on the phone with somebody professionally and he was like oh my god apes are surging like what is going on here so uh let's let's look at this timeline with some precision um last thursday the universal universal music group umg big music group announced that they were launching a band of board apes essentially and those apes are from jim mcnellis collection jimmy eth you might know him on twitter jimmy with a one uh so that was interesting that's again you have sort of mainstream talent agents equivalent essentially saying that they see value in board apes and that they're going to create like this metaverse band right this digital band okay that's thursday of last week pretty big news friday the following day jimmy fallon has people on uh the tonight show whatever his show is the late show jimmy fallon has people on where they of course talk about nfts and jimmy fallon admits that he's bought some nfts people's like oh what nfts have you bought jimmy fallon says i own some apes he then tweets that night jimmy fallon tweets later that night permission to come aboard b-o-r-e-d right permission to come aboard as in i'm an ape holder the discord uh the board at discard starts like freaking out fairly understandably so jimmy fallon is a super mainstream figure with millions upon millions of followers and he has just flagged board 8 yacht club to all those millions of people i actually looked into whether or not the united music group that umg and jimmy fallon had some sort of business relationship i wouldn't be shocked if they did just given the timing of these announcements it felt like this could be like a coordinated one-two hit umg announces they're doing this metaverse band jimmy fallon that starts talking about apes the timing there was interesting i couldn't find anything though i didn't spend all that much time to be honest looking for the connection um okay then you have on saturday so this was all friday people jimmy tweets saturday jimmy tweets again and now he says that oh you know what i'm actually looking at mutants as well not only have i bought a board ape but i'm also looking into buying a mutant ape or into multiple mutant apes so for the last couple days the the board a discord has been going crazy and specifically they have been chanting and by chanting i mean posting in all caps on the discord war on the mutant floor as in people were started pumping mutant apes as all this good news was coming out about board apes so now you have jimmy fallon on saturday tweeting about mutinates this sends it into overdrive i mean i went back i spent like two hours scrolling back through the board 8 chat just to see what was happening in real time over this weekend people were really going crazy if you've never been a part of a discord chat while a floor price is pumping it's a it's a unique experience it's also an experience in which bad decisions can be made because you can get very swept up in the enthusiasm of everybody in the chat being like mutant floors going to 100 you know like it could be a little dangerous as a buyer it's like going grocery shopping when you're hungry uh so jimmy tweets on jimmy fallon tweets on saturday okay he's buying new apes things are going crazy and then oh sunday i apologize sunday he tweets he's looking at mutant names also on sunday timbaland the rapper posts on twitter announcing that he's going to have a twitter he's hosting a twitter spaces with oh shiny who's an influencer in the nft space and the the name of the twitter spaces is timbaland launches virtual music group with essentially x you know collaboration with board api club so this is now the second music group that has been announced in a three-day period that's going to be comprised of board apes and of course this then this is like the cherry on top of this crazy weekend of all these announcement about board apes and mutant apes etc ironically on monday the following day of all of this board ape itself the yuga labs announces that there's this game that they're going to be releasing that can only be played by board apes and mutant apes but that feels like almost secondary news to all of this other stuff that's been going on um also timbaland i guess in this in this twitter space is says that the first single from this ford ape band will be coming out this coming week so stay tuned for the first board ape band single uh that the band itself apparently is called the zoo truthfully i'm not exactly sure how i feel about the future success of these board ape bands the concept like i think i'm just like not d gen enough the concept is a little strange to me people are really excited about it they're like you know what happens when timbaland's bored ape band wins a grammy and there was a good answer that was just like checkmate culturally right like we just win the culture war at that point as nft holders if a board ape band wins a grammy that's certainly true i'm still very skeptical that a bored 8th band will win a grammy but again might just not be degen enough about it i think i want to talk about though what i see is the bigger picture here and what's what's really important about this whether or not you believe in in the bands themselves um i think that there are we don't always like to admit this as a space but there are a limited number of pathways for an nft project to have long-term success and to really go the distance in terms of still being here in 10 years and growing and thriving and it's not there's not infinity paths to that one of the biggest and most compelling paths for long-term success is building a mega brand building intellectual property that has a tremendous moat around it because of how recognizable and iconic it is right supreme in the street where a world is just such a brand um and board apes day by day seems to be squeaking out ahead of every other nft project in terms of commandeering that kind of potential brand space and and so when you have friends who are like super fudders or you know people who are like this is such what the heck is going on with nfts this is so weird i think obviously in a big sense i think they're very wrong but they're also not wrong there is a lot of in this space and i think board ape yacht club board apes are the project you can point to to really counter that narrative by saying look at the mainstream attention they're getting but the people who want to associate with this brand and make it a part of their identity from steph curry to jimmy fallon now jimmy fallon right post malone got into it i think post malone may have been wearing a board ape sweatshirt again they're getting that streetwear merch you know crowd so take away this is awesome for the space it really shows what what nfts can be in terms of driving culture and i'm excited to see i'm excited to hear these singles and see what goes on uh i i just to give you the numbers here board eights started the week i think the floor was like 38 something 40 it surged to a floor of 60 at on the high end mutant apes started the started before all this happened with a floor of like four and they surged up to 10 at the high point now it's hovering around eight last time i checked the floor of the project um i will say as i was spending my many hours perusing the board ape discord chat there were some folks who were like oh my god i sold my mutant ape like two days before the surge happened at for like four eth or or whatever and really limiting the pain of that i know it might seem frivolous and obviously it's a luxury problem to say oh i had to sell my i sold my my mute nape for twenty thousand dollars but there is a really real pain that exists when you sell out on a project too early or you buy in at the peak and to anyone who's done who's doing that right now who just did that we've all been there it hurts you're lucky you'll have a win next time the fact that you're in this space and in a position to be selling and mute nape at all means that you're doing something right and stick with it don't feel too sad this is your sign that you're you're going to be all right and you're we are going to make it wagney baby uh okay the second project to talk about as part of our daily stats update is blitmap so i want to give people some context on blitmap folks might not know what it is it's stayed a little steady the past two days or so but earlier in this week it jumped like 50 percent from a floor of six to a floor of 8.8 eth i think now it's hovering around eight so blitmap is a like sci-fi story project i guess i'd characterize it that way founded by dom hoffman and a whole team dom hoffman for those who don't know founded vine videos if you all remember vine and has he also i'm going to try and phrase this properly i'm going to say this he founded the loot project which is something we'll we'll undoubtedly talk about in some future episode in greater detail because it it is a really interesting project in what in terms of the way it sort of flipped the usual nft model on its head for those who don't know the quick context is loot was a an nft project that you would mint directly from the smart contract dom hoffman kind of started the whole thing kicked the whole project off it was free to mint and it was just a series of words and attributes you know like ruby handled sword or whatever and it was sort of a wild phenomenon for a weekend it got up to i think like 15 plus 8th floor having been a project that was free to mint originally and the community kind of went crazy with it because they felt like wow i have these words and now i can create my own story arc my own artwork etc based on this list of words that you know i own so that was an interesting project that also came from tom hoffman but uh before all of that was well not before vine before loot was blitmap his project and i think what i want to highlight with blitmap because it did well this past week is it is one of these projects that belongs to the creative commons you'll see this listed as cco it's a cco project i think is how i would phrase that and basically what that means is the creators of it have opted out of copyright protection law and said this project is fully owned by the community by whoever wants to own it we will not enforce any copyright protections at all do what you want with this project um you've seen uh crete not creature crypto toads cryptos by grumplin also did this which says you know it's completely owned by all of you one of the big risks and one of the big reasons that teams don't tend to do this is you know you open up the possibility for nefarious use of your artwork you know fringe political ideologies hate groups anybody can come along and then use your work for their own purposes that may not align at all with what you stand for but this is a risk that this project for example blipmap has decided it's worth taking and they wrote a long blog post about it explaining their thinking as to why they wanted this to be a creative commons project and we'll talk a little bit about this for a minute because i think understanding how different projects approach the ownership question is really important if we want to get smart about this space over the long term so uh last week dom hoffman tweeted hey like here's the rough plan for the blipmap universe moving forward he said blitmaps equal power blitmaps were the very first generation of this project and they are essentially like these pixelated pictures smooshed together to create a new pixelated picture so he's saying split maps those original things are power in this universe a little vague but okay interesting blit knots which was then the second launch from this overall project blit knots are these sort of robot people looking things that have like tvs for heads and in the screens in these tv heads the blit map image is featured um i'll try and put pictures up and then so he says blit maps equal power blit knots equal heroes and then enemy collection they're launching another collection which are these enemies these are the villains in this sci-fi story that's being built as part of this tweet dom hoffman says sort of like this road map is establish backstory and building blocks create examples of character-driven narrative in different formats to fire up the imagination cco all of it add incentives see what happens so we've talked about road maps on this show before uh zenika brought up that he's not a big fan of road maps i think this is a good example of the kind of very flexible road map that zenika likes to see assuming the project is talented enough to pull it off what what dom hoffman is basically saying here is like yeah we're going to give you guys some backstories for these characters that we've created and we're going to create some examples of interesting character narratives as far as we see it but and to give you guys sort of fodder for your imaginations but then we're gonna put all of it in the creative commons so we're gonna say we have no copyrights over any of this we're gonna add some incentives to make you guys come up with a story and we're gonna see what happens and see where this world goes so much like loot this is very much an experiment in if we hand the story over to the community what will be created and this is really interesting to me because it's a central tension i think that we're going to be grappling with in this community for a very long time which is centralization versus decentralization are you is a project better off having like one clear creative visionary who controls everything and drives everything or are we better off having a group of people collaborate on something and see what happens if they build together i think the reality is you're going to have really amazing projects come out of both and you're going to have really crappy projects come out of both models and but it will be important to track that as we move through this space and so far the community seems to have liked this this road map and like this concept because the floor is doing very well dom hoffman is also a special person and uh you know has had a lot of success thus far in life and so is somebody that is i think trusted to create an interesting project he's a whole bunch of teammates as well who are all interesting um but we will see we will see what happens with blitmaps moving forward we'll continue to track it in the spirit of continuing to track things i wanted to just mention where bio pills is bio pills is the project that i really talked about last week and explained last week um it's had it's been a little up and down this week not in any sort of crazy way it's now holding steady um so it didn't continue its surge so to speak but it also did not crash again it was like this one project that throughout the bear market seemed sort of just unmoved by what was happening in the broader market so very interesting okay our next topic today is about mainstream coverage of nfts and the metaverse this was partly inspired by this jimmy fallon segment where he had people on and it was so funny to to imagine the audiences the jimmy fallon audience reaction to people i don't know if i was reading into this but it felt like they were like sort of laughing but sort of confused like you know what who was this dude who was making millions upon millions of dollars on this like fairly weird artwork jimmy fallon actually showed some of people's art and i just felt like the audience's reaction was like what what is happening here um but i think it's very cool that people got to go on jimmy fallon so inspired by that i wanted to look at some of the other ways that this space is being covered right now in again call it the mainstream there's one article that i want to call out it was from fast company and the headline is science proves it most nfts are worthless so the headline and the general like tone of this piece really just like my reaction was like okay boomer uh not because i actually think what they wrote was wrong but again it's about the framing and the whole like way they approached this piece was very i don't know just mainstream i just felt lame okay so the th the thrust of the piece was this we here at fast company or i don't even think it was fast company but you know somebody analyzed nft sales over the history of nft sales over the last you know four years essentially and found that most art doesn't most of the nft art doesn't sell for anything in fact they found that one percent of projects sell for more than fifteen hundred dollars just one percent and that seventy five percent of projects sell for less than fifteen dollars so there was one quote that said in this article that said according to new research people's success is an extreme outlier which again i just want to be like no sherlock like oh you mean the man who sold a piece of artwork for 69 million dollars is an outlier like that's an outlier in the real art world as well i think this is what bugged me about this piece was they acted like what this was unique they acted like this was unique to the nft market or in some way this information delegitimized the nft market when what they were describing i think absolutely applies to the physical art world as well there's a reason that starving artists is a stereotype right most artists are not making money so the the focus here should not be on why does the nft market have the same i don't know if you even know if you want to call it problems but same restrictions as the physical art market it should be oh wow isn't it amazing that there's a new way for artists to make any money at all let's look into that that was sort of the the general my general feeling on it however i do think there is an important takeaway here which is because nfts are a hot topic right now i think you you have a lot of artists who maybe see them as like a holy grail and are like i just need to get into nfts i can i too can become a millionaire and i do think it's important to flag that that's not the case that just because you make something an nft does not mean it's going to be successful and in fact it's actually a ton of work to launch an nft and the projects that you're seeing be really successful for the most part they had pre-existing relationships in the nft space that allowed them to be successful upon first launching nfts are not a holy grail for artists lord knows i wish they were i think they present tremendous opportunity for artists but you're not guaranteed success simply because you're an artist who launches an nft project uh and somebody tweeted this the other day i think it was punk2476 she was like i hear from a lot of artists whose work isn't selling and it makes them feel really sad and i think that's because there's a comparison element there which is all these artists seeing all these other people or feel like they see all these other people getting rich off of nfts and they're like what's wrong with me and my art that that's not my experience it's not just you this is this is a hard space you can be an incredibly talented artist and still not make it uh as an nft artist because there's a lot of supply here so i fast companies article in general i found the tone a little eye-rolly but i actually think there was a central message that is something we should flag more often on juno is your new crypto

and be kept up to date about what we have going on and also to check out open roles we have available we'd love to have you apply come work with me coming out blockblock.io ben shapiro went on joe rogan i guess this past week and they talked about the metaverse i don't want to hear people's opinions on ben shapiro and joe rogan that's not the point of this the point is they are prominent figures with a lot of followers and they talked about the metaverse and the clip that i saw online caught my attention because the the like caption for the youtube clip was zuckerberg's facebook's quote odd metaverse decision and that caught my attention because i was like okay whatever you may think about facebook becoming meta this decision is not odd it's brilliant it makes all the sense in the world i've been going back into i don't know call it the facebook mark zuckerberg archives since this announcement and i went back and listened to a conversation that mark zuckerberg had with kara swisher the tech reporter carol was interviewing mark and what mark zuckerberg kept saying over and over again this was back in 2017 2018 was facebook is a platform for human connection we're not just like a social media platform we are fundamentally trying to facilitate human connection greater human connection etc and again whatever you think of that in terms of like maybe corporate speak or a way for zuckerberg to dodge responsibility for things i think he really believes it and he sees that as the true north of facebook and hell facebook has facilitated human connection it's grandma's getting to see baby pictures of their grandkids in ways that they never could have before it's you know connecting with old friends from high school et cetera et cetera um so they have done that and that continues to be the refrain he uses now as he talks about the metaverse and why facebook is getting into the metaverse it's about human connection it's about human connection so he is very very clear on what he sees as the true north and the vision for this company formerly facebook now meta and in that frame the meta decision makes all the sense in the world so again feel how you will about it but this is not an odd decision this is a very sensible logical decision i i will say overall i thought ben and joe were reasonably they weren't as bad like their talking points weren't that bad they both seemed to acknowledge that this was inevitable and that this was coming and did the usual sort of fear fear-mongering maybe is a strong word but fear-mongering around oh no what does this mean when we're all just connecting digitally and we no longer have human human connection and contact legitimate concerns to raise but nothing nothing wild was really said other than this assertion that this is like an odd decision which i strongly reject um finally i've talked quite a bit about people going on jimmy fallon but in light of the fast company article we just discussed i wanted to say one more thing about it which is jimmy asked people how can other people do this and people was like oh there's so there's so many tools out there to learn how to do digital art and you know you can get involved and i don't think there's anything illegitimate about this conversation and i think it's great to encourage people to go try digital art and spread their wings and get into the nft space lord knows i'm excited about that but i do think that this feeds this narrative that i was describing earlier of like anyone can do this you too can make 69 million dollars on your digital artwork you know someday and and sure you know you probably you could potentially but beeple is a very special case he's been doing this for 16 years whatever it's been every single day he had a strong following he he had really found this hole in the market that probably doesn't exist as much anymore because you now have people and a ton of other people also trying to be people now and um i guess what i really just wanted to double emphasize here is if you are an artist trying to get into this space or you want to you want to make your move into nfts take the time to make connections in the space that is actually possible here you can go into the discords of projects you admire and talk to the founders or catch their attention but take i don't know maybe a year who knows how long it takes but take time to really build your network in the nft space because that is so critical for launching a project we talked about it a bit with betty dead fellas i will say it until i'm blue in the face over and over again i think people underestimate how important it is to have connections in this space when you're launching because we think of this space so it's so decentralized there's no gatekeepers that's not true right it there's just sort of a new it's a new there are new gatekeepers in this space and it's beautiful and it's lovely but you do need to put the time in and and really network in my opinion if you want to be successful launching an nft project okay uh final couple things here i wanted to touch on some controversies i didn't want to dive deep into these because i don't know some of them feel like real housewives drama to some extent the the big one is with punk2476 i mentioned her last week because she had launched a project where you could buy two four seven six coins this this project she launched and then you could stake those coins and by staking those coins you could get 2476's attention and and share your project with her and then she is said she would potentially you know promote your project on her twitter so we talked about that last week i don't need to rehash that but there was tremendous scandal this week which is that she i guess was getting other influencers to follow this same protocol right launch their own tokens that could be staked in order for them to sort through all the projects that were coming their way and thomas.etha i'm calling him thomas.eath but the his handle is like t-m-a-s-e launched one of these he's this like famous fodder in the space fear uncertainty and doubt right he he like goes negative about projects and says they're going to zero and he creates all this fun and that sometimes causes the projects then to actually rally as a result because he's sort of famous for doing this he launched a flood coin i spent like an hour trying to track down everything that was going on as part of this controversy and i couldn't even get to the bottom of it and there are very strong feelings about the whole thing so again i don't want to go go too too deep here but i do want to have a takeaway so essentially what happened is he launches this fud coin he's hyping it up punk 2476 is hyping it up some other influencers ended up actually hyping it up people spent a lot of money i mean multiple eth buying these coins and then it turned out maybe it was it was a joke i mean as soon as basically these influencers bought into it they listed them at zero tomas.eth thomas.eth said like make it go to zero it was supposed to be a joke because that's what he does he's a fodder in the space but the coin actually did then just plummet of course with people listing for xero so all these people who had bought in and spent like hard-earned money on it were like holy are you kidding me like i just lost all my money what is going on thomas claims no no this is a real project we actually are gonna do something with this uh it's but it's sort of lost all credibility in the space so people are like can you please give us your our money back people really went after punk 2476 she's been embroiled in other scandals before there then was a whole conversation around is she even a woman i'm not going there i don't it feels a little trashy the whole thing to me but i will say this is just a reminder that just because somebody is good on twitter does not mean that you want to invest in them as essentially a business person because that is what we are doing when we buy nfts we're investing in the team like we would a stock right and and we're trusting that this is a team that can build a brand or build a game or build something that's bigger than just what it is on the surface and somebody being funny on twitter does not make them qualified to do that well so please please be smart and really think these things through and look at the backgrounds of these twitter influencers beyond just oh they're funny on twitter look at what have they done in the real world to build businesses or to build brands or to build something because that's what you're trusting them to do when you buy into their project that's what i wanted to say there um last controversy i'll call it that i wanted to highlight is and i'm not going to know how to pronounce it because i don't think anyone does hick at digital art marketplace it's i h i c space e t space n u n c i'm gonna call it hen h e n because that's one of the abbreviations that gets used for it and that's a hell of a lot easier to pronounce hen it is a digital marketplace art marketplace on the tezos blockchain it was essentially set up you know it was largely built by one guy rafael lima but it was a very community led decentralized type project this past week rafael lima seemed to i'm going to use this word though it sounds negative i don't necessarily mean it that way but like abandoned the project he seemed to get he was seemed to be fed up with i don't know the space at large or other people copying things he was doing with hen whatever it was he basically said i'm out and shut down hen gave over the smart contract to the community but what's so important about this story is it speaks really well to what we all have been talking about in this space which is the power of decentralization and the power of the blockchain because although the original creator of the hen marketplace left and shut it down there's been virtually no disruption to what was hen marketplace activity and this is because all sales all all artwork that's held by somebody's wallet continues to live and exist in a perfect record on the blockchain nobody's wallets were disrupted by this it's all right there and furthermore all of the metadata from the site from the hen site in terms of what images were where the history of what images were where when on this site the copy that was on the site all of this is also preserved in a decentralized way which means that already new interfaces new websites have sprung up that can be you know essentially replicas of what hen was and there was somebody who wrote a blog post about this that i thought did a very good job and the author said the website so the hen website was merely acting as a thin interface atop the decentralized blockchain contracts and peer-to-peer file hosting and that was his way of saying this is why it was so not catastrophic when the founder of the project decided to peace out it's a really interesting case study something to understand and maybe look a little deeper into if you're interested in this space because it it supports everything we in this space have been saying for a while which is this is the power and the beauty of decentralized systems you're not at the whims of and you're not beholden to the whims of any one individual creator last thing here in metaverse news i heard a stat that i thought was interesting which is uh this past year metaverse was used 128 times in investor presentations as in the word metaverse came up 128 times in investor presentations by like major i think it was like fortune 500 companies uh last year it was it had been used seven times so it's a huge jump you're seeing metaverse become very trendy very hip disney plus announced that they were they saw themselves as a metaverse platform and that that's what they were moving towards is how do we make disney plus and take all of this amazing disney ip and make it an immersive experience for people uh that they were essentially i don't think they phrased it like we're becoming a metaverse company but rather disney plus is a metaverse platform um i think this stuff is going to take longer than we maybe expect it's becoming very buzzy right now but i don't think that you know in the next year we're all going to be living in these virtual spaces where we can hang out with our friends from across the country i think this stuff will take a lot of time still but it's exciting it's exciting to see more brands jump on board and talk about it publicly time says they're unveiling a metaverse category to their time 100 so that's interesting again we're just going to see this continue but it is a little buzzy right now and i think it's going to i think the buds will will die out at some point before the reality hits it you know it'll be a there'll be ups and downs in this path to becoming you know a metaverse society all
