hey bankless nation welcome to another state of the nation episode this time we're diving deep into macro markets there's been a downturn recently david i don't know if you've noticed it getting pretty ugly out here macro has taken center stage yet again i think people are wondering how is this going to affect crypto markets in 2022 so we brought on jim bianco to talk about the macro landscape what are we going to dive into in this episode david and we're going to talk about the changing stance of the federal reserve apparently the fed is uh taking things a little bit more seriously taking inflation a little bit more seriously not just rising interest rates but going from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening uh let's unpack what that actually is because again every time i hear the words quantitative quantitative easing and tightening i'm like okay i i knew that for about the five seconds that it lasted in my brain but then like it just flies right back out uh so what is that and why is it different than just fighting inflation and what does that mean for the different types of markets of the world the bond markets the stock markets and the crypto markets how does risk on assets how are they going to behave differently versus risk off assets and a bunch of other questions there's also some news that uh we talked to jim before the show that he really wants to talk about with uh microsoft buying activision blizzard for some crazy billion numbers of dollars uh and how they are just like facebook are also trying to co-op the metaverse so a number of different topics here but first leading with the whole inflation fed conversation yeah i really want to know if like first of all the world is going to collapse due to inflation okay that like that's somewhere in my mind space and and also like is crypto going to collapse due to this quantitative tightening this interest rate reduction or the interest rate uh increase going into the year so we'll have to see what all of this means we'll unpack that with jim also guys before we get in just uh an announcement from our friends at alto ira i'm gonna get tax nerdy with you guys you're the perfect one to do it ryan okay the attacks optimize or as you've told me before david all right so i've had this cool thing uh since you know as soon as i found out about it in crypto that this was possible it's called a self-directed ira okay and this is a brilliant for retail investors in the us this is a way to actually have a a tax advantage you don't pay any taxes until you retire a count that is denominated in crypto okay and so like any of you guys who have tracked your taxes for crypto and know what to pay an asset is you know how much you pay when you go from like bitcoin to ether that's taxable a taxable event not so inside of an ira account so i think everybody in crypto who's on the bankless journey should set one of these up if you live in the u.s uh and if you want to get super advanced there's there's another tool for you which is you might have a 401k from a previous employer okay so you work for a while somewhere you you put away some fun snow 401k you can actually take that 401k and you can convert it you can roll that over turn it into crypto all right and then you can start saving uh your retirement dollars in crypto some of you guys aren't thinking of retirement yet but like are you thinking of not having to pay your taxes because that's something you can do with one of these structures and what what we found there's lots of different solutions on the market but the easy button if you're kind of lazy right and you just want that easy button just something that works okay david might be that guy um also ira gives it to you because it's completely integrated with coinbase right so that means they have 125 different crypto assets you get set up just a few minutes uh and they it's a ten dollar investment minimum okay so you could start at any amount and again you can put away as much as 6k per year i think that's the current uh ira laws or roll over your existing 401k they take about 1.5 percent on that uh well worth it from my perspective just to get you the easy button to make it happen so if you want to figure out if you want to learn more about that and get your account set up which i encourage you to do everyone who's listening to this just take some time and actually get it set up you don't have to start depositing from day one go to altoira dot com slash bankless as you can tell david i get excited about crypto i was gonna make that same joke take it from the guy who gets really really excited about this it's awesome good taxes all right it's great uh anyway david let me uh let me ask you the question we begin every state of the nation episode with uh and that is this what is the state of the nation today sir the state of the nation is denial ryan i am in complete denial about the state of the federal reserve and i want to pick jim bianco's brain about whether if that's a healthy denial or unhealthy denial am i really a lot allowed to just ignore the antics of the fed can i just assume that the crypto markets go up only forever or is that naive and should i actually be fearful uh so uh i'm in denial and i'm trying to ask myself if that's appropriate should we have gotten a psychologist on psychological states and so what you're saying is like you're in denial because you don't want to believe that macro can affect crypto significantly that crypto fundamentals should kind of stand on their own and maybe this is sort of a wake-up call from jim that we're getting out of this episode yeah yeah so like i think that macro markets can throw crypto around a decent amount but can it throw it into a bear market that's what i'm in denial about i don't think it can throw krypto into a bear market but maybe jim has a different opinion well we're about to find out guys we will be back right

hey pleasure to be here thank you uh guys jim bianco is a president macro strategist at bianca research he's been a veteran of the dot com era he's an expert in global economy macro stuff i turn to his twitter threads often when i'm trying to understand all of this stuff he's also a defy crypto native which is a rare breed of those have transitioned both the traditional world and this new d5 world had him on the podcast again and i knew as david and i tried to unpack what is going on in macro we had to have jim on so jim can you help us make sense of this stuff i think a lot of people in crypto they came to finance by way of like crypto and so they don't understand when you're talking about things like the bond market and quantitative tightening quantitative easing they don't understand what some of these terms means we don't have those things in crypto we don't yes we have these things we just call them different things right uh so we're hoping you could help us out with that does that sound good that sounds good in fact i think the reason you created crypto was to get away from these ideas i think so but now they're now they're coming full circle as david said we can't just keep burying our heads in the sand so i want to start with maybe this um to make sure we understand with with the bond market and we're talking about uh sovereign bonds right here which are very important financial instruments it seems to me uh and um you've had a tweet thread recently that i want to kind of unpack and understand this was from january 9th and you open this tweet thread by saying in some respects what happened in the bond markets last week was epic something we might be talking about for many years okay so something last week happened in the i guess this is two weeks ago happened in the bond market that was epic something we might be talking about for years what is that thing what happened uh in simple terms the bond market got killed it had one of its worst weeks on record uh prices sold off quite a bit the losses that one incurred in the bond market were very very large quick word about the bond market and i'm hopefully not going to go too far into the weeds with some of the math when interest rates go down the prices of bonds get more volatile we refer to that as positive convexity and so when you have record low interest rates the amount that bond prices move right now is huge compared to 30 years ago or 40 years ago when we had 10 or 12 interest rates so you have these gigantic movements in bonds and in the first week of january you had one of the biggest plungers weekly plunges that we've ever seen across the board short rates long rates um you know in real rate bonds basically the bond market got killed and that's what i was talking about what happened was epic and we might be talking about it and that the bond market got really took a left turn and had some and got spanked pretty bad to begin the year and what are the implications of that uh if we have a dead bond market it got killed uh how what does that mean for every other market why is that so important yeah so interest rates are the price of money in the trad five world and it is probably the basis where everything starts whether you're investing in companies or running a company or buying stocks or buying commodities or whatever you start your analysis you start your idea with what does money cost me and if the bond market is signaling to us that money is going to cost a lot more remember lower bond prices mean higher yields if it's signaling to us that we're going to see much more expensive money that changes the valuation and the metric for everything else in the tradify world and now by extension uh the crypto world as well too so what the bond market was signaling was that money is going to become a lot more expensive to borrow and that is something that we haven't seen or had considered until we got right to the beginning of the year and by the way real quick why did it happen at the beginning of the year these markets are so institutionalized i'm talking about the trad five fixed income market uh is so institutionalized every institution gets paid you get paid a performance bonus usually on the calendar year so the most important date for institutions since december 31st that this defines their bonus that defines their income for that year january 1st tends to be like a new page that's been turned and it's not unusual to see in these heavily institutionalized markets that when you turn the new page to the new year all of a sudden a market takes a right turn and goes either up big or down big this year it happened to be down big okay so the bond market's going down big so can you remind us when we're talking about bonds are are we talking about like corporate bonds sovereign bonds like the bonds of nation states all of that and then who sets the prices this is free market but yet um what is that caused by at the root of things is that is that caused by central bank what jerome powell and the fed actually plan to do in the future and the market's kind of anticipating that so they go up or down based on what they think the fed is going to do in the future what are the dynamics that actually priced the bond market and what bonds are we talking about here so usually when we talk about interest rates we're talking about the sovereign bonds of a nation now in the u.s that's the u.s treasury market in the uk that's the gilt market in the japanese market that's the japanese government bond market those are the bonds issued by the government and typically not always but typically they have among the highest quality of credit you know with the u.s treasury the concern is the risk is not that the us is going to default the risk is is that interest rates are going to rise and your prices are going to fall so when we talk about interest rates rising we're usually talking about us treasuries corporate bonds high-yield bonds municipal bonds asset-backed securities usually get priced off of those so we usually refer to what where corporate bonds are as a spread or a premium over that risk-free rate of treasury so if treasury yields are going up corporate bond yields are going to go up usually by a like amount and if there's perceived more risk because there's a credit risk their spread might widen and they might go a little bit more so essentially if treasury bond yields are going up then they are all going up now to your second part of your question why what's got them going it's the big i word inflation and it's inflation has now become a point in the markets and i'll talk about this a little bit not everybody in the market believes this but it's not transitory anymore at least in the short end of the bond market what i mean by that is people that trade short-term bond or short-term debt securities two-year notes one-year bills fed funds in that space those players have decided that the biggest problem is inflation it's not transitory and the federal reserve is going to have to deal with that by raising rates many times and so that's what they've got as far as where we are in the market now is in the longer end of the market and in the equity market there's a little bit of disagreement about whether or not the federal reserve is going to raise rates as aggressively as the short end of the market thinks right now you can go to things like the fed fund futures market the euro dollar futures market there's a cash market called the overnight index swaps market and what they're telling you is four rate hikes for this year are priced in we're not that far away from a fifth so they're a big aggressiveness that's priced in the market you ask equity traders now that's not going to move that much why why don't they think the fed's going to move that much because they don't believe that the federal reserve would ever do anything when it comes to the markets that would upset the economy or the stock market they don't believe that the fed would raise rates multiple times and put the stock market or the economy at risk and from 2008 to 2020 they were right the stock market the fed would never do anything to put the stock market at risk but something has changed now and that's inflation and it's showing up and this is where i think a lot of strategists and economists um are either unwilling or won't go unwilling to go there don't want to go there whatever word you want to use if you look at political polling and cbs news had a poll out this weekend the president's approval rating is in the tank the uh the prospects of the democrats getting re-elected are in the tank the number one issue in the country is inflation it is not crime it is not climate change it is not covet it is inflation inflation hits everybody there's no escaping it 40 percent of the public has le this was a federal reserve study done right before the pandemic 40 of the public has less than a thousand dollars of savings in rents every single one of those people go to the grocery store go to the gas pump go to the mall and they wind up buying less every month than they did the previous month because of inflation that's what's showing up in the polls and so when people say well the fed will never upset the stock market yeah from 2008 to 2020 you had that 40 in the stock market's interests aligned on the same side but now they're on diverging interest don't raise rates jay you might tank the stock market jay do something about inflation because you got 40 of the people screaming that they're going to take it out on the democrat party in november so he's in a bad place right now which side does he go to does he err on the side of protecting the stock market or does he err on the side of dealing with this incipit inflation problem and more and more i think the markets are coming to the belief he's going to err on the side of this incipit inflation problem and get aggressive and raise rates and if that puts the stock market at risk and if that puts the economy at risk well then so be it but they cannot not deal with this problem that's the dilemma that we're facing in the market right now so you might just want to check my understanding uh and get back and pick up the inflation uh thread so we we had this big dip in the bond market where the asset prices of the of the bonds dropped significantly and as a result of that that means the yields go up because these things are inversely correlated the prices of bonds go down but the yield that they generate goes up and that sets a new level for the cost of money that's what you're talking about with how much money costs because if you can get a dependable you know three percent ap yield on your dollars in the bond market which is deemed very very safe perceived very very safe by investors why would you go take your usdc and take it into defy like when where there's a lot more risk like you could just get a very stable return and so like the it pulls people back from the risk spectrum and says like hey you know three percent on your bonds that's not too bad i'm just making these numbers up but this is the example and so this is why perhaps the stock market and the crypto markets are in the state of fear right now because they are seeing the raising rates raising yields out of bonds after prices have gone down and they're saying well i have to i don't have to take so much risk anymore in order to get the yield that i need and that has caused a drop in risk on assets and so that's what we're fearful about with the stock market and the crypto markets what i'm said i'm in denial about um and all this is because for the first time in such a long time the fed has been presented with a new problem which is inflation so okay can you just put ourselves in the shoes of the fed uh for for right now because they have they had the fed has a dual mandate for maximum employment and also stable prices uh and it seems that they have thrown maximum employment maximal employment by the wayside in lieu of stable prices can you just kind of do the cost benefit analysis that you think that the fed is doing as to why they've determined inflation as the big problem well one of the things that the fed is looking at and we have to be honest here is political the federal reserve is 107 year old institution that has gotten its reputation as an inflation fighter that they have and whether or not it's been paul or yelling before him or bernanke before her they have repeatedly said we have tools to deal with unwanted inflation okay the public has just told you we have unwanted inflation today and we want you to deal with it today right now is and so the fed has got a a choice that they have to make do they continue to push this idea that no no no you may think it's unwanted but don't worry it will go away on its own otherwise known as transitory so therefore we have to do nothing or does the fed decide that if they do nothing and they're wrong there's going to be a price to pay from the federal reserve or if they do nothing and a desperate congress looking to get reelected and i'm not trying to be partisan here by saying it's the democrats because if the republicans were in the majority that's exactly the same thing about them but that that desperate congress might try and take on this issue themselves through price controls or some other heavy-handed tactic to try and bring down prices in order to stave off a debacle during the election in november the federal reserve i think is looking at those although they'll never say it but they are and they're saying we've got a political choice that we've got to make and we've got to deal with this inflation problem um today by raising interest rates the first part of your question real quick how does interest rates going up how does that impact you know the stock market and then maybe the crypto market well one of the other things the fed does is what's called quantitative easing and then the opposite of that is quantitative tiding tightening now what is that very simply the federal reserve has a bunch of banks that are required to hold a reserve account with the fed so if i'm a bank of a billion dollars in size i have a reserve account at the fed and it roughly has around 110 million dollars of reserves around 11 the federal reserve has the ability to add reserves to my account or drain reserves from my account how do they do that they just change the number of my fed uh you know if if a commercial bank did that everybody goes to jail but if a central bank does that that's called sophisticated monetary policy is what it is so what is quantitative easing they call up my bank and they say we want to buy 10 million dollars of five year notes so sell us 10 million dollars of five year notes okay i did now how's the fed going to pay for it they'll say to me you know your reserve account well we'll just erase that number and we'll add 10 million more to it and so they created the money out of thin air in order to purchase these bonds why do they do it well if the fed is purchasing uh if the fed is purchasing 120 billion dollars of bonds a month a trillion and a half a year that helps to hold down interest rates that helps to create a buyer of bonds what does the private sector do private sector looks at these yields and says i'm not going to buy these these very low overly priced low prices uh or very high-priced low-yield bonds that are overvalued i'm gonna go look somewhere else maybe i'll buy corporate bonds or maybe i'll buy stocks maybe i might even move into crypto uh as well too so they refer to that as moving out the risk curve uh milton friedman had a fancy trace for this called the portfolio balance channel so that's the fear is if the fed is going to start raising rates ending quantitative easing then the bond market needs to find a trillion and a half dollar buyer and how does the bond market find a trillion and a half dollar buyer well it keeps raising interest rates by selling off its bonds to suck money in from corporate bonds the stock market uh maybe even the crypto markets too suck money in to buy their instruments and so that's why the markets are worried about the fed raising rates you the fed are buying bonds so i don't have to i could go play in stocks and crypto okay well you're gonna keep selling off bonds and raising rates and remember interest rates are the price of money you're gonna make money more and more and more expensive until i make the decision best place for me to put my money is in some safe high yielding treasury security so what yield do they have to go to well how much do they have to lower the price so that's why the fear is as the fed starts to fight inflation by raising rates they're signaling no more qe no more that they're going to be buying bonds and maybe they're going to do qt that they oh because one of the other things the fed does is they own seven trillion dollars worth of bonds yes seven trillion when they mature so if a hundred million dollars worth of bonds mature a billion dollars of bonds mature today they buy another billion dollars to hold their holdings stating maybe they just let them mature that would be qt that further adds to the supply that the market has to take in and that further puts pressure on other markets that we want to drag money out of those other markets to buy treasury securities so if the fed is worried about inflation and interest rates are going to go up it's a signal the bond market wants a trillion dollars worth of buyers and the bond market will find a way to get a trillion dollars worth of money in other places to transfer back to the bond market it will sell it will sell make its price go lower and lower and make it look more and more attractive with a higher and higher yield until it does suck all that money in that's why you see stocks being wobbly and at the end of the risk curve even cryptos being wobbly too it might suck money back the other way because what we saw through 21 was all the money was going one way from the tradify markets to cryptos this is uh thank you for talking about that in such a clear way jim like i think this is going to benefit a lot of listeners who are maybe for the first time actually understanding the dynamics at play here so you know thank you for that and i want to get back on the inflation train in just a minute but before we do something you said there sort of brought brought some more questions to you know in into my mind so it seems like the fed is is indicating signaling that they're going to raise uh interest rates right and the market has said maybe that's going to happen three times uh this year maybe four times not so sure and they've also maybe signaled that they're going to stop quantitative easing and do quantitative tightening but like can we talk about this whole signaling thing right it's like it seems very bizarre to me right why doesn't the fed just say hey guys here's what we're gonna do boom boom boom why is there all of this like talking in code and this strange fed speak that happens the market has to analyze everything that powell says and and say okay here's what he really meant to where like here's what's going to happen as a result why can't they just speak plainly about what they intend to do is is the signaling aspect an element of how this whole system works they have a fancy word for it they call it forward guidance is what they call it so yes the signaling is what they're afraid of in the market is doing something that upsets the market quite a bit and so they like to signal it in fact that signaling even gets a little a little bit more nuanced than that robin wigglesworth at the ft or nick timaros at the wall street journal will occasionally write stories like senior federal reserve officials are thinking about x that's usually them calling up the papers and saying hey tell everybody we're thinking about doing quantitative tightening a little bit yeah okay and then if the market likes it okay that's the policy if the market doesn't like it i don't know what the hell they're talking about at the wall street journal we had no plan on doing that whatsoever so that that's part of the forward guidance thing now of course i'm embellishing about a little bit about uh it for just to be funny but they do they think they do kind of drop these hints either through speeches or through conversations with with the media um as well too because they don't want the market to be surprised they are definitely afraid especially in the 08 period that they come up and they just say okay today we've decided something else and the markets completely freak out and crash they don't want to be responsible for it so they want to try and lead us all you ready here we go we're going to do it i'm telling you we're going to do it here it comes ready one two three there we did it so no one's going to be surprised when it happens again they call that forward guidance so that is by design the way that they like to do their policy which is why we obsess over every word they say and we look at the speeches and stuff because we're trying to define divine the forward guidance of what they're trying to do it's quite an elaborate dance between the fed and the markets but you know this is the way it works uh certainly so let's get back on that inflation train for a minute because it wasn't but six months ago that i remember um jay powell talking about tr using this term transitory inflation okay i'm not sure that whether this is part of signaling or part of the dance or whether he actually believed that that inflation was transitory what's what's your belief it seems like now the fed is is ready to take off that label and say no we actually have inflation what's your belief about inflation like is it a persistent problem and how persistent is it are there some elements that are still transitory and you know could inflation go down without the fed intervening what's your overall take on the inflation story here well a couple things just so everybody has a context one year ago the inflation rate was 1.4 percent and now it's 7 there were people a year ago like me that was worried i was worried a year ago that inflation is going to be one of the big stories of the year and i thought man we could see three and a half percent inflation maybe four on the outside and it was seven so i i directly got it right but i was way way short of where the the inflation rate was going to come up the word transitory the idea that the the a lot of economists were pushing the fed was the reason that we're seeing these higher prices was it was an echo of the lockdowns in 2020 we were all sent home and we didn't spend money in 2021 things opened up so now okay now i'm gonna buy that new car that i wanted to buy in 2020. now i'm gonna remodel my kitchen which i wanted to do a year ago or or or now i'm gonna buy some new clothes or something like that and so we're going to see this echo of this pent up demand to buy stuff in the marketplace so we're going to see inflation go we're going to see prices blip up higher and then dissipate well they flipped up higher and then they kept going and going then we blamed it on the supply chain then we've started to blame it on other things some people like me said all the stimulus all the air drops of all the money we did the 1400 stimulus check and the 600 stimulus checked and the 1200 stimulus check all of that led into a lot of people having extra money to spend in the economy and so what we wound up with is much higher inflation than we ever thought at seven percent now i'm in the camp that inflation is more persistent but the nuance here is all the data suggests that probably by march you'll see a peak in the inflation rate and then for the rest of the year it will come down problem solved right because it's going to come down no it has to come down to something like two percent um or the fed's old target around two percent to really say it's in it's it's transitory what it might wind up doing is peaking at around seven and a half or eight percent by march and by the end of the year we'll still be at four percent maybe five maybe three and a half that's still unacceptably too high now let me go back remember what's driving a lot of this is a political decision the 40 that have less than a thousand dollars of savings are not happy that they are that everything costs more money look the the upper ten percent we have homes stock portfolios maybe crypto portfolios so maybe my paycheck didn't go up seven percent in the last year but my house did my stock portfolio went up 29 my crypto portfolio went up in 21 so i got cushioned from the higher prices they didn't so now they're up un unhappy about it and so the fed is going to have to deal with that they can't tell them oh it's going to peak and it'll be four percent by the end of the year that won't satisfy that's still unacceptable so that's why i think that even if it does peak and it comes down it's probably not going to come down fast enough in order to bring inflation back to heal so that we could go back to a 20 2008 2020 scenario because right now again you've got the market on one side with the economy and you've got this 40 on the other side both are very unhappy and the fed's got to pick one and it's probably going to pick the 40 and deal with the inflation problem which is what's got markets upset because it's not it's going to provide by bond prices going lower and lower providing that competition for everything else so touching on that everything else side of things one of the narratives that has really been uh hammered into my brain over the last two years is that we can't let the stock market go down too much like too many people's retirements depend on the stock market so many people's pensions so a lot of things rely on the stock market at least staying flat and so you're telling me that the fed is kind of leaning into the other side of things the the average consumer the people that are meaningfully inflected by in inflation that have to pay rent and you know don't have too much savings but like what happens what happens on the other side of things like what happens if uh the fed prioritizes that too much and then all of a sudden the stock market does indeed go into like a pretty significant prolonged bear market is it now isn't there just an equal and opposite reaction where a different side of the world is unhappy and like what's the fed gonna do about that you're right and this is why they're in a bad place they've got no good choices there isn't the perception now and i happen to agree with this is there isn't a magic policy that makes both sides happy at the same time um so they got to pick one or the other and so that is the risk there's a phrase that we like to use in the markets that the fed has a history of raising rates too much until they break something and they you know break something is either the stock market plunges the economy goes in the recession or some other financial crisis seems to occur and that is a fear oh look a number of surveys done of professional trade fine managers ask them what is the number one fear you have for 2022 and the answer is a policy mistake the fed's going to raise rates too much and they're going to break something to your point they're going to raise rates to deal with this inflation problem too much and they're going to break the stock market or they're going to break the economy or they're going to break the plumbing of the traditional financial system and create some other kind of mess somewhere along the line so a lot of people are very worried about that's why these markets are very sloppy in the way because that's their fear so yes they've got a very difficult point that they're going to have to deal with raise rates some and then the stock market gets sloppy and then you say okay i can't do any more because rich people might become less rich well the 40 will be very very unhappy uh at that point and or do you say i have to address the inflation problem or at least look like i'm addressing the inflation problem and i got to keep raising rates and if the stock markets keep stumbling so be it you never want to be put in that position and that's exactly the position that the fed has been put in and partially because they waited way too long to deal with this problem of inflation they should have dealt with it maybe over the summer maybe last spring but by waiting too long and letting it get to this point it's left them with no good options can i just ask like a higher level question because um the fed has been pursuing a quantitative easing type policy since you know 2009 basically that's like printing tons of money adding to the balance sheet why are we just suddenly seeing inflation crop up i remember people who used to talk about inflation you know coming it's it's coming right around the corner in 2012 2013 and it never came but we saw massive asset price inflation i'm wondering if this time things are different partially because of uh fiscal policy so a lot of the money that you were just talking about with um kind of the stimulus checks and unemployment that didn't go to the banks and asset prices and quant that went directly to the consumer which also makes me you know wonder if the fed can really fix some of these issues right or if this is not a fiscal policy type of issue causing some of this inflation too so the fed's been printing money for the last 10 years now suddenly cpi inflation is a problem you have to ask yourself why and if that is more a result of fiscal policy than actually monetary policy and if it is fiscal policy is something the fed can really uh change is that something that they have any sway over do their dials work for that sort of thing what do you think well a couple of things first of all there was a fed governor who was there from 2009 to 2017 named dan torillo and he's over at the brookings institute and dan has given a number of speeches since he's left the fed i've always joked the best fed governors to the ones to listen to the ones that just left because now they tell you their opinion and they just don't spew the party line and he's been arguing that we don't have we being the economic community don't have a good theory of why what causes inflation and if you actually look into it and look at well it's too much money chasing too few goods it's the idea of inflation expectations rational expectations whatever theory you want and you back test it if you will it doesn't really work as well as you think so inflation's kind of this monster that we don't really totally understand which is fine but the federal reserve wants you to believe that they know how to they've got these little tools and knobs and levers that they could move it to the third or fourth decimal place anytime they want they give you that illusion that they have that kind of control on inflation so let's start with it is really hard to understand it second of all you're right something changed in the last two years that was not present in the last previous 12 years that gave us inflation and i would postulate this is it was the pandemic itself the event of the last generation was we sent everybody home for a year and because we sent everybody home for a year a lot of things have changed in the economy and we don't understand how they change wall street loves to use this phrase when things go back to how 2019 was no we're not going back to 2019 i don't know where we're going and it doesn't have to be a bad place it could be very good but we're not going to go back there and i've postulated that one of the things that's changed is that in the the lockdowns work from home our lifestyle choices that we've made we now want more stuff and less services now that runs counter to what a lot of people think but that's why we have a supply chain problem that is not getting better it seems to be intractable that's why we pay up for things like used cars and the like because we're at home more we've made a lifestyle change and that we want more stuff and that and then you add into that we stuffed everybody full of money and we've got a supply chain that can't handle it and that's why you've got these higher and higher prices now to your question about fiscal policy yeah uh who who where'd those checks come from the twelve hundred dollar check the 1400 check the 600 check they came from the federal government they didn't come from the federal reserve they're the ones that airdrop the money to everybody uh as well but the federal reserve through quantitative easing it's argued by buying up bonds where did the federal government get the money they borrowed it in the bond market they issued a bunch of bonds and then they used the proceeds of that to airdrop all this money to everybody who bought all those bonds the biggest single buyer was the federal reserve uh and that they allowed the government to borrow trillions of dollars without interest rates meaningfully going higher and so that's what happened and now we're on the we're we're seeing the effects of all that stimulus so i think lifestyle changes like i said don't discount the idea something that we never thought possible before the beginning of 2020 what did you know what if we decided that we're gonna send everybody home for a year and no one's gonna work for a year and then how we're gonna and then we're gonna turn it back on and we're all gonna pretend it's 2019 and go right back to the way it was before it's pretty obvious we're not going to go back to the way it was before i'm not going to tell you i know where we're going to go i just would argue again i don't think it necessarily has to be bad where we're going to go and i would argue it's not going to be don't look to how were things in 2019 and how do we get back to that again working at home wanting more stuff i think is a big driver of this inflation because it's been driven more by capital goods than it has been by services so jim the average bankless listener bankless viewer has some sort of portfolio that's very very heavy crypto or could also be very very heavy tech stocks for for these individuals what should they be paying attention to and should they be concerned if they might be overexposed on the risk end of the spectrum what would you say to somebody that has like you know 80 to 90 percent of their overall portfolio in crypto assets right now what should they should what should they be paying attention to david are you asking for yourself sir not at all ryan asking for a friend you're asking for a friend yeah um um let me start off by saying i am a big believer in this space and i'm a hodler and so at the end of the day think ahead longer term uh and you're gonna see this space expand greatly and you're gonna see coin prices go up quite a bit the whole space is but over the next year or so what was the big adoption of 2021 it was traditional institutions coming into crypto thinking of it as either a hedge against inflation or a hedge against the financial system but using it as part of the same spectrum right you've got super safe corp uh government bonds and corporate bonds high yield bonds equities and then you know within equities the more riskier equities are tech stocks and then at the very end of the spectrum is crypto it's part of the same spectrum is what it is so if the fed is going to raise rates if the fed is going to deal with this problem and the bond market isn't going to you know the bond market's going to sell off the stock market doesn't like it the end of the risk spectrum kryptos is going to feel it and so it's going to continue i think a struggle now longer term i would argue to you that the crypto market is not going to always be a adjunct to the trad fly markets it is now because that's the way that a lot of the adoption came into it is it was just they viewed it as the next and the we've extended out the risk the risk parameter it doesn't end with tech stocks there's another there's another world after that which was crypto uh eventually i think that the the crypto market is going to become independent of the financial world um as well too and once it becomes independent then it won't be stuck with all of these problems of what is the fed going to do where interest rates how are tech stocks what kathy woods portfolio did this week or that week all of those things will then be important for themselves but not necessarily for crypto but crypto has to break that link with trad five but it's probably not going to do that any time soon because they just got everybody in on the idea that it was the the further out part of the risk spectrum so you're anticipating uh you know choppy waters for 2022 for crypto because it's classified as a risk on asset and all risk on assets suffer kind of a a similar fate and uh that could be kind of bearish crypto in 2022. longer term can i just jump in and yeah just jump in and say that's already been happening yeah i was just looking at some numbers this morning um i went back to april 30th um bitcoin's down 25 since april 30th uh the d5 pulse index is down 50 since april 30th the bloomberg crypto galaxy index which is an index of all the coins is down 15 since april 30th we've been in eight or nine months of choppy waters already and i think we're going to see more of the same as we go forward from here uh so what i'm arguing is what you have seen over the last several months will probably continue as we sort out you know what the fed's going to do and that the the biggest risk off a risk on asset excuse me is is crypto guys we have so many more questions for jim including talking a little bit more about um you know bull bear market how long this this lasts talking a little bit about the politics here uh transitory inflation also the metaverse but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible

schooling us on the macro landscape here uh we we ended that commercial break um a little bearish like wondering what 2022 is going to do for crypto as an asset class i want to throw this idea by you jim which is an idea i think that was articulated fairly well by arthur hayes he's got a post about this he's the the ceo of bitmex also kind of a trader and his take was similar to yours in some respects basically you know the fed's in this uncertain territory has to do something about inflation it will do these things we'll probably get that in q1 q2 q3 as well and then one of two things might happen either something will break as you were saying and the fed will be like okay time to dial it back or midterms will be over and all of the the political angst that that you said is actually contributing pressure on this uh fed intervention on inflation will be over because you know november midterms have passed in the us and so his take is basically i'm going to play it safe for the next three quarters and then i'm kind of expecting maybe a rebound in q4 after some of this misery and volatility and chop has passed with the fed and then it's back happy music again fed continues printing money asset prices go up what's your take on that do you think that could be a possibility or do you think that's naive in some ways no i think that's exactly a possibility that's why i said i'm a hodler let's go backwards in time march of 2020. march 20th of 2020 eth dipped under a hundred dollars he i think it traded 93.94 on its low uh of the day at that point uh march 23rd of 2020 was the day below the stock market and when the stock market turned what happened with e it didn't just rally like the stock market the stock market turned and it doubled and eth one up 50 x is what it wound up doing so yeah when the fed keeps raising rates something breaks when this game ends the far end of the risk spectrum comes screaming out of this thing comes just flying out of this thing orders and orders of magnitude bigger than the tread fight markets do that's what we saw in march of 2020 uh that's what we saw last summer when uh the stock market took off in july and we bottomed out around 1700 on eath and it took off um as well too so i would argue to you it's about expectations i'm a hodler i'm holding i don't expect my coins to do much for me in the next several months but i know when the game turns i'll be wondering did it turn i'm not sure it turned it'll be up 5x before i've realized that it turned so i don't want to miss that and so therefore i'll just sit there and just ride this out for right now uh as well too so i would agree with arthur that's exactly i think the way you need to play it and don't check prices 38 times a day and go damn it's still 3100 when's it going to keep going it will it will it just not might be anytime soon but that's great and like i think people in crypto honestly need to hear the long-term perspective right and we're not even talking about like years here or decades here we're just talking about like months let's let's get over this this uncertainty and then like see where we are on the other side there's another idea that i want to float by you and this is um i think put well by raul paul who's been on the the podcast is he actually doesn't so if i don't want to put words in raul's mouth but i'll just try to paraphra phrase which is he doesn't think that inflation's going to cpi inflation is going to be a big deal over the next decade as many as many others do and like they think in in crypto that's a that's a very popular narrative that inflation like is going to be precipitous into the decade the reason for this according to rowell is um demographics so like demographics the baby boom generation is over people aren't having kids populations not growing as it used to and so you know like it's kind of the economy is a snake and it ate the baby boomer generation it's like working its way out of the system and will that's a deflationary force if you know population growth decreases and the other deflationary force is of course technology which tends to decrease prices that's his case for why we won't have a crazy high inflation 2020s what do you think about that do you think there's merit in that in that argument or would you take the counter uh counter perspective on that well you know first of all let me start with this whole deflation debate that you have out there is unusual even in the traditional markets it's like the baboon cage at the zoo somebody offers an opinion and the rest of us throw at them it's basically what happens and in fact most of wall street is like that most of the time as well too so is crypto exactly crypto twitter especially uh yeah but uh i think really this inflation thing i i agree that rolls right in that the three big things that have driven inflation down for the last generation have been demographics globalization and technology dgt they have come and they've been pushing and pushing and pushing the problem i see is that demographics are not going to change that should continue to be a downward push on inflation globalization is changing there is all of a sudden you know china's not our friend anymore and we just don't view china like we did even three or four years ago we view them with suspicion and and um and are very careful in how we deal with them technology is is there too but what we're not factoring into this is i still come back to the big event of the last generation was we sent everybody home for a year the way we do things the way we spend our money the way we view the world has changed and because of that we're still not getting our head around it look i know a lot of people in the financial markets that are now permanently work at home and they live in jacksonville wyoming or tempe arizona or they you know they live in um uh somewhere in florida they no longer live in manhattan anymore or they no longer live in san francisco or chicago and so that's a big change as well too in these markets and that's where i think this inflation thing has come and let me remind everybody i think that once we get through this peak on inflation we settle out three four percent inflation not 10 not 15 not 20 or something along those lines but three or four percent inflation well the 10-year yield is at 185 the fed funds rate is at zero if we've got a three or four percent inflation rate those interest rates are way too low and they're going to have to come up a lot maybe even approach those rates of three or four percent and that's going to put a lot of pressure on traditional financial markets so i agree with rel we're not going to see the 70s we're not going to see 9 10 11 12 inflation but if we see three three and a half that's going to be a problem and again i think it comes down to a big event just happened and our attitudes about a lot of things have changed and you know whether you want to call the great resignation or whatever phrase you want to put on it but things have changed and i think what we're seeing out of that is a change in the way we spend our money and that's why we've got inflation so jim how are you positioning yourself for for this year like these things have just recently changed right so like inflation just came on the radar some of these fed actions have changed things is your take like hey whatever it's all noise i'm a long-term holder anyway i'm just going to hold the same assets that that i've always held or are you a bit more active in that like you want to hedge against some of these events and change your portfolio as a result of of what's uh occurred what's uh what's your take on how you're positioning yourself for 2021 in the next couple of years well in crypto land um i only do one thing i buy and that's all i ever do so you know if everybody wants to play if you want to panic if you want to panic eats down under 2 500 i'll buy is what you'll you'll wind up seeing and i'm not in the in the mode of selling now in tranfi land uh i'm going to probably have a different attitude i've been reducing risk i've been getting out of the markets a little bit probably since around thanksgiving i've been investing more in stuff that benefits from higher inflation whether it's cyclical stocks or basic material stocks or something um along those lines as well too and even a little bit in financials although longer term i think financials are terrible investment uh but for a rental if you will higher interest rates should definitely help the financials as well too that's kind of how i'm playing this game right now so i view crypto differently than i view the tread firework because remember like i said before when it turns i'll be sitting there going did it turn i'm not your turn you know 5x and then did it turn it'll do 2x before that i don't want to miss that so i'll just ride this thing all the way through and every panic i'll try and just buy a little bit more and buy a little bit more by a little bit more and when this cycle turns watch it go just like the last cycle uh that we saw in march of 2020. really good advice really good thought and i think also i i hope people heard what you're seeing the benefit of having some dry powder on the sidelines to take advantage of some of these these dips that might be ahead if that's if that's the way we move also jim bianco buy only when it comes to crypto assets spoken like a true crypto knight native uh and something that i think is also going around in the world of crypto natives right now is the conversation of the metaverse because while markets are dealing with this crazy volatility due to inflation the metaverse continues to get built out and something that is happening in the wake of that that happened this morning jim that i know you're paying attention to is activision blizzard is getting uh perhaps bought by uh microsoft the world's largest company is buying one of the world's largest gaming companies um what do you think of this uh big uh merger is that or or buyout uh what's going on here so um just to put some numbers on it activision blizzard call of duty uh has been is being bought by microsoft for 70 billion dollars stock is now up i'm looking at my screen right now it's it's trading at 82. up 16 bucks for today so about a 30 percent gain um for today uh this is this is salvo number two in the metaverse salvo number one was facebook changing their name the meta salvo number two is microsoft spending 70 billion dollars to get a gamer uh they know they being the the web 2o world if you will facebook and microsoft know that the metaverse is coming they know web 3 is coming and what they're going to try and do with the metaverse and let me not mince words here they're going to try and turn it into metaverse 2.0 they're going to basically try and co-op the metaverse with their centralized version of the metaverse as well to whether it's meta whether it's what microsoft's going to do um we'll see what what some of the other players um you know wind up doing whether it's twitter or google or anything else if they make some kind of a metaverse type of play as well too so it it worries me that what we're going to see is we're going to jump from a decentralized kind of metaverse that we're all envisioning right to the centralized version of the metaverse and i am one that does believe that everything has to start with decentralization and anytime you get centralization whether it's these alt layer ones or whether it's going to be what they want to do with the metaverse that ultimately you haven't accomplished anything if we wind up with a a centralized version of the metaverse says i quick to you guys before we started maybe when facebook creates meta they can just take everybody who's been canceled on facebook and say okay you're automatically cancelled now in a new metaverse as well too uh is that really where we want to go with this and unfortunately a lot of these big companies want that to be the place that we're going to go and they're making big bets on it and i hope it's not the case but they're trying really hard to to grab control of the of whatever the metaverse turns out to be whatever web 3 turns out to be they want to try and roll it call it web 3 but make it really web 2.2 is really what they'd like it to be as well and hopefully at the end of the day it does become its vision of being a truly decentralized world do you think they'll be successful jim i hope they're not successful um at it and the reason i say i hope i you know i say that is let me throw into the world and i can almost throw the question to you i get a little dismayed by a lot of these alt layer ones that are basically so centralized and all they can continue to do is just push tps speeds oh look at how fast we could do all of our trades yeah well you got like seven validators oh who cares but all you get is cheap fees and real fast turnaround and that's all you really want well if that's really all we really want then we're never going to really realize the world of a bankless world we're just going to have a digital banked world is what we're going to wind up doing so i'd like to think that they're not going to be successful at it like i'd like to think a lot of these alt layer ones are going to be forced at some point screaming kicking to decentralize in one way or another because that's going to be the only true path to where we're going to go in this world but at times i i think yes we're going to that's where we're going to go and then at times i go man we're just going to wind up recreating a digital world a digital version of the tradfy system and we're not really going to accomplish a whole lot so you tell me i mean i kind of go back and forth on it i want to believe we're going to go decentralized and i hope we go decentralized you wanted you guys tell me why we will oh i think it's uh it's definitely a competitive edge when so much of the crypto world was was uh decentralized coming out of the bear market like really the only things that made it out of the bear market were bitcoin ethereum and dogecoin which is actually meaningfully decentralized and so like centralization actually was like a competitive edge um but i uh but i think what with what we're seeing uh exactly what you're what you're talking about with facebook pivoting to meta and microsoft buying activision blizzard like they're cornering the centralized version of the metaverse right like they can do centralization way better than we can uh and so like while perhaps centralization was a competitive edge in 2021 and maybe it still will be in 2022 with regards to crypto the long game is decentralization um and so maybe the strategy for these alt layer ones is like start start centralized because you got to go to market and on board people with cheap fees but then learn and carve a viable path towards decentralization because well now you've got to now you've got to compete with the centralization of facebook and and microsoft and like you're never going to compete with their level of centralization they they lean into it right i hope you're right i i would say that um preaching to centralization like a couple of things i've learned it's like uh it's very difficult to preach decentralization when numbers going up like on the other side of things because people don't really care in like the you know the bull market fervor but one of the reasons i guess the investment case for decentralization is that um basically that is that is the rock on which we build all of crypto and the metaverse is about property rights it's not about virtual reality that zuck thinks it's about property rights and if you believe that then the entire thesis of the space everything in this space has to be built onto centralization and the investment case here is like decentralization is the only true moat right and uh i think that'll prove itself out over time but you have to be sort of the prophet in the wilderness kind of like talking about that and and believing that sort of contrarian for a period of time um but we've also seen this play out in in other you know bull markets with bear comes maybe maybe 2022 will uh will br bring the market back to the realization that hey decentralization is the thing that matters so yeah we're still uber bullish on it and uh want to be on that side of of history but also i i do think that there are some centralized solutions that are on boarding the masses into crypto in a very healthy way that will like reinforce and and uh come back to some of the more decentralized elements of crypto too so in the end it's it's all increased the pie net win for everyone uh and i think that's how it plays out but we'll see man it's a journey it's really impossible to predict the future isn't it and thank you so much for spending some time with us jim today helping us understand the uh like what's going on in the macro markets i think this has been a fantastic education for everyone today uh last question for you man we really appreciate how into crypto culture you've gotten recently i noticed you're wearing a crypto shirt what's on this shirt yeah so uh there we go this is really kind of the way that you got it i tried it this is for all my old trip my no coiner friends i wear this shirt do they think you're crazy do they think you're great oh yeah oh yeah by the way i i think the biggest degens in this space are the no coiners they just are so obsessed with the damn price of these things going up and down and get so irate when one number go up they're the worst and stuff but hopefully i can get them to change their opinion keep representing and uh we appreciate it thank you for like being a bridge once again between traditional finance and and crypto um you're welcome on anytime we'd love to have you back soon jim thank you thank you i enjoyed it guys written disclaimers of course we have no idea what is going to happen over the next six months over the next six years none of this was financial advice is risky crypto is risky so is d5 you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
