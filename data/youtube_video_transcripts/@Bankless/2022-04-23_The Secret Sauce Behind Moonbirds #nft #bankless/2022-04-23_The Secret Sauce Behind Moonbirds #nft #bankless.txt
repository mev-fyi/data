going to talk about moon birds which is absolutely living up to its name is absolutely mooning for me this is like what i love to do the scariest part was the sale what i love to do is build products and that's what i have done my entire career so going out and building products for this community is just going to be a blast it's it's my favorite thing on earth how did you do it what is the secret combination to success here it's a it's a good question honestly i didn't expect it i feel very fortunate that people trust what we're about to embark upon and what we're going to build and then once it went out we had no clue what the secondary volume was going to be if you had asked me the day of i probably would have said well we'll end up at around you know two eighth or so and then it immediately show up to five and then 10 then 15 and then it just kept climbing so it was shocking but i do realize it's not lost on me that there is a lot of hype here and so it's on us now to go build and really fulfill everything that we the roadmap that we've put out there
