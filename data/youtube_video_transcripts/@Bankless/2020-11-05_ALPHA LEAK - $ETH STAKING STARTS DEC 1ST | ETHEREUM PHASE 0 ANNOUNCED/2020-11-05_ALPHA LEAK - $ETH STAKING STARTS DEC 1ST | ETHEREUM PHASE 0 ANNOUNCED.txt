if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallets i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wire wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways but a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on d5 and d5 is producing the best interest rate whether it's dytx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stablecoins automatically so you don't have to check them out at why earn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well welcome bankless nation this is a special episode that we're bringing to you on youtube we are bringing to you on the podcast this is alpha leak david we only do alpha leaks when something alpha happens when we know that there is something that you want to know about and you need to react to quickly a major type of event what is this alpha leak today man the alpha leak that we are talking about today is something that i think we've seen coming a long way off but that doesn't change how big of a deal it is today alpha leaks are when we just need to drop everything and get into the content production mode to talk about this what's going on and what is going on is the ethereum 2.0 phase zero deposit contract has been announced starting on december 1st is the first the december 1st could be the day that phase 0 goes live so there's a lot of conversations to be had about how to prepare for this we all want to be a part of the group that helps ethereum 2.0 get off the ground and so this this podcast episode this youtube video depending on where you're watching it is going to help you understand what the hell is going on with the deposit contract with phase zero and how you can help grow ethereum 2.0 starting on december 1st it could be as soon as december 1st absolutely we want you to be able to find the alpha in the midst of all this so we're doing two things first we're going to give you kind of an overview of what is happening what just went on the significance of it how to stake how can you stake from your home what are the risks um what are the rewards all of those details as part of this alpha leak episode as well so with that david we should just get right into it man it was like i was having kind of a a rough day you know not knowing who the president is and everything else like this morning when i woke up uncertainty it's something that you talked about on uh monday's post on bank list that hey like this election could go one way or the other but the worst outcome is uncertainty and we got the worst outcome didn't we and then i got a very uh cheering message from someone i saw on twitter that the eth2 staking contract has been announced so the eth2 staking contract has actually gone live more than been announced gone live with a specific block time and we'll get into what that means but high level this is what we've talked about for a long time uh dave this is ethereum's initial bond offering so think of this ethereum right now is the largest non-sovereign global economy a decentralized economy that the world is ever seen and they're getting ready to issue a bond that's how i see it we talked so many times before david about the triple point asset ether being a triple point asset like it can you can you can use it as a commodity pay for gas you can you can use it as money as a store value of collateral and defy well this is that third point right this is using ether as a capital asset to actually generate returns for you and it's finally going live i feel like i've been here like waiting forever but it's it's finally happening so yeah what like where were you what was your take when you heard this news yeah this it happened this morning except it started to happen yesterday and a lot of people that really pay attention to the intricate details of ethereum started to figure this out and people noticed this by the eth depositcontract.ethens address getting deployed to an address that had a bunch of zeros and there is significance to an address that has a bunch of zeros because those aren't easy to find right and so there was a lot of some behind the scenes like what's going on here like deposit contract.e that's a real thing uh and then the next day the day the day after election day which is the craziest time to announce the launch of phase zero uh we get an official announcement from the ethereum.org site a new website on ethereum.org that shows you how to be a validator on east 2. uh so all these things happen at once which is did you predict this though i feel like a few episodes ago you were just calling i came pretty close i came pretty close i predicted uh a week and a half ago that the that this last monday a date would be announced and it happened on wednesday morning so i was off by two days not too bad that is super close that is not too bad so what's been the reaction in crypto twitter can you talk about it so like i put tweets out i feel like you put you put tweets out the entire community is celebrating this this is uh spencer noon he had to take like this is a big deal i think is is basically the summary of what he's saying here um it was enough to get eric connor back on twitter eric connor's out of bed like welcome back eric connor to twitter we'll see how long he stays here i'm not sure he's in the move to save for the whole bull run yeah probably i'm glad eric connor's back to help lead us into ethereum 2.0 he's a great community manager uh if that's what he's here to do then then absolutely um yeah so it's and you know your question about how did twitter react to this um it was mixed and that you know and it's a little bit frustrating because there's a bunch of you know very deep core ethereum people that have been paying attention to this for a while and to these people people people like you and me ryan like you know at some point this is just not a surprise like yeah we knew this was coming from a long way off we never had any doubts that this would actually be here we did have doubts about when but we also were able to talk to people we've had danny ryan on the bankless program like twice in two different capacities now uh we've had a bunch of just e 2.0 talk we've been seeing what's been coming right so vitalik a couple weeks ago he said yeah it's it's coming coming in 2020 the end of the year right we've got two months left in 2020 of course right and so like some people are surprised but like i think the people that are paying attention the most are just like oh yeah like this this is it it's it's very much later than we thought and now it's here okay so ethereum community is celebrating i i think one one take on this is like for to me you know like being the space being you being in the space mainstream media is not going to pick this up like they have no idea what's going on crypto media yeah they'll pick it up but there'll be a generalized crypto media yeah yes there'll be a slant from kind of like is this that big of a deal i think this is the most significant event clearly to happen this year right maybe it's the most significant event in the last five years like this is a big deal but bigger than paypal yes bigger than paper like you don't see it on you're not going to see it on the any of the mainstream even if they weren't just covering politics 24 7 these days this is below the radar that shows how early we truly are like this this is a a major event in crypto and no one knows about it right important importantly and i i definitely do want to get to how how and why this is so significant with preston van loon here in a bit but importantly i would like to say that the 2017 bull market was pinned by eth 2.0 being right around the corner turned out that was a little we were disillusioned by that that was a little bit of three years around the corner yeah but but now now we actually have phase zero right we actually have staking staking was a huge bullish undercurrent for the last bull run and now it's actually here or at least it will be here on december 1st all right so are we just going to say david like at a price of 400 per each is just stupid silly hilarious yeah i mean so like the market responded by going from 380 east to like four hundred dollar east what what should be priced in right now is uh roi from staking ether ether lockup from staking ether and also may i think perhaps even most bullishly the a complete reduction of execution risk for ethereum 2.0 as a whole and i made a graphic in a previous market monday that talked about the evolution of ethereum 2.0 and how people think that it's like okay first we do phase zero then we do phase one then we do phase two and we're not even at phase zero yet so e2 is a long way off in reality phase zero one and two have all been working in parallel and the teams themselves have been working in parallel learning how to work with each other the progress i think is going to compound so it's not going to be another three years between phase zero and phase one i think it could and and preston in this uh in this episode talks about his his timeline predictions about where phase one is um i think there's overall going to be compounding progress on these fronts that is the david hoffman eath bull that i know coming out once again good to see you i do agree with you that eath is hilarious right i mean so if you're looking for like what's the alpha what's the alpha in today's alpha league it's eve yeah the price of eth is the alpha guys that's the alpha and we we could talk about staking what the returns are but i feel like um in general i don't think eth as an asset uh and the execution risk diminishment that you were talking about is appreciated in the mainstream of course but let alone that the crypto markets so uh we will see how that feeds into price in the coming days but um can we talk about like what what folks should do so what the announcement actually means is that there is now a deposit contract for your eth right um you shouldn't just send if to that deposit contract you have to set up a validator and go through the steps you know one way to do that is to look at some of the guides that we've put together on on bank lists about doing this in test net but there are some like you don't just get free money like in a in a yield farm there's some responsibility that goes within the old farm this is not a yield farm this is the yield farm of all yield farms and it it takes some work so you got to get your hardware together you have to understand a little bit about how the software works you have to secure your private keys there are some steps to this but um let's talk about that date of uh december 1st so in the intro earlier you were talking it looks like december 1st but you didn't say it's absolutely going to be december 1st why did you why did you hedge a little bit right on that right so there is a window of opportunity for many people to deposit 32 eth or more into the deposit contract eth address but we want a sufficient time for people to do that right and this is a big deal like we this isn't some like random you know proof of stake chain that you know got spun up and doesn't really do much other than that this is ethereum and this is also ethereum 2.0 so we're going real slow here and so we're going to have a nice long window for people to deposit 32 eth in order to reach a minimum amount of ether required like we need some sort of like consensus as to like yes we're ready to start ethereum 2.0 and we are signaling that consensus by having roughly half a million ether deposited into the staking contract so we're taking our time to get to there uh we have almost a full month of november to get to that point and if on december 1st we do cross that threshold of half a million ether then we can have the security needed to get the ethereum 2.0 phase 0 chain up and running if we don't hit that threshold by that time it gets kicked out until we do hit that threshold so we have infinite amounts of time to get to that threshold but we aren't starting until we do get to that threshold and then if this hap if that threshold is met at december 1st or later the phase zero of ethereum will start seven days after that threshold is met right and so that is what we can expect that is something i think will we will be frequently talking about on the bankless podcast on the bankless youtube uh so you know prepare for for tweets and for information as we watch this bar march forward into completion david probability that it doesn't hit 524 000 some odd eth before the date required to launch this december 1st what's the probability on that 15 15 percent interesting okay i hope you are uh you're paying 85 likelihood that we get there before the the uh december first date i hope your calculations are better than nate silver my friend my bank list predictions have been pretty pretty local to the actual answer so i'm feeling pretty good about it not bad yeah i would um you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna raise yours i think it's a 95 percent chance 95 i think yep i think it's absolutely it won't take much but let's talk if there's gonna be a prediction market i'm sure there will be absolutely um let's talk about why you would stake though at this stage right so again this is um this is not for everybody we talk about that often right you know this is more risky in some ways in some ways than some of the d5 yield farms that you might be used to in the d5 summer in like in one way particular is because once you push eth into this contract it's a one-way ticket the eth doesn't come back and so there's opportunity cost for your eath if you're doing this like um like you can't do other things with it in defy it's over on the other side it's in the eve too but there's also rewards so why are people doing this what are the rewards dave david so one of the reasons why the d5 summer 2020 yield farming mania was so hype was because of the apy the earnings the yearly earnings rewards that you could get on your assets and sadly ether was kind of left on the sideline with that right like the only really way to get uh yield on your ether was through the y vaults on wiring where people would put their ether and then they would use that and they would put their ether into maker dow to draw a die because it's the dye that got the yield not the ether but ether you could make die with it so by proxy you could get yield on your ether right there's nothing native about ether that allows you to get yield like borrowing and lending rates for ethers are low and what this really gets me excited for and what and why i'm going to be participating in this phase phase zero launch is because this is the first native yield to ether and the best thing about ethereum is that it promises it guarantees maximum assurances to give you this yield right there is ether denominated yield on your ether right and so for if you are an ether maxi this is a perfect product for you if you believe in the upside of ether you don't have to like sell your ether to get yield in something else you can keep your ether and get ether denominated yield on your ether so if you're bullish on ether this is a perfect thing for you to do while you are also serving the ethereum 2.0 network and our upcoming conversation with preston we talk about exact exact amounts it really depends on how many other people stake alongside of you so it could be as high as 20 percent but that could also drop as low as you know six four percent that type of range you know another reason that i want to stake uh at the at the early stage is just to be part of this launch to be honest so look look um dave and i were just talking about how risky it is it is risky so me personally i am absolutely not going to stake my like all of my eth that would that would be imprudent at this stage uh how much you don't have to tell me specifically david think about it i'm just going to do one validator i just want okay so that's what we're talking about guys so don't let the our enthusiasm or the enthusiasm of the community spill over into thinking that this is the best most bulletproof investment opportunity that you've ever heard because not necessarily it's not it's risk reward right exactly this is not a 10 000 apy yield farm this this the whole point of proof of stake and ethereum 2.0 is slow methodical dependable gains similar to a bond market yeah market under a hard asset that's exactly that's exactly it that's it's a bond market under a hard asset it's like a t bill you don't like you're not you're not gambling you buy tesla if you want to gamble you don't buy t-bills this is in the future it will be more like that um but right now it's offering high return because it's uh it's a t-bill of a national economy that is just getting started so like an emerging nation that has no history um that's what you're that's what you're doing essentially that's exactly right like the upside the financial upside of of ether is still going to be of capital appreciation of ether the asset not the apy of staking but the apy is just this nice cherry on top if you know what you're doing you're prepared to stake you're prepared to run a node and you're ready to move your eth over yes so like to make that clear i think you were asked on twitter someone was like oh how could like if if this how can i take advantage of the staking opportunity it's like you buy eve yeah you don't necessarily have to buy you don't have to stake you don't have to do anything you could just buy eth um in this like that's parkinson's side still look man this is also a great excuse to buy some cool hardware i think because i know you used to mine right from your house i have actually four miners in my in my apartment right now i'm actually gonna be mining on eth1 and staking on eth2 in the same household wow well fire em up right so and um you know you can run a surprising amount of youth validators on one consumer grade a hardware uh device so that's uh that's a cool opportunity too and then lastly i would say it's just like it's your patriotic duty you know if uh you were here at the very inception you're listening to this this uh show so you're here like why not get involved right why not um why not serve the community a little bit and be part of what we're doing here is we're launching the world's first decentralized economic network for open finance that could serve as a global permissionless banking system for the entire world right and um your kids are going to ask you dad mom where were you when phase zero went live what what where were you standing on your hands watching what else was taking are you gonna you're gonna do it you're gonna tell me my answer that you staked on on day one i that's what i'm mistaken day one yep ah that's gonna be my answer so you do do this stuff for posterity too all right there there are some if you're

we've had a bunch of experimentation and innovation defy and now it's ethereum the main chains turn like uh just along the lines of like roll-ups does also ethereum 2.0 and phase zero bring its own innovations which i'm i'm really excited about and it's just making me really bullish dude yeah that's really bullish i can tell i can tell there's so many people have put so many hours of labor into ethereum 2.0 so i think we want to talk about like what does that actually turn into and you know some some people make may consider this a controversial uh statement but like when you when a bunch of very very smart dedicated people believe in something and pour an absolute magnitude of man-hours into something i expect that that thing would be valuable right and this is something that i'm going to be looking to the secondary markets to really signal if that if that is a valid take or not and this is why we think ether is undervalued and interestingly ryan is that you know there's a bunch of conflating data here like we're also looking at the crypto markets during the u.s election uh yes the spx the the uh s p 500 index is also moving bullish bullishly upwards but like we had this uh on november 3rd election day we had that what we what i was talking about earlier which was the movement of the ens domain deposit contract.eth a lot of people started to figure it out and ether price jumped from 380 to 400 right and bitcoin price jumped from 3 13 700 to 14 000 right then and there uh and that to me like crypto markets have actually been uncorrelated the last two days and so to me that signaled that bitcoin price moved upwards on the uh rumor of of phase zero so you think bitcoin is maybe going to follow eth a little bit and and i showed some signs of that uh yesterday right starting yeah i showed some showed some signs yesterday and then i i got into a debate with nick carter and he was like you know what did he say i i said i said like you know the reason why bitcoin is moving on to 1400 is because of ethereum two deposit contracting goes like why would that impact bitcoin and i i said well i don't really know but like look at the charts they're happening at the same time and then this got repeated again today where we first it was a rumor and then it was the official ethereum.org site and all the people in who are working on ethereum 2.0 like all said like yeah this looks legit and then ether price moon from from 400 from it went back down to 390 and then it moved up to like 410 415 and then bitcoin price blasted through 14 14k is that 14 200. and again conflating variables spx is also mooning but i think bitcoin's moon and because of ethereum man and it's always done this it's always been this like the 2017 bitcoin all-time high was the ico mania on ethereum and bitcoin moving past 10k was as a result of defy summer in in ethereum and now bitcoin moving through 14k happened when the ethereum 2.0 staking contract got locked or got announced and so like i i'm a fan of conspiracy theories in my conspiracy theory is that bitcoin moves when cool things happen on ethereum oh yeah and i think that's like for me that's like that's not a conspiracy theory that's like what we see empirically and those instances sometimes bitcoin moves lots of time bitcoin moves and then eats follows but sometimes eth moves and then bitcoin follows i think some people are unwilling to accept the the latter uh or the the eth leading because they feel like it's the tail wagging the dog a little bit right and they're like no bitcoin is the dog right and ether is the tail and you follow me and i'm not sure that they're right about that i see the evidence for that right i know regardless look bitcoin does well eve does well each does well bitcoin does well this is true you should buy both that's the final alpha leak right here yeah but you can't stake your bitcoin so you can't that's that's david flipping uh eath bowl again so hey man i've always been an easy excited all right dude so um what do we got next so this is alpha leak what what can folks do now what um kind of resources are we going to provide for them you want to start with the the rocket pool resource that we have yeah so rocket pool is something i i that i have close dear to my heart and the reason why i say that is because rocket pool uh of all the other projects on ethereum yield farms defy apps whatever rocket pool's a little different because it's related to the core infrastructure of the ethereum blockchain it doesn't it doesn't actually have any code in the l1 itself it's like not a natively built system but it does operate impacting the actual fundamentals of the ethereum blockchain right and whatever what rocket pools are is are staking pools you know the we have a theory that ether is going to be really valuable one day and that means 32 ether to stake might be like out of reach for a large amount of people and so rocket pool is a staking pool where people with less than 32 eats can come together to stake on a single node and this is really good for for decentralization of ethereum in two different or in two different ways it decentralizes the nodes by incentivizing more total nodes and also decentralizes the set of possible staking individuals so it really is increasing decentralization on two separate fronts in one product there's a fantastic video with uh david rugendyk who did a we were talking about the end at the end of the interview about how efficient we were with the interview there's really good information in there and so if you're looking for more information there's going to be a link somewhere in this youtube video in the corner here where you can click and it'll take you right there uh some some definitely some some it's a juicy info there absolutely uh so if you've heard everything we've talked about so far you're still interested in staking but you don't have 32 eth you want to stick less than 32 you don't want to run your own hardware this is a decentralized way to start staking super cool i'm not sure on the flip side of things however if you are interested in running multiple nodes you can receive your staked ether and then a little bit of a dividend on top of that for allowing other people to stake their ether on your nodes and so you can actually make a little bit more money than just vanilla staking yourself yup pretty cool economics there and they've been doing this for a long time um two other resources that we're coming out with so we've got a uh how to how to become a validator on the e2 test net on bankless we will include a link to that you can look at the test net but we are updating this for mainnet here shortly so we'll have a mainnet version for you as well at some point subscribe to the program you will receive that as well lastly we are putting together a summary of an eth2 economics report that consensus is publishing and we're going to have that for you probably thursday if not early next week hot um yeah it's going to be hot uh we might talk about it on a meet the nation too so anyway lots of resources coming at you on the bankless program that we will be providing david this has been alpha league we've been waiting for this specific alpha leak for years a very long time super exciting man anything else you want to say yeah hey ryan congratulations on making it all the way through the bear market into phase zero right we're just finally here like we did it the days you too yeah you too cheers cheers to everyone who who went on the journey with us and really stuck it out during those you know kind of dark times well right now it's even still even though we had d5 summer it's uh not many tourists in this space it's it's all the people who've been here for the long run and um yeah like tears bear markets are not fun i think we're on the other side of that and uh looking forward to sticking with you guys alongside of you guys all right well risks and disclaimers of course ethan's risky so is eth staking none of this was financial advice guys um you know this is the bankless journey you you know the drill uh you could lose everything that you put in if you're putting it in eath if you're putting it in defy staking so it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the journey this has been our alpha leak eat staking edition
