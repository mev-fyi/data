Kevin Rose has gotten his multi-million dollar nft collection swiped drained so that's that's unfortunate we'll talk about that and we'll also talk about how you can protect your nftas from getting fished uh because if Kevin Rose can get fished you can too bankless Nation it is the fourth Friday of January David what time is it uh it's the Friday bankless weekly roll-up Ryan where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier with coffee I've already had two cups how many are you at uh four or five you know they answered this it's always the same uh I'm pretty regular you know like uh regular coffee drinking old chap is what I am how's your Amber mug it's pretty good it's it's retaining the heat yeah use it all the time this is not a uh this is not an ad it's uh actually it's not an ad no actually um so what happened is my office is like right down the hall from my kitchen and I would go from my office to my kitchen like many times a day to heat up my coffee I mean the most frequent time you would leave your office is to go do that well but think about it right so like three times uh three three uh different coffee heatings per you know cup of coffee times five it's 15 per day anyway my microwave button broke off like completely like disintegrated under the pressure of all of the all the clicks so um I had to order a 3D printer part I'm just getting you printed image of this robot not learned knowing how to like control its own strength and just like snapping off his microwave paddle as it tries to open the door no it's going easy on it but yeah it's it just wasn't built for that kind of uh that kind of pressure anyway we're not talking microwaves or coffee today what are we talking about topics of the week David what are we covering topics of the week Genesis officially filing for chapter 11 that Saga is coming to a close so we discuss the Fallout of course uh sadly in other news Kevin Rose has gotten his multi-million dollar nft collection uh swiped Ryan what else are we going to talk about we're going to talk about the SEC they came in with a big old band Hammer this week Caroline Ellison Gary Wang next a whole bunch of action by the SEC and we're also going to be talking about a fire speech from SEC commissioner Hester purse stay stay tuned for that and doodles migrating to flow pudgy Penguins migrating to arbitrim uniswap migrating to BSC is everybody moving from ethereum David we got to talk about that too and of course we got to remind you to like And subscribe if you enjoyed this episode if you're on YouTube hit that like button subscribe to the channel if you're listening on the podcast player then hit subscribe as well David before we get into this episode gotta talk for a minute about taxes and you know I've always taken the time to talk about crypto tax calculator uh during the last few weeks this time it's your time I'm gonna hand this to you what do you want to tell us about taxes and crypto tax calculator David okay so if you're like me you majored in a discipline that has nothing to do with money or Finance or any and your parents are the same and never taught you about taxes and so you had to figure it out for yourself because crypto was your first entrance into the world of business and finance and also taxes and that probably means you need something like the crypto tax calculator that we are showing on the screen right now because you don't know how to do taxes and so you use something like the crypto tax calculator which there's a link in the show notes to go use to help you sort out your crypto tax nightmare especially as crypto is getting more complex uh first you have ether then you got staked ether wrapped staked ether on arbitrum that is gonna yield farm that is brand new well crypto tax calculator can help you out with all of that it's got all the layer ones all the layer twos many many defy apps 300 000 currencies which I didn't even know we had that many uh and it's as simple as just plugging in your ethereum wallet putting in your transactions and they will do the rest there's a link in the show notes for 30 off for bankless listeners that link that that code is Bank Thirty but if you are bankless premium subscriber you get 40 off from a secret code that is in the bankless nation Discord so go there to get your your tax off how do you how do you like that pitch right that's pretty good guys take it from the psych major not from the business major I think you pitched it better than me my friend uh that's right and I was too excited about it that was actually practical advice uh good job David all right let's get to markets then Bitcoin uh as measured by dollars we still measure Bitcoin in dollars we don't measure it in Bitcoin dollar Maxes um let's see where are we at on the week up or down big up almost big up again start of the week at 22 200 up 9.2 percent to where we are now at twenty three thousand dollars how are we doing this this is like it's three things keep going going up man ah I mean I'm gonna start having to say bear Market with a question mark at the end of it like that's not good let's not get ahead of ourselves it's like four days we'll talk about that uh well I mean it's been three weeks in a row almost double digits you're right you're right uh let's talk eat the price too is that up yes 1530 was where we were last week we're at sixteen hundred dollars a hair above oh a hair below 1600 we were above 1600 a second ago Up 4 point five percent on the week so only up half as much as Bitcoin this week does that mean Bitcoin gained some ground on the old ratio that means we are down below 0.07 on the ratio 0.069 so mad about that data I mean it's just noise brother it's just noise that's outstanding on this ratio oh yeah BTC ratio is like that is a multi-year long long position I'm holding how are you doing that trade it's a like that's compound uh no excuse me yeah okay oh cool uh yeah so um you bet that ratio and holding for the long run right what's your time Rising on that multi-year you say until until the lappening yeah until the the not the flipping okay the lappening which is what double to 2x Bitcoin yeah 2x Bitcoin in market cap so maybe even the third happening who knows okay so what does that mean eth would have to appreciate by what is that 5x and so so if we if ether doubles versus Bitcoin that's the flipping from and then it doubles again versus Bitcoin which is the lapping so that is up 4X from current bitcoin prices is perhaps consider to unwind this trade perhaps but then you'll feel like it's you know only going to go up from there and yeah exactly like I said like ether doesn't stop at the flipping it starts lapping Bitcoin that's that's how it goes can you imagine in this industry on the day that that happens the flipping happens can you imagine it would be the most healthy and Progressive thing to ever I don't think it's going to sound very healthy on like your Twitter feed or my Twitter feed when that day happens but um I'll be feeling okay about it all right global cryptocurrency market cap will be above a trillion above a trillion 1.08 uh trillion dollars yes that's right that's a lot that's a that's a big number yeah and it's pretty big for it like are you hearing anybody saying crypto is dead this cycle yeah Jamie Diamond said it this last week yeah okay well Jamie Diamond's been consistently wrong in crypto from the beginning that's right there's less of that than there was last time around I think I mean yeah there's fewer people saying crypto is dead right that was one of the best things that died in the 2020 to 20 the 2020 bear Market was like no no one after big crypto ethereum Bitcoin came back from that bear Market that was the last time I heard like it could all go to zero like I'm sorry Bitcoin cannot go to zero that won't happen same thing same thing with ether like it's just not going to go to zero I mean a trillion is definitely not dead this is very much alive and yet it somehow feels like would we get to last cycle uh three trillion so like almost four trillion yeah uh no just above just above three just a hair above three it still feels to me like crypto hasn't had its big one yet like it's big big Runner oh God what do you think I mean like if you think of the.com um Bubble for instance and you kind of measure that in in today's dollars that was something like seven to nine billion yeah excuse me trillion in terms of the you know it puts crypto bubbles to shame yeah it was real big yeah and I don't think the stock market yeah yeah I don't think I don't think we're there yet my my mental model for this and yeah I'm there's nowhere I'm not gonna be able to tell if I'm right on this at all but just like okay so we had the 2013 bubble we had the 2017 bubble we had the 2021 bubble to me this is like the crypto engine like tumbling over you know you know when you have an old car and it's like you the and the cylinders tumble and it doesn't start and it tumbles and doesn't start every single bubble is like a tumble but these things are getting bigger and also kind of faster a little bit TBD um but the idea is like we just start to Tumble and Tumble and then the engine starts to rev and then crypto takes over the world yeah well that engine feels like it's revering revving anytime it's about a trillion for sure um all right let's talk about inflation uh what does this chart showing us yeah this is a chart from halprest which is just inflation typically goes down as fast as it comes up so the headline CPI inflation for 1980 peaked at 15 year-over-year and then it slowed at the same rate that it went up for the next three years back down to 0.2 percent so uh this uh I asked how for uh a source on this one and he said it's just like National economic data so it's like pretty pretty damn verifiable the take here is that inflation goes down as fast as it goes up which is while we're still in the early days of data of declining inflation does seem to track so far so basically we went up last summer all the way to nine percent and if we are kind of on the other side of the of the peak here then we can expect over the next 12 months to fall back down to what is the question two this is two percent two percent that's what happens in 2023. yeah I I don't know I mean are we ever going back to two percent sure question well it's all it's all relative so like if we if inflation went down to two percent it would not mean that prices went back to normal like eggs are still going to be like high prices the rate of increase the rate of increase is now stable now which is fine because that is what we need what we are doing with inflation is resetting the denominator and resetting the debt so like debt is too large and so we had to keep on inflating and interest rates makes the debt too hard to pay for and so what what did we do we just cut the value of the dollar in like half and now that's her much more manageable I some I I still somewhat uh wonder if the new normal is going to be above two percent though I mean like it's been two percent for like the 90s right sure kind of the existence of most people's uh adult life I think that has to be about two percent because we have too much debt I think the new normal will be like a three four percent I think that's very possible so we might not get back here let's talk about earnings in crypto crypto revenues David we haven't pulled up crypto fees dot info in a while that's why I wanted to put it on our weekly agenda I don't know when the last time he looked at this was but um tell us what we're looking at for somebody on the roll-up who hasn't seen us pull up crypto fees dot info what are we looking at what does this tell us so there are two things that we're looking at here there's pink and there's white lines on this list of things that generate fees pink are applications like uniswap Ave GMX liquidy white uh non-pink or ethereum binance marching Bitcoin or actually like blockchains so there's different ways to measure this the unit swap fees which are a seven day average of 1.4 million dollars generated over a seven day average so that's per day 1.4 million dollars per day over seven day average is the fees charged by the unit swap protocol uh to traders to go to LPS top line revenue top line revenue ethereum and also Bitcoin and also binance Mark chain are like basically gas fees the fees it takes to transact on the network ethereum is making four million dollars a day over the last seven days on average Finance SMART Train is the next closest profitable blockchain at five a half a million dollars a day followed by Bitcoin at 350 fifty thousand dollars a day wow yeah yeah I mean it's not it's not it's not a zero it's not zero well let's pause here okay so when you say uh top line revenue for ethereum how is it generating this Revenue that's been Precious on that gas fees gas fees yes okay so what's it selling block space block space it sells you the space for you to put the data into the block so you can do your thing because guys blockchains sell blocks is what they do that's the thing that they do and sometimes somehow every single cycle we seem to forget this yeah so what is the difference between so look ethereum is about 4 million in sales per jit day that's how much block space it's selling per day Bitcoin 356 000 worth of block space per day it's actually way higher than I thought it'd be that's higher than you thought yeah but look at the Delta here I mean yeah it's over 10x yeah Bitcoin that's the smart contract premium like Bitcoin is like all right I'll send you Bitcoins and then I'll also open up the lightning channel ethereum is like what you want you want to mince some nfts you want to Mint some tokens you want to take some leverage like what you want to do yeah it's uh it's got more to offer in other words the utility or the value of its block space is worth more yeah it's very high and are there any other layer ones on this so we talked about BNB which is that's always been a little bit weird because it's super centralized but it is producing Revenue yeah and then what do we have coming to number four we have an L2 yeah wow that's the first time I've seen l2's on here optimism coming in at forty thousand dollars a day polygon thirty nine thousand dollars a day arbitrim 128 000 a day these numbers are super low but we also have to remember they don't have to pay for security by in the nature of layer 2 design so coming in uh after uh arbitrum it actually depending on how you measure it uh Solana made less money than arbitrum yesterday but it's made more money over the last seven days I've never thought about it this way but it in a way like if you look at a layer two like optimism kind of like a reseller of ethereum block space Oh yeah that's a yeah that's a good way to put it because it's basically it's kind of like um it's taking the ethereum product block space it's making it more valuable it's adding its value on top of it and then it's reselling that to all the consumers yeah that's that's interesting but okay but the next uh the next closest layer one alternative layer one is Solana with 45 million per day yeah making over the last no no no yeah making less money in the last 24 hours less than optimism less than arbitrum less than uh uh polygon yet it also has to pay for security so the other website that we also go to is moneyprinters dot info I think and you'll just see like the absolute rate of inflation on a lot of things monolithic layer ones we I we will Hammer this into your head blockchain cell blocks they also collect Revenue if they sell if they issue more currency than they collect in Revenue they are inflating and that's bad and for sustainability yeah that's why it's like here's the thing someone in the I think it was YouTube chat the other day when we were doing a live stream it's like why don't you guys talk about why are you guys talking about these other alternative layer ones acting as if they should be valued far less than ethereum I'm like because of this go to this site discrepancy their revenue is down they are not selling their blocks their product is less valuable than even layer twos by definition their product is to not charge fees which makes them fundamentally unsustainable over the long term like the product anybody the construction is broken anyone can sell a product where you're losing money like I I just I don't understand why this is more widely I don't know I I don't know dude okay all right well we are like this we're just dumb East Maxis who don't understand it's just economics it's just basic economics it's just science what's going on with the price of Aptos that's a really good question did you know these fully diluted valuation of Aptos right now is at 16 billion dollars I did know that David did you know did you just further no the fully diluted valuation of coinbase remember that exchange that little exchange is 12 billion Aptos oh my God it was 16 billion dollars when I looked at it yesterday at 18.6 billion dollars look at this chart coinbase The Exchange from 2011 or whenever it got started is at 12 billion dollars who the hell is buying this I think I actually think it's uh I think the inflows are actually coming from Korea this is a 6X from January 8th it's unreal it is an empty blockchain there's nothing going on there there's uh some stats here for you David um the tvl total locked value vanity metric sure uh for Aptos is 58 million dollars that's with an M that's less than most D5 apps on ethereum the valuation is 18 billion the total um locked value on ethereum is 32 billion that's with a B the valuation of ethereum is 196. if you do that math of total locked value divided by fully diluted valuation which you can do that means Aptos is 53x more in terms of its value in the market than ethereum seems like quite a hefty premium I'm having trouble understanding why yeah I'm I'm not one to to be so foolish to short anything in crypto because why would you ever short something where there are just Apes involved you just say manage that really an enticing short you can do it I don't even know how because it's not a token if it was a token on ethereum it'd be easy I don't know I'd have to go do it in some centralized exchange but like would you do if you could if it was trivial for me uh yeah I'd probably throw some pocket change out of napto short yeah just for fun just for the economy just said just to say I did it yeah I just never like never short things because yeah it's always it doesn't matter if it's the most obvious short in crypto history because Apes will liquidate you have you ever seen people do like these angry shorts well they're like the Market's wrong apto shouldn't be this high and they just like Angry short it and they're just right but they're but it doesn't matter because the volatility still liquidates them they might be right like two or three years later right like anyway uh dydx is also rallying the reason why is because they postponed an unlock of tokens that's basically it so that's the dumbest reason tokens it's pretty dumb reason it's not well do we know that this is true because sometimes people that just like to ascribe things sure it does seem like it's true because the news came out where they were like the unlock will now begin December 1st rather than on some other date uh anyway when that happened then the price Rose so yeah that's what we're trading right now cool cool an unlock we can just kick that can down the road but um optimism is up too do you want to yeah optimism is that all-time highs op token uh I'm sure if Arboretum had a token it would probably also be I'm assuming these things will will trade in in parallel with each other optimism coming in at uh almost a 10 billion dollar network uh which is pretty damn crazy uh it's hard to Value these things because like optimism still so what am I looking at here this is coin gecko this is just this is not fully diluted evaluation that's that's market cap valuation yeah so market cap is the discrepancy between the supply of not much Supply on the market not much apply in the market but that's just a function of like how they're just slowly air dropping out their token slowly releasing it right so like there's a lot of locked tokens market cap is something like half a billion but fully diluted valuation is at 10 billion so it's actually technically not unlike Aptos in that there's a very small float and a very high fully diluted valuation but when you buy these things you need to look at the fully diluted valuation because that is the evaluation that you are buying these things at if so if you're a long-term holder at least I hope you are yeah yes yeah yeah but but at least there's real actual Innovation and activity like velodrome on optimism is hitting volume all time highs uh so there's actually like justifiable again uh it is kind of it's like in a much more advanced amm uh it's a little bit it's got kind of a hybrid between um curve and uniswap a little bit but for any token like curve specializes in like to like assets uh bear velodrome is a little bit like unit swap where it's not like a to B assets press assets that aren't supposed to be priced on parity um I did we did an episode with um a few months ago and then after we did the episode the price absolutely moved I'm like why didn't I buy it yeah why didn't you David I died because it's tradition that's why yes it's tradition the the number of times I've done a show on something and like that's kind of bullish and then I don't buy it and then the show goes out and then token prices goes up is that that's happened a handful of times uh definitely it would be by the way guys in case you're listening um if there was a purchase of anything that David made prior to doing a show that would be listed in the disclosures on our website and also mentioned in the show and also mentioned at the beginning of the show yeah so um even if David tried to fake pump and dump us he actually couldn't yeah because we have that in place yeah also that's like not what I'm interested in doing I don't need to do that you don't want to pump a dump you just want to hold for the long term and be boring exactly all right what's coming up next we got some non-boring stuff I got some non-boring stuff yeah so Genesis filing for chapter 11 so that is finally wrapping up we'll talk about that SEC coming in a hot uh Ali Iceberg the mango Market manipulator got charged by the SEC Gary Wang and uh Caroline Ellison charged by the SEC uh nexo charged by the SEC uh lots of things to talk about and then Hester purse of the SEC comes and delivers a fantastic speech which Ryan and I just absolutely gushed over we'll talk about that and then also a bunch of nfts migrating uh uniswap migrating to binance everyone on the Move lots to talk about oh and we'll also talk about how to make sure that you don't get your nfts fished all that and so much more it's going to be a big roll up after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this episode

them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop we said it would happen last week and now it happened Genesis filing for chapter 11. here's the story Genesis owes more than 3.6 billion to top 50 creditors the papers were released we got some more data on this David phillson what's happening with Genesis yeah Genesis Global files for bankruptcy protection and the U.S bankruptcy court for the southern district of New York in the filing uh there were the company published a list of its top 50 unsecured claims so if you are curious of that it's a whopping 3.6 billion dollars to its just its top 50 creditors uh 3.6 billion dollars it's owed are you on that list anywhere David no I'm not okay um I think I am by proxy yeah well I think I think you are joined by many many people who are who are owed that because like again it just turns out yield is just this gravitational black hole and so all the yield that was created in the last few years ended up flowing back into Genesis it was the Keystone of contagion so the list of creditors is going to be large 3.6 billion dollars is owed uh does not say how much they have assets under management that is not a 3.6 dollar hole as a 3.6 dollar amount owed they have some amount of money and they're on their balance sheet that they do have so it's not the whole size uh but what are some of the big ones Miranda core Europe 151 million I don't know what that is Babel Finance I've heard of them 150 million van Eck you know vanity yeah I went to that big institution I went to their talk about too long ago well they're uh out of luck uh 53 million dollars it's a it's a whole big list here and a lot of people affected by this um Genesis literally at the end of the row here but okay so Genesis goes bankrupt but not dcg interestingly crutch is kind of the parent company right of all of this yes so dcg is letting Genesis go into bankruptcy without coming to save it because the whole is probably too big for that to be um for that to to be saved for them to want to do that and so that's also that's also why they are selling coindesk they are did you hear they're selling coindesk because they need they need to raise capital and like apparently I heard like um prices on Twitter like 25 to 30 million I would like to that be really corroborated I think that's just a rumor but the price the speculation on Twitter was like the prices that are being offered for coindesk is 25 to 50 million dollars which is extremely low it's loads who knows how much it's hemorrhaging right yeah I know coindust has a ton of employees should not be profitable yeah well it turns out we all thought the block was not I thought everyone was like oh the block great company like turns out they're not profitable yeah like Anyway gosh imagine having a profitable media uh all right will earn get their money their users uh money back that's the big question and I know Cameron Winklevoss and Winklevoss twins have been all up in this yes this is Cameron Winklevoss with an update on earn this is the big question it means like 900 million dollars almost a billion dollars of retail funds in uh Gemini earn will investors well I guess investors will people get their money back David um so TBD so quote from Cameron winkloss is that Gemini Genesis bankruptcy does not insulate Berry dcg or any other wrongdoers from accountability said Cameron Winklevoss Gemini is preparing to take legal action against Barry dcg and others for the fraud so the idea here is that they are saying that fraudulent activity happened it's outside of Genesis it's Barry and all of dcg and so if even if Genesis can't make Gemini earn customer whole we are going to sue dcg and Barry silbert for fraud to get the rest of the money back so with the Winklevoss twins continue to be coming in very hot with accusations of Fraud and we will only be able to tell what the truth is after everyone has their day in court but Gemini twins coming in very hot this is interesting I just uh ran ran them Matthew so 900 million dollars divided by 340 000 earned users according to Cameron Winklevoss it's about an average of 2 600 per user so I mean these are smaller retail types of accounts and that could be somebody's like savings their crypto savings hopefully not their life savings don't invest more than you can afford to lose and certainly don't lend it out to a crypto lender um Gemini laid off 10 percent of Staff amid troubles which by the way is not a lot it's not great compared to like Krakens it's their third round of layoffs in the last eight months uh but like 10 is relatively normal especially when like other like web 2 companies are laying off similarly yeah like totally I mean Google just did a massively coinbase is dumpling us um all right well we're going to continue to talk about this as it as it comes up but uh we got more the SEC band Hammer what are they doing uh SEC charges Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang with defrauding investors in FTX absolutely no surprise there in the press release it's charged that uh Caroline Ellison manipulated the price of ftt by purchasing large quantities on the open market to prop up the price again which was the collateral that much of Alameda and FTX used to borrow with overstated the value of the collateral on the balance sheet led to all of this uh explosion at FTX and over over a crazy amount of risk exposure the complaint stated that Wang created the FTX back door allowing Alameda to divert FDX customers funds and Ellison used Miss appropriate FTX customer funds for alameda's trading strategy I think as these people go through the process of being in court we're going to find out how much did SPF actually know because he claims that he had no idea that Gary Wang had the back door between Alameda and FTX how could he how could he have known that his his exchange and his prop trading desk having a back door with you how could he have known yeah I just impossible to know really you got a feel for the guy uh Caroline Ellison was the former CEO of Alameda right yes and then Gary Wang was the CTO of FTX correct basically operating is the same very incestuous yes all right so that's hit number one from the SEC what about number two Ali elseberg the guy that manipulated the mango markets on Solana and then took that money over to Ave to try and do a short squeeze on curve or something but then he got liquidated blah blah blah blah uh I see I think the AC FTC is going after him too but the SEC charged Avi with Market manipulation uh which is what he definitely did uh Ellsberg is Eisenberg excuse me is in federal prison awaiting transport to New York City uh and the SEC labeled Bingo token as a governance token offered and sold as a security on the crypto platform mango markets so this is perhaps sitting in precedence what is the mango that you said mango markets I think it's like Solana D5 on a thief I think yeah I think it's like a borrowing lending protocol what's funny to me is um I'm like uh the headline is uh this guy apparently stole 116 million of crypto assets I'm like oh that's not that much holy crap it's 116 million what has happened to me yeah I'm like measuring things in the billions for the fraud well remember he was the guy that tweeted out uh we just engaged in an extremely profitable trading strategy and everyone was like bro you stole that money it's called Market manipulation and theft and he tweets about it tweets it well he has he didn't he did it out in the opens like it was a very profitable trading strategy yeah like Market manipulation is profitable do you know like when um when uh YouTube influencers and stuff and like Tick Tock influencers like will literally film the crimes that they're doing you can like post it for clout this is what this guy was doing advertising his uh big wins and it was uh in the form of Market manipulation so that's number two or is this yeah same thing how about uh they hit someone else next up next oh 45 million dollars see charge nexo for failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset lending product uh its interest product uh nexo has agreed to pay the SEC 45 million dollars and have ceased the sale of the earned product to U.S investors this is why nxo said that they were leaving the US market last December citing a dead end in talks with U.S Regulators which is kind of on par with conversations we've already had SEC charged Gemini earn and Genesis last week for the same thing also told coinbase it would sue them if they release coinbase's earned product as well and so this is kind of far in in line with all the other things that the SEC is doing to David so I I feel like um you know lots of times bankless has a lot of scolding for the SEC yeah like we're like what are you guys doing stop doing like what are you doing um can we be mad about some of these actions I mean the SEC uh taking on a market manipulator for the mango token the SEC taking on uh the FTC FDX Executives and doing that I don't know about nexo but like even though she's those two isn't the thing we want the SEC to do is come after like the clear scammers and grifters yes like the bit connect guy from 2017. isn't that where where crypto is basically hey we could use some help in these areas so I I I almost feel like I Want To Praise them for this or like say thank you I can do some of these things and yet David I'm like I'm worried to say that because I don't know what the lines of demarcation actually are right and like it's kind of like oh you give them an inch and they'll take a mile sort of thing and and so I'm just I don't know how to really address this or how to talk about it I don't know if you have any takes on that but um yeah what do you think my take has been what it's always been which is if it can be regulated then it ought to be regulated if there is a central Loki of power that the SEC has the ability to apply pressure to and that works that means that that thing that they're applying pressure to is sufficiently centralized to the point where there is a discrepancy between Public Market information and private actors that means there is a principal agent problem and so it's a little bit kind of judging after the fact like if the SEC can apply pressure then they ought to but that's just what the nature of decentralization is if they know so I I agree with that line right I agree with that line however like so I think you almost have to get even more detailed there sure because that's a guiding principle but like how do we know yeah etherscan can be regulated it is a centralized company right it could be regulated as a broker dealer if we or like infuria for instance are we going to make remember that was actual uh legislation material from SPF we should regulate all of the D5 front ends do you remember this I don't understand that yeah that's a good point so so how do we do this I guess one of my uh and takeaways last week was like a breath of fresh air Pastor purse who is a commissioner uh of the SEC uh gave a speech at a digital assets conference at uh University Duke um and this is just exact like I don't know how to articulate it the way Hester does but the way Hester articulates the role of the SEC with respect to regulation crypto is exactly it's so good what we want it's we should say quotes from this fresh reminder of how things ought to be done by the nature of why they were created in the first place here's a here's a quote uh Hester says crypto's value proposition depends primarily on the Builders of this technology not on The Regulators like me who lack technical expertise and stand on the periphery looking in what a great posture to the space some of these lines are so great what else you got my favorite line here was privately designed and voluntarily implemented Solutions can be both more effective and more tailored because the people driving them better understand the technology and what they are trying to achieve with it iterating and experimenting with private Solutions is easier than it is with regulatory ones moreover private Solutions avoid the systemic risk that comes from an industry homogenizing because everyone has to fit into the same regulatory parameters like mic drop oh my God it's such a powerful like line it's so good it's just also the principles of just like Frontier Innovation always happens when you let the free market do its best and this is what I've seen not necessarily the SEC at large but Gary Gensler really getting in the way of is just like really pushing back the freedom of the frontier to explore and innovate like yes we find trouble on the frontier and then we route around it and you're not going to do that Gary she also says this uh regulatory Solutions which tend to be inflexible should be a last resort not a first Resort I also appreciated David how this speech was also directed to people in crypto yeah uh said this to us to the bankless audience I think people who believe in crypto's future should not wait for Regulators to fix the problems right regulatory Solutions which tend to be inflexible should be a last resort not a first Resort I said that already privately designed and voluntarily implemented Solutions are much better at fixing things than Regulators using their inherently coercive power to impose mandatory Solutions she says later crypto is about solving a trust problem how can you interact and transact safely with people you do not know that is the core of it anyway this whole speech is fantastic and I just like the the posture of a regulator really taking the time to understand our industry what's up if you go to the footnotes David uh look at these footnotes here okay are you able to bring out uh oh sorry go ahead multiple bankless podcasts oh yeah right yeah three three biggest podcasts what's up Hester shout out thanks for listening Taylor Monahan uh YouTube video on the brink episode yeah um podcast we do that's great I mean she's this is what we've asked yeah the SEC and our Regulators to do is like we don't bite engage with the crypto Community we want the scammers out too uh like we want your help to do that so can you take some time to understand to talk to us uh anyway this speech made us once again so excited and so bullish we uh reached out to Hester purse's office and asked if she'd want to come the show and uh I think that's in progress right that she said she said I'd absolutely love to so it has a purse round two people don't know that uh the crypto industry have uh uh warmly dubbed Hester purse crypto mom uh way back when uh for for offering the stances that she's been put forth in here also you know she's a regular listener because she cited our uh is everything a security episode with uh Brian Frye uh so you know you know she's paying attention yeah yeah she she actually mentioned the uh the fifth prong the Howie test Yeah the speech did you read that oh no I missed that part yeah she did she she said and yeah fifth prong the how we test some people have observed is does the SEC want to regulate this right which is like exactly from Brian I mean the only prong of the Howie test anyway uh I'm just Bagless listeners know we give Regulators a hard time sometimes and I think a lot of that's Justified but we want to call out um when they're right and when they're trying to do the right thing and let's keep in mind Regulators are just people they're citizens this is a layer zero type of thing and uh when they're when they're fulfilling their mandate in like for the people uh then I think that's a much healthier place to be so just uh hats off to this particular regulator doing this work and we hope more of them step up and do this in SEC cftc all the government agencies in every jurisdiction around the world and just to really drive this point home the reason why we spent time to talk about this is like we talked about okay the SEC charged Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang with defrauding investors and FTX uh yeah that's good uh charging Ali Alex ellisburg with Market manipulation like yep that's good uh nexo for failing to register like the facts and circumstances it's a black box we don't really know um but like the point is is like the SEC Hester in this article said hey crypto is not a monolith and we need to judge crypto individually by facts and circumstances and I think that's how we should approach the SEC facts and circumstances for every single decision they make and that is what we are trying to do here that's right David Kevin Rose had a real bad day earlier this week here's the headline Kevin Rose's nft wallet with 40 high-value Collectibles was hacked this was a phishing scam David that drained millions of dollars worth of rare tokens a lot of very valuable nfts on this list uh what did what did Kevin lose in this hack yeah so 40 nfts like you said One auto glyph which hurts my soul autographs are such a such a treasure there's not that many of them 25 chromie squiggles which is the first one uh that's a chromey squiggle yeah yeah uh 25 of them uh which is the first art block ever created uh one qql mint pass which I don't know what that is one admit one pass from G money I've got one of those uh a cool cat nft the currency nft by Damien Hurst Quantum key several Unchained monkeys but uh it was nice to see that he owned a zombie crypto Punk extremely rare extremely valuable and that one was saved um but all the other ones were sadly lost to a phishing scam uh the way that this worked is a fraudulent website uh he proved a transaction that transaction uh bundled up all the all the nfts that it was preparing to bundle up and then sent them outbound from Kevin Rose's wallet all in one go uh so quite unfortunate sorry Kevin that is terrible news um and this is just prior to part of the early days of crypto where we still need to work out some of these Kinks this is a problem that only we as an industry can solve do you know that line we say at the end of every show which is you could lose everything basically this sort of thing can happen this was a phishing attempt that got Kevin um this was my take on it David shortly after it happened I said it looks like Kevin Rose just had millions of dollars in assets stolen because he clicked the wrong transaction and how brutal is that you just click the wrong transaction imagine if swiping your credit card at the coffee shop put you at risk for getting your entire bank account drained I think David this is really bad ux honestly it's something that crypto has to fix before it goes mainstream some people say there's ways Kevin could have protected himself for this 100 agree yet if he's a bit more careful and yet he's a seasoned veteran he's probably kicking himself now right um but like this could happen to anyone buddy we know uh in crypto like a simple mistake of I'm signing a transaction that I think is legit from a wallet where I have a lot of different tokens or assets this type of thing can happen right so how do we solve this do you agree with me that this is up to the crypto industry to solve like it's a big ux problem there are things that you can do today to make sure that you never fall victim to this and it's just a matter of taking the extra time and energy to do the thing uh DC put out this this wallet best practice which I thought was uh very very valuable and also it's really the first two points that I think everyone can do if you you are engaging if with a wallet that has a ton of value in it you should consider that when you do something the rest of the things in your wallet might be at risk and so what DC investor is advocating for and which is a great system is that have people people in the nft world do this quite frequently you can see people's like Vault address in their name on openc have a vault address and what that means is like you put all of your high value nfts into that Vault address you send it from your hot wallet to your Vault address like cold storage Cold Storage yes you never ever approve any nft for sale from The Vault address if you would like to sell that nft you send that nft away from the Vault address to a wallet that doesn't have much money in it and then you approve it for sale from the that wallet and what this does is that it only approves things to be sold from that hot wallet so like this is how like if you ever want to sell something on openc or any other nft Marketplace you have to give a smart contract approval to access that specific nft set this is how Kevin got fished he said uh I'll sell this nft I approve what he actually was doing not an open C right some other website some other phishing website right it's probably somebody was like Hey Kevin here's something for free it could have been something like this and so he approved an in bulk are nft outbound transfers from that wallet and then that smart contract did that so what you do is that you only transfer one nft into your wallet that you plan on selling and then you just sell that one nft and then once you're done you send the nft back into the Vault wallet so the Vault wallet never ever approves any smart contract ever permissions to move your nft and so one is literally Fort Knox and then this hot wallet is the one that you can collect all of your you know smart contract STDs is kind of what some people call them STDs yeah yeah so like have you ever gone to like delegate.cash for example this website uh DC Scott it'll show you sometimes like you load up your wallet like I've allowed all of these smart contracts to access my money yeah like most most of the time smart contracts are safe because they're not owned by anyone but if you approve a smart contract to access your money and that smart contract is controlled by someone they can remove all your money all right well so let's double click on this what is delegate.cash should people go do this right now delegate.cash is a way to delegate a a specific authority to have some sort of access to a hot wallet there's also revoke try revoke.cash I think that's the one yeah that's what you're talking about right yeah and that can show you all the permissions that you've enabled for a specific wallet yeah you can unenable unrevoke those yeah yeah definitely definitely some things that you need to do as an early crypto native we're settlers on the frontier here right we're basically beta testing all of these things for the rest of the world and so we get the upside from that we also get the pain when this sort of thing happens so you need to protect yourself it really is the wild west right now and uh I think DC has some valuable ways to fix this also though David back to the kind of the point it's still really bad ux it's bad ux right we have tracked wallets you need smart contract wallets contract wallets and I do think that this will be solved over time but uh we're not ready yet all right David what do we got coming up next coming up next for the rest of the weekly roll up win withdrawals when withdrawals Ryan I would like to withdraw my ether psych know I wouldn't I'm taking forever but my Wormhole hacker is now the fifth biggest owner of staked ether and ethereum nfts are going multi-chain as well as uniswap going on to binance crazy all of this and more as soon as we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this episode possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling arbitrim home both arbitrum 1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to Arbiter Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free all right David when withdrawals when are people going to be able to withdraw their eth from the beacon chain still don't know but we are one step closer a mainnet shadow fork or in full dress rehearsal for system upgrades which has allowed developers to test for Flaws of the withdrawal contract and this so we have done a successful Shadow Fork of the withdrawals contract for Shanghai and so this is like one of the last big things that we needed to get done uh in order to actually do withdrawals on mainnet so this means that we are still on track for a March perhaps uh delivery of the Shanghai hard Fork that is not official do not quote me uh but we're looking good David said March you can quote me quoting David uh unit swap poll just shows 80 support for going to binance BNB chain that is what is this I can't wait for the headline to come out I was like you to swap abandon's ethereum uh we're getting a Unix swap uh on binance so binance is not a layer two on ethereum but it is a evm clone an evm Fork which means it's relatively trivial to deploy a uniswap V3 there since binance actually has real adoption unit swap is like yo let's let's go to binance and so 20 million uni token holders voted yes uh 6 500 uni token so they're doing it yeah voted no and so they're doing it yeah do you care about this it's not bearish for uni token I think the only thing that's really relevant is for the uni token here it doesn't put ethereum under any threat as well it's not they're not migrating and leaving they're just adding um it's adding more it's like the unit swap is on arbitrum it's on optimism it's on polygon and now it's also online finance a story on coinbase of course with a with a unit swap floaty here I don't understand this image David but it's hard to get images for crypto headlines Man true true Wormhole hacker moved 155 million dollars in the biggest shift of stolen funds and months moved it and then also staked a portion of this with Lido started doing some things with it uh so refresh us on the Wormhole hacker made up with made out with like hundreds of millions of dollars in hacking this this bridge protocol it's still live on chain and we could track it of course moving from from place to place uh and now they're active again yeah so Wormhole hack third largest crypto hack in 2022 uh Wormhole is the bridge between ethereum and Solana uh backed by jump and so jump actually filled that hole in in Wormhole uh so they took it they took the hit there to make people whole again 120 000 ether was stolen in February 2022 during the hack so the hacker has now transferred 155 million dollars onto some exchange then went on to swap that around in various D5 protocols the latest on-chain activity has us at 995 000 ether sent to open ocean I don't know that ducks and then converted into each pegged assets like uh State ether and Rob stick ether and then what they did with all of their steak teeth uh is they used it as collateral to borrow 13 million die which they then swapped it for more stake teeth wrapped in it and then wrapped that say Keith again and then borrowed more dye so they are leveraging long on their staked eat they're still a bunch of heat and now they're leveraging it up that uh so they are now the fifth largest holder of steak teeth yes according to uh this tweet right here which is pretty crazy is this threatening at all to eat a protocol like Lido so let's say the authorities say Hey you can no longer um interact protocol can no longer interact with this specific ether dress why because it's a criminal see we find out the hacker is like North Korea or something like this and it gets makes its way in an ofax sanction list this specific address is this threatening to make or is this threatening to lie to it all yeah so I put out a tweet can Lido confiscate this eat the steak teeth turns out the answer is no and I'll go back to what I was saying earlier if it can be regulated then it ought to be regulated and if it cannot be regulated then it's fine uh and so hackers like ethereum doesn't know the difference between a normal good person and a hacker it's just everyone's treated equally and if no protocol has the ability to do anything about that that's just the way that it is and you can bet authorities are watching those uh funds move and waiting for this person to slip up so they can nail them in real life which is uh fine with me nft stuff okay did Doodles just move to the flow blockchain I think so here is a tweet from I think one of the founders of um Doodles black uh the Doodles nft project so why did we choose flow for Doodles 2 and he goes on he States why what's the tldr of why Doodles is moving to um flow they think that they can get better customer user are onboarding using the flow blockchain I think the ux is easier and so newcomers can just get better access to Flow by all the various differences of the flow blockchain my critique of this is always that like yeah of course things like flow are better are more like web 2 and therefore easier for new users because they are web 2 because it's centralized but that's just my that's just last time I heard about flow is in the context of top shots and even top shots was kind of named in this tweet in fact the the flow founder says this is how top shots got to 400 000 people newcomers can create a wallet by signing into Gmail and then buy an nft with a credit card it's like yeah it's like it doesn't okay all right so that I mean that that is interesting right and you you kind of wonder if other nft projects are going to migrate I've you know we've long known that they would migrate off of ethereum main chain of course but the big question is where do they go next right um and it seems like the answer for Doodles was flow I also somewhat wondered David if this was um subsidized I know many blockchains even layer twos but certainly uh alternative layer ones essentially subsidized projects in order to kind of move to their chains so I wonder if some of that was involved um there's a full letter to the community is there any takeaways from this yeah it's just like the Doodles Community knows that they're going to offend a certain set of their cohort of their Community because uh I mean flow is just it's just not crypto aligned it's not crypto native uh yet at the same time uh as an ethereum person we should take this as a signal that our layer twos are not ready to do the things that they will eventually be able to do and so other other systems ones that are more centralized and have compromised have been able to adopt protocols like this because they can just have better onboarding experience so that's great bring on the competition right sure sure Penguins is doing something too what are they up to uh migrating to other ecosystems such as arbitrum polygon and BNB so pudgy Penguins using layer zero which is a cross protocol into a Communications protocol has allowed for cross-chain bridging for little Pudgies one of the derivative projects so that uh you can find little Pudgies across more blockchains this is a take on all of these happenings from Cyrus unesi what's he say yeah he goes as an eth maxi I'm disappointed by this I love the facetious self-leveling of Youth Maxis by the way um as an East Maxie I am disappointed by this but every layer 2 builder needs to read this thread and figure out what type of onboarding and user experience they need to provide if they want to scale to the masses it's just a fair reasonable take it's like hey our layer twos are not as polished as compromised layer ones but they need to be so absolutely David you told me this was big news but I wasn't following it board ape Community launched a new collection apparently an upcoming sewer nft pass what is this it's not no longer upcoming it is released sewer nft pass it's a game called dookie Dash released by yoga labs and in order to access this game users had to hold a sewer pass nft that was free for all board April mutant ape holders so a new nft that was created that was claimable by board ape and munate polders that I can't remember what the uh there the price for one of these nfts started trading on the secondary market and was definitely trivial and definitely non-zero was definitely a good price uh and so uh the game instructs holders to reach a score above zero to validate the sewer pass and then transforms it into a mysterious power source blah blah blah like they okay the wealth effect from board aches and Yuga Labs is absolutely insane because if you are a board apolder you got to Mint a mutant ape you got to Mint a board ape Kennel Club uh you got access to like the other side mint you got the koi the the ape token drop now you got this nft so like a lot of people who are outside like me like looking in at the board apes or like why are those floor prices so high how is the ape coin so high well it's because of the wealth effect like Yuga Labs keeps on air dropping like so much value to the yeah but it seems like the community is really sticking around it doesn't seem like some of these can yeah because they're they're making them Rich dude but we're in the bear market and if everybody was leaving if everybody was pressing the sell button they would no longer be rich it seems like this community is here to stay right because like the dividends you get from holding an ape has been it's like paid for the ape like five times over yeah I'm saying like I'm bullish on any community that is surviving and thriving in this bear market and if that's what this community is doing then it sort of makes me bullish not enough to buy an ape but you know uh what what else are you doing this is um a tweet the board ape Yacht Club uh organization sets a huge legal precedent yesterday for the whole nft Space um what is this huge legal precedent this kind of went unnoticed but you brought it to our attention yeah so in the terms for this uh sewerpass dookie Dash game uh there was a in the fine print by uh minting this nft I believe that says by accepting these terms you are agreeing to resolve any dispute between you and UK Labs through binding individual arbitration rather than in court so I if I'm reading this and not a lawyer but they're saying Hey by participating this you remove your ability to take eucalabs to court for any dispute and then they also finished saying you also waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration against Yuga Labs so that's new out of the nft industry um what's your reaction to this friend I you know the reaction is obviously before minting you're going to get hit with one of these gigantic terms of service agreements from here moving moving on yeah like every every Project's going to have one of these to cover themselves and that makes sense but it's also just like okay well that's back to the legal system how many terms of services have you ever read before like clicking your iPhone update or you know whatever it is um yeah I mean all right cool I guess this to me this is the private Market filling in the holes that things like the SEC and the cftc have left is like they haven't given us any Clarity so teams like Yuga labs are saying like hey in order to participate you can't sue us maybe which like or maybe it's just fine that's fine for me just them covering their ass and it's not like we've created a new governance structure for like board ape holders to settle their disputes amongst one another they're just saying if you click if you meant this thing then you can't sue Yuga which covers them but right uh I mean it's like you it doesn't matter what asset one NF what nft if it if people buy it and then it goes down in price if it goes down enough people Sue it doesn't matter like what the precedent is or like what the grounds are there's like I'm gonna Sue and so like this is just yoga Labs finding a mechanism to protect themselves from that and this is the private Market saying like figuring out when there's lack of clarity or lack of investor protections the people issuing the tokens get to get to determine what the protections are yeah well uh my only take here is I don't know whether it's good or bad but I know it's going to be omnipresent from here I'm sure the Porsche nft collection failed to gain traction man uh what happened people not into Porsche nfts David yeah so Porsche nft Porsche uh or is it Porsche Porsche uh release an nft collection I think like 10 000 of them for selling at a whopping .911 ether permit and what does the nft look like it is a JPEG of a Porsche Porsche it's a JPEG Porsche I love that David and I don't know for sure um because of course of course I'm not a car guy I don't know if you are are you a car guy David I've got uh oh I love cars I would love to tell you about my car I know um because I people bankless listeners know we're huge Sports guys but um we've never had that car conversation oh actually oh I'm not a modern car guy I am an old car guy just like uh it's like your music right you listen to like a lot of the deadline stuff well since we're talking about it I'm gonna go send you a photo and we're gonna talk about my car real quick do I have to do this right now yes you do because you brought it up David I drive a 2015 Honda Odyssey okay I'm not that Honda Odyssey was the car that I was riding in when I was being driven to soccer practice there's no shame in that all right it's a good car I'm sending this to you want to take you from A to B um guys I'm I am anxiously awaiting sorry for the interruption this roll up I'm anxiously awaiting David's car picture wow this looks slick man this looks like something uh old James Bond would right here right can I find this uh let me yeah right right click it and let me share the bankless nation look at that what is this that's my that is a 1972 Volvo p uh 1800 you still own this oh yeah yeah sitting in the garage of my house back in Seattle in real life nft guys I didn't know that that car has been in my family longer than I have no way yeah so this is a family uh yeah not a family family car I have a family car it's all called the Honda honestly I don't know what this is this is not a family car it's an heirloom that's awesome all right guys well that was our car talk so um expect to hear more car talk from bankless in the upcoming episodes uh actually that'll never happen um what do we got next David back on track of course the nft didn't work out anything else to cover uh there was a supply of 7000 and 500 of them I think they sold 900 total uh yeah so or did flop excuse me did flop huh very big flop oh moving on um still made about a thousand ease David some uh interesting news here too uh I think you're gonna have to yeah brand new headline Trump nft holders have been airdropped classified Intel by Donald Trump himself actually no that's a rug uh that headline brought to you by the rug which is a product out of the Dow this is something I think we're gonna try and experiment with but uh the rug is a weekly issue of a it's like the onion of crypto uh aliens invented Bitcoin uh Canadian government sends Ukraine 45 billion dollars of ship chat BT can't rat set right satire for [ __ ] uh it is the it's there some of the headlines are pretty damn funny uh Gemini suspected of being run by one or more evil twins uh if you are not paying attention to the rug there's a link in the show notes you can collect this post on Mirror by the way uh and so moving forward the idea is that we are going to slip in a rug every single weekly roll up and we're going to read that that headline at some point in the time this was the rug this week y'all just got rugged Trump nft holders airdrop classified Intel I think that's pretty funny that's funny and tell some of the news man everyone's getting classified Intel um all right what do we got next uh Peter Thiel wound down his eight year long Bitcoin bet in March of 2022 so he sold pretty damn close to the top uh and a very early supporter of Bitcoin cashed out uh in March of 2022. you know not long after being crazy on the Bitcoin 2022 stage but that's a topic for a different day he uh he held his Bitcoin for eight years so eight years that's a long-term holder he made about 1.8 billion he bought his Bitcoin in 2014 and then just sold it in March at the like good timing March 2022. yeah and then went on a Bitcoin stage and talked about how bullish uh he was on bitcoin later that year was it later that year was it was it actually after he sold might have been at the same time when was Bitcoin Miami is it March 2022 22. maybe he went David you think he went to that conference is like these people are crazy and oh my God it was in April oh it was in April yeah he sold in March and started Shilling in April what was he doing I'd be a little mad at that if I mean if he's if he's gonna buy back into the bottom that's fine like you can't guy held for eight years he's held longer than most people yeah sure like sure sold in March and then went to the conference in April oh Wales what are you gonna do uh all right on releases this week so uh somebody built a really cool protocol I would guess a protocol uh kind of extension it's called proof of Innocence it's built on tornado cash um I think the best way to think about this is it basically enables a tornado cash user which of course David and I are not because we're using no longer and that would be illegal um David once was um and uh what it does is it essentially allows you to cryptographically prove that you or your eth address is not on an ofax sanction list even though you've interacted with tornado cash so the builders are calling this a proof of Innocence protocol it uses cryptography to do this um I think it's brilliant David because of course it is basically ofac and treasury of course um kind of organization under uh treasury there's a sanctions list and what they did was they a blanket banned everyone from using tornado cast that is if your U.S citizen you you couldn't use it and a whole bunch of people said including us what about the legitimate uses of of tornado cash are you saying no one who is an American citizen can have access to on-chain privacy are you saying all of us are criminals and ofax response was like yeah basically that's what we're saying yeah not only that is that probably unconstitutional and possibly on its way to the Supreme Court there are multiple lawsuits one which includes my my co-host David uh going on right now now we have a tool that we can use to cryptographically prove that we are not criminals using tornado cash um I think this is Magic you can view the details if you're interested in this there's a medium post uh in the show notes but my question that the treasury is basically this all right can you unsanction the code now right because if we run this tool and basically prove that we are not uh some of the addresses that you suspect are North Korea or other sanction type addresses that we are just average Americans looking for crypto privacy or maybe or the question to treasury is was this really not about protecting us from criminals and terrorists all along were you trying to do something else that that's the beauty about this whole thing and this is like a this is a statement of speech it's not I don't think it's really about the actual implementation of this code it's about making a point which is that now users can access privacy tools while proving that they're not North Korea or any other illicit actor still have their privacy which is their constitutional right prove that and then prove that they're not a criminal and if ofac doesn't remove this tornado cache now from sanction code it just proves that it wasn't about North Korea in the first place it was about making sure that that they can spy on us uh thanks to the builders for building this thank you photography see cryptographic cryptography is both the solution the problem and the solution to all problems 100 yeah we are cryptography maximalist around here oh God yes Robin Hood has just rolled out a new wallet a new crypto wallet this say is going to be a competitor to metamask and they plan to onboard a million users this way David I think we've got a beta access to this I haven't had a chance to to test it out but Robinhood is very much known for their design and I know we talked to the Robin Hood's founder back in the summer and told us this was coming well now it's now it's finally here I'm excited to have new wallet entrance on the scene because I think I think competition will drive better Solutions uh to to the market so this is great to see and you know those Robin Hood users are going to be super picky uh so like they're not going to accept gas fees or anything like that so like that this wallet has to solve that yeah yeah so um this is built on polygon right now um so they're also going to add support for ethereum and uh there's probably a way to get into in some beta access um and then I think that will release to everyone later in the year David this is a new product from index Co-op what's this Diversified staked eth index it's just basically all of the state t tokens inside of an index that's that well done some of them are risky some of them are less risky uh now they're all together yeah they're all together in one kind of packaged risk love Diversified portfolio that is D5 for you uh Davidson races this week what's this first one centrifuge raised 252 million dollars to add more power to the real world asset Revolution which is a revolution I'm a big fan of uh centrifuge is the system that helps put debt products on chain uh loans Etc uh been around for a while uh long-term cooperation with both maker and Ave to help take real world assets and put that value of real world assets into defy allowing maker Dow to not just be the Central Bank of ethereum but the Central Bank of the whole entire world which is why I'm bullish on it uh we got we got this as well from quick note tell us about this quick node uh 800 million dollar valuation in their series B series B raised 60 million dollars uh basically crypto infrastructure firm providing blockchain development tools um two record quarters in 2022 and revenue grew over 300 last year uh which uh it's wow 300 in 2022. Jesus I know pretty amazing uh get get to see more blockchain infrastructure funding for sure quick notes a good company doing great work guys we have some questions from bankless citizens this week uh the first one let's see who is this from this is from Denton dancing okay dancing in Discord I think we're looking at the question a question on the staking derivative tokens David I'm gonna throw this one to you sure why is there a premium on our eth that is a staking derivative for Rocket pool and a discount on St eth which is a staking derivative for Lido that's the question is it purely that our eth is currently the most decentralized option and less reliant on a single point of failure if all liquid staking derivatives lsds are eventually one to one with eth then what is the benefit of buying or holding our eth essentially what's the benefit of one over the other and is there a benefit to our eth when the gains and staking rewards are essentially canceled out by the premium you pay help us understand these staking derivatives and why they trade with uh different market prices yeah so dancing's intuition was correct our eth has a premium because the costs of decentralization are always higher Lido doesn't it doesn't have a cap on the supply of staked ether because you just come in there's no there's no bond from the stakers so the Lido validators of 29 of them you can come in and you give them your ether and they don't have to put up any sort of bond that's what the role of the light of Dao is with rocketpool the far more decentralized option rocket pool stakers do have to put up a 16 eth Bond so there is a constraint on the supply of Rocket pool staking nodes which limits how much external Ethan come into the system and that is just the cost of decentralization decentralization tends to be costly it tends to be slow and that is why the constraint on on re Supply shows up as a premium on the secondary market and the unconstrained supply of State either from Lido shows up as a discount so it's a little it's a little bit like the difference between die yes which is a little bit harder to scale in usdc which is coinbase can prevent that as yeah right that's exactly right but what about this what about this kind of follow-up question so um what if someone buys our eth is that is that a good idea or like right how does r e equalize to the price of eth is there some Arbitrage opportunity here right so if R1 our eth is like 0.1.01 ether you pay when one ether will net you like 0.99 aren't either so you kind of lose one percent ish at that rate and so what the Dentin is asking is like okay well like you lose one percent right off the bat and at you know five why would I do this with five six seven percent uh returns a year I'm backwards like I'm back like six weeks or something and I have to pay six weeks of my time in order to make up for that so why would I do that well if you want to go in min and are ether by providing a node you actually get that one percent premium so you can rather than buy it mint it mint it yes and so you mint our eth by instead of buying our Ease on the secondary Market you go to Rocket pool deposit your ether and then you get our eth in return and then you can sell that r e for a one percent Arbitrage now that one percent's not that much so you kind of have to do this at scale but that's how you can do that and same thing with with steak teeth if you want to wait until withdrawals which are coming in March in theory they'll say steak teeth is at 0.98 ether you buy one ether worth of steak teeth you get 1.202 each worth when you can later withdraw but yet you are right that essentially the discrepancies between premiums and discounts and also apis will eventually net out because of Arbitrage here's our second question David from Danube and of course this question is in the bankless Discord which is where bankless citizens hang out these days um a question about layer twos question starts this way it seems that every layer 2 starts to create an ecosystem with a different value proposition so you have D Phi on arbitrum and nft community on polygon is strong and optimism has its thing here's the question from Danube do you think that l2s would differentiate themselves in the future based on the value of ecosystem rather than technology so what is it is the differentiator between these l2s is it more on the technical side or is it more in kind of the community in the set of applications that are on top of them I absolutely love this question because this question is talking about Ryan the relationship between culture and code and that is the thing that I think is the coolest thing about this whole entire industry so danubis he's onto something they're on to something that like arbitrum is super D5 focused polygons got this nft community uh our optimism is really focused on this governance model and each one of these things has Downstream effect size to who chooses to do what on each layer two so the culture behind the teams and what the teams decide to build their layer 2 as actually shows up in the communities that come to be built on these things so like optimism is working on this to optimism Collective dual token model for for governance which I think is like the longest term most bullish time Horizon for what we can do in this space is like how can we re-architect human governance and so you'll get a lot of like the regenerative Finance uh uh like uh public goods focused communities on optimism like the defy ecosystem on arbitrum is super hot so you get a lot of the D5 people and a lot of this ultimately comes back down to like how these different layer twos are constructed and so that's one of the bullish like cases for layer twos is that we we have like the idea that every single chain is its own city right like some people like La some people hate New York some people want to live in Seattle like layer twos all have their own culture to all facilitate any sort of demand for any sort of Niche that needs to be that needs to be expressed by the people that live on these things and so that is how I see layer 2 is differentiating themselves based on values rather than technology even though these things have a synergistic relationship it's it's a little bit of both right but I I do think you're right over time the technology itself will become the commodity right all layer twos like just in the way that all cities in the real world adopted similar kind of Standards around roads and kind of their transportation system and all of these things not really that much different from like Chicago versus New York but there were some subtle there are some subtle things that are different that are different I I do think all of these layer twos will kind of collapse on the same best set of Technologies you can even see some of that now with some of the optimistic Roll-Ups being like ah that ZK stuff yeah we'll Implement that when the time is right not yet but but soon and I I do think it'll all just collapse and what you have left is kind of the culture that's what makes Chicago different from San Diego different from New York City different from Austin different from any like oh you know that's the differentiator so I do think that will become more true over time although and this is this is why sorry finish finish that I was just gonna say I I think in the short run technology does matter sure a good bit Yeah and probably more than it will matter in the long long term yeah what uh and this I'll take this moment to chill the op stack uh this is something that optimism is building eopstack is this skeleton so it's like a build a layer 2 workshop and so they have all these modules that you can come and combine into a layer two and so it takes the best of any layer two turns it into a module and you can build a layer two on it and so the op stack is allowing for the expression of any type of layer two and if you build it on the op stack any sort of layer 2 that is built on the op stack actually has synergies and composability benefits and just second order positive consequences that allow these op stack chains to work together which is what optimism is building for like this massive Cambrian explosion of interoperable layer twos layer threes that are all built on the op stack that allow for different technology to come together to allow for some sort of expression on top yeah I'm so bullish it's so awesome it's so sci-fi uh it's pretty exciting by the way I'm speaking of awesome things going on in the community uh what you're seeing now on screen is the bankless nation Discord right this is where we hang out we talk about heading west this is where we head West with bankless Citizens bankless Community members as as a group questions like this get asked all of the time David you are doing something I believe this Friday a special event in the bankless nation Discord tell them about that and uh how can people who are not part of this community join so uh at the time of me speaking newsletters going out on the bankless newsletter that I wrote is called ethereum the economic engine the economic machine I'm super excited about this article and tomorrow which is actually today for the time of listening listening if you are listening on Friday at 3 P.M Eastern we're doing a little q and a session for so everyone that's watched the video or read the article that has questions about the article at 3 pm Eastern we're all going to be all the bankless premium subscribers all the bankless nations are going to be in the stage in Discord and I'll give a short little monologue about the article and unpack it a little bit and then we're going to do a q a session and so for anyone that's got extra questions about the article or anything else I'm sure we'll start talking about whatever that is happening at 3 pm Eastern for every bankless citizen the other cool thing Ryan that happened in the Discord this week we made this channel called RSA David tracking from I want to click on that uh how do we come up with all of the topics for the bank list weekly roll-up well we put them into this channel inside of the bankless HQ Discord the centralized Media Company Discord and then we've created this relaying channel into the bankless nation so the bankless nation can keep tabs on what we're up to and making sure we're still working uh and so somebody so somebody can get our information for car roll up and come up with a different one a better one with better right so everything that we talk about we we just take the link from Twitter from coindesk wherever it is we put it into the into our Discord and then that a bot relays it into the bankless nation Discord and then you can like comment on that and see what we're going to talk about it's like you can you can see what we're going to talk about seven seven uh days ahead of time just because as we have this carbon clone copy of these two different Discord channels that goes it's like it's like a window into HQ that's what we're up to a lot of cool stuff going on here and if you want to become a we're calling them bankless citizens upgrade to bankless premium there's a link in the show notes and what happens is when you join uh you get a link to this Discord and you can catch uh David's talk tomorrow that's that's happening in the bankless Discord all right David we got some takes of the week here's the first one from Amin solimani eth only Rye that's r-a-i Rye was a mistake the staking yield means that borrowing Rye against pure eth will always have some percentage opportunity cost the Rye Redemption rate should almost always be negative to reflect this opportunity cost decentralization is expensive people don't want to pay all right there's some context I think people should understand before reading this tweet the context from my perspective is rye was too much to call it a stable coin it's not tracking the dollar but we'll call it a stable coin a crypto native stable coin that doesn't have any off-chain values so it's completely collateralized and backed by eth um it uses some control theory to do this it's it's sort of the original single collateral die model only fully realized right um amine is he's been in the theorem space for a long time he's kind of a a co-father uh of this Rye protocol right which has been kind of exciting for crypto natives who want like we want our crypto only money right right um this is him kind of waving the white flag and saying like hey this method didn't work out and I think that's a big deal because he's been very bullish on rye um prior to this so that's the context I guess my question here is twofold why do you think amine is waving the red flag uh the white flag on this ride project and what does this mean for the future of crypto native stable coins does this mean we'll never get here because Rye was one of the most promising projects there and it's just like look at the market cap David yeah it's down to like 8 million or so so this is like the supply of dye going down from like almost a hundred thousand a hundred million down to eight million and so like man this isn't working people aren't using it yeah uh he actually follows up with a second tweet that has some elaboration he goes I tried to do uh some casual interest rate manipulation to this set the Redemption rate for positive basically basically he's saying that like ride doesn't work when there's only one collateral and no one wants to take the opportunity cost of using that their ether collateral to Mint Rye when ethers is going up and up and up and up and up uh and so maybe was he a statement maybe it works if you have staked uh derivatives in there instead like if you have steth in it or like R eth maybe it works better yeah so he says that the Rye team has always been doubling tripling quadrupling down on ungovernance as in no governance mechanisms just pure raw cryptography that makes this system work which is admirable and very something that we should always aspire to but he's saying that they went so far down the ungovernance route that they were never able to swap out ether for something like staked ether or anything else because they made their system so rigid and so I think the lesson here is like if you like there is some benefit to having human governance like going so far down the ungovernance it's just ungoverned too soon until you like are ready for homeostasis right or ossification yeah and that's what happened here and so basically there's a massive opportunity cost for people depositing eth it to back Rye because it means they can't stake it so anything else yeah or do anything else it's a much higher cost of capital and it's just the economics don't make sense it's also just like tip of the Hat it's hard to admit you're wrong so Props to a mean I wouldn't be waving the red flag and say oh like the project I'm working on we made a mistake do you ever admit you're wrong David was the last time you admitted you're wrong oh no uh it depends on the context I've admitted that we were wrong about the outlayer one trade but I only emitted it in the short term I still write in the long term I need to reflect on that one a little bit more I got one uh we admitted recently that we shouldn't have had nexo as a Q4 yeah for six weeks yeah yeah yeah but okay but also I'll say like we should be able to have centralized sponsors because centralized products yeah Okay blah blah blah blah there's always like I would always like to justify it in some particular way when I'm look the big takeaway here is I'm kind of worried we will never get sort of a uh crypto native backed stablecoin that's my worry I guess frax is some combo of maybe it's just our hybrid options are the only things remaining for us but I think the decentralized enough approach is underrated here's uh my take David I'll read it out in crypto when our banks fail we don't bail them out it's more painful in the short run yet more healthy in the long run free market this is kind of hard to just say coming out of 2022 right because a lot of people got hit by 2022 including us including many bankless listeners and yet there's an element of like that is short run pain but what it did was it detoxified a bunch of the things that were destined to fail anyway and it it's strengthening our Market rather than the other method that we use in traditional Finance is bailout right we didn't have to bail anybody out the companies that were taking undue risk die can't pay for that risk they paid for it isn't that the way it should be um I think that's good and I I'm hopeful crypto can preserve this sort of thing in the future um we'll be much smarter next time around the appropriate people largely got hit with the penalty for the risk that they took it's not perfect let me just say it's not perfect but I think bailouts would be far worse I totally agree yeah the comfort that is a bailout is toxic towards maturation and growth if you just if you don't have to deal with your consequences you don't ever mature here's uh here's your take David um the bull case for e-staking is no longer that ethereum will be the settlement layer for the internet that's now the base case the new bookcase for eth is that it's the security layer for the entire internet e-staking goes from one dimensional to omnidimensional I think you're talking about eigenlayer here by guessing that correctly I well not specifically eigenlayer but eigenlayer is the one that's pioneering this field of restaking or what I kind of have called Omni dimensional staking where you can take your ether and stake it to ethereum to secure ethereum but you can also take on additional slashing penalties to secure other things as well and also get a yield for that too and so like what do you want to secure an oracle you can restake your eth what do you want to secure a prediction Market you can restake your eth so ether people are think like oh yeah ethereum's gonna be the settlement layer for the internet uh the yield on ether is going to be great I'm going to stake and retire for the rest of my life that's now the bait I'm I'm claiming that ethereum is winning that and is going to win that and so that's not the base case for eth the new bull case for eth is that you also get additional yields for other things that you want to use your ethereum staking for that gives you additional yields and so it's just it's rather than just being ethers only meant for ether staking ether you can stake for anything Omni direct omnidirectional staking I think this new book could be and this should be honestly a bankless article at some point in time because I don't think people fully understand this probably um is the idea I mean it kind of transitions Ethan to kind of the ultimate yes in some ways because the asset yeah you can use it to bond other entire networks as well yes and that's what we're talking about it's like the secure the unit of security for the entire internet yeah and I haven't fully walked through what all that means but um I think it's pretty cool this is why uh this eigenlayer thing has uh captured the imaginations of many many many people all right David what do you bullish on this week uh I'm bullish on this concept which is the subject of my article which is economic equilibrium uh so Ryan the history of steam engines was that we figured out this team has a lot of power and so we tried to harness it for a while and then it would just blow up because we couldn't figure out how to harness it and then we figured out this mechanism called a centrifugal Governor which allowed a too hot engine to cool down and a two-cooled engine to heat up and then that was this mechanism that allowed the steam power to go into actual productive output created this the Industrial Revolution that we know today I am claiming the that that same mechanism of control theory could the controlling of power is what the combination of eip1559 and proof of stake is for ethereum where when gassies remember when gas fees were like 600 gray like all of that value went into proof of work and we actually just lost that value it expended outwards out of ethereum with proof of stake in the ip1559 the ethereum economic machine can recapture that value put it back into the ethereum into the ethereum economy and actually like move forward as an engine and so this is the subject matter of my article it came out yesterday for you Friday listeners and it's also why I'm just so bullish on what I'm calling ethereum triggering the industrial revolution of the internet uh because all of this energy recapture ethereum block space goes into the value of ether ether is the dominant collateral and defy when the value of ether and D5 goes up the downstream wealth effect for all tokens and supply of stable coins also goes up and it's just this recirculating Loop of economic activity that makes the internet Industrial Revolution on its way that's why I'm bullish on yeah that's cool David uh David bullish on Steam Engines steam engine from internet steam engines Cipher Puck to uh steampunk Ryan where do you bulletron I'm really bullish on this proof of Innocence thing uh just some code that we were talking about that earlier in the show all right and um just to recap uh of fact ban tornado cash so and they said anyone who uses tornado cash is obviously a criminal we have to assume and so what did Builders do they developed a way to cryptographically prove that people using tornado cash are not criminals and that's just badass that is like uh Jiu Jitsu against authoritarians I think the authoritarian move is like You Can't Ban it because bad people will do bad things with privacy right and the uh the crypto Builders are out there saying like well no we can use our math and our cryptography to prove um without divulging our privacy that we are not the criminals you think we are uh that's why I'm bullish on I I just think that cryptography and Builders uh and a community with shared values is always going to be able to fight back using the internet against uh authoritarians and against this this further encroachment of our freedom and the reason I'm bullish on that is both because I see it happening that's what the crypto movement is all about and uh also David because honestly it's our only hope as we transition to this digital uh era we have to stay one step ahead of the surveillance State and surveillance corporations and those that would um seek to kind of encroach and control uh so yeah it's so cool when when we see that sort of thing and then you can kind of put the acid test you can throw back to them and say like yeah was this really about what you say it was about protecting us from criminals and terrorists uh or was it about actually you controlling things right right and then that's where the the strong community and the social layer kicks in and it's like yeah tell us like show us like that's why that's why we've always thought of bankless and cryptos more of a social movement than anything else 100 uh anyway that that kind of thing just makes me bullish because I had no idea this sort of thing was feasible and then just somebody spins it out and it's like yep we released this open source code go ahead and use it extend it if you want and then I could tweet like something to you know Janet Yellen the treasury right like hey can we can we use tornado again because we could prove that we're not criminals um anyway it's cool Builders always like four steps ahead of uh you know archaic institutions and for all the people that are suing the Department of Treasury myself included this is just a huge piece of evidence that we get to take to the court and be like I think so look at this look look what we can do uh and so like it's a huge Boon to all the people that are suing the department treasury yeah very cool so thank you all right David meme of the week of the week remember the week boom um roulette table where this is the the scene out of The Hangover except uh all the faces are have been replaced although the wolf pack faces have been replaced by Kyle Davies of three year or Hero's Capital we got Sam Trabuco in the bottom left we've got Sam bakeman freed rolling in a dice we got dokwon uh who is that in the back Barry Silber uh oh of course uh suzu and then uh in the top right corner uh we got Arthur Hayes wait what happened to Arthur he's doing okay well I mean after after fighting the cftc and paying a fine I don't think the guy the guy's in Singapore uh guy's not coming back to America uh each one of these things each one of these people have an X over their face they did not make it yeah uh rip wolf pack with 2022. that's it for you guys okay this is for YouTube only because it is only Visual and this is about the kzg ceremony that is currently going on if you do not know what the kzg ceremony is there is a YouTube video interview that I did with uh Trent Van Epps and Carl of the ethereum foundation basically everyone needs to contribute entropy to this kzg foundation and then there's this like period of time where really fun and cool mechanisms of creating entropy are give like kind of art are Artful ways tasteful ways of creating entropy are also being added into ethereum to unlock eip4844 if you didn't understand that go watch the video but here is a very fun and creative way of creating entropy to add to ethereum and that will come after right after Ryan tells you all about how risky crypto is yeah yeah guys it's super risky okay uh you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
