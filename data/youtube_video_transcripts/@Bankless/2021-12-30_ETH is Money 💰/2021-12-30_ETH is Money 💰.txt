is money and that had a breakout year as well this narrative hit the mainstream so much that i've read this year not not just on the bankless side but industry reports investors talking about eth as an asset class even like bankers talking about youth they refer to it as a monetary asset some even refer to it as an internet bond which uh we've talked about for a long time and all of them refer to eth as a store of value that is now the commonly accepted narrative for ether as an asset that is not just gas it's a store of value asset i think dare i say that the narrative flipped and eth became money and displaced bitcoin as money because bitcoin is now just digital gold like that's what it is when you read the big reports
