Eve went ultrasound last week since the merge we had issued 13 000 ether today seven eight days later The post-merge Ether issuance is seven thousand one hundred we have burned about 6 000 ether in the last seven days we've almost cut out fifty percent of all issuance in the last seven days it's easier to burn ether than it is to issue it and you can recover a significant amount of ether issuance in a short amount of time previously the inflation rate was 0.22 we are now down to point zero eight percent since the merge the less cool thing about it is okay why is this happening why are gas prices like sustaining 30 gray and sometimes getting up to 100 again it's because of a Ponzi Zen crypto thing
