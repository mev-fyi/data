[Music] welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community ethereum is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the ethereum community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero is a podcast that focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with anthony cesano and i always joke that anthony he would submit his own soul as a pr request to ethereum if he had the chance anthony does five 30-minute youtube videos a week and five articles a week all about updates and thoughts about the ethereum ecosystem on his daily grey newsletter and youtube channel in today's conversation with anthony we talk about what he finds meaningful about working for a decentralized protocol how does he find purpose in working for ethereum this leads to a conversation about values and working towards something greater than oneself and ultimately finishes with a broader conversation about why humans form tribes join organized teams and rally around symbols when something like ethereum promises to be around for countless generations being a part of the early bootstrapping phase provides anthony with immense purpose in his life and why he has an unceasing amount of energy to help promote the best of what the space has to offer while i've only met anthony in real life once he is a close friend of mine and it couldn't be more obvious that he's here in crypto for the right reasons so without further ado let's go ahead and get right into the conversation with anthony cesano but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless balancer is a powerful platform for flexible automated market makers typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d5 with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indices but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bankless we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts too much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield in defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using balancers asset managers balancers vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at app.balancer.fi hey anthony what's up hey david how you going yeah pretty good man pretty good excited to do this yeah this should be fun i just actually was listening to the one you did with justin drake yesterday uh the layer zero one you did with justin drake that was quite interesting yeah it was wasn't it um it it took me a while to get to the actual like layer zero part of that conversation because like whenever i talk to justin drake like we both just want to talk about ethereum right so like it took me a while to get to like the actual part of his lifestyle but like once once we did actually get there it was like the perfect model for exactly what i wanted player zero to be it's like oh yeah justin drake is a rebel like he doesn't have any like nation state identity uh his kid is like some some sort of like fractal off of ethereum and it's uh himself uh yeah i thought it was a i thought it was a ton of fun yeah yeah it definitely was i mean i particularly liked the part where he kind of spoke about his changing roles within the ethereum foundation and kind of like how he focuses more on the layer zero these days because i mean that's been obvious from his work uh through kind of like the last 12 months with the ultrasound money meme and things like that but i think the more people at layer zero the better for ethereum um we have like a lot of protocol researchers a lot of people at layer one and layer two but layer zero seems to be sometimes neglected by people and they kind of neglect the importance of it and the importance of a really strong social layer for these things so yeah it's cool to see um kind of like his roles change and kind of he kind of fit into a slide into where he's needed most i guess i think that's actually uh there's some sort of invisible line in the crypto world it's yeah groups and cohorts and communities and individuals that have made it through a bear market and those that haven't uh and i think i think if you if you have a crypto system uh and you really want to be bullish on it on the long term like you need to make it through a bear market right like if you can't if you have if you're a crypto system and you haven't made it through a bear market like you have are actually like not fully tested in your resiliency and your rigidity right and like like the the concept goes like at the end of the day it's the layer zero that supports all of these things mm-hmm yeah i mean i i this is something that i kind of write about and talk about a lot through my work is that i mean vitalik put out an excellent blog post around this where he basically i can't remember the the title of it but he basically described this and basically and said you know you can have all the fancy tech in the world and and kind of all the scalability or whatever you want in the world but if you don't have a strong social layer to resist attack or resist kind of i guess um onslaught from competitors or from like nation states and regulators when we get to that point then you just either kind of like fade into obscurity or you kind of lose the battle there so whereas with i guess chains like bitcoin and ethereum we have these extremely strong social layers and we fight back uh you know people fight for these things they fight against the regulators they fight against fight online and yeah i mean that falls into having to go through a bear market together because in 2018 2019 and even parts of 2020 it was a very brutal time for the ethereum ecosystem uh both from a kind of price perspective of eth which obviously drove a lot of negative sentiment towards ethereum but also from kind of like a use case perspective because in 2017 ethereum's main use case was ico mania and people were kind of like doing all that kind of participating in icos and there was kind of like rumors that east 2 was going to be delivered end of 2017 which never materialized and i think you know we suffered the fallout of that we had like a massive hangover during the bear market but we all came together and we and we kept you know beating on against a really rough current and we got through it in the end which was you know obviously very positive ethereum is now where it is today and you know the eighth price has gone up a lot and think to reflect that and things like that but uh it's not just those kind of things it's the fact that we now have a very very strong community who's basically been through the toughest times together and will stick by ethereum through you know thick and thin it's it's kind of like ethereum faces competition from so many different angles these days but there's a very big reason why you know you and i and a lot of other people in the ecosystem stay on the ethereum track and stay on course and it's not maximalism it's literally this is what we want to see kind of like built this is what the future we want to see is what we want to be a part of and we've been through all this together so we understand that hey you know we can get through this like this is not a death now for ethereum or anything else we can get through this we can we can keep building we can keep innovating and if you don't have that and like so many other chains don't and i'm not talking about the current crop i'm talking about the old crop of of kind of like other other blockchains that didn't have this and never built a social layer like this they've faded into obscurity no one talks about them anymore and there will be blockchains and new chains from kind of like this era that fades in into obscurity once we go into a longer term kind of bear market so i think from that perspective if you take like a long long term view like like you know we both do ethereum is fine i i and ethereum is is thriving it's just that short to medium term there's a lot of noise and you have to kind of like uh get through that and then on the other end i know ethereum is going to be there i even know bitcoin is going to be there but i don't know what else is going to be there i i couldn't say that about pretty much anything else at this point right yeah there's the idea that like you know profit money and profit is made in bull markets but like it's values that are made in in bear markets and like almost by definition like i mean i i didn't sell a single ether in the 2017 peak or the 2018 peak and i just watched it like go down to zero and like just at the same time like i was very much in crypto for profit in 2017 2018 and then like in of course like i would keep on buying ether 2018 watch it go down buy more ether 2019 watch it go down buy more ether watch it go down uh and like but but it was profit motivated right like i knew the thing was going to resurge but like there's still like a difference in people who like tap out of the ecosystem and be like well this isn't making me any money first because like fundamentally this ecosystem is about money like it's it's about a reinvention of money and so no one can really say that they're not profit motivated but like it takes more than just being profit mode to motivated to make it through a bear market right like you also have to have like long-term convictions in the values as to why you're here in the first place right like say what you will about bitcoiners but like they have like non-profit motivated beliefs that they truly definitely believe right um and then always like the profit is the profit motivation is like maybe the energy behind the propagation of those beliefs but like it's gotta start with values and beliefs yeah i mean obviously most people come into this ecosystem if not all um but probably not all but like almost all people come into this ecosystem with kind of like the the goggles on hey i'm gonna make a bit of money especially during a bull market which is fine like there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with speculation it's how crypto is advertised exactly exactly and we wouldn't get like the the on the kind of like um people into this ecosystem that we're seeing right now the onboarding that we're seeing right now without the profit motivation which is completely fine i am i mean i i i did the same thing i came into crypto for many reasons as well i mean when i first bought eth in 2017 i kind of like bought it after reading like one blog post about it i didn't like i i had kind of known about bitcoin 2013 spent some time there but i remember reading one blog post i can't remember whose blog post it was but i read that in early 2017 and then i was like holy this is awesome i'm gonna buy eighth and that's it like i i knew i didn't know about like um the the community i had no no involvement in it i didn't know about the values i didn't know about why ethereum was decentralized whatever i had no context i just bought and then i bought and i kind of learned all about it and then really through 2017 i was making multiple bets it was i wasn't like uh that involved with ethereum to the point where i am today like nowhere near where i am today i was making bets on other chains i even thought i even fell into the meme of oh neo is gonna be the ethereum of china like i fell into that meme i bought neo you know you know what i mean and then my conviction on ethereum and and kind of like my my um evangelism around ethereum only really came to light during the bear market when i wasn't profit motivated anymore and it was more about how can i kind of like build up my social capital here how can i become more involved and see like a brighter future be created and how do i be at the center of this so that's going to happen for every every chain i believe but during a bull market it's kind of hard to separate that signal from the noise i had someone ask me the other day hey like which change do you actually think are going to be around which has substance you know which which of these ecosystems are actually going to be long-term kind of sustainable and i can't answer that right now because it's just there's too much noise um i can obviously as i said ethereum and bitcoin obviously um are guaranteed to be around but the other ones i just don't know just yet even even some of the really popular ones that are getting a lot of attention right now i mean this was the same in 2017 most of them it's the same thing they got attention because the price went up uh they you know and over the bear market they failed to build out an actual ecosystem and they were basically uh relegated to to the to the history books so from that perspective i'm just going to wait and see how it all plays out i don't know when a long-term bear market's going to hit if it ever does considering how much adoption we're seeing and how kind of ingrained crypto is becoming within kind of like normal society i guess or non-crypto society uh but but i guess when i look at these other things and evaluate them i always look at the social layer and if the social layer doesn't kind of like appeal to me or kind of like the community doesn't appeal to me i just won't get involved with it and the text just secondary to that and usually the tech is what dictates the social layer as well at the end of the day because you'll see within bitcoin because bitcoin is such a limited technology it actually lends itself to a limited viewpoint and that attracts a limited kind of set of people those being kind of libertarian digital gold bug type like anti-government type whereas ethereum you have a much more expressive kind of technology and that lends itself to a much more expressive community and then other chains have their own kind of things that they're trying to do and attracts different kinds of people so at the end of the day just like you wouldn't hang out with people that don't share your similar interests in real life you're not going to hang out with the people who don't share your similar values and interest on on you know in crypto it's the same kind of concept to me i want to ask a question on a similar like line of thought line of reasoning but from a completely different angle so you do the daily way which is one newsletter every single every single day uh on do you do you don't do it on the weekends right uh newsletter every weekday and a youtube video you know recapping ethereum every weekday yeah yeah not weekends right now so you you take weekends off good for you uh well every second weekend because uh on saturdays i do an ama in uh two hour ama in the discord channel um and i wouldn't say i take the weekend off i would say i take the weekend to catch up on emails okay okay so perfect that's great context you do a youtube video 30 to 40 minute youtube video every single day you write a blog post every single day every other week and you do an ama and then you also fill up your time with like all this other ethereum stuff and like the impressive thing about like the daily gray is is like not only the level of cons consistency i don't think you've missed a single one but also like your consistent level of energy while doing the the damn things right like so like where dude like where the hell does this come from man like why why i i the funny thing is i often surprise myself i i sometimes you know catch myself and i'm like how am i still so involved with this ecosystem how have i not got bored of it how have i not burnt out um how how do i do this like i ask myself these questions and really i only ever really come back to one answer it's just that i have such a passion for everything that i do for ethereum for this ecosystem and and and the passion for changing the world i guess and and being a big part of that that's what keeps me motivated but it it's also a purpose thing like it gives my life purpose and i mean to get a bit personal here since this is layer zero i struggle with that i struggled very for a very long time personally especially through my teenage years and early twenties uh with depression and with a lot of men different mental issues and stuff like that and i had paranoia i had um uh i was very stressed very anxious about a lot of things i i kind of um uh was just like down in the in the dirt about a lot of things and i think now looking back at it it was because i just didn't feel like i had a purpose i felt like i was just aimless i didn't know what i wanted to do i felt like i was i i you know i had a group of friends that were kind of the same we would just hang out and do nothing like just talk like at mcdonald's and you know eat junk food and that was another part of it as well my diet was shocking so that added to it i was i was overweight and it just like really overweight and it was just like really really bad i kind of put myself into like a super bad head space that kept compounding over time and it just kept getting worse and worse and then um as i said like i discovered bitcoin in 2013 i got pretty pretty involved in terms of like passionate about it learning about it and everything but not but it was mainly profit driven like i was super excited because i was young i was like oh my god i'm gonna make so much money and then you wanted to understand what you were invested in yeah exactly and you know i rode the wave up from like a hundred dollars i bought my first bitcoin to like a thousand dollars or whatever all-time high was back then uh then mt gox collapsed and so did the price of btc and i sold like 400 or something so i still made a little bit of a profit but i had traded away a lot of things because i fell for the scams and the pump and dumps of course as you do um but then through there i guess like i didn't come back into the ecosystem until ethereum in early 2017. but between like 2014 and 2017 i was still in that aimless kind of thing where i was doing a bunch of different stuff i started some companies like it's funny i started like a a clothing company where we did like t-shirts it was like very very kind of like weird stuff i had like a company where we did beard oils and things like that which guess makes more sense for me but i did not have a fun fact right there yeah yeah so i and i think f for what i was trying to do back then i was i was still trying to look for my purpose right something that i could actually put my energy towards and feel happy about and feel accomplished about that uh and would actually make me feel happy and they did there was briefs of brief happiness there but there was no profits made i had co-founders that were really kind of like a kind of air to work with they weren't really pulling their weight and stuff like that um and then i joined like a uh so in between this time the way i was making money is i was a freelance web designer as well just doing like it wasn't anything complex doing like wordpress websites for kind of local businesses and then in 2016 kind of like towards the end of 2016 i i joined a telecommunications company as a cyber security analyst and this was shift work uh but i didn't mind because i was already pretty uh pretty shitty with my sleeping pattern anyway and i'd kind of like stay up to all the hours whatever i was a big gamer through this as well played a lot of world of warcraft especially in the in my earlier years but um and then from there uh that gave me purpose as well like i felt really happy like i was i felt like my life had actually turned for the positive i was making good money you know considering kind of like it was an entry-level role uh and everyone was like super nice but over time given it was a it's a huge corporate kind of company uh that kind of weighed down on things you kind of discover wow okay this is what corporate work is like it's really really you're a cop in the machine right yeah it's it's a grind you're a cog in the machine there's really the only end game is to become a manager and kind of like that's it and and i looking at all the managers there i didn't want to become a manager ever like it looked like the worst possible job ever it doesn't matter how much money there was it wasn't even that much money compared to what what crypto gives you right um but it wasn't even about the money it was about the kind of like the purpose and passion but i think when i discovered ethereum and i guess like the fast forward through all the years that's what finally kind of made me feel like i actually belonged somewhere and i could actually create like a a kind of uh purpose for myself within ethereum and that's why i kind of like i've tried so hard and worked so hard through the years to get to where i am today and what keeps me going is because the thing i'm most scared of scared of is becoming irrelevant kind of like falling into the history books and just becoming a footnote in this revolution i want to be at the forefront of it i'm going to continue to be at the forefront of it for as long as it takes and until we reach like global adoption where i don't matter anymore because there's so many people that you know are involved with it i i still want to be that and i think that is what kind of like drives me the most so all that previous context all that build up and me remembering all of that personally is what keeps me going and keeps me doing this because i really don't want to become irrelevant i really don't want to become kind of just someone who sits in the corner and hey that guy used to be a cool ethereum dude now he doesn't really do anything he made money and now he's just kind of gone away it's funny because i actually i i made enough money to quit uh set being working full time at set and kind of sustain myself now and the thing is i actually just ended up working more because it's never been about the money um besides that at the start when it was profit driven once you have the money this is what i think this is what a lot of people don't understand is like once you have the money like there's only a marginal increase from getting more money and if you're not materialistic i know i have a lot of crap around me but like but like only right behind the camera he promises it's only what the camera can see yeah yeah and you know i buy these things but like i don't buy like i don't have a sports car like a supercar i don't have like fancy clothes or anything like this is like a cheap top from like some some kind of like outlet i don't even know where i bought it from it's and and stuff like that so i'm not like super materialistic like that so i don't think people realize that it's just like a marginal difference once you have the money and from there on you want purpose you want a kind of like reason to continue doing what you're doing and that's always been the case for me the money was a means to an end to sustain myself to be able to do this work um so i think that all taking all that into context and taking all that as kind of like a holistic thing is what keeps me going and what keeps my passion burning but again i still surprise myself because i've been doing this non-stop since 2017 um and i've just increased my workload and i still wake up every day just super charged super kind of like motivated to to get you know to get it to just get at it and do what i can to keep growing myself and growing ethereum um so yeah maybe that's like the the much needed kind of backstory and context to that question so uh i'm a fan of the parallel universes theory where there's like multiple universes and each one's a little bit different and so there's some universe out there where like anthony is actually like a bitcoiner or anthony is you know equally passionate about something unrelated veganism or something something else so why ethereum like why did this anthony pick ethereum to be passionate about yeah yeah it's an interesting question because there's also a parallel universe where i was like a fan of another chain right or something like like eos or like neo or something but i still was like in in the in the dirt there but i think the number one thing for me with ethereum that keeps me so involved and and why i've stuck with it for so long is i mean there's a few different things but i think the the number one thing is that it's it's freedom in its most purest form i believe and i've said this before and i've written about it being ethereum is is freedom and this is because ethereum to me is the only platform right now in terms of smart contract platform and i think we'll continue to be the only one where it is truly truly decentralized where there are kind of like i guess um i wouldn't call them central points of failure but there are parties within the ecosystem that have more kind of influence than others but if we look at the ecosystem holistically and what it is today it is truly decentralized which means it it lets anyone build whatever they want on it right anyone can transact on it there's there's kind of like no it's censorship resistant uh and and and and it's like expressive so uh because of the smart contract language and everything like that and capabilities and and that attracts a certain type of person a certain type of builder and they're ideological about it because there's not really any shortcuts being taken people are trying to do things the right way where they're trying to kind of i mean it's funny because the perfect example of this is what happened with the eth2 beacon chain for example this took many many years of research and development to get to where we are today but i truly do think that the beacon chain is the best proof of stake implementation that has ever been kind of like conceived it is absolutely amazing how elegant the design is and how open it is as well i know that there's a 32 minimum requirement to to validating that is there a per the design spec and that can be lowered in the future but it requires a kind of a few changes there but in saying that you can still validate it um uh you know with these decentralized services that can be built on top there's also others like rocketpool and there's also other services like um ssv which is um uh basically being able to kind of like i guess you could call it delegate your stake but keep your keys which i think is really elegant as well a really elegant way of doing delegated staking as opposed to delegated proof of stake which is which is kind of like um a bit different there but but essentially uh that is kind of like the the i guess like the culmination of everything i love about ethereum is that we didn't take shortcuts we didn't rush it we we didn't kind of like say hey we have to get this out because the market is like heating up and we need to pump each like that that's never been a goal of ethereum's core development it's always been we're going to ship it when it's ready and when we're happy with it and we're not going to rush it to market and that's the same with the later ecosystem that's the same with sharding it's the same with all of the major upgrades like look at one five five nine that thing actually is you know half designed to be an eighth value accrual mechanism right like it's an east pump thing like if you want to be accrued with the language it still took over two years to get it into the network so from that perspective um you know the the core development is actually doing it right and doing it doing it um slowly and not taking any shortcuts whereas a lot of the other kind of like ecosystems they take shortcuts especially to scale they're like you know we're gonna scale by doing this and then we'll decentralize later it's like i don't like that i like decentralization first um focus on the virtues of of um decentralization of kind of like freedom of letting anyone kind of do whatever they want on this platform of being kind of like uh focused on the long-term aspect of this technology rather than the short term uh and that all it lends itself back to you know ethereum being being freedom because anyone can do what they want but um no one's taking shortcuts from from what i see uh some of the apps built on top uh you know taking shortcuts whatever like some there's a lot of scams and stuff like that but if you look at the actual core development of the technology it's taking so long because we haven't taken those short cards and it will continue to take long and i'm in this for the long term so why would i go focus on the short-term kind of things rather than the long-term stuff kind of like that's a bit of a synopsis around i mean this could this conversation go on forever and the answer to that question go on forever but really at the end of the day i just feel like ethereum aligns most with my values of of kind of like freedom making sure that anyone can can kind of like participate in ecosystem with the strongest guarantees of security and decentralization and sensitive censorship resistance rather than and and actually i think this is an important point and then i'll stop rambling here i think the important point is that because the ethereum ecosystem is focused on the long term and focused on resisting kind of like the last boss which is nation states that's what everything's being built for um whereas with other ecosystems i don't see them doing this they're building for scale now at the kind of like sacrifice sacrificing decentralization and that works in most cases but when your enemy your final boss is a nation-state who is going to try and take you down because they don't want you doing this then you need that kind of like level of assurance and level of decentralization and security and it's really only then that you kind of like test these things in their full capacity and and to me that's what i want to kind of work towards i don't want to because you can imagine like if i was involved in another ecosystem for five years and they weren't really decentralized they weren't really secure but they were scalable and whatever and then in five years they kind of like get extreme regulatory pressure they get basically um shut down essentially like for all intensive purposes then what was the point like that the previous five years meant nothing like that the accumulation of all that work meant nothing whereas with ethereum i can have near certainty um it's not always certain but near certainty and ver and a lot of confidence that ethereum can survive basically anything as a network because of that decentralization because anyone can run a full node anyone can validate the network anyone has a copy of the chain and anyone can validate on on the network as well that to me is essentially uh the crux of it is that i'm not building for something that can kind of like go on we'll go about its life for five years and then die i'm building for something that can result well i'm involved with bill and trying to build something that can resist everything and kind of like i mean that one of the design goals of each two was to be world war three resistant so even if the whole world goes to we can still have this network kind of running or at least have copies of this network around that we can bootstrap it again it once you know once you know the kind of like war is over for lack of a better kind of term there so that's what i guess like attracts some of the stuff that attracts me to ethereum so much yeah you took the the transition right out of my mouth so i'm gonna go with that so ethereum is world war three resistant uh if everything goes according to plan uh it will be here until we die and then beyond be even beyond that so like what are you going to do you're just going to do daily gray like newsletters and youtube videos until like you can't talk anymore like is that the plan what's the plan i mean it's funny because actually this falls into something else i i forgot to mention so i had a like plan for myself in early 2018 not so much 2017 once the bear market hit i was like because the reason why i exited bitcoin in 2014 i guess is because the bear market here i was profit motivated worst mistake of my life missed the ethic ico missed everything else you know missed out on kind of like all of that and all that growth of the early days and mr theorem until earlier in 2017 which now seems like uh you know an eternity ago but back then it was kind of like okay i need to stick around this time and and when the bear market hit it's like i need to stick around i need to make sure that i can basically um make a kind of like uh uh make a name for myself you know i know what happens like these things work in cycles i'll just keep investing and i'll be good in a few years i had no certainty of this it was just kind of like a bet that i was making um and that was kind of like a plan that i had for early 2018. i'm like i'm gonna do this for as long as i need to to get to where i want to be and then we'll kind of like figure out once i get there what my next kind of thing is and i still haven't figured out what my next long-term thing is like i'm doing the daily grain stuff and i'm going to keep doing that for the foreseeable future same with like the ethub stuff and all that all that kind of stuff but um generally i don't have like another grand vision like i don't know kind of like what i want to do into the future i know what i'm doing now but um it's kind of like been a weird thing for me lately where i've been like okay i achieved the goals that i set out for myself back in 2018 so where do i go from here um and that was kind of like that that spurred the daily way but i kind of view the daily way as kind of like more of a like i don't know if i call it a hobby but it's more of a kind of thing where i i'm giving back to the ecosystem through it because it's all free and i don't really monetize it or anything like that and it's kind of like a diary for me as well to kind of keep track of what's going on in the ecosystem but but generally um i don't have like that long-term goal now so i would say like for the foreseeable future i'll be doing the daily way and i don't i don't plan to stop that i don't really want to stop doing that at all like as i say like i can't i'm still very passionate about it and i and i i don't want to kind of like stop being and i don't think i'm going to stop being passionate about it for the foreseeable future but there may may come a day where i'm just kind of like okay well you know this is this may not be the best use of my time maybe i should focus on something else and i've been thinking about that as well i have ideas around you know maybe trying to help uh people kind of like find jobs within crypto starting like a not-for-profit profit kind of like job agency or something like that but even that like i mean it's just kind of like where's the best use of my time right now and i think that i'm doing pretty much everything that that i consider to be the best use of my time because not only do i do the daily gray but i do a lot of stuff behind the scenes as well like i talk to a lot of different teams like i do a lot of angel investing i talk i advise a lot of projects i talk to a lot of people all the time so i think it's funny because like i'm both content with what i'm doing now and feel like i'm doing the best that i can be doing but also i have this nagging voice at the back of my head being like hey you could be doing more like there could be something grander that you could be doing um but i haven't exactly kind of figured out what that is just yet yeah one of uh eric connor's metaphors that he's given uh i think he put this out on twitter is like ethereum is like this uh this blob thing which was a reference to this 1950s horror movie about it was terrible apparently never watched it but this blob that ever ever expanding ever like invasive ever growing uh and like sometimes i talk to ryan at about uh just being absolutely drained with like what we do at bank lists and likes it's like if you let it ethereum will like invade every single point of your life and like you'll lose you'll lose touch with your former self and you'll only be your ethereum self but like with you you actually seem to like gain energy with ethereum like you know injecting itself into your into your into your into your brain uh and so like it's kind of weird it's kind of funny just to notice like everyone else like we all get excited about ethereum everyone gets excited about ethereum but like it just you just don't stop it's just like oh you're like pl please absorb me blob like take take all of me and take it off [Laughter] yeah i mean i i think for me the reason why i get more energy as time goes on and as ethereum gets bigger is because i worked so hard during 1819 and 2020 and even to this day to get to where ethereum is today to see this mass adoption happening to see all these things coming to life to see the beacon chain chango live to see layer 2 roll out happening and the fact that i've been kind of talking about this stuff for so long and kind of promote it and kind of trying to kind of like usher it along and the fact that it's finally happening just motivates me even more it gives me more energy it just it just kind of like uh re uh it charges me up every single day when i see these things and and and the amazing thing is that i used to think me being kind of like in the time zone that i mean in australia was a curse because i slept during kind of like the peak of crypto because the u.s it wakes up when i sleep and europe's still awake and everything like that but then i realized it was a blessing because i get to wake up and i get to catch up on everything that happened overnight which is an amazing kind of like boost to my day or start to my day where it's like two to three hours of catching up on all the chats catching up on twitter on all the emails and things like that and everything that's happened and i get to kind of like just experience a whole world all at once like every single morning like you get like eight hours of chatting but you get to consume it in like two hours or even less oh that's interesting exactly and and that like literally charges me up like i i it's amazing like i come to my computer and i look at everything like okay where do i start like oh my god there's so much stuff to do right now and you know there are certain days where it's crazier than others like when some massive launches happened defy summer was was particularly pretty crazy where i'd wake up and it's like okay yams launched okay wi-fi is launched okay this is launched um you know where's the latest kind of food farm and then i'd message my friends and i'd be like hey you know is this safe do i ape in and stuff like that um but outside of that there's also the tech stuff like arbitrary went live when i went up while i was sleeping and i woke up i'm like yes arbitrary is live let's go try it out let's see what's happening let's see what people are saying about it uh and it's because i've been and and what makes it even more exciting when things kind of like go live or where kind of like updates happen is that i talk about it for so long like we i mean we've spoken about one five five nine since day one like eric is a co-author of the aip we spoke about it for a very long time not just eric and i but like you and the rest of kind of like the the um the eth core people that that everyone probably knows by now but we spoke about this for so so long through different market cycles through different sentiment cycles and to finally see go go live i i don't think people that don't have that context would realize just how amazing of a feeling that was and how kind of like not just that the beacon chain going live i spoke about eth2 i mean i'd known about eth2 and staking for such a long time and that went live and you know coming up is the merge as well that's going to be huge we have all the layer twos i mean i've been talking about layer two or thinking about it since day one of this ecosystem because people have been talking about it since then um and roll-ups were kind of relatively new but still talking about that seeing them go live and actually work and do what that you know we've been talking about for so long especially as someone who writes about it every bloody day and does videos about it every day to actually see it materialize dude it's like it's it's a feeling that's just like unmatched really and i think that is is kind of um you know what gives me that energy and what kind of keeps me going and why my energy actually goes up with the crazier this ecosystem gets and also because i know if i take a day off i miss everything like there's no days off in this industry like and that might may not sound appealing to a lot of people because they want to take a day off they want to recharge but i i have a pretty good system now where i can take time time off during kind of like my afternoon and my evening because everyone's asleep this is the beauty of my time zone as well is that once i'm done like by 2 3 p.m you know i have some lunch i'll go for a bike ride i'll spend some time with my fiance i'll watch some kind of shows maybe play some games there's like a cool down period for a little bit uh and then towards the evening i'll do my my newsletter i actually like pick the topic and write my newsletter within an hour at like 10 p.m and then i'll record the refuel i do all that and then at that same time the u.s is waking up so it's kind of like multitask i'll do that and i'll start talking to to to friends and things like that and i'll see twitter get more active and then i go to bed at like 2 a.m or something like that right in the i guess the peak of the u.s but then i'm like okay well i go to bed now i wake up and everything's going to be you know awesome again so yeah yeah yeah and it's funny because like i i had never experienced what it was like to basically live live in the us time zone until uh what august 2019 when i went to see the set team after i joined set in july of 2019 and it was completely different i didn't like it i hated it i woke up and there was nothing like i was sat there and i'm like nothing happened like what the hell like where's all the updates um and it'd just be boring so i'm actually and this is another reason people ask me like why don't you move to a more favorable time zone why don't you move somewhere else it's like i don't think that's more favorable than what i have now like i don't think i'd be able to do what i do without the the kind of routine that i have now it's just it's awesome like really and i don't know there's probably some australians that will listen to you and even asia as well similar time zone that will probably um know what i'm talking about but for anyone who has never experienced kind of like that yeah the time zone thing yeah you just don't know how awesome it is to wake up to just like a flood of information and and get to absorb it because i mean for personally this is how i learn as well i overload my brain with things um like to the point where uh i need to basically keep just like reading stuff over and over again and overloading my brain with the same information to get to a point i i'm not a structured learner i can't just sit there and read something and be like okay i'm going to study this and that i'm going to absorb it it's kind of like yes give me all the information right and my brain will make sense of it as time goes on i don't care uh it's just crazy i mean i have six monitors in front of me and i have information everywhere because i just want all of it fed to me at all times and maybe that doesn't work for a lot of people but it works for me and that's i think a big reason why yeah the energy can kind of like uh keep going up as this ecosystem gets crazier so one thing i've noticed about you uh and like you you talked about like before you got into ethereum and and in your in your formative years like you had like you know mental health issues like depression anxiety and like you know uh issues like that tend to bring along further issues right uh there's like they come in they come in groups right uh and like i also know that you listen to extremely uh in my mind these are my words but like violent like death metal maybe is that the right maybe that's not the right genre right and so like you you sent me a song and it's just like this guy is like screaming at you and he's like screaming his guitar at you and then you like you said you you have like six monitors and monitors in front in front of you uh and like you do the daily guay every single day and then like when you talk about aetherium like you can feel the excitement and feel like and you you want i can watch your brain try and go in like four different directions at once and you somehow manage to like hit every single one of them so like i think that i think you have like a pretty decent harness on like a pretty good like manic side of you and you've been able to like cur like corral that and like inject that energy into like well okay i've got i've got like this like you know moderately not too crazy manic side of me and i'm just going to be manic about ethereum like to me that's kind of like your branding is like anthony cesano manic about ethereum yeah i mean that's that's actually a perfect way to put it and you you know it it's funny you've you've actually hit the nail on the head that's exactly kind of just what i'm like i just i and maybe a lot of people aren't like this where they need to be calm wanting to kind of like have a cool down period i'm just like go go go all the time i need to overload my brain with as much kind of stimuli as possible to to be at my best and and that's because my brain is always just look behind you look how many colors there are there are so many things yeah yeah exactly exactly and i think that that definitely stems from that just like a constant need to have stuff around me have things going on i can't sit still for very long uh even when i'm watching kind of like tv shows on my pc or something like that because i really do love a good story and i love tv shows and love watching stuff but um generally i just have other stuff going on as well like i can't really focus and maybe that's a that's a little bit of a curse is that i can't like focus focus but um you know i i still i think for me like and this is exactly actually why it's another issue is that i i have struggled kind of like relating to people talking to people when it's not talking about something that i want to talk about like at conferences is amazing because i get to talk about crypto the whole time but if i go out with like some old friends and we just talk about stuff within like an hour i am done man like i am exhausted like i'm actually tired from that conversation because it hasn't stimulated me it hasn't actually yeah you got tired for the first time in your week yeah exactly i just i feel tired i feel like just bored i'm just like wow okay this is just like such a waste of time and my brain's just shutting off and it's just it's really amazing how quickly it happens so uh yeah i mean you hit the nail on the head i have like this kind of manic stuff where my brain goes in all these different directions all the time and i try to piece it together in my brain like it's uh commonly on the refuel because it's it's not scripted it's just like a stream of consciousness i will commonly have to correct stop myself and be like okay wait wait i need to give this context first before i jump to this because my brain has already gone to the point where i want to be but i need to kind of slow it down and that's kind of become faster than the mouth exactly and that's kind of become like an acquired skill that i had to to kind of like teach myself because i realized that when i talked to a lot of people i skipped a lot of much-needed context uh and that was definitely like a hard part for me to kind of like come to terms with but i think it's yeah it's definitely needed um but yeah it's just funny how it happened because i don't think i've always been like this i think it kind of just happened naturally as i looked for more of a kind of like purpose in life and and like more of a passion it's just that i i become obsessive with things and i kind of engross myself in them and if they don't catch my attention then i just like i'm not interested at all and i think this is why right now like a lot of people kind of tell me stuff and they're kind of like hey you couldn't kind of like do this you could yield farm here you can you can make money here at this point in time i'm just not interested in making more money like i you know i got to the point where i don't need to to kind of like make more money i can sustain myself um yeah okay more money's you know always fun and whatever but i i don't that's not the stuff that kind of motivates me anymore it's not the stuff that makes me passionate anymore i need the the stimuli that actually kind of like wakes my brain up and makes me want to focus on things um so i kind of like tune that stuff out and and for a lot of new people i don't blame them for wanting to do that you know yield farm make money like that's all well and good but at the end of the day there's a lot more to life than money right yeah everyone gets into this industry or or even just like gets into their life with like their focus on money right like go through college graduate college maybe they don't go to college whatever but like you start off life like focusing on money and like you said at the beginning like once you have some threshold of money like having that translated into actual happiness gets harder and harder and harder right like i got myself a an apartment that makes me happy and like i got i got a fun car that and after that it's like well i guess i could get a like the next thing to like add to my life could be like a boat i guess but that was so much more money and it's not that great like i worked on docks when i was when i was young uh my is my summer uh summer job in college maintaining a bose is like a huge pain you so you don't want a boat you don't want to vote at all like no that's that like maybe it's cool but like the value the how hard you had to work for it because like you know boats are orders of magnitude more uh and like insert any noun here right they're just more orders of magnitude like more expensive than like the typical things like an apartment in a car um and then like what you get out of it is actually not that much and so like you actually have to like reorient your attention if you because like the whole point of life is to like feel good right like feel good and however however that is done whether you like are hedonistic and you like drugs or you're altruistic and you like helping people the whole point of life is is to feel good uh and like money only goes so far with that right like the diminishing returns hit real real soon mm-hmm yeah and i mean it is this kind of probably a perfect segue into into i'm not segue but like a perfect kind of thing to to kind of bring up like who's the interviewer here no no i mean what you were talking about got me thinking back to like i guess my grand thesis on just life in general and it's that i believe that we're all born with like a massive hole in ourselves and we try to fill that hole with things right different people try to fill it with different things that make them happy as you as you said some people will fill it with religion some people will fill it with money some people will fill it with materialistic possessions some people will fill it with fill it with family and friends whatever but there's filling the hole for the short term and then there's filling the hole for the long term so you can put short term stuff in there and that may give you some kind of like very short term happiness and and whatever like i'll be honest some of the stuff that i buy i buy and i'm just like okay well that gave me some happiness but like that's not going to sustain me like i can't stare at the stuff that i buy and be like yes i'm content with life now you know what i mean like it's just and then for me i fill that hole with with ethereum with crypto with my work that i do um but other people fill it with with other sorts of things and i think that too many people fill it with short-term stuff and expect that to keep them going because you know the funny thing is with the short-term stuff is you can keep compounding that but the thing is you have diminishing returns you can buy something short-term happiness okay well now i'm gonna buy another thing to get that happiness again but each time you do it you have diminishing returns and that's why i think a lot of people fall into a place where they're depressed they're sad they're not even content with life they're just like aimlessly going through it with no purpose or goal you know some people turn to alcohol and drugs as well and get like really bad advices and addictions and it's and once you once you fall into that it's very hard to get yourself out of it like it took me a long time to get myself out of it to get to lose the weight that i put on which is a big factor and as well diet plays a massive factor in this um but to get my head space right it took a very long time and i kept trying to fill it with short-term things i kept trying to buy new stuff and and do do things and become obsessive with the wrong things and it never led to any long-term happiness it always led to short-term kind of uh stuff that you know while good while i was experiencing it i paid the price later for that like i paid the price of of um you know just destroying my diet in the fact that i just had really bad mental issues i looked bad trying on clothes is always like really depressing whenever i went shopping having to go to like the double xl section and just like super super depressing um so you there's nothing for free really i mean you you kind of like pay the price for your decisions and you pay the consequences for them so make better decisions and feel your fill that hole and with better long-term stuff that you actually enjoy doing and you can sustain yourself sustaining over the long term and you'll be fine um but on the flip side of that unfortunately i think a lot of people just don't have that like they just don't have the ability to basically fill that hole with something that's long term because they uh either just don't want to put in the work to do it or they're probably not fundamentally wired that way and it's quite sad because i know a lot of people who are fundamentally not wired in a way where they can actually be passionate about something or at least as passionate about as i am with ethereum um and i just think that if you're not like that then you have to look at look for other ways to kind of like give yourself long-term happiness and there's no wrong or right way it's just the consequences of that like are the consequences good for you or are they bad for you does it lead to more happiness or does it lead to you know less happiness and i think a lot of people fill this hole with with having a family which is totally fine but like is that go is that what you actually wanted like is that actually going to lead to long-term and i'm talking like long happiness or are you just going to breeze through life and eventually get to your deathbed and look back on your life and be like wow like i didn't really do much and you know that's that's like i'm not happy with the way my life went that is actually something that's very scary to me i don't want to get to the point where i'm lying there and it's like my final kind of like days and i kind of look back on my whole life and be like wow i did what did i do yeah what did i do like i'm so and just you know i'm just so depressed so sad and not just for me but for like everyone around me they just you know everyone that i care about everyone that cares about me they kind of look at it and it's like what did he do did he just waste his life away and and whatever um and i i think you know there's there's there's some people there's a lot of people that aren't like that they're just trying to kind of like i think it's like a privileged position to you know the funny thing is for a lot of um humans humanity's history it was not about like this kind of like filling your hole with like these grand goals it was more like fill that hole with food and water and surviving because you're a farmer and and your village is going to get attacked if you not if you don't defend it and stuff like that um and that's true for a lot of the world still today like i'm talking from a privileged first world position but i also think that the fact that we've kind of like had all that stuff taken care of for us now a lot of people struggle with that transition because we don't have to worry about surviving in the first world a lot of us we don't have to worry about where our food is coming from we we you know we're we're content with a lot of this stuff we're fed all this stimuli we've fed all this kind of um all this stuff and all this we're kind of like babied through through life a lot of the time if you're a first world if you're middle class you're babied through life a lot of the time honestly compared to someone in a third world country so from that shout out to stimulus checks yeah exactly stuff like that you know what i mean like and from that point of view and for that perspective people just kind of like get going to and this is why depression and mental kind of like issues are on the rise is because people just don't know what to do once everything is already done for them like they're like where do i go from here like what is my life and you really have it's like a little robot from rick and morty who asked what his purpose is yeah exactly exactly so yeah exactly you have to find you you know your own purpose in life and i think for a lot of people that is a scary prospect they don't want to do that they want to be told what their purpose is that or they want to be able to kind of like know from i guess like um the get-go what their purpose is and back in you know before modern society we knew survive that was the purpose for most of humanity's kind of existence survive now that's being taken out and our primitive brains haven't actually evolved past that we now still have that inertly within us like the the goal of humans is to survive and procreate right to keep our species going and that's all taken care of of us even kind of like procreating is taking care of us like there's no need to worry about the baby you go to a doctor they tell you what's what they tell you when you're due they tell you what's complicated about things they tell you you know if if it's dangerous if you're going to give birth you might die in childbirth all that's taken care of there's no there's no risk anymore like there's no kind of like there's nothing for our brains to latch on to in terms of like fight or flight anymore it's kind of like you know we're just cruising cruising along through life everything's taken care of whatever and yes we have our little battles here and there but it's nothing compared to what it was back in the day um so that's why it leads to i think increased depression increased mental issues it's because a lot of people just don't know how to deal with that all right guys in the second half of the show this is actually where things get in my opinion really really interesting uh i bring up the the concept of ernest becker's denial of death theory uh which i'll explain in the show but it's basically a a theory as to why people work enjoy join teams working governments work for things that are larger than themselves and it's an attempt to become immortal right we all know that we're going to die um but when we find things that we can create permanence in object permanence there are things that are going to live on beyond us we can actually find meaning in working for those things and the subconscious fear of death is what motivates people in getting to that point so i think it's a fascinating conversation that anthony and i had uh but first before we get there we have to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various

check them out at gemiini.com go bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave.com have you heard of ernest becker he said no i haven't a philosopher cultural anthropologist he wrote this book called the denial of death and uh he talked about like you talked about like people phil are born with a void in their life and their mission in life is to fill it and like it really depends on how you feel it um and that will dictate how your life is uh the denial of death is is like this theory of like um it it's it's very it's a very wide-ranging theory but like it talks a lot about tribalism and all and meaning and and ascribing symbols to things and he talked about like organized religions or like public service towards like governments or sports teams or any sort of like entity right like the like the average sports team pick your favorite sport in baseball soccer football whatever like the team itself is beyond the person right like it's an organization that like it existed before you were born it'll exist after you die same with your religion same with your country same with your like insert your tribe here right and so like the theory is that like humans have this insatiable desire to build symbols that will outlast their own death in order to seek mortality right because we all have this fear of death we all have this fear of death it's embedded in our like our subconsciousness and when you wake up in the morning you can't think of like oh i really don't want to die therefore i will go do this right like that's just too paralyzing but like still still you are motivate motivated is the theory still you are motivated by that conscious subconscious desire of denying death but you also know that you're going to die so what do what then do you do with your life and so the people according to this theory find long-term sustainable symbols to be a part of right and like to me this answers so many questions as to why like crypto is so tribal like the whole cryptocurrency revolution is about building systems that can last way longer than we can even imagine right like not not centuries but like multiple multiple centuries  maybe even a thousand years right and so like when you consider that we are on like the bootstrapping phases of systems that might be literally a thousand years old like no like you wake up every single day and you look at ethereum and you're like i need to consume everything right like we're all trying to deny death by building and being a part of this symbol that can last for forever right the whole point about ethereum is it will outlast nation states the whole point about these things is that they are going to be the longest lasting systems that humans have ever have ever generated right like including religion um or at least you know religion morphs and change shapes so the symbols change but you know the point still stands right and so like there is immense amount of opportunity to like latch on to like this symbol that can last like far like more generations than we can count uh and so like that i think that's why there's always like this such they're why crypto so tribal why there's so much like bottom-up community engagement why some of the deepest core ethereum like developers like the people on the guest team are so like they they kind of feel like the some of the deepest like you know ethereum like religious like deep like religious people right in the sense that like they don't care about profit they don't care about social media clout they just want to build the damn system right they just want to build because they know that the thing that they are building can help them deny death because they they built it in the first place i never heard that kind of like theory before all that kind of like the way you've put it that's actually super interesting because i think it comes back to permanence as well right like these systems are permanent systems like uh especially the the ones with decentralization guarantees where you can be uh or at least have relative confidence that in a hundred years this is going to be around and this is going to have a permanent record of everything that's ever happened on the chain and uh you know if it comes to like crypto your account balance is going to be correct in 100 years or whatever or like whoever you you pass down your crypto to they're going to be able to have that in a hundred years and no one has been able to take that away from you no one has been able to alter it no one has been able to change history could you imagine if we had like a a permanent record uh throughout the last thousand years of history instead of etching it into like stones and things like that we put it on this system and yes okay like history can be rewritten or like the history of predictors and yeah exactly different interpretations but at least we have that on there and it's a permanent system through time where we can look back on it and dig the data out and kind of like do this i guess chain archaeology as some people have called it before which i think is really cool and have uh relative certainty that this is the truth right this is actually what happened here it didn't get altered by any central party to say something else or to reflect something else and and that is really the crux of it i think is that that permanence and to your point about like us subconsciously fearing death and wanting to create like permanent systems so that even when we are gone everything that we did while we were alive uh or at least a lot of the stuff that we did when we were alive is still there like all the stuff that i've done on ethereum in a thousand years potentially could still be there right all my transactions everything i'm long gone i you know i'm not there anymore uh but my my history is like the history of who i was doesn't matter how small of a person i am in terms of like how well known i am or not um i'm there i'm edged into kind of this this thing as a permanence thing and this i mean you go through history look at the people that that are like the pharaohs that built like the pyramids or they built like massive statues to themselves that they did that because they're like well what's the what's the way that i can make myself kind of like immortal through a symbol to your point and we make ourselves immortal by tying ourselves to a network that we believe can run forever uh and whether it does or doesn't is another thing but i think that's what really attracts me personally to the these systems that are actually truly decentralized is that i know that i well at least i can have relative certainty uh that these things going to be around in 100 200 300 years whereas a lot of these other things i don't know that and i don't know if someone's messing with it or changing it or doing some exerting central control over it and i think that's actually the extreme point for bitcoin is and that's why they are really really adverse to any sort of change on the base layer is because they don't want that that they don't want kind of anyone being able to to change change anything they're happy with the way it is they're happy with that permanence and and that's fine but i think i have a bit of a looser kind of i guess like approach to it where i think that you don't that bitcoin ossified way too early on in its life like these networks are 10 years old they're not like i mean ethereum's not 10 years old but bitcoins like what 12 11 years old um they're not 100 years old yet so ossifying now is probably detrimental to kind of like what you want to build that's why i'm so interested in ethereum still and kind of excited about ethereum's kind of like changing but at the same time they're changing for like the tech upgrades and they're not changing history they're not trying to rewrite anything and technically it could happen but it hasn't happened and obviously there's the dao hack and stuff like that but that was even earlier on in the life like it was like a year into ethereum's life i think we're building systems to last hundreds of years let's not ossify them too soon but let's make sure that we understand that they will eventually ossify at the base layer and that will be like a permanent record of of people and yeah i mean that's a really good way of putting i never thought about it like that and now it all makes sense yeah yeah i mean it's also a convenient model to frame like why security on ethereum is so important and not only security in the in terms of like you know uh the sp specifications as to like node requirements but also with monetary policy right like bitcoin isn't secure because it actually has kind of a broken monetary policy as as good as the bitcoiners will tell you their monetary policy is it's also broken in terms of long-term long-term sustainability on the blockchain right and like the reason why like ethereums have been always criticizing things like binance smart chain is that like cool you just increase centralization you increase state bloat like you reduce sustainability and so like there's actually a very like there's that one equation about like the sweet spot where a planet can be away from a sun base like there's a there's a sweet spot about crypto systems that make these these things long-term permanent right and if the point in the uh also you talked about the pyramids uh ernest becker like one of the the greatest example of the the first examples he uses is like the pyramid so good job for tapping into that but like if we want the like these crypto systems to be permanent like there's there's a pretty narrow band of design choices that like in ethereum needs to be inside of that or like insert your crypto system here it's got to be inside the band or else it succumbs to lack of sustainability in monetary policy or lack of sustainability in in just like the the network size right and so like that this is why vitalik always talks about like this goldilocks zone of like design choices and what he's really talking about is like how do we make this thing exist forever right how do we how do we how do we deny death of the ethereum system yeah and and it's funny because like when you point out these issues with with bitcoin sustainability people say oh we don't have to worry about that for 10 or 20 years like okay but you're trying to build a system that's going to last centuries and you're saying that we don't have to worry about it for 10 or 20 years but we'll be 40. like that's not that old yeah yeah and and and you're also building a culture of not changing anything right through that time like you're building like 20 30 years worth of culture around no changes happening at the base layer i don't know i don't see that being sustainable i think it's going to be very hard for them to to change anything at that point in time because they've only got a few things they can do they change the proof of stake or they do a hybrid proof of stake or they or they remove the monetary policy which probably goes hand in hand with that as well um and they have to kind of like issue more coins or they can they can take coins from old wallets that haven't moved but that's like goes against the very ethos of bitcoin in general um so yeah i mean that falls exactly into kind of why i like ethereum as well it's like it's it's it's more sustainable in my eyes than than even bitcoin i i actually have more confidence that ethereum in its in its kind of like uh current current kind of like form is going to be around in like 20 years uh at least kind of like secure in 20 years than i do with bitcoin unless bitcoin was was to change um and i know that like ethereum is not there just yet we have to go through the merge and then once the merge is done really that is the most sustainable thing because we have like the proof-of-stake uh security and we have the burn uh to kind of like offset that that issue that perpetual issuance and you know we've been through this a million times but that's kind of like why uh i guess like i'm most interested in ethereum's kind of like sustainability rather than bitcoins even though people will say well you know i'm more confident in bitcoin it's like ah like i think there's an argument to be had there uh but it goes back to like the permanent stuff and kind of like creating systems that outlive us by far but you know on that note as well though i've noticed the very um very funny overlap between people in crypto in ethereum specifically and longevity research and reverse aging right like there is a very very like clear overlap and vitalik has actually funded this research he's i think he's donated 10 million to the sands institute probably done other donations um and he's written about i'm not written about this but he's got a blog post i don't know if it's still there but in his twitter bio he had a blog post for a while about like a dragon tyrant and essentially it was a metaphor for hey why do we just accept death as a reality why not fix death or cure death why not treat death like any other disease that we cure um and he i mean that that post had a point it's like okay well let's do it and that and that's why a lot of research is going into this now where it's like can we live forever not immortal as if nothing can kill us but can we actually be biologically immortal where we can reverse aging we can stay at like you know a certain age and we can basically uh extend our lifespans out and indefinitely um and i think we can i actually think it's possible i don't think uh it's it's um something that we can't do because we've cured so many other diseases and really aging is a disease when you look at the cellular level it's just our cells breaking down over time you don't die of old age you die of a disease that you got when you were old yeah exactly exactly and it's because like our bodies are just like not they can't fight that anymore right they can't they can't function as they used to so whether that's making our organic bodies um to getting it to the point where we can reverse aging for long enough until we just basically transfer our consciousness into like a machine that can obviously live forever you can just keep changing the parts of the machine you can keep changing the parts of a human body but eventually it gives out there's diminishing returns to that you can't just keep replacing every part whereas with the machine you can um and and you know as long as you have the human consciousness in it you can keep changing parts but it's also the same thing of reverse aging can we basically keep um you know pushing back the date of our of our death to effectively like being immortal um and there's philosophical questions about that it's like is that actually desirable can society survive with a population that um sorry with a with a um kind of like turn with no turnover because at the moment the way society progresses is that usually the older people are more kind of like conservative they hate change they're the ones that are kind of like at the ruling class but they die off and then you have like a new ruling class come in and that's how society progresses um through time and that's how we all kind of like yeah exactly it's it's basically the wheel but can that continue with uh uh effectively kind of like biologically immortal kind of population and you know what a society look like in that world so but yeah that that overlap between ethereums and longevity research is not i mean that that is definitely just because we we we're obsessed with permanent systems we're obsessed with the long term we're obsessed at the very long term like long term being 10 years is normally what you're talking about i'm talking centuries like we're obsessed with this sort of stuff and and that's what a lot of people that i talk to are thinking about they're not thinking about any of the day-to-day stuff um even though it's it's tempting to i do know that vitalik does actually take um like some of these uh supplements i guess you would call them that longevity researchers have like kind of given the unofficial like green check mark on and so like he he not only is he a believer and thunder in this thing but like he's actually taking like meaningful steps of his own like you know well-being to to attempt to get to living forever right and it's it's when the i was i can't remember when i was talking to him about this but he talked about like well you know if these things that i'm doing now kick out my life by like 20 to 30 years well then that just gives me 20 to 30 years more room for like more meaningful innovations to come out and so like maybe i'll go from like 80 diet 80 to diet like 110 but like between now and then we'll think of even more things and then that will buy me more time to for people to think of even more things which will buy me even more time and then it's eventually it's just some process of like kicking the can down the road and you just ultimately you just kick the can down the road forever and find ways to like never actually have to like leave the can behind right you just keep on kicking the can and so there's some there's some sort of joke or juxtaposition here about like vitalik the guy that designed the everlasting economic system and then also like figured out a way to live forever so he can just ride this economic system into like the sunset which is which would be a phenomenal story yeah and and the beautiful thing of that is that vitalik doesn't have control over the system that he made right like he can live for like for centuries and so can this system but he doesn't have any control over it he can't exert central control um which is which is actually amazing i love that the fact that imagine both these systems ethereum not system but imagine a theorem in vitalik live to be a thousand years old everyone knows that vitalik will have created it right he's he's etched into that forever um but like he has no control over it so it's just kind of like this thing that he set out into the world that he can't even i mean he at that point he probably doesn't even have any influence over it he's probably working on something else who i mean i mean his social clout would be absolutely insane but yeah yeah but yeah but other than that um you know the system itself would be if if it works as kind of like we want it to work we'll be still fully decentralized and secure and stuff like that so yeah it's kind of funny when you think about that i mean these are definitely like very deep philosophical things and stuff that may not be answered for for like 50 years to come we don't know what the world's going to look like but i mean yeah i think people are doing different things to kind of like extend their life already i know that you fast and that's been kind of like there's a lot of research done into that that shows that it could extend your your life potentially um and it's cool i think it's a wash with the beer that i drink so call it even yeah yeah yeah but that's the thing like i'm i like personally i try to take a little bit more care of my my health uh trying to kind of like lose extra weight as i if i put it on or try to exercise more it's kind of been hard with covert in the lockdowns and things like that but generally um you know living a healthy life is not a bad thing like that's even if it doesn't extend your lifespan even if you get hit by a bus tomorrow who cares like living a healthy life means that you just feel better overall anyway um which i think should be the goal for for everyone but um uh generally if you're trying to extend your life out yeah there's a lot of experimental stuff you can do as you said like there's some supplements and stuff there is there's fasting there's a lot of experimental stuff you can do but if you do it now you need to kind of be content with the risks of doing it being that you know you may kill yourself in the process you might have jumped the gun too soon on some of the things like it turns out that wasn't the right one not the right experiment yeah it turns out that gave me cancer that steve jobs ate a fruit only diet and turns out he gave himself cancer for that on the quest of like living curing immortality exactly so there's going to be like a lot of that happening so and then eventually you know maybe in 100 years we solve this and everyone born then gets to experience the joys of everyone else's sacrifices through through time which is exactly what we get to enjoy right now the millions of people that came before us that sacrificed their lives whether that be in wars or in clinical experiments or dying from diseases that we eventually cured and viruses and stuff like that um we all just kind of like uh survive based on previous generations and i think it's a scary thought at because you you know you we could be the generation that has to be the one that suffers the most pain for people to get to this enlightened live forever stage but at the same time it's kind of like cool because we get to be part of it we get to be like etched into history and it goes back to i guess your your kind of discussion what you were saying about like having these monuments having these things exist that live longer than us to kind of remember us i guess totally well anthony for a conversation that started with like how how the hell do you have so much energy to put into the daily way like well i think we actually might have found our answer yeah yeah exactly i mean yeah i mean the fun thing about these i think these layer zeros that you're doing is that it doesn't have to be just about crypto can be about anything and the conversation can go anywhere which which i always really like because i mean people who follow me and probably listen to all the stuff that i probably only know know me for ethereum and crypto stuff but i definitely do a lot of other stuff outside of that and read a lot of other things and try to keep up with a lot of other stuff but the overlap between yeah i mean like i think it's not just like longevity research but anything on the bleeding edge like i'm definitely interested in like space stuff that's happening there and kind of like trying to loosely keep up with it and space travel i'm definitely interested in in just like all kinds of new advances in medic medicine and i actually thought it was really cool how fast we got like a vaccine for covert like the fastest ever i'm just super interested in that but like it's kind of hard to keep up with everything don't say brother you're in australia hey no i think i think an australian came up with the astrazeneca vaccine or at least one of the people that that came up with it so um yeah i think i think so yeah yeah so that's cool but um yeah i just generally like i try to keep like a cursory kind of view of everything happening but there's just too much happening man like trying to keep up with the theorem alone is is like a more than a full-time job now so yeah i'm all right man well i i definitely appreciate your time and coming and chatting on on with me on layer zero yeah thanks for having me man i'm sure people will hear my voice on the live streams that we do or any further like bankless stuff that we do uh probably in a few months when we do another kind of like bull case for eth like we always do right maybe 8 is that 10k who knows but we'll have this game we already got two of them scheduled one for a couple months and then one for six months so they're already on the menu yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly maybe eric will join us again um for the next one like he missed the last one but yeah yeah i'm sure he was eating the popcorn while he was watching it yeah yeah yeah but i think he's more bullish these days so maybe but anyway yeah thanks only on jpegs yeah exactly oh man cool all right well i'm getting a little bit loopy because it's coming into my my bedtime so uh anthony great great having you on uh layer zero sir a testament to ethereum and thank you for everything that you
