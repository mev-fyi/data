[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and today on this episode of our Zoo zalu series we are exploring some New Frontiers New Frontiers and new technologies all of which are poised to completely revolutionize the world and change everything about the operating system that Society is currently running on bankless Nation today we are exploring the frontier of DSI or decentralized science what is DSI it's a really good question because I legitimately had no idea going into zuzalu but it became clear that DSi is a great connector of many of the Technologies presented here at zuzalo DSi is how synthetic biology and Longevity have to do with ethereum DSI is what is putting ethereum at the center of these things the fundamental argument for DSI is that the old ways of doing science is bad and for the same reasons why the old way of doing money and doing Finance is bad DSi looks at the incumbent system of producing science and sees friction and Corruption and antiquation and toxic tradition Desai wants to use blockchain technology to improve the systems and institutions of science the mechanisms of how science can use a blockchain is a very big conversation and the answers are more than a few but the conversation that you're about to hear with Boris and Mikey will download you on the DSi landscape here but this isn't just about improving the ways that we do science this isn't just about hey we found a new way to do science better and faster DSi presents a zero to one step function change in the form factor of scientific progress itself you know how uniswap and aveg and erc20 tokens are just open apis to financial tools DSi wants to do very similar things for scientific data what would happen if we made our scientific data as open and as free as a contract call what if scientific data was as modular and open as the internet itself but blockchain Tech doesn't just provide new solutions for scientific data specifically DSi is also marked by an emergence of dows all following a decently similar form factor of capital allocation financing clinical trials in hopes of investing in a breakout new treatment servicing the long tail of unserviced patients which also sounds a lot like baking the unbanked and a bunch of other similar puzzle pieces that are all coming together in these very variety Dows that are all trying to go after a certain specific use cases in the world of science so this first episode in this two interview series is with Boris dayakov and Mikey Fisher both who are pioneers in the Desai space and helped me have one of the most enjoyable and easy conversations that I had at zuzalu and after listening to this conversation you'll understand exactly what DSi is getting at and whether or not you want to proceed into the second conversation with al-aktai whose project Vibe bio illustrates a specific example of the overall archetype of Desai Dows that are art there trying to use blockchain Tech to coordinate and accelerate scientific progress so Bank location are you ready to explore the frontier of scientific progress by the way at zuzalu of the traditional scientific researchers that were there all realized that the existence of Desai implies the existence of tradsai which was a meme that stuck pretty damn fast so all right let's go and learn about DSi with Boris and Mikey followed by D side Dows with alak but first I want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible extra thanks to Kraken our preferred exchange for crypto in 2023 whether you're dollar costs averaging into crypto to prepare for the bull market or you're taking profits out of crypto be sure to do it with Kraken the newly designed Kraken Pro makes it super easy to do both your basic Financial transactions while also taking your trading to the next level Kraken Pro is truly the trading ux that you've always wanted so if you're a bull market archetype is the trader class you need Kraken Pro in your toolkit but if your character class is more of a defy journeyman or a woman then metamask portfolio is the tool for you metamask portfolio is your D5 multi-chain battle station any asset on any ethereum layer 2 mendemast portfolio will present it to you so don't get caught for getting assets or missing opportunities make sure you're prepared for the bull run by prepping your my mask portfolio moving on from tools you need to Playing Fields to play on the arbit from layer 2 is one of the main Arenas in which this bull market will be fought on whether your character class is a D5 DJ airdrop hunter or healed Seeker the arbitrum Coliseum is where a ton of the action is going to be so whether you're on arbitrum one for defying nfts or arbitrum Nova for web3 gaming or a new frontier on Arboretum using an arbitrum orbit chain there are so many opportunities to sink your teeth into but as we know the ethereum role of centric roadmap produces all kinds of layer twos and mantle is one of the newest layer twos on the scene with some of the newest technology that ethereum layer 2's has to offer in the year 2023 mantle is built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one reducing gas fees by 80 compared to other layer twos with billions of dollars standing by from bit Dow to invest in mantle make sure you stay ahead of the game by building and growing your on chain footprint on mantle let's not forget about the each staking character class and stator makes it easy running a staking pool with stator just requires four ether for a deposit letting you charge a fee to the remaining 28 ether that uses your note to stake their ease increasing your yield by 35 seder's staked ether token ethx allows you to stake your ether and use it in defy at the same time for all you D5 swappers out there this one is for you uniswap X has opened up a brand new landscape to play in and it's the world of intense this is where those who employ this swapping ability get to team up with the evil Mev butt Army and they get to band together to discover the most efficient liquidity route through the ethereum landscape gas-free swaps Med protection and theoretically optimal pricing when swappers and Emmy viewers come together new metas happen and is thanks to uniswap X so the next time you trade on you swap consider clicking the uniswap x button to get your Mev protection and so if we're truly entering a bull market phase in crypto which we totally are then tokens are going to start flying all over the place so if you're an organization looking to grow with token incentives then look at no further than toku if you want to distribute tokens to your employees team members or for payroll toku can help you comply with labor laws tax obligations and reporting for whatever country you employ someone crypto is entering its regulated era and toku can help you achieve your token incentive award goals with compliance so thank you to all the sponsors that support Bank lists and all the podcast editors newsletter writers and operations managers who make the bankless organization the best that we can be we truly appreciate your support and for all the listeners out there who listen to the mountains of content that we turn out each week especially this one right here so let's go on to the show Bankers Nation we are here at zuzalu and I got two people on the podcast with me today uh right to my right we got Mikey what's up Mikey how's it going how's it going and then further down to my right we got Boris what's up Boris hello David pleasure to be here so I've heard the name Desai a number of times um it was had some exposure at East Denver I've seen it on Twitter but I haven't really figured it out but DSi seems to be the thing that really is pinning a lot of these various conversations at zoo zalu together that's why the synthetic biology people are talking to the crypto people right that's why the longevity people are talking to the crypto people that's kind of my basal level understanding but beyond that I don't know what DSi really is or how to explain this movement to the bankless nation so I'm hoping you guys can help us guide all the listeners down that rabbit hole you guys want to do that very excited too yeah happy to but first a little bit more about you guys Mikey tell us a little bit about yourself and your background yeah so uh I just finished my PhD I was at Stanford I was writing uh computer science and natural language processing and uh after I finished that I wrote a book on regulating Ai and then I got very interested in I saw the PHD I thought this could be done in a different way so uh I got into crypto I learned about DSi and I thought one of the key parts around DSi was like data and how we could fix uh some of the problems that exist in traditional Academia around how data is collected so I started a company called DB dial which basically like fractionalizes large data sets and then gives peoples and gives people an incentive to contribute data all right Boris uh tell us about yourself so uh I'm a scientist by training I'm actually a current PhD student PhD candidate at the University of Toronto and the ludenfeld Tannenbaum Research Institute um so I'm coming from a different field my PhD is in molecular genetics and basically my research is around figuring out where these uh which proteins are found within these structures in the cell called nuclear bodies and in the nucleus so I spent most of the past decade pursuing this academic career uh really just trying to build a career as a scientist and eventually have my own lab and continue to unlock new knowledge about how cells work and how they're organized and during covet I kind of took a step back and started exploring other Pathways and after the sort of long journey exploring business and finance I eventually ended up getting interested in webstery and thinking about how we could solve some problems in science that essentially drove me away from the career that I'd been pursuing for so long um and we'll talk about this after I'm sure because there's a lot of issues in how science is done both in Academia and industry but basically I was thinking about how we can maybe fix some of these problems and uh realize there were other people coming from my background who were excited about these same problems and were trying to tackle them using some really interesting Technologies like Dows and crypto so uh that was about a year and a half ago and it's been a wild ride ever since I mean I think Boris and I are both interested in science like we were both scientists and we both love science and we both went through the traditional science means of doing science which is a university we both saw that there's issues or ways that could be done better and that's that's what me that's what excited me about DSi is like oh you can still do some science but you can do it in maybe a better way that's actually just resonates a lot with me because of the when I was getting into crypto I was thinking about going down a doctorate of physical therapy route with the intention of also applying that to mental health and nutrition and then I found ethereum and saw one path which was slow and friction filled and costly and the other path which was new and Innovative and fast where you don't ask for permission and I kind of think that's why this DC World exists at large is because the ins the the old way the Trad side is is old and friction filled and slow and I think maybe we're what uh the people that have got hopped onto the D side movement have been able to identify in crypto is that we move really really fast and there seems to be an appetite in the scientific Community to move faster than the incumbent ways of doing things and that's where this demand for a new form factor of science comes from that's kind of my sentiment is that is that am I over the Mark here yeah one of the big things is just accelerating science and tradside um it could literally take two to three years to publish a paper for some things um by the time you like get the funding to the time you do the play around with the research question to publish the paper to get reviews it could take quite a bit of time and it doesn't have the quick turnaround Cycles like GitHub or like a pull request does this really does vary field by field I mean everything is slow in the Life Sciences in biology like I work with I'm a wet lab biologist and when I say wet lab I mean I actually work with pipettes and cells and proteins and liquids and test tubes um and everything's slow but cells need to grow you know all these processes are manual and and really drawn out and that stuff can definitely speed up and be automated that's not really a d side problem I mean I think in some ways the slowness of science can be a feature and not a bug but not in every sense there's a lot of inefficiencies that can be sped up and I think a lot of this appetite and excitement for DSI is one scientist discovering that there's new technology that enables us to coordinate more effectively make things more efficient um do things in a trustless way of course and uh and just exploring the possibilities around that and then I think on the other hand people who are coming from like crypto are excited to have more use cases for blockchain technology um yeah yeah one thing you were mentioning is like the permissionlessness of um of it of crypto and I think that's one of the things that's become an issue in traditional science is it is a very permissioned system you have to get grants from a specific agency you have to get accepted into a university by fulfilling some certain things you have to then appease the advisor appease a journal it is very hierarchical and gatekeeping or an approval by the FDA exactly whereas whereas what's really neat about this DSi movement is that it's permissionless anybody can contribute to a research project if you have the right data if you have the right background it's not based on a degree or any or anything it's based on a meritocracy and it's based on the data that's provided and it's a much different way of thinking about uh how to do science if I can add to that I mean uh something we should maybe start with is that the D side movement I guess we can call it a movement um it really Builds on on the earlier open science movement which has been around for decades which has tried to solve a lot of these same problems we're talking about I mean um you know the fact that if you want to read an article like scientific knowledge that should be freely shared among everyone you need to get through a paywall and you know hopefully we'll have a chance to talk about public like the whole publishing problem and reproducibility crisis in science but um there's a lot of barriers and it really just doesn't make sense in a lot of ways so there has been this movement of people pushing for making everything Open Access open source um and I I think there's a lot of inspiration that science can and must take from like the open source software movement and those communities because it's just a better way of doing things it's how things should be but we as a community are kind of Trapped in these long-standing in you know really like strong institutions of science which have done a lot of good things but have also kind of uh missed the mark in a lot of ways yeah and I mean building off what Boris has like Desai is very much um has its roots in open science like but one of the things that's really interesting is like open science was probably happened like 10 years ago I don't know around 20 30. yeah so it's starting for a while but it's it's it's it's it's caught in some waves but it hasn't really taken over as much as uh people would have liked I guess maybe the crypto correlate is like the Occupy Wall Street movement which was a good uh flag a banner to Rally around that actually didn't really end up moving the needle until Bitcoin came around right yeah love that analogy yeah it's like oh yeah yeah so one of the things that's interesting about the open science is like what what is what is what does DSi offer that builds on open science and it's um it's like incentivization mechanisms so now we have the ability to track research from test tube to final product and so if final product is good you can incentivize the people that contributed because you you have this immutable Ledger that anyone can contribute to and you can track who did what part and so this is very cool because now we have a way of tracking if someone does good basic science does someone does good research they can now be partial owner of it the benefit whereas in open science you had your data you'd throw it over the wall to this journal to a data set and you'd lose sort of ownership of that and so this is like why blockchain is actually very important for this design movement just for like attribution and creditness and being able to see the source of things and being able to map those things and just having a specific destination of who did what opens up the world of of collaboration and other and other mechanisms 100 I mean like the the whole idea of like data Providence is is a big topic I think in crypto and like data science and all that but the same thing it's like your contributions in science essentially are only recognized through this chain of citations which is like text in a PDF these things aren't hyperlinked you know there are new there are systems now where you can kind of have a a record of your academic work it's called Orchid um it's very much a web 2 kind of you know system it's it's a step in the right direction for sure um but I mean we have technology to dramatically improve on these systems and then be able to look back and say wow somebody's getting a Nobel Prize for this but here's all the hundreds of people who contributed to this maybe we should reward them too maybe they get an airdrop you know like and the funny thing about is like an academic paper it lists all the people on the top of it but it doesn't say who did what so you could have a research paper with hundreds of people on it and the last name is the advisor and the first name is the lead author and then everywhere in between is very complicated on who did what but there might be little notes like these people did experiments but like but with blockchain you know exactly who who did every single part and like who contributed good data who contributed about it and with that why that's important is not for like rep it's for reputation but also you can reward people like oh I really enjoyed this part of the paper I'm going to reward this specific person right and there's I'm assuming there's more ways to make this really really codified rather than just like putting ethereum addresses next to people's names there's a I think there's like the idea of like um identity yeah right there's like the value graph of all of these things um one thing that the reason why detox caught my attention lately is that it seems to fit the same mold of other movements that we've seen in crypto which is there's this uh spark that just happens because someone figured out a basic pattern and then that started to get copied a bunch and I think uh maybe correct me if I'm wrong but I think the story starts at um Vita Dao Vita Dao uh and that was like the first D side Dao that like created this archetype for other science people to be like oh there's something there and then it spawned more and more and more D side Dows and now there's like a slow Cambrian maybe not slow Cambrian explosion of D side Dows being formed and it's like I think that's the kind of the top of the rabbit hole of this whole thing is that right I think for a lot of people it is I mean longevity is huge in crypto and in Tech in general um vitadel is doing amazing work big fan of what they've been doing also the focus of molecule who've kind of built that whole ecosystem around uh around vidadel they're they're doing a lot for the space for sure and really trying to template that that sort of bio-dial model um with their whole incubator accelerator program um that's I think one type of DSi project right this is like I'm not going to call it an investment dial but it's like a it's a data that is essentially trying to fund and support specific areas of research that will hopefully have some sort of translational application you know maybe we'll lead to a drug that will go into the clinical trials one day um are you curious for something your new products um and I mean this is something that I've been thinking about a lot lately which is that there's like science can mean a lot of different things there's so many different fields of Science of course and they all do things a little bit differently I mean we're all kind of surrounded by or unified by the same principle that we're trying to understand how the world works and gather data and analyze it and use a scientific method to create better models of the world around us um but science can mean basic research which is just like fundamental basic research like math you know that may not have some specific application like a drug or a cure for disease and then there's things down the line like biomedical research that is trying to find Targets for drugs to hit to cure types of cancers um and they have different types of problems like in terms of how they're funded or how you incentivize them but I think that brings me to the topic of incentives which I think is the other superpower that crypto brings to the problems that science has so the the thing I was talking about where like these Vita Dows these there's one I interviewed was um uh a synthetic biology Dao there's many of these things is that Desai what is DSi like how do you how do you put a border around this thing like what actually is it what is DSi I guess that's what we're here to answer right like a movement it's like what is defy it's in the same way it's it's people that are looking to do or what is a network State it's people that are looking to exit the existing system to some extent okay and use blockchain as an important part or dids or collaboration or putting data on chain um but I think it's it's very dependent on the actual project it's an idea I mean I think we can look at the the current DSi landscape the projects that people are working on what's happening in the space who's giving talks at the various great D side conferences and meetups that have been happening over the past year or so um and I kind of have like three buckets I like to put it into one is funding so funding is a major problem in science we need more money for science how do we get more money for science how do we create better more liquid markets for biotech intellectual property for example um that brings up topics like ipn FTS stuff like that so that's one thing funding second of course is something we talked about which is publishing you know the the current publishing industry academic publishing industry is kind of crazy and people who aren't in Academia aren't aware of how how nuts this is I mean academic publishing houses have I think the highest margins of any industry like way higher than anything it's it's really absurd because essentially people pay to publish in these journals and then peer review is done for free by scientists in those fields and then they charge universities individuals whoever wants to read those papers huge fees to access those papers it's like a triple payer model is what some people call it so that's the second publishing and the third is well not just third but I think uh reputation systems attribution data Providence all that like all the other things that yeah and much more I would also add reproducibility so um like yeah one of the big problems in science is uh papers are too complex to be replicable or the data sets are not open or the basically a lot of stuff can't be reproduced and DSi has an emphasis on reproducibility through many eyes on data um through putting the data on chain so that it's immutable so that it has provenance and tracking and reputation associated with each of it because I think we're going to go back in 10 years and see that so much of the data so much of scientific research is just hard to reproduce so you can't build on it whereas like a GitHub project you can just download it run it and see that you can run you can uh you know build on it and that's an important part of science is being able to reproduce and build it yeah I think another one more bits had would be the actual execution of science I mean there are projects like lab Dow that are trying to build new tools and infrastructure for scientists to actually do scientific work in a more reproducible way um so yeah decides a lot of things right okay so there there is no boundary there's no border on what is and is not Desai it's not just this growth of dows who are doing very various things across the the science space it's just there's a lot more tools in the crypto world that are being leveraged for the pursuit of Science and there's no really better way to like put a boundary on it other than that yeah I like to kind of summarize it as using blockchain technology to improve the systems and institutions of Science and like create new incentives for science you know like how do we something I've been asking myself is like how do we create a world where everybody wants to be a scientist and has the opportunity to be a scientist if they want to be a scientist I don't think everyone should be a scientist or wants to be but you know how do we increase that number yeah I mean I think in the same way d uh defy brought about many different types of Traders DSi has the ability to bring out many different types of scientists and many different people who can contribute to science whether that be through uh collecting specimens around the world of nature or of like testing out different uh nutrition or stuff like that and um it has the ability to open up science a lot more so that that very much just fits into the mold of crypto right democratizing access lowering the barriers of Entry making things more permissionless making things more um kind of disrupting the incumbents no matter what yeah always kind of tablespace table Stakes for the things that crypto touches maybe um you guys can use your imaginations put on your imagination cap and just like Fast Forward 10 years what's the Bold case of GSI what's the bulkates of Science and how and and how because crypto enabled it and DSi fulfilled all of his promises what does this new world look like yeah um it's like GitHub for science so it's as easy to do and reproduce science and get credit for science as it is to use a GitHub package today I love that I mean that's a good question both case for Desai I mean in 10 years I'd be really happy if most of the new research and most of the new data that is being generated uh is is going on to some sort of decentralized storage system and able to be accessed permissionlessly with a record of who did the work who built on the work what kind of computation was done on it and you know we kind of disrupt this whole model of the PDF as the token of knowledge you know progression um but it's so much more than that I think I think I would really I'd really like expect to see new funding models to appear new ways of rewarding people for their scientific contributions again science takes time but at least having the framework in place and and seeing early results so that would be what I'd love to see yeah well while talking to some of these uh the Dows um it was a Vibe bio it was one of the dolls I was uh one of the interviews I have in this track uh it was interesting to see that there's an explicit investment thesis an investment case for some of these things where like you put in capital this Dow goes and funds projects it funds new medicines do research for new medicines and then the Dow owns that IP or that provenance may I don't know what to call it but that I that whole concept and then that Dao grows in capital because it produces one medicine that is demanded by the market so the fact that there's like Financial uh Financial incentives to grow this thing makes me uh pretty bullish just on this idea of being able to converge science in financial incentives in a ways that hasn't that has been full of friction right we already know that the bank list Nation knows the frictions of the traditional Financial system uh they are probably at least now starting to wake up at the very least to the frictions of the sign scientific community and I think the whole idea of defy and DSi is that we get to take friction away from both and turn on this propeller of innovation and maybe that's another way to articulate this whole thing yeah I I mean I think a lot of so maybe there shouldn't be barriers to contributing to scientific knowledge like anything you do throughout the course of your day should be law could be logged and you should have the ability to contribute that or you have some sort of insight you should be able to contribute that um have have your data be shared and and be rewarded for sharing the data and there's some things that actually lend itself very well like you were talking about earlier around diet and nutrition I think this is something that has the ability to really take off in DSi because this is something that is very longitudinal so any anything you eat you should be able to take a picture of that thing put it to some Dao say how you felt share that data set that data set is purchased and then everyone who uploaded a picture of their food and their data point of how they felt after it could could be rewarded when this data set is purchased so this is for the my new share of data that they contributed exactly and this is something you can actually do with dbdao is like you get rewarded based you get you fractionalize a large data set so that when it's purchased everyone who contributed to it gets a portion of the rewards but this is something that works very very well for DSI other things are a little they're not to say that they don't work as well but they're a little trickier like I want to do like scanning electron microscope research it's a little harder to democratize than something that is uh uh that more people can participate in yeah yeah and again so many so many different uh Dimensions to Desai as an idea as a as a field if you want to call it a field or a narrative maybe um and you're talking about defy and DSi coming together right so um something that I don't know if it was Paul or Tyler from molecule who kind of birthed this bio-dow ecosystem including veto dial um I remember a talk that I I watched from from one of them back in like 2018 and I only saw this a year and a half ago but it really inspired me because they were talking about the idea of ipnfts as enabling a much more efficient biopharma IP Market intellectual property Market because now you can sort of wrap intellectual property in an nft rapper and fractionalize it and create much more transparent and liquid markets and enable things like prediction markets for you know drugs that are in clinical trials um because the the whole biopharma industry had it's very opaque it's very very hard to access unless you're an accredited investor it's actually probably impossible so they thought well how do we bring more liquidity to this use this to fund more research and sort of hyper financialize a lot of these things a lot of these ideas like has happened in in crypto and I think a lot of scientists are turned off by right that term but I actually see it as a superpower of crypto that can really fuel a lot of innovation and a lot of Discovery and I mean yeah I want to come back to scientists and crypto but I mean the the term hyper financialization generally turns a lot of people off we definitely need to find a new term for that the way that I've explained this in the nft space is like a lot of the resistance to nfts came because like oh you're putting Finance in in our art get your Finance away from our art and I always try and flip it around on them it's like well you're actually putting your culture into Finance like these are an opportunities to take your culture and make our finance less Banky and more artsy and so like finding new ways to explain like yeah hyper financialization but also you know incentives compensation rewards upside growth all of these like adjectives that have been uh missing from so many different other Industries also accountability so like science is accountable-ish but if there's a train connecting everything together you can see where the weak points are and you can start to tighten them up a little bit uh which I think is probably needed at some point definitely I mean so one thing I feel like I need to say is that um there's this question of onboarding scientists into web3 even with DSI really picking up steam over the last year it's still hard to get typical scientists working in Labs working in universities to kind of pay attention to this because one scientists want to do science like most of them don't want to be writing grants and exploring new things they want to work on what they're interested in second crypto has a pretty bad wrap among the you know the rest of the world the rest of the world right so if you say the word crypto to a scientist they kind of recoil with disgust they lose interest they don't want they don't want to hear about it they they think it's all monkey jpegs and scams um and I mean you know of course scams are a problem in crypto right but the other thing is you're not you're not wrong yeah so so when I talk to my colleagues about DSi I start off with blockchain technology and start explaining why blockchain technology is unique and why an immutable Ledger enables you know us to do things in a trustless way and then they start paying attention they start thinking oh okay so I thought it was just money I thought it was just like Bitcoins and I'm like no no no it's just technology there doesn't need to be money in there at all that's just like the first use case that was actually you know a really good use case I think one of the interesting things is going to see the how Desai and tradside sort of interact so like look at like uber like it never compete it competed with taxis but Uber never tried to change the existing taxi industry and I think that there's an argument to be made that Desai won't necessarily compete with tradside in the sense that it's going to launch its own initiatives around health and wellness around nutrition around longevity around cryogenics things that are typically not touched as much in traditional science and then develop its own ecosystem that is sort of bifurcates from the existing infrastructure so it's not going to try and get money a d side project is not going to try and get money from the NSF it's not going to try and do research at Stanford it's not going to try and do research publish in nature like right now we have it's very good it could but like ethereum doesn't publish their eips on a computer science journal they have uh their own research thing they have their own EIP thing and they've developed this sort of own bifurcation and how they do uh on how they do improvements and I think that there is definitely a possibility that uh DSi will bifurcate from tradside and it'll develop its own ecosystem because it's just oftentimes so hard to move an existing uh culture within something that only the people that want to participate in it will participate in and the people that don't will just continue on the way to add to that I mean I I feel like my bull case for DSI is that all of traditional science just becomes just synonymous with decentralized science things that we talk about science is supposed to be decentralized yeah yeah ultimate use case like science is supposed to be a Marketplace of ideas and uh competition something is true until it has proven false and stuff like that totally but but exactly so it's supposed to be that but in a lot of ways it isn't and there are a lot of misaligned incentives which lead to things like most of the data being published not being reproducible in like biomedical research some ridiculous that like 60 or something um and I think again with this technology we have opportunities to build new systems which address those problems which create the right incentives to address those problems I'm being a little bit vague because we're still figuring this out and a lot of people are excited to discuss these ideas if you want to jam on DSi come find us on Twitter and uh come to the next DSi conference and meet up um NYC we have them monthly actually oh yeah you were in the shirt nice um I should have worn a Bitcoin shirt we'll talk about yeah yeah but but so that's the thing I think really like DSi is just going to be the new infrastructure for how science is done I I don't think that DSi is going to replace our current scientific institutions it's not going to replace PhD training programs like there's a lot of value that you get from the science apprenticeship oh great yeah being in the lab and doing the work and being around scientists and just like becoming a scientist um but I think we can improve that process by bringing new funding sources by you know creating new incentives like I keep saying but just making things more efficient better tools making it easy to collaborate and to publish your work it's like sort of really simple stuff in a lot of ways but scientists need a good reason to start doing things in a new way um and that's that's where we need to work you know what problems can we solve for scientists now that will sort of create an entry point for all this technology to flourish yeah I totally agree with uh what Boris is saying around phds are still important and needed in some areas for sure I think one that's not the part of science we want to disrupt right well you actually do learn something in a PhD of four years of X number of years of dedicated research like it is useful in doing these hard subjects um one of the interesting things around DSi that's a bit of an unknown still is like how chat GPT plays into this and how AI comes into play Canon AI can you learn from an AI can can an AI take the role of a previous what previously had a PhD advisor so could an AI Mentor you and be like get you up to speed to be doing uh deep foundational science research and can you use can can chat GPT then say like oh do this experiment and I do the experiment and then I upload it to DSi and then I get rewarded for it so I think one of the things I'm very excited about in DC is also more of the integration of AI into how it thinks I mean one thing that would be really cool is like when you're writing a research paper one of the important parts is like related work AI could generate that thing in an instant right another thing would previously take a human you know a long long time to write so there's a lot of cool things that where things that are fundamentally changing here which will even further Propel Desai I was wondering when AI would come up during this conversation um because something that I've noticed a lot around the conversations uh regarding crypto and AI together it comes down to like you know decentralization of models and reproducibility of these models and being able to trust that this was the model that was run to give you your output and all of these same problems are directly transferable to other areas of scientific Computing like computational biology um so I think there's a lot a lot of space to explore there um the design space is huge also things like knowledge graphs and discourse graphs and how you can use that to train AIS and also reward people who've contributed to this work I think crypto is a big role to play in all these emerging Technologies um and all these emerging technologies have a big role to play in science so at some point we're going to stop talking about DSi we're just going to talk about the different products that people are building on I think um maybe this like whole like New Frontier for for listeners just like oh man I didn't really expect this this is like a unexpected turn of events for crypto to like be in integrating into the science space but I think it's it's worth kind of zooming back out and putting on our Kathy Wood hat because Kathy Wood was always about hey uh um uh Gene editing synthetic biology crypto AI these are all intersecting and so these are all coming together and because our products are finally becoming like useful for each other these are also these are all new technologies that are outside of the system and they're all using each other to help bootstrap each other and like from the crypto I'm coming from the crypto side of things the providing new scientific tools to a new scientific Community is probably like one of the most legitimizing use cases of crypto that we've ever created yeah agreed and one of the things that's slightly different around D side than D5 is there's exogenic information right being added to the system so when I conduct by the way thank you when I conduct an experiment I'm taking data from the natural world and putting it on chain that is creating value when people are swapping tokens it's a different type of value that's a speculative value it's a different type of value but when someone is when I'm when someone does something and you know creates actual creates value that way and that's what's going to drive um like these projects to create value is like there's useful information here in the same way when someone builds a house they're taking uh Lumber and nailing it together and that creates something that's like really valuable and here when you take data and you conduct experiments you put it on chain and you do analysis on it and you show it's reproducible that creates tangible value beautiful guys this has been a great first exploration into the world of DSi and I'm excited to to go down this Rabbit Hole even further if people are peaked um is there a starting place that you suggest to them like how would one get started exploring the deeper the world of Desai uh DB Dow dot XYZ has a one pager on uh DSi and you should also check out all the meetups that are around the world um DSi NYC decitokyo DSi London uh there's many more out there and you can Google them and find them we will put the link into the show notes um I'd also add the ethereum foundation has a pretty good and comprehensive page for DSI with tons of links and if you want to see what some of the current like new projects in DSi are right now check out the DSi git coin Grant round that is I don't know if it's going to be before or after this but you can get a get a sense of like what are people trying to get money to build right now in DSi um this is part of the whole new grand stack and allo protocol launch at gitcoin which I had to talk about at some point um because I'm organizing the DSi round along with some Community stewards so beautiful guys thank you so much this has been uh I've learned quite a lot and I think I'm very optimistic about this world of science on on the blockchain it's nice to be able to say on the blockchain again I haven't said that in a while it's all just gonna merge together on the blockchain cheers guys appreciate it thank you we are here with alak Tai of vibe bio oh look welcome thanks so much for having me really appreciate it so we are here with the in the synthetic bio track at zuzolo uh which is uh way more broad than I ever thought that it would be and and we got introduced at just one of the uh the talks today and so maybe you could introduce yourself and explain what a little bit about what bio is yeah so uh I myself am actually a scientist I spent about 15 years at the bench doing research um then caught the software bug and started a bunch of software companies focus on the Biotech Industry um those companies went on to raise about 100 million plus Adventure a few hundred employees doing pretty well but you know an entrepreneur builder at heart exactly right and uh someone who Not only was a practitioner of science but also I've had the fortune of seeing how different functions in the Life Sciences industry operate uh having built tools for clinical trials for r d Labs Etc so uh I have a I feel like I was fortunate to have a really unique Viewpoint into how Pharma operates and how the overall drug Discovery process unfolds and so can you go into a little bit about the the problem that you're tackling here with Vibe yeah so um as an organization you know we were founded uh in 2022 um the impetus for founding Vibe was that while I was building software companies in the Life Sciences space um in mid 2021 my wife and I were fortunate to have our first kid though the pregnancy went okay unfortunately our daughter was born very sick and spent a long time in the hospital one of the reasons was because the diseases that she had uh were somewhat common the biology well understood but unfortunately there were no dedicated therapeutic options available to her and as a consequence she spent a long time suffering that's an interesting dichotomy a common disease without a ready to go treatment correct and that was sort of my uh focal point when she became sick right where in a circumstance where a lot of people suffer from this disease when we truly understand its root causes why is it that we don't have a treatment much less anybody working on it and that became an obsession for me and that translated into Vibe bio today okay so talk to me a little bit more about that um what were you I'm sure as a very concerned adult uh a parent of your first child uh you are watching them I'm assuming uh live in the hospital uh the archetype the the typical uh uh response that leads to Hollywood response is that they go on a learning uh they go down a rabbit hole is that what you did I'd say very much so you know I think in my case we were fortunate to live in Boston which has phenomenal medical um establishments as well as a deep biotechnology Corridor and so given my experience having built software companies in the space as well as having been a scientist it allowed me to very rapidly spend time with everyone from biotech Founders to Pharma companies to uh Venture capitalists to truly peel back the onion and understand why in this circumstance uh we don't have treatments for these sorts of rare diseases and for diseases at large okay so uh just redefine the problem for me one more time just zooming back out and then we'll to talk about uh what your next steps were but the problem was that there wasn't a solution for this common common disease yep Yeah so basically uh for my daughter's diseases the there were no dedicated therapeutic options and when we started to understand why this exists we start to realize that the challenge was not finding a cure but rather funding them further when you actually look at the incentive structure within the pharmaceutical industry they often try to go after the largest potential diseases and deprioritize the balance but when there's 13 000 plus diseases out there it's really hard to get the industry to focus on more than just a few hundred so we saw this dual fold challenge of both Capital Capital Access but also incentive structure and Alignment to go uh have the medal to go find treatments for these sorts of diseases is the right mental model for understanding this is like especially when you say we know what the disease is we just don't have the Cure that sounds like one half the problem solved at the very least but it's about uh you know continuing on this Arc down to go to the other problem it sounds like the uh maybe a way to articulate this is that there is a long tail of diseases out there and with the current incentive structures of event venture capital and research and perhaps maybe insurance is involved that they don't really care or they care less about the system cares less about the long tail of diseases is that a way to articulate this I think you sort of hit the nail on the head because when you look at the incentive structure today a lot of these companies are valued based on the net present value of the drugs they pursue naturally that guides those medicines to the largest potential diseases as opposed to you know the remaining thirteen thousand where there's actually good Economic Opportunity a measurable amount of unmet need but just get de-prioritized in comparison and one of the areas that we've often seen this challenge emerge is as these medicines are being studied and developed as they approach what's known as an inflection point it becomes an opportunity for the company to prioritize and double down on usually the largest diseases and deprioritize the balance so to your earlier point the Venture Capital funding environment as well as the decision making and incentives just unfortunately de-prioritize these sets of diseases and we see new opportunities to be able to crush for there yeah and I think uh bankless listeners who have been listening to with us for a long time will probably understand there's some basic patterns that are probably about to emerge here uh first we're talking about Capital coordination and failures in capital coordination um what is crypto other than uh tools for coordination and when we talk about uh the long tail of things usually that is where these weird New Frontier Technologies actually get their way uh to get their start and so I'm assuming the audience and myself actually uh starting to see the seeds of how blockchain starts to work but before we started talking about how because again we're at the the bio uh week of zuzalu where bio meets blockchain is the name of this particular week so I think listeners can see where this goes but first I still want to do a full kind of autopsy of the system of incentives that has left that has created this failure mode in addressing the long tail of diseases can you really just walk us through the full problem set so we can really understand this problem for sure well so drug development is a very complex long-term highly risky Endeavor oftentimes it starts with the first process of discovery which is really trying to understand the root biology of a disease at the mechanistic you know whether it's the genetic or the cellular level in those circumstances whether it's an academic institution or an early stage biotech company you have scientists in a canonical lab trying to better understand the mechanics behind a disease and then hopefully elucidate a gap that you could potentially use to treat that disease from there there's a myriad of tools that have been developed over the past two to three decades from small molecules to antibodies Gene therapies to crispr that allow you to be able to then go and remediate that disease and those are then identified in that Discovery stage from there those medicines are then moved into what's known as pre-clinical development where you figure out how to manufacture it test it for safety and if it passes that bar you can then move into a clinical trial step most folks especially given the pandemic are probably familiar at a high level with clinical trials but you're essentially running an A B test if you will to use a software parlance of the drug versus no drug to see if the drug actually works to treat that disease and then ultimately if it does then governments the FDA regulatory authorities will allow you to then sell that medicine out and so when you start to break down that overall approach what ends up happening is that that Cascade uh ends up focusing the industry on those diseases where there exists a well-trodden path but those diseases sorry those medicines that pursue a well-trodden path are usually going after diseases that already have some treatments that are already out there in the totality of time however we're also starting to see is that diseases themselves whether it be a cancer or an Autism or IBD are actually not one large disease but actually are composed of hundreds of little diseases so we're seeing this other broader industrial shift away from sort of one drug to try and treat everything and often poorly but rather very targeted very specific medicines that treat very explicit diseases out of the gate so this is sort of the overall landscape overall I'd say there's probably 1.2 trillion dollars a year that are invested in Pharmaceuticals every year and maybe almost 80 to 100 billion dollars a year in just in the r d phase as a whole so a lot of opportunity I think to drive efficiency but also I think a lot of opportunity for uh communities to also play an important role sure yeah and and the intuitively every time there's a step that a one of the in this process of creating a cure for a disease that probably makes the longest part of that long tail less and less viable right so every new step is just more cost and we we reduce the ability to go and we have to you know not risk too much we can only risk a little bit every time new steps get created what would you say is uh the most critical step in this that has removed the most of the long tail yeah is it I might guess that it's the FDA in regulation but I won't speak for you what are the big steps here that we should focus on yeah you know I think the uh items that I would highlight is this broader concept of inflection points okay unlike the software world or even web3 where you can get incremental users easily uh in the biotech World value is created by these highly binary events known as inflection points an inflection point is essentially a piece of data or an experiment that helps produce an understanding around a given medicine and supports its continued advancement and investment some example inflection points that are in the drug development process are when you prove in a Petri dish that this candid medicine actually could treat a disease or you do so in an animal model or you do so in a human like in a clinical trial those are example inflection points and I'd say some of the key gaps that often emerge are in this process not only the fact that there's multiple of them as you pointed out but getting medicine into patients is usually a very expensive and time intensive Endeavor and as you start to go down this long tail there are fewer and fewer people that you can actually go and collaborate with to actually run those trials which makes it even longer and more expensive and so as a consequence I think you see people wanting to mitigate that kind of risk and focus on those better trodden paths okay so it's it's you wouldn't say there's any one particular obstacle it's more of this again the holistic system just doesn't produce the resources and the connections that need to happen yeah it's Death By A Thousand Cuts unfortunately right okay well that's the worst kind of problem yep okay so let's go into the solutions like and so we can talk about uh five bio a little bit here but then also just high level uh again using the principles that we've talked about at bank list maybe we can keep that in that theme of just like uh Capital coordination and you know going and Expediting the process and and attacking the long tail diseases so where does this conversation start when we talk about the solution here yeah well you know I think we're really fortunate that I think Vibes approach has drawn a lot of inspiration from how uh patient communities have actually remediated these issues in the past so if you actually reflect on the past half century of drug development there's been many circumstances where um medicines were actually not developed by VCS or by the FDA but actually patient communities themselves I'm assuming out of their own raw need for the solution exactly right when no solution exists and the existing institutions don't see it to be viable patients themselves have rallied together in the form of a community often instantiated initially as a charity raise money philanthropically and then invested in drugs and Drug development themselves so some of the most canonical medicines medicines we think about uh the vaccine for polio treatments for Cystic Fibrosis forms of hypertension Etc were actually backed not by the FDA or by uh traditional institutions but actually by these patient communities so and just intuitively I'm guessing that events like this that happen are probably for addressing diseases and solutions to diseases that are probably just just further along on the frontier than the long tail right not still not super far out but still like close enough because that's probably what R is the next most viable kind of disease it's my intuition right here I think you know you're hitting an important point because oftentimes the Legacy institutions look at numbers today around a given disease in that long tail but time and time again what we've seen is that the medical establishment under diagnosis a disease when no treatment exists because you never want to give false hope interesting to but the moment a medicine actually comes to the Forefront around a given disease you see this magical expansion in the overall number of patients cystic fibrosis is one of the most canonical examples because in this specific circumstance dating back several decades ago there are only about uh you know a few thousand patients known in the United States the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation which was founded to find a treatment for Cystic CF ended up funding to the tune of tens of millions of dollars a company called Aurora biosciences whichever eventually became vertex Pharmaceuticals today through an acquisition and brought the first set of medicines to the table for CF after that set of medicines uh were brought to Market and awareness was grown we saw the patient population roughly 10x over that period of time because Diagnostics improved so even those diseases that we think are long tail actually once properly vetted and diagnosed actually become pretty substantial right so it's almost like just a search problem right exactly right yeah and so what we've also started to see is that this same model with the cff has pursued has a led us to again things like the vaccine for polio treatments for forms of hypertension and I think this broader concept of communities come together coordinating Capital have led to not only transformative medical outcomes but huge financial wins right vertex Pharmaceuticals is an 80 billion dollar market cap company that does almost seven billion dollars a year in Top Line all from about roughly 10 000 patients globally in CF United Therapeutics which is started by Martin rothblatt does over a billion dollars Top Line initially started uh focusing on pulmonary arterial hypertension etc etc there's many such examples where these are transformative medical and financial outcomes um when uh operated this way okay so I cut you off to go down that little rabbit hole as we were talking about the solutions here so maybe let's pick up that that thread yeah uh let's just can we can continue going down what what vibe bio is and and how the puzzle pieces all come together absolutely so what we saw is that model of Community Driven drug development as being a true inspiration for what we do at Vibe and so Vibe bio essentially wants to take those that model and put it on steroids so Vibe is essentially a community of patients and scientists that help identify and fund treatments uh and specifically treatments to move them through an inflection point so we have a broad-based group of communities that we partner with as well as patient Charities and science drug Developers that help us identify and vet these high potential medicines that exit inside biotech companies academic institutions Etc we then Provide Capital to be able to help Advance those medicines at the point where it's hardest to get Capital to then ensure that those medicines are able to show their potential and then be able to recoup our investment once they're able to obtain proper sources of funding so we're really so it's an investment vehicle it's a it's a way to allocate Capital to invest in uh the opportunities that Vibe has identified are good Financial opportunities that are also targeting diseases and cures for diseases that are not being targeted by the current institution exactly or you know near and dear to my heart are sort of rare and overlooked diseases which about half of the projects we're evaluating right now are sort of in that space But we see a broader opportunity where this challenge of medicines sitting on a shelf as it approaches an inflection point is a common problem across many different diseases and so we see an opportunity by which we can help unlock capital and help ensure our medicine gets a shot on goal okay so uh where does the blockchain element fit into this where's the crypto element happen so you know when we started we saw a huge opportunity to empower patient communities uh because of the work we've seen from other organizations as a form of Charity but what we saw is that in the current instantiation of whether it's a C Corp or academic lab or charity you have inherent limitations some of those limitations include how many people can participate and have ownership limitations in terms of the types of and quantity of capital that you can access as well as the risk tolerance of that capital so what we see is actually a dow is a really unique construct because it allows you to have essentially infinite scalability of ownership and participation especially amongst the patients themselves second it allows you to leverage something like tokens to be able to raise meaningful sums of capital from a source which is both looking to take on big projects and take big swings like in crypto also provides liquidity but then third and finally is that we see it as an opportunity by which any proceeds from those medicines can flow back to the community to be reinvested in the next generation of projects so we see Dows in these sorts of communities and that approach as being a very high potential uh way to kind of scale a scale of development medicines in this way and that's why our mission at bio is to find every cure for every community would it be fair to classify Vibe as um it's just a an investment an investment now I think uh we initially would sort of see it as a capital deployment approach that enables this source of this approach to financing that we call inflection point financing and I think our hope is to be able to then enable investment Dows to come in and take advantage of that model unlike a traditional uh investment Dow one of the other pieces that we're also starting to build is technology to allow us to evaluate rapidly these high potential projects because one of the issues that emerges as capital allocators is often adverse selection right and I'm sure that's something that you know a lot of your listeners have probably seen across a myriad of other thousand projects so we see our remit as being not only advancing this approach to financing around inflection points but also building the tools to make sure that Dows and communities can make good financing decisions can we just go do the um just the anatomy of ibio right and like we'll go through maybe there's like a big like step one step two step three that we could talk about like how do we how do we understand the story arc here yeah so let's uh so maybe take a step back Vibe as an entity is about nine or so folks about one-third one-third one-third one-third on the community and marketing side one-third in the drug development side and one third on the software and Engineering side and so as a team we are actively engaged and partnered with biotech Venture Capital firms biotech Founders patient communities who oftentimes are in the flow of high potential medicines that just aren't quite ready for a larger round of financing or proper partnership say bigger pharmaceutical companies so we are receiving proposals from them at basically every day of high potential medicines that with a modest amount of dollars hundreds of thousands maybe a million or two million dollars could actually get some real uh pivotal data to advance that medicine so that's sort of Step One is sort of the Partnerships and the ecosystem that we're looking to build to be able to identify those high potential medicines second step is diligence in this case we sort of run two processes in parallel one to look at the financial plan of those candidate medicines and to evaluate its potential but then second is to go and do a deep dive and enabled by our scientific Community to ensure that the scientific rationale is solid and that the scientific plan around obtaining that data is viable this is I think the hardest part because today a lot of that work inside pharmaceutical companies and Venture Capital firms is highly laborious takes months on end and is Laden with friction right this is I think another area where communities especially Dallas of domain experts can actually expedite and rapidly evaluate projects at scale third is finally financing so once for those projects that sort of exceed a certain bar that we decide to fund as a community we then release funds uh to that organization and do so in a partnership with an external service provider who's going to run that experiments and obtain that data for the biotech so that's sort of the three-step process proposals diligence and then eventually funding so to put this into different terms is the first step like um like deal flow sourcing except for diseases right and so like what is the best disease that we can identify that we think that we have a viable path to create a cure for and that's Step One is like deal flow but with these diseases and opportunity identification for the best diseases that aren't being yet addressed by the fat tail that are on the long tail so Step One is like disease deal flow yes um step two is like okay let's Pro let's push that through the due diligence process let's stress test this let's make sure like we can have the assurances that this is a good investment and then if it passes that then it's actual investment exactly right and then and then that's when like you finance what is a disease startup which is like um what it takes to make a cure and then that cure if that gave that is secure successful is owned by the bio org and that is the way that the bio has like profit or Capital generation yeah great question so we're we initially had uh started out when we launched about nine months ago spinning up new biotech companies around these candidate medicines investing and building out teams to pursue them oh cool yeah I still believe that to be a long-term path in terms of how we can enable communities to pursue medicines and enable the focus on those diseases what we're doing at the moment and what we found greater scalability is that many of these high potential medicines already reside within biotechs that have a team Capital Labs Etc but oftentimes as these biotechs approach an inflection point their boards are trying to focus them in on say The Highest Potential medicine because they lack Capital to pursue the others in parallel so instead of us say taking on the medicine that team already has the expertise the infrastructure and the know-how so we're actually doing is providing them with access to Capital to run drugs two three and four in parallel with the uh the first one and then when that institution is able to get to the next round of financing we're then paid back for the amount that we had shared risk on and then would be the idea is like for these new companies that are generated you have some sort of stake in them correct and but and they're they only exist because they have economic viability probably because they've identified a cure for a disease that is in need because that's what the original process was for exactly right and so this this is like kind of an org of org sorts of things where every single New Aura comes out is has decent assurances that it's going to be a viable uh Capital Growth org yeah I'd say so I think the interesting thing is that when you look at sort of the incentive structure because a given biotech is Advanced the point where I can pursue save one high potential medicine they often tend to aggregate to a few hundred sort of diseases out of the Thirteen thousand in our case now through our financing mechanism we can actually enable them to have multiple shots on goal to becoming a successful biotech because if you only have one medicine you're working on that's a lot of risk right that you're putting on the organization so what we're seeing is that our inflection point financing model allows these biotechs to not only get to the inflection point but second increase the chances that they get there and if they do and they have multiple drugs that work have outsized value once they do so it becomes a really exciting model I think longer term and one that we've been getting a lot of really positive feedback at this conference and elsewhere about right is it one more time this uh where does the actual a dow element so the this is what I don't think there's much of a blockchain here it really just sounds like there's some governance decisions and that's really the main application of the crypto world to this yeah so I'd say right now we're just trying to get the basics of the business model working so we have yet to launch the token and formally instantiate the Dow unfortunately being based in the US there's a big regulatory love to hear your thoughts on that at some point today but um yeah so we're right now currently trying to get the mechanics the diligence process and the tooling right in order to be able to scale up the model without using tokens so one of our investors is Ryan selkis uh from asari yeah yeah I'm sure this one you know as well oh yeah uh you know one of the things he's mentioned to me in a recent call was that he views tokens like fuel he's like if you have a dumpster and you add tokens to it you're gonna have a dumpster fire but if you have a rocket ship then you'll get Rocket Fuel and then reach the stratosphere and the analogy he was trying to make is that you have to ensure that both your community and your core economics and business model are sound before you add tokens to the mix certainly um to ensure that you can actually start to scale things up and make good decisions long term so that's why we've been really methodical over the past nine months to focus in both on our technology products as well as our community build to help find really exciting drug programs is it too early to ask like what the mechanism of the token does a little too early at the moment but I think uh thinking of it as a governance token sure um if we choose to launch one in the future when we choose the launcher in the future it's probably the right mental model yeah but right now we're sort of instantiated as a c-corp with a cash off our balance sheet and a few High net worths and so that's what a lot has allowed us to get some pretty good momentum and hopefully initially pre-wrap this model to then be able to extend out using a token potentially in the future okay so the original process they were talking about the three the three three steps to deal flow the due diligence and then the the financing that is what be would be governed over I'm assuming right in the future thing yes you got it beautiful uh so we're proving it out in a centralized way initially when the first couple in a scrappy lean way and then intend to translate that over to a more formal Dao or other sort of vehicles over time why does it need to be transferred over why can't that just be contained to The Experts um I think the diligence process for sure should be but the part that we've seen as we spent time with over a thousand patient uh families patient Charities is that patient communities I believe having been the father of one that they should be involved in two facets of the drug development process most importantly prioritization and capital allocation and I think diligence for sure should be pursued by experts but ultimately the final sort of uh check to be written I think patients should have a seat at the table for okay and that would mean that they they have a say in governance correct right and so do you know maybe again too early but how would they get their hands on tokens in order to have that governance power so some of the things that we have been talking about in the industry for the past couple months has been uh looking at the overall tokenomics and the allocation of tokens enabling patient communities themselves to have a pretty measurable if not the largest stake in uh an Adele itself and the way we would do that is instead of giving it directly to individual patients because that's hard to to vet is in the U.S especially many of these diseases that don't have treatments are instantiated as 501c3 Charities so we can actually provide tokens and allocation to the patient Charities themselves the foundations and enable them to be part participants and owners in the process such that not only can they govern but they can also capture some of the upside if the overall project is successful so without um knowing really the specifics of the the full role of the token in this org when did you have the aha moment about using crypto tools to help facilitate this and what really brought brought the idea of using a dow to the table for you yeah you know I think that really happened in in mid 2021 after my daughter was born because I had started getting into crypto a few years prior um what really excited me personally was the Vibe for a lack of better phrase uh within the crypto industry and web 3 more broadly and it's potential I think it has to sort of rewrite Wall Street and how money flows but then when my daughter got sick what I knew after having peeled back the onion on this industry and some of the challenges is that we truly need ownership to extend to people other than those who are purely financially motivated and second we also need participants who who are who want to inherently take big swings and when you start to think about those two requirements when my wife and I looked at other sorts of vehicles a c-core a foundation an academic lab they all had gaps and only a dow and web3 really enabled those two in the long term so you know we saw that as The Telltale that that was the Technology stock we should be building on and those are some of the principles that we should be bringing in from the get-go and these other sort of canonical examples like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation the March of Dimes I think just further cemented that from a community standpoint sure so it was more maybe it was less about the these specific Technologies are exactly what I need but is the community ethos and the community culture that is what you want to align with and what you want to attract and so perhaps that was why why you were more open to adopting crypto Tools in a time where other people found it kind of unsavory Yeah well yeah I think that's a fair statement I think I'll be candid that you know I think of myself first and foremost as the father of a sick kid and in that circumstance I'm not dogmatic about what technology I use I want to go solve the problem and it just so happened that I think uh web 3 Dao's Community oriented coordination tools I think are the ones that are going to have the best long-term potential and are is the direction we want to head in and I think the broader industry does too so what other piece have we touched on every single piece of the story here or what stone have we left unturned no I think we hit on a lot of the key pieces you know I'd actually love to ask you a question which is um you know you sort of mentioned the the volatility in the web 3 space and the regulatory environment yeah you know that's one of the challenges I think we face today and why we're in part taking our time and being really diligent on any sort of white paper and uh tokenomics is because of the regulatory uncertainty at least in the United States curious to hear what you've been seeing given your your perch across the industry sure yeah so the again without without too much details there seems to be some of the common patterns found here so we have a governance token uh we have this organization that invests in Opportunities and then hopefully Harvest those opportunities to be reinvested back to the org to invest further which means capital appreciation if that means that we're putting this thing and that is being governed by the token like the equity the word equity and governance token are pretty similar and so like my regulatory ears are definitely perked and so but also at the same time uh that relationship between like coordination between Capital financing the long tail of not just diseases but Planet everything planet Earth right there's so many long tail things that humans haven't discovered yet like this is why we use we're on the frontier at bank list like we're on every Frontier right now we're talking about the frontier of these diseases that haven't been addressed yet uh and so like using crypto as capital coordination tools along with tokens for incentive alignment and giving upside to communities which is one of the core Primitives of this space like that is what we are here to do and then sadly Gary Gensler comes into this conversation and says hi hello no you can't do that which is really sad right and one of the big um themes that I've noticed while like listening to the talks over at the synthetic bio and the longevity um longevity tracks and talks is that man the FDA really messes everything up and I I don't find it any like it's not a coincidence that like the crypto industry is frustrated with Gary Gensler the longevity Community is frustrated with the FDA it's like man top down regulation really comes in and hampers a lot of progress and Robs a lot of opportunity here so with regards to the regulatory conversation like I mean I'm not a lawyer and I don't really have too much advice for you other than just like yeah you're kind of like pushing up against the boundaries here and not that I want to encourage any sort of just like violating the law but at some point sometimes it it takes the Bold to push the frontier and I think the crypto industry is gearing up to fight back against Gary Gensler and we are currently coinbase is currently doing that and uh you have a bunch of time it sounds like before you enter The Fray and so a lot of new things could have happened by then um but it's stories like this and examples of what we could do had we the freedoms that we desire in the crypto space to unlock opportunities like this is exactly the kind of stories that need to be told to the world yeah um so it's just a matter of uh earning hearts and minds of the people to say hey Gary Gensler like back off because even members of the SEC are saying that to him right and so it's really just this one Rogue actor we don't I don't even want to call Gary Gensler the SEC he just happens to be in the biggest chair so that was kind of a rant without any specific answer but those are those are all my thoughts for you yeah well I think to be candid I think you hit the nail on the head in terms of how the technology can be better under understood and better integrated into broader Society at least in the US where I think it really comes down to individuals and them speaking up about the value it creates for them you know as silly as it sounds I think the analogy that I often think about is actually Uber when it first launched right in 2008 2009 2010 you know I remember when it launched in the DC Market uh the local government came in and shut down who were they even arrested and impounded one of the early black cars yeah that were on the Uber Network and so what ended up happening and why did Uber end up becoming as successful as it is today and pervasive even though it was illegal in many cases same with Lyft right I think it was because the value to the End customer was so obvious and the pain points so large that and the opportunity is so great and the Opera and the Market's so large that everyday Americans found value and use in it because they couldn't find a safe and accessible mode of transportation from point A to point B and now this magic piece of software like Uber or Lyft gave them that and they were willing to vote people out of office who wanted to take that right away right and so I I don't think it was easy by any means for Travis or John or any other folks there but I think it was a circumstance where the world recognizes that this need to exist it created real value and therefore was willing to advocate for it and I think crypto is at that point now where it needs to find that same set of opportunities and that same connection to the everyday American and you know maybe it's D5 maybe it's Desai maybe it's uh something else we haven't discussed yet but I think that's really the key point I think you sort of nailed it hit the nail on the head in that regard yeah and I think it's important for the listeners to really imagine that um we're talking about this one particular use case which is attacking the long tail of disease to get new solutions for that and that is one application of human coordination and capital coordination that of many of a full spectrum and so think of this story that you've heard today bankless listener as one of another set of long tail applications that are across the entire space of capital coordination and what is at the root of all things which is money in capital right and so it's not just prevention of uh already known diseases and solutions for already known diseases that's that we're talking about that's just one of one of many uh applications on a long spectrum of possibility that is being hindered by being able to connect Financial upside with long tail solutions for long tail problems I completely agree and I think the part that intriguing the most about the long tail is that when you are in a circumstance where you're not being prioritized or valued by Legacy institutions I think Dao's become a really interesting structure because it empowers communities who care about that problem right who didn't have a voice prior exactly now it gives them tools it gives them people right and it gives them capital and I think those are the pieces that are absolutely critical to tackle everything from climate change to uh diseases to you know who knows what else alok thank you so much if people are further intrigued by going down this particular rabbit hole for for uh by bio where should they go yeah you can us out on our website at Vibe bio.com that's v-i-b-e-b-i-o.com or you can check us out on Twitter we're at Vibe bio who do you want to hear from the most what kind of talent or or person out there what's the archetype of the the that you're really missing that you need to talk to we're looking to talk to any biotech company or academic scientist who has a high potential medicine they see the future and how it can help patients but are struggling to be able to get that compound to an inflection point to raise traditional Capital we'd love to be able to help support any biotech company with a promising drug in that regard to get to an inflection plane a lot thank you so much thank you cheers [Music] thank you
