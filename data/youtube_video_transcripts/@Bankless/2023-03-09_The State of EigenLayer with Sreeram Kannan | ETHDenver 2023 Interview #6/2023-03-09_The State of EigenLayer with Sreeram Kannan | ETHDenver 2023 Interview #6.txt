[Music] thank you we are at the axillar interoperability series next up in this conversation we're talking to sriram from eigenlayer I think you probably might not need to know what eigenlayer is because it has absolutely swept the web 3 world by Swarm at least the ethereum world because it's created this thing called restaking where you can apply your e-stake to more things than just ethereum shaking getting a lot of the ethereum community very very excited and it's also allowed for new kinds of chains to be interoperable inside of the ethereum ecosystem so we're gonna go talk to Sri Ram right now all about eigenlayer and where eigenlayer is in its development but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023 why because Kraken has been around for over 12 years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry trusted centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable with over 9 million users and not a cent lost choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no-brainer we need exchanges like Kraken to provide the on-ramps to get people to go bankless and cracking emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor if you're unsure about your centralized exchange or on-ramp perhaps open an account with Kraken today and if you're unsure about the rest of web3 well then maybe you should get your learn on with metamask learn learning about crypto is hard there's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry until now metamask learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about web3 if you are a company trying to onboard employees or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your Boomer parents metamask learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons making learning about web3 fun and easy now once you're through kraken's Gates and you've taken the metamask course on what's a DEX you're safe to make your first stop into the world of defy where better to start other than uniswap uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps but it's now also an nft aggregator as well making uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading Tech that's out there uniswap's a big announcement at East Denver is their uniswap wallet which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big old bully about crypto apps in the App Store uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem so if you want to use uniswap but with the cheapest possible fees then use uniswap on arbitrone the arbitrum layer 2 is the host of ethereum's most vibrant defy and nft communities arbitrary is already surpassing the eth layer 1 in transaction volume and it's not even close to full capacity with so many vibrant communities on arbitrum arbitrum is a good place to call home for the era of layer twos speaking of settling into new homes the Phantom wallet is now available on both ethereum and polygon that's right the number one wallet on Solana is expanding into the ethereum ecosystem Phantom is the one wallet for everything displaying nfts making nft trades swapping tokens staking tokens so if you're a multi-chain surfer or an nft power user then the Phantom wallet is for you it also comes in Mobile check it out at phantom.app now let's get into the interview alright Banco station we are back at the axlr interop summit and I'm here with sriram from eigenlayer stream um last time we talked at Devcon not many people knew about eigenlayer now it seems everyone knows about eigenlayer uh how does that feel it's a little bizarre yeah it was it's definitely a more positive outcome than we anticipated we did expect that over time people will warm up to the idea that actually ethereum can serve as the security layer for pretty much anything but the speed at which the community has gotten there may be partly thanks to you and the episode we did earlier but uh really happy to be here in this position okay so give us the the lay of the land for where we are in the progress of eigenlayer because everyone starts being able to wrap over their heads around it people are starting to see the use cases but like win main net is that the right question yes yeah uh we definitely want to be on mainnet by Q3 this year okay so we are and you know that'll be a test Night by Q2 this year so public test net we already are on private testnet as as I told you before and the on the team side we've been growing our team quite a bit so if any of you out there are Builders or you know want to grow the ecosystem any of these things do duping me at the eigen layer handle uh on the product side we've been continuing to build the core platform and the way we're thinking of doing the launch is because it's such a complicated platform with many sites like stakers node operators you know new Services Roll-Ups you know all these different sites so we want to onboard one side at a time so we may start with stakers operators services do a phased launch so that's that's what we're hoping for and so eigenlayer has just generated a ton of excitement the concept of restaking has really opened people's brains to new use cases and new ideas it's what have people already approached you guys saying Hey I want to build on eigenlayer what's that been like and what are people trying to build yeah that's it's been really again very very enthusiastic response we have people interested in building a decentralized sequences people interested in building oracles Bridges you know because you can move data in and out of ethereum using the restaking layer now you can have IBC Bridges or other kind of light line Bridges you can have like Fast ZK proof verifications or some of the major ZK teams are interested in can you have like thousands of dap Roll-Ups all right to like a kind of intermediate restate layer where the restrict layer just checks the ZK proofs very very fast and reports that back to ethereum so those are some examples we're also seeing interest from RPC providers some of the bigger ones as well as new players we're seeing interest on AI on like ethereum like you know can we get a chat GPT type thing to be built instead of having a single Central party like the open AI server serving it can we have the ethereum decentralized nodes serving open source versions of AI on eigenlayer so that's the range of Interest we are seeing it's it remains to see how much we can support like right now we are like constrained by engineering bandwidth and the ability to support these we want to support all of them but whether we can support them on day one is the thing that we're trying to figure out yeah and what's the strategy there because if you want to support them that requires resources there's only so many people at the eigenlayer team it's the strategy to I'm assuming the strategy is to be able to allow anyone to permissionlessly build on eigenlayer maybe that's what mainnet is what's the strategy to enable anyone who wants to build online or to build on iron layer so we are building a set of developer tools so that like when you're developing a metal wire what is the specification to which that should comply and trying to build a series of libraries I don't expect the day one when we launch on mainnet it is going to be easy for anybody to build on uh I can layer maybe the initial launch should be very restricted but over time in a year or so we want to be in a position where many many other teams have built something at least on test net on ILS when something like this so I can raise is Raising around at a 500 million dollar valuation which when something like that happens a lot of people focus on that I was like wow that's that's clearly a very big deal all of a sudden you really change the game have you seen eigenlayer competitors start to like crop up just to you know follow in the footsteps no I I don't know of any I'm sure there are some yeah which we don't know about but uh the uh you know competition is healthy so if other people want to build you know that's always a possibility uh and uh the the way we think about like a Marketplace for decentralized trust from ethereum is the more the amount of stake and the more the validators that opt-in that increases the power of the marketplace sure and having a common Marketplace is I think in general more beneficial to the ecosystem so that's our view but of course you know it's a permissionless Innovation We Stand by our values yeah of course of course and uh bankless listeners who are listening to sriram for the first time might be confused as to what we're talking about we did kind of skip forward ahead of what eigenlayer actually is uh but I definitely would encourage you to listen to our talk at Defcon where we really went through this quite a lot sure on what I've been the metaphor I've been using to explain eigenlayer is like Skyrim mods uh and so like you have the base game the base Skyrim game the vanilla game which is like base vanilla ethereum staking but then you add in another mod to add on to that base game to do something else to do something extra that is beyond staking that's using the base game as a as a as a platform the cool thing about Skyrim mods or maybe the bad thing about Skyrim mods is that you can only add so many but think before things get really really weird I'm assuming that is probably the right mental model to have don't add too many mods because things will start to conflict is that kind of is that the right intuition I've got yes I think like you know if you look at the range of services several services will be supported by small groups and you'll have a long tail of services supported by oh you know I go I got these validators to run this for me or this group of stakers but there'll be some Services which are core to the ethereum ecosystem like a hyperscale data availability like uh most performant ZK Bridge like a performance light Clan bridge to the cosmos ecosystem these like a super performance decentralized sequencer and a super fast settlement layer there are some Services which will be core ecosystem Services which we expect everybody should run so I will agree to the extent that we are talking about services that are run by everybody there'll be a few sure but there will be many many services run by a few people so that there is a possibility for a service to be bootstrapped and emerge up to the system level rather than the system level being guarded closely and I would agree also with this is going to have unpredictable second order effects right yeah it very much is reminiscent of the Mev Discovery by the flashbots team right early on in 2016 2017 that like this is going to be a force and it is going to happen and like the only question that we can think of as a community or the ethereum community is how do we Channel this energy in the most useful way possible so that it's a positive sum game for all of us so that's something we're very much aligned to and always solicit ethereum communities inputs on so one question I haven't we're at this interoperability Summit and this is hosted by axler which is this brand new blockchain that I've been learning about today uh which is an IBC chain that connects Cosmos to ethereum but also all the other blockchains and that's a lot of the main uh threat of this whole entire event is interoperability between many many desperate chains away from ethereum layer twos away from the evm standard but still put uh interoperability between all these trains now this is a conversation the question I'm about to ask you is a conversation about the push and pull between a horizontal mesh landscape of change which is kind of the cosmos polychain multi-chain Vision versus concentration done onto one single train which is perhaps the eighth Maxi or network effects vision that Ryan and I tend toward to lean into now I'm not I'm not I don't think it's so binary I think the answer somewhere in the middle but I think that eigenlayer pulls towards the ethereum central one chain one dominant chain because of what eigenlayer can do for e-staking in providing security and I'm wondering how does that check with you do you think that will pulls forward pulls the pendulum in the ethereum favor definitely to the extent that there were some features that you know some layer once the the main thing that a general purpose layer one was trying to do was to say that there are some technical features not available in ethereum that we are providing B consensus be it like scalability be it you know the virtual machine and what we see with both the layer to vision and the deepening of the layer division with the eigen layer vision is that pretty much all of those things can be internalized back into the ethereum ecosystem so then why would one want a separate chain there may be other reasons other than technical Arbitrage that's how I view it is basically any Technical Innovations can be internalized back into the ethereum ecosystem this is I know analogous to think about companies right like when there is one search company and there's another search company if you know good ideas Google will internalize and and run it and the agile mechanism to do this is what eigenlayer provides and so competing purely on technical Arbitrage is not going going to be feasible you need other things you need a way okay you know I'm a dab and I want my sour knitting you need some other reason you know this is a different kind of community Cosmos has this vision of a community computer is like you know my Village my community like you know there's a group of artists and we are running this chain it's not up to Economic Security it's our own like reputation and stuff we are putting on the line so these are all Visions there is a vision of like a chain which could be like a prove a personhood chain right like there's a vision of like it's a proof of space change which can be more decent but all these visions of possible other L ones but technical Arbitrage or as like hey I'm running this proof of stake chain for these features this is better and I'm that's why I'm a new L1 I think that is going to become less and less possible with the eigen layer view I also want to add that since we're in the interop summit one important thing we have to think about as the ethereum community is how does ethereum position itself to be at the absolute center of the interop ecosystem right whether it is just layer twos are totally sour in Chains ethereum is the most secure chain it is the most liquid chain it is also the most connected chain how do we make sure we go from this to provide some of the strongest bridging to all of the other chains so we retain this position and that's something that I'm excited about eigenlayer can do that is to provide high quality bridging in and out of ethereum by running light plans off chain and having a lot of Risk Takers certified you can actually get a lot of you know very high quality bridging in and out of ethereum so ethereum can maintain the position as the premium Center Hub of this multi-chain ecosystem right and I really I think that's articulated very very well where uh like I said whether it's a mesh network of many many chains with no dominant Center or a single one Center focal point of one chain and no other chains after that it's not going to be to the extreme it's going to be somewhere in between those two binaries but I do think that this technology about eigen layer really does have that that sun of the solar solar ecosystem where all the other chains kind of gravitate around ethereum and eigenlayer allows that ethereum expression to expand outwards when people come up to you and ask you questions about the technical questions the really good questions about eigenlayer what are those questions uh the questions are one of the most interesting questions on eigen layer is it is a everything the crypto economics that you can import due to eigenlayer has to be on chain and slashable there are certain things that are launched and slashable and certain things that are not like for example if I want to build an oracle this is a simple example I give but if you dig in deeper the Oracle is one of the harder things to build on eigen layer the reason being when you try to build an oracle how do you create a slashing condition how do you know Bitcoin to eat is not one dollar today how do you know that in a non-chain verifiable manner are you going to trust a commit committee for it that feels like you know low grade sure but eigenlayer trust model is actually very Dynamic for example there are multiple dimensions of trust that exist and slashing or economic trust is only one dimension of trust there are other dimensions of trust and in the ethereum community we're very passionate about decentralization as a dimension of trust right it doesn't matter how much money you have like if there are thousands or tens of thousands of nodes validating and providing independent inputs it's very hard for them to collude and attack the system and that itself with a source of trust independent of how much money they have actually put in and this is the homesteaker each taker Vision the rocketpool vision of like everybody should be able to run a node and eigenlayer can supply the trust to things like oracles imagine an oracle price feed where like every homesteaker just provides a feed even if they're not like slashable right just the fact that 10 000 independent nodes actually vet at something is a source of trust so when we think about a Marketplace for decentralized trust the most important question is like what are the ways in which we commoditize decentralized trust stake each stake is one dimension of it another dimension is how do we vet and validate what are the whole who are the homesteakers how are we going to identify that sure this is another important question that we get yeah how are we going to identify that I think it's very hard to identify homesteakers it's very easy to identify the exchanges and the major liquids taking protocols and this taking service providers so the complement of it is already like a pretty decentralized set but we imagine the emergence of decentralization oracles oracles were just specialized like a chain analysis but an analysis of like where validators are how decentralized they are you know geographically and like agency wise like are they really independent agents people coming and wetting this and we don't want to be the source of like subjectivity one of the major platform goals of eigenlayer is to push all agency to the edges if you're a middleware you should dictate what kind of nodes you want to opt in because some would want economics some would want decentralization for us and we want the spectrum of decentralized just to be expressed on eigen layers so we imagine that different middlewares will have different subjective decentralization oracles and once you have that there may be additional yield accruing to these decentralized nodes so these these are the two I would say major questions what slashing do you do how do we get instant device decentralization on eigen layer so those are some of the questions it's not always when the hey what a question should I ask question actually works all that well but that one works pretty pretty well uh cerebrum if people have been peaked or they just want to learn about the frontier of eigenlayer where should they go uh right now the best place is the eigenlayer Twitter handle EIG and l-a-y-e-r but also the Twitter handle points to our forums discourse forums where we are inviting all the ethereum community members to participate and engage with us on any aspects of eigenlayer how that would enhance or deteriorate any aspects of the ethereum ecosystem we want to be cognizant of all of it so please we want to invite the ethereum community to come and participate there and slowly we'll be rolling out more and more ways to open up the eigenlayer development to the broader community and I'm assuming you're hiring or just looking for Partnerships what are you looking for on the PD and hiring front on the hiring front like distributed systems Builders you know uh smart contract Engineers always you know we want on a team like this especially now that there are a lot of teams who want to build stuff up on we want people internally who can support all of these really interesting creative things so we're looking for that on the BD and ecosystem growth side you know anybody who's creative in growing uh you know ecosystems like this definitely we want to talk to on the broader ecosystem we're looking for the various sides of our markets takers who have eat for staking eat and want to enhance yield we want to look at node operators you know the major node operators we are talking to them uh service Builders like whether it is Big existing services like chain link who want to add on an iot or you know the broader decentralization from the ethereum community or it could be services that are new and upcoming who want to use this as a way for bootstrapping and like differentiating themselves from existing Services we are very interested in talking to all of them so everyone thank you so much thank you so much thank you
