[Music] what's up coordination how you doing this episode today is going to be a really good one i we are doing it on git coin dao and it's governance evolution over the last year or so i've got linda zee a git coin dow steward kyle weiss the executive director of the get coin foundation and a moonshot collective work stream lead chris who does dao operations at get coin dao simona pop who does dow engagement strategy at get coin dao as guests of this episode this is not everyone who's involved in get coindial governance but it's a sample of them you can go to gov.getcoin.com if you want to see all the governance discussions this is just a tiny sample of why bitcoin dial was launched git coin dao governs get coin grants which is a funding mechanism for the ethereum community bitcoin dow's mission is to build and fund digital public goods it does that mostly with quadratic funding and get coin grants if you know anything about quadratic funding you know that it's the optimal way to fund a democratic community of public goods and it's because the every quarter on get coin bitcoin grants runs a matching campaign that matches contributions from the crowd usually about five million dollars are given out every quarter and one of the really powerful things about quadratic funding is that the matching comes from the number of contributions to each grant on git coin so you're basically getting rewarded for what your peers think of your project on git coin grants and that's really powerful because a one dollar contribution can be hundreds sometimes thousands of dollars of matching on git coin grants and that's powerful but it's also presenting presenting some governance problems what do we do about civil attacks people who make up new identities in order to get funds out of the matching pool how do we even allocate funds to the matching pool in the first place these are the governance problems that get coin had coming out of its ears in early 2021 on it and on may 25th 2021 about a year ago get coin dow launch to solve those governance problems so this episode is about how do you build and fund digital public goods but it's also about how do you govern a project that builds and funds digital public goods and so this episode is about get coindal launch we're going to cover get coindale launch and the past of get coindal for the so the last year or so we're gonna cover the present so what does governance look like at get coin dial today and what does it look like in the future and this uh the objective of this episode is just basically to daylight to to y'all the listener to you coordination about how a 300 person dow does governance in the year 2022 show off get coins path to decentralization and keep in mind as you listen to this episode that governance is evolutionary this is a snapshot in time of what's happening and the ecosystem is moving fast in this build market so i think that you can expect that if we do another episode in the year 2023 about governance at get coindao you'll see a evolution forward of what's been happening so without further ado i will introduce our guests the first voice you'll hear as we start the episode will be me followed by kyle weiss executive director of the get coin foundation really great episode i hope that you enjoy it without further ado i give you git coin dial governance the opera crypto

hey everyone what's up hey hey thanks so much for joining us everyone uh we are here to talk about git coin dao and the evolution of its governance it's been about a year since get coindale launched in may of 2021. kyle can you tell us about the why and the how of the dow launch on may 25th 2021 yeah for sure um thanks for having us i think we're excited to kind of tell a little bit more about bitcoin and how we got to where we are today so back a year ago i think we were really interested in solving some of the governance problems that bitcoin had around our grants program and sort of funding allocation specifically at the time we were a team that was trying to figure out you know how much money to appropriate to each of the different categories of grants that were on bitcoin and we recognized there's this really large opportunity to move not only the the platform the entire grants platform over to the community into the dao and what we aspired to be a dao at the time but also the decision making for how to allocate that funding um and to turn more and more of that control over to the community instead of you know the team that you and i were on as we kind of built and advanced that product so with the launch of the gtc and the token um we set out to decentralize a lot of the governance and decision making on the grants round specifically and also see if we could spin up different work streams um and empower people to help kind of grow and further and advance bitcoin's mission beyond just you know the core team that we had at the time right and so can you say more about the governance process that was launched i know that there was a proof of uh an airdrop with a proof of knowledge and then a proof of distribution uh how did that that airdrop set up the conditions for get coin dao at the start and what did governance look like at the start yeah great question so um whenever we first launched one of the things that we recognized is we identified the governance participation was really low and at the time we were trying to come up with ideas as to how to encourage more participation and how to make sure that these governance tokens which were were used to govern a thing and you know hopefully not to speculate on a thing um were actually used in that way and one of the things that bitcoin did is um you mentioned yes we had our airdrop where half of the total supply of the tokens went to those who helped us build and advance our mission to date and the other half were kind of set aside in the treasury to help further our mission in the future we'll talk about that half in just a sec but as part of the delegation or excuse me the airdrop experience we introduced delegation where for those who were coming in to claim their airdrop they either needed to self-delegate as part of that claim or they needed to pick a steward and stewards were somewhat new at the time um they're a bit more common now we're incredibly thankful that ens and optimism and others have started to pick up kind of that steward approach and the delegate approach but at the time claiming your tokens and actually delegating to someone as part of that that same kind of one-two click of the experience um was novel and i think it's one of the things that really helped us both identify who great stewards of our community would be that's what brought simona into our world that's what brought linda into our world that's what brought chris into our world is them showing up as stewards and delegates here um but then also enabled our community to help make sure that their voice was being represented as part of their airdrop so um tldr airdrop launched um it had a great experience like we invited people to the quadratic lands with us they were able to claim their tokens they could delegate to a steward and then we worked with those stewards um to make sure that we had a governance process kind of laid out and set up and that we had initiatives or work streams set up that we felt like would be great places to seed a lot of the growth of the dao and from that it's kind of been off to the races with our stewards helping lead and guide much of what the dow does from now on right and just for the listeners out there uh stewards is what git coin dao calls delegates um and then work streams are kind of the fundamental organized organizational unit of the dow and how work is getting done and the quadratic lands is the token distribution experience that get coindale launched with the quadratic lens being the mythical place that we're all going to go to if we're able to rewrite the rules of economic gravity with quadratic funding one of the best i still still love quadratic lens immensely i think it's awesome yeah yeah i agree and hopefully we can build out that lore uh over time uh linda i want to kick it to you next you have are a coin investor you've been a get coined out steward and you were there from the start uh curious if you have anything to add about the dow launch back in may of 2021 yeah um i was really impressed with how the launch went i thought it was um really well thought through one of the problems in the past of dao's is that there wasn't much voter participation and so i love that at launch there was a hundred percent delegation when you had to claim airdrop which i think was a first from what i saw or at least it was very early on and um i also loved that because the airdrop went to past users who had supported and contributed to public goods you already bootstrapped a very strong community that just had really really good values and i felt like the community was just almost filtered early on for people that cared about the long-term funding of public goods and so it was just um for me like a really thoughtful launch and i see a lot of future dollars replicating it but you can just tell like early on that the energy was really positive and the delegates that came through um really did care about the mission of the dow so just want to say thanks for that launch process yeah and it was really uh a lot of fun to have you linda become involved in governance and reviewing proposals um can you talk a little bit about your experience as a steward over the last year yeah um it's definitely been a learning process through the last year i think early on there were a lot of decisions to be made in the dow and over time we kind of started having more of the work towards the working groups and so we spent more time improving budgets rather than like smaller decisions within the dow which um while it's not necessarily my favorite part of like approving budgets on a regular basis i do think that it makes more sense from an efficiency standpoint um but it's it's also been i think a learning process in that we're starting to have more open transparent conversations um where early on like i would say that people are pretty generous about approving things and like kind of um just learning the process of the dao and a lot of us like didn't even know each other necessarily like there were a ton of people brought together from the stout like all over the world and we're just starting to learn how to work with each other and so over time you start being more open to having these tough conversations around hey like i don't necessarily think that this amount requested for this budget is um maybe the best use of funds um especially relative to the dow treasury this might not necessarily be ideal so like let's have a conversation around what's actually needed here and like we kind of iterate from there and so that's only kind of in my opinion been in a more recent situation like early on there were just more generous approvals and so i'm really glad with how we're just i think growing up as a dao i would say um and i think we're becoming more sophisticated in metrics and having compensation structures and just kind of figuring things out and i think simona and everyone here has just done a really great job of pushing for these conversations so it's definitely over a year like yeah we've just grown up a lot right we're gonna get into the scope of the governance rights that gtc imbues uh in the future but one of the main ones as you said is approving budgets and i know that that's been sort of up and down as the market has kicked around and as we figure out the essential intents of the dow i think it's a good opportunity to kick it over to simone pop at this point who's doing uh dow engagement strategy i get coined out now but at first i think started off as one of the top stewards in the dow so uh simona tell us about your entrance into get coindao and your impressions of how governance works there in the past present and future so um i i feel it was a natural um step in um my kind of work in web 3 to become one of the top stewards um my uh relationship with bitcoin has um you know has been going for what is it now four years so um we've had a long history and i think uh it was only natural when um the the doubt started that i would become a steward and apply to become a steward and then become a steward and a lot of people um felt that they could trust me and delegated uh their tokens to me that i appreciate um every day and uh hopefully i'm making the right decisions on their behalf um i think in terms of the a little bit to to what linda said the evolution of what governance looks like particularly because get going down was so early amongst the dows to play around with a lot of the delegation a lot of the stewardship a lot of the flows that really didn't and don't exist um for us to uh to utilize or to shape or to indeed purpose or or uh adopt for the uses of this now you have to create them from scratch and creating them from scratch is something that as i always say needs to come from a very very mindful place where you are constantly in this um dynamic of balance between attention and action and the attention part coming back to what both kyle and linda mentioned is very very difficult in this space we are incredibly incredibly uh tight on attention um there is so so much to focus on particularly for people who have been in this this ecosystem for a while um we have a lot a lot of interests um around the ecosystem because we all want to see it grow and evolve because the tide lifts all ships and i think it's important that you know we keep that in our minds as we evolve things but that balance between attention and action is something that in practice is actually pretty difficult to like really get right um and having people participate and participate in a meaningful way is something that needs to be addressed and um coast and and kind of um enabled by very very um clear flows which is again what linda was saying i feel we've been starting to implement a lot since like in the last um let's say six months um and i think we've really really seen that come through in the granularity of the decisions in the uh attention to detail in the conversations that we've been having which have been one of my favorite uh parts of this whole process just the care that goes into those conversations and potentially those debates where or i won't call them arguments because they are just debates around what is valuable what should be something that we do now versus a little bit further down the line and making sure that again we we balance all of those things out in an engaged and meaningful way and potentially creating standards that can help the the entire now ecosystem move forward is something that is um i feel a great responsibility for um and i feel is is very important for us to to continue evolving right absolutely uh chris would love to kick it over to you and uh hear hear about your experience working on get coindao over the last six to nine months yeah it's been an interesting experience so i um i joined the dao like at the very beginning um as a steward um and the dao actually started on my birth today so i'm never gonna forget that so that's that was like an epic moment it was like oh i'm getting tokens happy birthday yeah so it was like it was a great start to to see that getcoin went to the next level with starting the dow so i i was very much into this and then uh yeah very soon i uh joined as a contributor um working initially on community experience it was still being like we were still discovering what that exactly entailed um and i was i was yeah still discovering like how how i could add value and so the thing that came came about very quickly was like okay we need a body between somewhere between um on the one hand the stewards where we can make decisions about like okay we have budgets that we have for these work streams these these units these organizational units and then just the contributors who are just like coming coming with initiatives we need another uh body where we bring the different work streams together and make decisions so that became what is now um which is a mouthful so csdo so this is the cross stream dao operations call so we have a a very tactical call once a week and every two weeks we have a strategic call where we dive deeper and so in these two calls we make decisions as as a team so like in these calls there's two representatives per workstream most of the time it's like the work stream lead or the workshop leads and and there we ratify a number of things that we do not want to like bring to the stewards or we communicate it to the stewards but we we have decisions to make on a daily basis and so we bring these um on this level and then we communicate it to the stewards so that's what we do in cseo and that evolved uh quite a bit so um personally it was just a meeting but then very soon there was this entire work stream that developed around it and that is dao operations so because there's a lot of things that you can actually unify and that all the work streams need so that's like how do we how do we tackle things like accounting uh people operations um lots of things that that we see that this is impacts cross down so this became a work stream and so this tactical meeting the cso call became something that was really very much at the heart of it and then yeah it was really interesting to to experiment with this and see like how how can you actually take decisions as a team where nobody is the boss like before it was easy it was um there is uh there's just get going holdings and there is kevin owaki who is the ceo and there is a ceo kyle and then it was always a very collaborative environment it feels to me but now suddenly it's like okay nobody is in charge we all are so we experimented with different ways of doing this so um what um the first format of of of the call was uh using integrative decision making so that's like the holocratic way where like you have a process of asking um for making a proposal and then you go through a round of getting uh reactions and then integrating what the feedback is and then passing proposals so that is the first thing and uh from that so that's sociocracy holacracy we are now evolved to form it that is a nice template from the ready that we often work with and we call it an action meeting and this is more an evolution into a format where we have more of a sort of stand-up meeting and it's like okay i have this point and this is the next steps that i need and these are the outcomes that i want to get to and uh most of the things we try to do async because it has been mentioned before both for this viewers it's for the contributors uh there's always this fight for like the available time so we try to constantly optimize and get to a format that works for most of the people that counts for both work stream leads and contributors as well as stewards so that is that level that um i've been focusing most on great so cross stream dao ops is the body that is where work stream leads come together and make decisions with the context that they have and it sounds like it started off as a holocracy sort of consent based decision making the legitimacy comes from the consent of of the other people in the work streams um anything else to add about csgo chris yeah um no i think i think that kind of explains we can go deeper into into other parts of this but it's it's definitely it's a continuous evolution on figuring out what works so it's like we always end with our checkout where the main question actually is like how can we improve this goal um like the first one time we even asked like how can we improve it ten percent because that's the goal like all these processes need to evolve the entire time so it's it's been an interesting journey yeah dow governance has sort of been an iterative game has been what i what i've seen that might be a good segue into talking about seasons which i think maybe simona you might be qualified to do uh you want to tell us about how dow governance what it looked like when you came into it and how you organized it into seasons when you came in um yes so i think because we're talking about evolution right and we can go in the natural realm a little bit which i know that where we might do a little bit later but obviously seasons just makes a lot of sense when you think about cadence and to to make sense of a landscape or to make sense of something you want a particular pattern that you can recognize and you can move with and so aligning the budgets for work streams with grants rounds just made a lot a lot of sense in in terms of that attention versus action dynamic that i mentioned earlier because if the attention is on bitcoin for the grants rounds then we would want to capture that attention and that action and have it apply to potentially other things that are dow related or that are bitcoin related and so having this cadence that aligns with the grants just made complete sense in terms of um creating that pattern of it's happening from here to here this is the focus and this is what we're doing here is a list of actions that we take here um the the important dates here is when we make the decision here is how it flows and everybody is aligned with that i think the reason why that's very very important is again you want to make sure that the energy that people put in is used to its maximum potential whereas before you if it's not if it doesn't have a semblance of a pattern or some sort of organization it can very easily go in a lot of it but it doesn't it isn't directed properly and it can dissipate and it can cause frustration for everybody involved because if i have to come back to a proposal to proposals for six months every single day a different proposal that might not be beneficial because we are human beings we have rhythms we sometimes sleep we sometimes do other things which is okay and so having that cadence ensures that we have that balance that i mentioned earlier and it's important to have that and maintain it and evolve it so that we get even better at it so that was the reasoning behind seasons um and aligning things that way all right we just heard the reason behind the the reason seasons the seasons yeah i maybe what i would immediately makes me think of is like both being both a steward and a contributor that was personally very interesting to me because then when you're on both sides you see the amount of work indeed that stewards get with like the these these these three monthly reviews of budgets etc and that was like that's what what i think everyone on this call has just like also seen like when we constantly got this feedback of like okay how can we make this better and that's also where we're currently like evaluating like how can we maybe morph the seasons into a longer period or maybe do some other optimizations because it is a lot it takes a lot of people to actually really dive in and we do realize this because we we went through it ourselves and also just um to come back to that point and i know that linda you had a tweet earlier and it's so true in the beginning that there used to be these votes that would literally be put up for like three days and it would start on a friday and finish on a sunday at 12 am and you go give me a just like a tiny break and they're like i really had an opinion oh too late so the point when when you start thinking about these things and this is the big thing this is why we need to do this mindfully because you have to account for the fact that the technology is very powerful and it does many wonderful things but it's still people are still involved in it you cannot remove the human element from thinking when you're thinking about patterns and flows and things that you put in place you simply cannot and it only creates frustration if you are not mindful of these again seasons in people's lives the ups and downs the ebbs and flows it's important to account for those it's important to bait those in and yes sometimes it takes a little bit longer yes sometimes the vote is up for way too long two days too long or here and there niggling uh delays let's say but they are there potentially for a reason and when we evolve it we must find out what that optimum window of voting is and how do we do it and when does it happen and what are the steps before that so that again it all flows and it doesn't frustrate anybody or it doesn't stop anybody from genuinely making an informed decision and hopefully a valuable contribution not just to get point but again to this ecosystem and making sure that they are comfortable doing so not rubber stamping things because you're running out of time because you have 30 minutes until a vote closes right like all of those things and being um careful about how you align those things is very important if we want this stuff to genuinely become the things the thing that everybody replaces organizations with right thanks simone yeah i mean i think that we're you know we can kind of look at the seasons which every quarter there was a bitcoin grants round now there's a bitcoin grants round and there's a coin dow governance budget review proposal those are the seasons and if you look at this in an evolutionary perspective we've kind of got oh well the dow launched in may of 2021 2021 and uh there's been about four quarters uh going on five now of evolution you can almost think of the seasons as like a metronome it's it's it's an it's a an iteration of of doing uh hypothesizing doing learn uh getting

a natural discussion between these four panelists of of what was one problem that you observed or an opportunity that you observed and [Music] what attempts have gone into solving that problem and i can play host for the rest of the episode if we want but i'm hoping that it can just be sort of a natural conversation between between the four of us so uh anyone want to take a stab at that yeah um i think there was one that um i appreciated how we've evolved since the early days but um early on you'd have these snapshot proposals and people a lot of people just vote yes or no and then there's not much commentary or guidance on why they made that decision and so there's this lack of transparency to the person making that proposal and just other delegates slash stewards on on what's happening so over time i really appreciated people have been releasing voting guides on why they're voting for something or why they're voting against something and so now there's more transparent discussion on what's going on and i've tried to improve my process of now commenting on the proposals hopefully early on before it even goes to the snapshot vote but i think generally i'd love to yeah just for other dows see more uh transparency on that optimism is really early on in the starting of their dow and there's a bunch of major delegates that i haven't seen like and they carry a lot a large voting weight and i just haven't seen um any commentary on why they voted in certain way and so i'd love to see like gatecoin dao kind of um like influence these other dows to push for these like voting guide type proposals yeah i totally agree i think that that has evolved in the in really a good sense and will continue to iterate on this um and like by adding some rules to it like we have for example the thing of um a proposal cannot go to snapshot if not five stewards have commented and then um we refined that to like saying like if you are a steward but you're also in the work stream well we're not really going to count your vote or your comments so it's like these little things that we've tweaked to make sure that um then we get more input so that's one thing um i think the steward council that we now have which is which is like a selection of the stewards where we can dive a little bit deeper it's also a positive evolution there um that comes to mind and i guess the third one that immediately comes to mind is um is the bear market um i i really love it because like suddenly the stewards have become uh some of the stewards have become way more um yes really getting into big debates on like why are we funding this and i love it it's fantastic we should always have this whether it's a bull or a bear market like having these these very deep discussions is like does it actually make sense that we fund this or not and this actually led to deeper discussions within the work streams as well within csdo and like we really need to need to now fast track everything that has to do with what is the purpose of git going down what do we want to fund what are our main goals that we want to achieve so and that's the thing that then became what we now call our purpose and essential intents and so this is another tool that helps stewards to actually like evaluate does it make sense to um to actually fund this is this really aligned with the mission and the values and the goals of get coin and yeah i think there's lots of little steps that we're doing here and i think it's very much around this theme of transparency and making sure so this is one of my main goals that everything that we do is as transparent as possible and also as objective as possible when we make decisions about things which is why having clarity around the purpose and essential intent is important which is why having clarity on what the engagement is around the stewards and the stores that then become part of the steward council is there because again to linda's point there are so many people in the various different dows out there that i you have no way of knowing are they present are they taking time to look through the proposals to understand the impact of a budget request or some sort of funding request on the treasury of that particular dow is there a process what is the process and so for me having these things very very clear not just for the people within the dao but for the outside world for the ecosystem and potentially having it again as patterns that can be adopted and can be taken again open source containers for people to use to ensure that their decision making process and their governance process is as transparent and hopefully as flowing as we're trying to make the gitcoin one be and i think um ens recently well i think in the past couple of months they've actually um forked the steward health cards that we have that tracks engagement and tracks engagement in the last 30 days whereas before we had it all like lifetime now we're doing it in a way that you can actually see when somebody has dropped off which are absolutely fine that they have and if they have again things happen you your attention goes elsewhere that's absolutely fine but everybody delegating and everybody involved should know or should be able to see and so i was really really pleased to see them forking it and really focusing on okay this is a bit of tooling that actually is very very important particularly if we want to move towards a fluid governance model right again coming back to accounting for the fact that we are all humans and we want this to work but also want to maybe sleep sometimes so it's like it's a very very um i would say a very nice and really kind of fast evolution i would say like i have these things that we've put in place but again in the last six months or rather a little bit less even um since february when we started putting all of these things in place i think has been really really good yeah maybe mentioning the the health cards like um that this is something what it actually is so we used to call it like the stewards report cards but that that sounded maybe a little bit too high schooly so that's like the health cards and it gives like a score on like how well stewards are doing in the sense of like it it takes a number of elements into account like how many times you have um responded on the forum how many times you have voted how many votes you actually have delegated to yourself etc and it gives you this activity score that that is a really good i gives a good representation of how active you are as a steward but actually that's in the beginning it used to just be the voting and i believe some sort of forum activity and the reason why i really wanted us to evolve that is because there are so many stewards who are also contributors there are so many stewards who are also part of some of the work streams so we started pulling some qualitative metrics not just the voting how many times have you done it because that's so easy okay i voted 10 times great i'm super engaged but coupling that with the comments with participating in the work streams with doing a lot of active engagement like being on the calls being on the steward calls being on the steward council calls and really having that a true finger on the engagement pulse has been very very telling on a lot of those metrics which is again wonderful to see i think one of the one of the problems that we tried to solve which you all have called out is that whenever we launched the token we had this awesome sort of claim and delegation experience but a lot of those delegates over a year's time period their interest has waned they've gotten involved in other projects they've been really focused on the merge like there's a number of things that have come up that just pulled people away and so building out those stewards report cards and setting them to the 30-day frequency have just been um a really great way for us to evaluate like who's actually active in community so that folks can go through and re-delegate so we can make sure that those stewards are active in the community still and those that are most active actually have the voice um to kind of represent what they want to see inside of the protocol development inside of the grants program itself as well um one of the other areas that really kind of stood out to me i think is mostly in like work stream mandates it's been interesting to kind of see how work streams have formed and sort of evolved over the year and then come back to like a core thesis especially during this build market as some folks have been staying during this bear i think that's one of the places where um you know we have very much appreciated more steward involvement and delegating to the stewards who are more activists to help align some of those incentives but i think um one of the things that's been great about this build market is it really has brought the dow closer together um whenever the dow first launch we sort of saw like this explosion of autonomy across work streams and i think a lot of the dao is starting to realize that like oh if we coordinate if we work together like we can get to a better collective outcome than like my work stream could on its own and it's like whoa like that's not mind-blowing information here yet but um i think it's through some of the difficult conversations on you know evaluation of like the purpose of the dao and the essential intent like chris talked about but like we've been able to really focus and kind of move more together as a dao instead of in different directions as work streams so i've appreciated that evolution over time and um steward's helping guide us to that outcome and really just kind of getting closer and closer to that protocol state and launching you know git coins protocols as well i was going to say i can add another one that i feel like we're working towards improving but generally just compensation structures for delegates i'm it is a lot of work and it's a lot of time spent on this and i definitely want people to be in a situation where they're not feeling that you know just because the dow's not paying them they can't spend their attention on this even though they really care about what the dow is doing and so we are moving towards like we've had discussions around you know compensating at least the gas that people have spent on uh voting for these proposals which i'm really appreciative of i think that helps people because at one point gas was quite expensive um and then also just um we've had like a git coin payment um towards or a bitcoin token payment towards the council um but i think that amount can definitely be reevaluated but i would really like um yeah us to continue having that conversation around like how can we make sure people feel compensated for their time since it has been a year of of work from a lot of people and um many calls many forum reviews and stuff like that totally and yeah we yeah it's definitely something that that is top of mind to work on um so actually swann and i were also just discussing on the on on the entire thing of like we have so many stewards also who applied i think it's like 400 plus people right who also said like i want to be a steward but that we want to like re-engage and like check in with them and see like hey would you have time but then indeed like there is a question of like how do you incentivize them the steward card health cards is one but there can also be like a financial component to it but that needs to be like reasonable of course because we want we want people to to really come because they believe in the mission but at the same time like how do you um yeah also take into account that that we are still in a world where people um need to need to just pay for their living and if they spend a lot of time on this like how can we justify this so it is not an easy an easy subject but um it's definitely yeah very high on our list and it's a really interesting subject because like the the level of compensation that we all voted on i can't remember when it was maybe it was march or end of march beginning of april at that point was good and we chose the lowest tier out of the three tiers and so it's such an interesting dynamic because obviously in our space you have to account for that potential of a fluctuation if it exists or to take into account hey when we started with the council maybe we didn't envisage just how many hours it would be and so i think again just uh rewarding with more governance rights is something that is should happen right because you are involved you want to and you are consistently involved consistently engaged and so it makes sense to get even more governance rights but i think figuring out what a dynamic of or a combination could be that actually does incentivize people to give more of their time to this versus doing this in their free time and then trying to stretch something that can actually pay their bills and and this is i would say is a condition of our current state right of our current status within this this ecosystem because we don't have a full protocol politician role very well defined and somebody that just is present in the governance of a lot of different dows and they bring their expertise and their um you know their their opinions and their um valuable skills to each of those dows and that is in itself incredibly valuable um so i think we'll we'll see a lot of those models evolve and i would love for free bitcoin to be a big part of that because we're preparing for you know the the end of the first steward council and i want us to do a big retro and see okay what do we need to do better what do we need to think about what do we need to make sure that we have in mind for the next one and even when we set it up it was very much supposed to be hey let's see if this is something that works and in my opinion it really does because it does help us have um higher level discussions and potentially difficult discussions sometimes about the future of the dao and let's see how how we evolve that to make it something that is sustainable and is something that is valuable for people and their time totally thanks simona uh at this point i think it's my job as the timekeeper to note that we only have about five minutes left so let's maybe get into final thoughts is there anything that i didn't ask that you want to tell us about git coindao governance what are we shooting for uh does it do you all have final thoughts about get coin dial governance and its evolution before we break i actually have a question like on the on the thing that simula just said um on like we are continuously getting this feedback you being here linda as like a steward and not a concrete contributor for bitcoin now because like kyle simona and i are also contributors like what is like the biggest point of feedback that you would give to us right now what what is top of mind like you should get better at this like i'm really curious what comes to mind uh i mean i definitely think you guys are doing a really great job um one thing is that um for me i because i'm not day-to-day operating in these work streams it's hard for me sometimes to understand the context of uh why things are being done or this new project of um what the goal of this is and so i actually feel like it's i mean this is how i think about being a steward but i actually don't think stewards should be reviewing everything i really think that stewards should be focused on their interests and expertise and so actually i know we're moving towards the structure of getting paired up with other stewards based on like their interests and expertise to actually work with specific uh work streams and so for me i just feel very overwhelmed by a lot because um like i'm not an expert on some of these topics and i'm i'm trying to my best to read through this proposal and i'm like i just have no idea if this is a reasonable amount for what they're trying to do and what they're trying to do is that actually something that's necessary or is it like a nice to have and so i'm just feeling how can we like alleviate the amount of information that people have to process and it's like a very limited amount of time but otherwise i i do love that everyone's trying their best to give context i just don't think it's practical that a steward knows every single topic makes sense that that would have also been my final point and like what what what would i still communicate on what we can do better at now governance it's communication and it always it often comes down to communication and coordination just like how can we how can we get better at actually like summarizing a very concise thing bringing the right information to the right people and that's a challenge and a lot of like human coordination and i think yeah we still have a lot we can do there so thank you for that feedback and you know what helps creating standards and flows totally all right kyle we haven't heard from you any last thoughts um i was just gonna mention we haven't talked too much about our governance forums and those are a great place to get involved i feel like any time i listen to a podcast i'm always super excited i'm like hey this community seems great like how do i get involved um so you know typical plugs of discord is a great place for us like that's how we communicate day-to-day but the governance forms are really the place to go through and kind of understand what's happening at either a proposal level um and a product level there's usually updates that happen across the protocols there as well so we definitely encourage folks just to check out the governance forums um you know because that's that's been a tool that has evolved over our year as well and the way we structure it and the way that we request proposals to be submitted and the way that people show up and communicate there um but it's it's a great like it has all the details like it's got all the things that you might need to know as to what's happening on bitcoin so and yeah i think that's probably the only thing i would mention is like one last nice we'll have links to those resources in the show notes i think gov.getcoin.com is the governance forums and you can go to getcoindial.com which has links to all the things the governance forums the discord things like that alrighty well thanks so much for joining me to create this episode about git coin dow governance i think that governance is definitely an unsolved problem but uh this is a snapshot in time about how one project is doing it and uh hopefully will be useful to our listeners out there who are studying dollar error governance whether within git coin or beyond so thanks so much for joining me appreciate all of your contributions to get coindown thanks thank you thanks all thanks see you all [Music] you
