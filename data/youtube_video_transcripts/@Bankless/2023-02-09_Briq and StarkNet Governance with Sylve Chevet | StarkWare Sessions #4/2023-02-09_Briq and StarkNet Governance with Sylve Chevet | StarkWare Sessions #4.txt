welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and sometimes that Frontier is at a conference like last weekend where over a thousand developers Founders Builders and investors attended the starkware sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing this darknet ecosystem this is bankless darkwear session series which are nine bite-sized episodes interviewing the founders Builders and ecosystem developers of starknet every once in a while in the crypto World a conference happens but not everyone is available to attend don't worry Vanquis has your back because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto in this episode I'm talking with Silva who is a governance facilitator over at the starknet foundation as well as building on starknet with his project brick that's briq we kick off this conversation talking about brick and it is composable one of one by units of nfts that he hopes will be adopted by surrounding starknet applications but the meat of this conversation is really all about starknet governance which we turn to pretty quickly in this interview Silva is a starknet governance facilitator uh a steward if you will of Stark net governance and this is one of the first experiences I had when I landed in Tel Aviv I landed in uh 10 a.m in the morning and I immediately walked over to the hacker house to see what the hackers were hacking on not too long after I got there it was announced that a governance Workshop would happen in about 30 minutes in the room next door and So eventually people started to trickle over and these two governance facilitators sat down literally crisscross applesauce style and started to talk about what was the plan for Stark net governance and how governance would roll out and the tldr of that plan is that the community needs to come together and help them create a plan and so this is why in my article if you read this on Thursday and other areas of the Stark net sessions interviews I talk about Stark now as a governance platform is just learning how to stand up but these developers are learning that not only can they do really cool things on starknet but that doing cool things on starknet has imbued them it empowered them with ownership over the protocol so developers are learning what it means to field ownership over starknet and the starknet foundation is learning how to give their developers and their protocol devs a voice and control and power over starknet so we are in the very beginning days of starknet community governance and learning how to stand up and walk and this is where I got a large amount of my Impressions and information about overall what the community and ecosystem feels about the protocol that it's building on I'd sum it up as excited slightly intimidated but very optimistic and very early of course so I hope you enjoyed this conversation with Silva from the brick team and as well as the starknet ecosystem governance facilitators but first I wanted to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Kraken has been around for almost as long as crypto itself as crazy as crypto is Kraken has remained a rock for its clients building out a platform designed to stand the test of time dragon is all about proof not promises which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves A system that lets kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange and for this reason and many more we've chosen Kraken as bankus's strategic sponsor for 2023 and once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty Fiat money into pristine crypto assets perhaps you should check out arbitrum where so much of the frontier of crypto Innovation is taking place Arboretum just announced their stylist initiative which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like rust C C plus plus alongside regular old solidity evm apps stats can use any coding language they like and it simultaneously drops layer 2 feeds by an order of magnitude it's a big deal so many of your favorite DPI apps have already deployed to arbitrum like uniswap but did you know that uniswap isn't just for erc20 tokens anymore uniswap is also an nft aggregator too to make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFC purchases uniswap gives nft collectors and Traders powerful tools all from the cozy comfy uniswap interface by the way it's also got a native Fiat on-ramp it's also deployed on like every Layer Two and it's got this Nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades crypto protocols like arbitrum and uniswap are becoming super powerful so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out if you're looking to upgrade your wall experience check out Phantom the number one wall of Solana which has recently come to both ethereum and polygon Phantom has native nft support giving you your own nft gallery from inside the wallet Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to span both the Solana and ethereum ecosystems check it out at phantom.app and now let's get into the interview favorite station once again at Star prayer sessions in Tel Aviv Israel and I am here with Silph who's got a couple hats on and so we're going to talk about both of them today one of them is Brick and the other of them is a governance facilitator over at the starknet foundation uh still welcome nice to be here uh so which one you want to talk about first brick or or your role in the circle from break brick okay what's brick so brick is a uh nft building protocol so think Lego or construction game but running entirely on the blockchain so the thing that we wanted to do is twofold first off we wanted to like solve composibility because you have the all these axes and they don't do anything with crypto punks now on the other hand we wanted to give people a way to act upon nfts and right now we can like buy them consume them but it's pretty difficult to build them and so the thing we thought is like okay nfts behave a little bit like physical items what's the equivalent in the real world right like in the real world people don't build stuff they build with Lego because that's made for this and they're composable because they made for that so we replicated this exact system the composibility system but running on chain so you got 100 bricks you build a house it's an energy disassemble them get 100 bricks build something new assemble it with someone else it's yours okay so what an nft is the smallest unit of construction is that the idea yes sir and we're not actually talking about Legos is that a metaphor it looks like a voxel so it's Lego like uh but like every single brick is represented as a voxel so you put four of them that's a line and this thing is an NFD okay wait but we are literally talking about bricks we are literally talking about bricks okay like as they actually do plug it off okay and so when we're talking about like composability we were literally talking about Legos actually talking about Lego things okay uh why what can you what what take us where should our imaginations go here um the way you should think about it is the very reason we built it is because we think the way people have thought about composibility so far has been dead wrong okay the way you should think about composibility is not if you if you compare this to like a real world example it's like oh I want my axi to be with a crypto bunk and something happens it's a bit the same thing as if you took like a go piece and you put it in chess it just doesn't work so have a question for you what's the most composable game asset in the physical world the most composable gaming asset in the physical world um me the human person the human player close it's uh it's a deck of 52 cards oh of course okay sure yeah and the reason it's very composable because you have like thousands and thousands of games all across the world that we use that same asset is because it's super dumb okay it's over specified you get a color a rank and a type and that's it right and that's just something that gets interpreted sure whereas the way we think about composability is oh let me actually build 70 000 different standards that I attached to my item okay and you don't interpret it it's all about building something that is under specified and allowing people to interpret it okay so it's like inverting what composability means absolutely okay uh what when what use cases do you imagine or is that kind of antithetical as in like it's the whole thing I think it's the whole thing okay right now we wanted to help people just build assets without them having to be like a software developer or a graphic designer it's just you've gone better construction you start stacking cubes and you've built something you've built in nft so we have a surprising amount of like people oh I have my kids playing brick and like build a house or something right because that's a way for you to act upon these things you don't you just need to know how to stack like cubes so it's fairly easy is is calling this a Minecraft metaphor is that right it is okay is it so how how should people Envision this is this supposed to be like a virtual world that I play in that's a really good question um we're not a game We're Not Gonna rebuild Roblox or Minecraft we're a protocol to help people build assets so for instance like for stock recessions [ __ ] okay we have a QR code that we're doing with cartridge you just can it and you get an nfg like it's a it's a little pull-off that is entirely built out of bricks that's just one thing you can do otherwise you should have had like graphic designer I just did that on the UI minted them and so if you disassemble the pop yeah you got you get your bricks again and you can build like a treehouse or something else okay so there is a there is a physical right 3D rendering and this is a thing for me to go and play around and build and construct and deconstruct yeah and then the individual units are actual assets on Stark net and everything is running on chain like when you're building something uh we actually store this shape on chain and we can make like checks and verification so for instance if you want like the 2D attributes we can actually verify it on Shane thanks to stockx computation power and the fact that is extremely cheap the the construction that you've made is actually very very it's just flat so it's the same thing as the deck of 52 cards it's like you have a very simple structure in the end it's just like a matrix XYZ is there a brick there and you build rules on top of that okay so is this composable with broader Stark net or is this more siled into its own thing it's com it's completely composable with the rest of stocknet like we're integrated with all the different wallets we're working with different energy projects to work together so think of brick as like nft matter that just helps you build stuff okay so say I've got my nft avatar how can my little NFC Avatar like walk around the brick world and go into a brick house or like what's going on here so for now it's just an object okay it's like completely static so we're not rebuilding a metaverse or anything else like we are working with metaverse so that you can bring any construction that you have inside a metaverse but think of them as just like items that get reinterpreted okay what are you hoping people do with brick honestly I want them to surprise me uh to give you an ID like we have one extremely talented uh person who's building an entire PHP collection with bricks it's like one little dock a day they've been doing me for like a year now that's the kind of stuff oh yeah but like I don't know how blockchain works I don't know how nfts work so I just started using the cubes and just clicked and it worked so that's the kind of thing I Really Wanna I wanna see people do okay this possibilities are so endless that I actually don't know how to proceed in this interview like what what other parts of this universe are I haven't illuminated uh yet that we should talk about uh that's about that it's uh both extremely like simple and weirdly complex it's like you're just putting like matter on the blockchain so it doesn't go much farther than this it's more like a tool for your imagination that you can reuse recompose rebuild um it's just there for the taking but of course starknet uniquely enables this right yeah so we we're one of the very early projects to launch on Stockman we launched in like October 21 we more or less crashed.net magnet when we launched on December 21 so there was a whole that was the whole thing um and initially we wanted to go on stock on Stockton because I knew the stockway team uh I worked at a job before I knew the team um and we decided that we wanted this not running on a side chain because of bridging issues uh and we very much believe in validity Roll-Ups known as ZK relapse back in the day and the only functioning test net was stalking it so we just deployed it worked uh it was so early that not even like arjon Bravos or the other wallets were not even there um it just worked like the community just grew around us there are a lot of very cool uh onshine gaming projects like cartridge uh realms for instance so it's uniquely interesting for us because the more Unchained things you have the more it makes sense to use bricks for this why does it make sense can you can you for can you just unpack that a little bit more why does it make it make sense to you so for instance let's say you build a little house with brick and you build a whole verification system to verify that it's like a game could say I will only accept assets that follow a certain standard like they have to be brown they have to be in 2D they don't have to have that this or that color because we're putting all of that on Shane and these games have the power to actually use this Logic on chain it just makes it like uniquely positioned as uh an asset building uh okay so I can build a particular shape of a brick thing and other parts of the Stark net ecosystem can accept my my shape if it works inside of their ecosystem absolutely yeah okay and so you're literally trying to go for the most smallest unit of composability and hoping that the rest of the ecosystem starts building stuff exactly okay so composability just starts from like the lowest unit rather than building something that is overly complicated and try to build standards okay how do I get my hands on bricks you're going to break that construction and uh we're gonna drop another collection soon and we're working towards like fully decentralizing the protocol so something that looks like nouns Dao so you can build bricks anyone is able to build a collection on top of brick that you have Lego Star Wars I want to have brick nouns uh brick boards absolutely anything so you'll be able to build bricks you'll be able to uh Thunder Down choose what gets prioritized in terms of development the Horseshoe Bank are all the bricks the same size uh yeah okay what how do you quite how do you measure size um think of it as like it's a resolution problem like if you can build the same thing with like 3000 brake or just three bricks it just matter how you this one is one break a one by one unit yes sir okay it's like a voxel thing it's like Minecraft cool okay okay so one brick is one one unit no use it is yeah yeah okay cool okay Sylvie you're you're also part of the governance facilitators for starknet foundation how did you come to find yourself there and what does that even mean um if I have to be completely honest I think it was my uh [ __ ] boosting abilities on Stockton that got me this job so uh thanks Mom it actually worked um but I've been in the ecosystem for a bit of time now um know a lot of the other builders and so the snake Foundation reached out to me and said we're standing up uh to be like fully decentralized we want to have like a gradual open way of doing this so we want people from the community involved in the Stockton Foundation to shake things up towards a full-on to long decentralization so my capacity is that I help along with two other people Devin and Manor um to help prepare the first votes on stocknet and prepare what stocking companies is about to be is about to be like okay that the decentralization of starknet is a huge topic uh how does this conversation even begin how do you even do your job the first thing you have to keep in mind when we talk about digitalization is that you have two main components the first one is protocol decentralization and it's the ability for anyone to run a node participating consensus so that that's really like the technical meaty part um that's one part of the equation the other part is what do you how do you choose what gets implemented in that decentralized protocol in a decentralized fashion what do we prioritize in the roadmap um what kind of updates get upgraded to production how do we agree on like standardizations what we call Snips it's like eips um on sock net it used to be called Sims but we obviously changed that name Snips is a great great way which is a great name I just use the emoji I'm really happy about it bips pretty good eips not so great Snips I think takes the case it's the best one I'm really happy about that one I'll have you we chose it uh to give you an ID like there is an ongoing snip about should we write stock net with a lowercase n right it sounds dumb but it's something that we have to decide upon so um the way we're approaching it is the first place of dominance are going to be about we're going to allow token holders to delegates uh and everyone who's like involved in dominance to choose what goes into production so for instance the first vote on Stockton will be about Stockton version 011 and the question is does it go into production or not right okay so the current round of token governance with this darknet token is really just giving the community a voice to veto protocol upgrades which are coming from the more centralized ecosystem it's as if we're introducing like a democratic friction in the process in the end it's still business as usual as it stands today software creates the upgrades but we're introducing this so that we actually get a warm-up people get used to it people can build a track record we understand what works and what doesn't so that we can like let's say move up the release stack and we can actually at some point decide what gets priority ties get feedback very early on and in the end the way I think I started to better understand how governance worked when I picture the foundation as like a government like you're but you're not managing like a country you're managing a public good and that public good is stock net and so you start to realize why it's pretty difficult because it's fairly rare that governments are created and how do you acquire um I do think for instance for a company the most important thing is efficiency but for government it's legitimacy you can be slow you can take your time but the moment you lose legitimacy you're just done so that's why the Stockton Foundation has decided to be like very gradual open and responsible in the way it's approaching governance uh just to make sure that we're keeping that nugget of legitimacy and it's probably good that we're starting with things like should we have a capital N or not a capital N because we're at the very beginning right we need the community to learn that they have a voice and be able to learn how to express that voice absolutely absolutely just start small and then we'll just continuously increase the scope of what we want to govern about so it's funny because the current discussions are also about meta governance what do you govern about what is what can you legitimate about so it's funny because like we're basically Reinventing the real do we need a bicameral system doing the Supreme Court uh how do we vote even the delegate system is exactly like the parliamentary system so there's a whole range of Inspirations we can we can uh we can take from something that's unique about software is the there's it's a token vote it's on chain governance so the token is the governance asset how is the token distributed like where where is the token yes so at the moment it's uh 50.1 percent is that the foundation the rest is distributed between Stockton investors stockware and partners and core contributors during that first phase of governance uh in order to make sure that a broader set of people are represented in the vote the voting powers are going to look like a third for token holders uh a third for uh core contributors excluding stockware and a third for the foundation the third of the foundation is 20 23 for the Builder Council which is like a voted block of 17 builders that have been on the ecosystem for for a long time and 10 for delegators that the foundation is choosing um what we hope to achieve this way is to attract people who want to be involved in governance and get them like training voice their opinion agree disagree how should we change things on a very limited scope at the time but that will be gradually expanded and so people there's there's always this question of uh people love tokens people also love airdrops it doesn't sound like there will be an airdrop it will sound like if there is an airdrop it will be because the foundation decided to do that with their own allocation which will be something that governance determines and so whether or not there is a stark net airdrop is probably going to be determined out in the public it's probably going to be determined in a more decentralized fashion that what we're gonna do right now um it's not going to be stuck with that randomly decides oh by the way everyone gets to talk and so on and so forth um it's going to be decide in a much more uh open fashion and both for like Community retributions for partnership programs for grants for events uh the whole thing and uh Stark net actually has the the privilege of having a very vibrant and Alive development Community which actually probably makes it easier to decentralize the whole system because there's actually a community of people to decentralize it too and so there's actually like people there to catch it on the other side uh and so really who shows up in these governance decisions who shows up as a builder it's probably easier to for that token distribution to start centralized and diffuse into these Builders because you know who they are they're the people here who have shown up as darkwear sessions or the people who have shown up what kind of philosophy has arisen I know it's in the very early days what kind of philosophy has arisen as to like how this token becomes distributed is there anything there to talk about um at the moment it's actually not something I um I'm currently working on so it's not something I'm going to be very uh useful on but the one thing that actually uh I really want to drill down about what you said is it's a very dev-centric ecosystem at the moment but a Government is made up of a whole range of diverse opinions so we if you haven't uh written Cairo it doesn't mean that you cannot become a delegate anyone can be involved in governance anyone can voice their opinion anyone can say for instance right now there's like a group of people who want to be like oh I want to be able to be like an ambassador for stock Nets I want to represent it I want to talk about this with other companies and this is not necessarily very it's not techy it's not about oh I want to build like a robust program or something but it's just that important and these are people that have to be incorporated inside the governance uh process of the stocking foundation so the the two camps of archetypes that I've seen in the Stark net ecosystem oh I'm curious to know yeah it's like you you have the protocol devs who really care about the actual Stark net protocol how it's designed sequencing you know stuff like this the technical details the base chain details uh you would call these protocol devs core devs on the ethereum layer one and then there's also uh so that's the first Camp second archetype I found are the Cairo devs application Builders yeah and these compose most of starkware but think what you alluded to is this third Camp that's starting to arise is people who care about governance for governance at sake as in like I'm maybe they're not even technical but they are Governors absolutely and they can actually and that is a new Surface area that's been created in the Stark net ecosystem for people to arise to is that right absolutely like if you think people like such as palinia on Twitter uh who keeps on repeating that he's not a technical person but he he's a very technical person uh they by the way we don't know actually yeah they're completely unknown um this is the kind of profile that we would want to have it's uh even if you're not technical uh your area of expertise can lie somewhere else and it is a valid opinion that has to be voiced and I can just benefit the overall community and to your point about the uh app Builders this is why the Builder council is mainly constituted of app Builders because we felt that the protocol that were already well represented in the roadmap the the obviously they talk with the rest of the community and their Builders but we wanted to have the app Builders as more like the where the bug stops it's like this is where governance is going to be and this is more or less who you will answer to but the technical choice that have been made up front so this is probably a call to action for the governance minded out there that there is a lot of Need for governors of starknet and so for those people that that sentence just peaks of curiosity how can they become self-actualized how can they find an agency absolutely the way to do it is to go on stocknet.io all the blog posts about governance over there this is like the plan and the next step is you go on the government forums the links is on their website and you will be able to see all the discussions that happen from the capital and to lowercase n to the or should we use sentimental something else for the consistent protocol and if you want to apply as delegate anyone can would like to be a delegate there's a delegate thread post over there you just post your profile and get started so you've committed a certain amount of your personal energies into starknet You're Building brick you're also a governance facilitator why have you decided to give up some of your human energy to Stark net what about starknet called to you oh that's a good one um one thing I'm really proud I've done in the ecosystem is that I give a talk in Lisbon and I came up with the sentence uh keep stalking it strange uh and I think that's that's something that really resonated with me and it's you have a weird amalgamation of builders that just want to try new things uh and it's extremely endearing it's a very I mean there's no meme about the origins of gigabrain etc etc but I think it's mostly about having um I think it's strange people like they try to do things differently there's a vibrant gaming uh online gaming Community people are trying to do something different because they were like even the thought of oh I'm actually going to learn Cairo which is completely different from the any other ecosystems and try something um I think it's really what appealed to me doing something uh differently doesn't mean that it's like completely Superior or anything else it just I was very interested in doing something uh relevant and different one thing I've noticed and uh one of the first experiences I had coming to Tel Aviv was going to the hacker house and have watching you lead a governance workshop and I thought it was pretty cool when you and uh Devin your your co-facilitator the first thing I don't know if you intentionally did this but the first thing you guys did was sit down with and cross your legs on the ground and I thought it was very very like appropriate for like a governance workshops like all right everyone like Kumbaya we're gonna like talk about governance we've been Shin boosting about this for like a few weeks like oh man we did some move over but the government it needs to be like fun to have governance and so I look at them and I'm like I'm actually gonna do it so next time we're gonna have like a like a speech baton that everyone has to have uh the talking Cube like I have the time exactly I'm sorry you don't have the cube you cannot you cannot talk right now like we want to have something that is like 14 people that we want people to be involved in it doesn't have to be clinical it doesn't have to be boring I mean if you look at even like a history of governments or parliaments like it's all full of like indi-syncrasies this is the kind of thing that we really want to replicate and have like something that has a soul yeah and and really it was striking to me just seeing what I keep on using balaji's words Network state in ways that I'm not sure he would have used them but I'm using them this way and that seems to be what we're seeing here in in Tel Aviv at the starkware sessions it is a cultural meeting place of the network state of Stark net uh and so this thing is in its infancy it's learning how to govern itself it's learning how to think about itself but that's kind of what I see today um is that is that what you see and where do you see this going I completely agree and uh like one advice I'd give to builders or anyone who wants to be involved in in blockchain at large is um if not on starkner had gone any Lego too I mean that's what vitalik said at ECC last year it was L1 is going to become simpler more ossified but that means that the Innovation is going to get driven to the edges of the network so that's why on Stockton for instance we have like native account abstraction and that just allows a whole bunch of things uh we have a very there's a very very young team called the Stockard ID who have found found a way to like Implement sbts with a construction and so they're finding out all kinds of new tricks and new ways of doing it so it's like a way for you to make a name for yourself uh there's always like oh you have to be early in some it's more than that it's it's you can you get to build something and be there um and make yourself heard from them like there's just so much cool stuff to build that's what's really cool uh so what are you looking forward to over the next few years over in starknet um the one thing I'm really looking forward to is seeing governance shape up uh seeing more people stepping in seeing how we're gonna decentralize the whole thing like the the thing I said is I came on Stockton for the tech but I stayed for The Vibes um so I'm looking forward to that I'm also looking forward to like all the like these weird idiosyncrasies that the community is gonna is gonna come up with like there's this meme about like everyone being French which is like honestly half true it's only 70 of the ecosystem yeah between uh between Israeli and French like that's most of this that's most of what we got here yeah we had like three official languages like Cairo French and Hebrew English is only tolerated at this stage I mean it's color coded already so that's what I'm looking and like all the cool technical stuff and the one thing that I'm like really thinking about these days is when you get into like L3 L4 territory it's more okay now that we have a reliability um what can we do that is different from a blockchain do you need blocks anymore can you just do like checkpoints that you send every hour that's definitely something that we're looking for uh on the gaming side like do what is called what I call like game channels you're playing an entire you could we could play a game a provable game just the two of us sending each other Cairo programs and approval in a browser and just at the end of the part of the game we just send something to the chain and that's super cool that's just like all this area of experimentation is what really drives me not so uh if we've piqued the interest of any listener so far in this conversation uh where should they go how do they get started getting sorted into the the Stark net world so I think the best way for them to start is obviously the dog hello Cairo uh really well written uh the hits don't actually matter if you're reading the dock uh then the next step should be starklings which is like a great tutorial that was built by the only dos team which brings me to the third step which is uh stop contributing to an open source projects on only dust so these people they're like they're organizing all the open source contribution on stocknet and it's actually a great way like to give you an ID uh you have people who are like oh yeah I would like to uh drop my web to jobs like working web 3 and these people find like paid contributions open source contributions foods like ramp up on all these things find a job I mean I even my my brother-in-law is now working on stock net so that's how built I am so I think they would say like hello Cairo starklings and then start contributing or maybe they got peaked by Brick or maybe they just want to follow you on Twitter where should I go for that uh I'm a self chb that's why l v e c h v and it's brick nft with a cube Sylvia thank you so much thank you very much cheers [Music]
