with almost certainty I would say that the world of cryptocurrency is looked at by the intelligence Community as a non-state actor okay which is a little bit dangerous or rather a little bit adversarial for those of you in that community welcome to bankless where weeks for the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front front the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless is the CIA spying on crypto that is the question today and our guest Annie Jacobson has spent her entire career interviewing and studying intelligence agency she gives us her thoughts on that question we cover a few things things to look out for in this episode number one why intelligence agencies see crypto as a non-state actor and what is this term non-state actor why is it a default threat number two we talk about intelligence agencies the CIA the Pentagon NSA are they in our discords are they in our telegrams do they walk among us is anyone spying on my co-host David like he thinks and finally we talk about a win-win scenario can crypto exist alongside the National Security forces in our world and can both parties benefit David this was a really interesting episode um kind of uh on a side quest from typical bankless content but really important this National Security structure intelligence agencies are very much a force of power in our world how do they view crypto that was the quest question of today's episode what were some thoughts as we get into this yeah I really wanted to to do this episode after just learning about Andy Jacobson and who she is because she is a unique person in that she is Illuminating this part of the world which is supposed to be secret and I think that everyone's perception of intelligence agencies the CIA like DARPA the Pentagon it's like you know mysterious and secret and Espionage and very hollywoody right and so how do we even think about these entities and their motivations without having the influence of Hollywood and drama determine what we think about these things like are they really a threat are they really is the word infiltration even correct so Annie gives us uh the best first-hand account of how these agencies think and what they want out of crypto I think by the time we have arrived in the world of 2023 crypto uh crypto as a movement is on the radar of every single intelligence agency that exists both inside the United States and out what do they want from us anything do they want anything at all from us and so talking about how the crypto industry how the crypto movement is intersecting with these intelligence agencies I think is worth exploring and so that's why we brought Annie Jacobson to the podcast today look guys the real reason we did this episode is David really wants to know if he's being spied on right now yeah right and if if they are walking among us and then who they might be how to identify them uh in fact David I want to talk to you more about that what your kind of conclusion is about that in the debrief of course our debrief episode is the episode after the episode the one that you and I are about to record David we record these right after the show if you are a citizen of the bankless nation you can get that episode right now it's available to you right now there's a link in the show notes if you want to upgrade and uh hear David's thoughts on whether he's being spied on which which of you might be a CIA which one of my friends I explicitly name I

over the decades many other things and of course bankless Nation you know the movement that we find ourselves in crypto in 2023 is sufficiently large that for certain it's attracted the attention of some major intelligence agencies out there we want to understand a bit more about the scope of this interest and learn what the world's intelligence agencies might be interested in looking at with respect to crypto Annie Jacobson is the perfect guest to tell us a bit more about that Annie welcome to bankless how you doing I'm great thanks for having me guys okay first question for you what are the what are the chances that some three-letter agency out there is going to listen to this episode do you think oh goodness well you know everything is sort of digitally stored and captured and can be called up uh on command we should definitely talk about biometric surveillance if we're going to be talking about crypto uh anything in the world of computers and Technology the defense department is super interested in as is the intelligence community so they can listen to this episode of course um like do you think they will I mean are there people like um scouring in the intelligence agencies scouring all sorts of internet communication forms whether it's podcasts or you know websites written form uh or videos on YouTube um for these this this sort of information and like you know tapping into communities at this level or is this way too granular for an intelligence agency to to keep track of well for starters you probably have some fans in the Intel community in the military community community people who are interested in learning about uh what you guys are subject matter when you say when you say fans Annie do you mean fans in a good way I'm a little bit worried when you say we have fans and intelligence agency I don't know what to think you know one of the things that I'm most uh you know I appreciate the in terms of process in my own work is that a lot of people in this world have been um D you know like they have become human to me meaning there's not a big paranoia you know there's not a there's not a sense anymore for the kind of reporting I've done for the number of decades that I've done it about you know sort of the the twirling mustache bad guy being ubiquitous yeah in in government agencies yes there are individuals who are nefarious um I often think that lack of knowledge is the most nefarious of all things right or or ignorance or fear all but for the most part most of the people I interview and I've interviewed at this point six books 250 sources a book on average you know multiply think of how many people I've spoken to have worked for the CIA DARPA Dia you know any of the military organizations and mostly there are people just like any other people that we come across in our different uh ways in which we move through this universe so full circle I think many people probably listen to you because they're probably closer of a mindset than than you would imagine so these are uh the atomic units of intelligence agency made this the first lesson before we get in and I know we want to hear more about your background but uh you know I'm kind of front running this but the atomic units of an intelligence agency goes back to individual people uh individual civilians people with hopes and dreams and maybe uh who are interested in speculating in in crypto markets or interested in the technology interested in the um the freedom that it provides um it's not sort of uh I guess a shadowy group of individual members of our society that live in a completely separate Universe you're saying your experience in all of these interviews and talking to people at these intelligence agencies they're a lot more similar to everyone else than we might think absolutely I mean there are people on the edges that are extraordinary you know that are that are like I I have interviewed people who I call the Superman of science you know presidential science advisors um people who invent things like the laser right Charles Towns now towns is going to live way over he passed recently but the universe that he occupies is very different than my universe because he's so damn smart but that doesn't mean he doesn't have interests in say comic books right so these things always overlap and the other thing that I always keep in mind and this probably has to do with my age the older I get I realize um because when I started out I was very young and I would be interviewing you know 90 year old or 80 year old men who fought in World War II right and that as that as as time passes I have learned this commonality or rather kind of witnessed and observed it among people is that everybody has a set of parents everybody has a set of parents and those parents did things that said individuals want to know about and that's why I think a lot of people become interested in history right and many of us choose to have children and then we want to know about modernity we want to know about the future we want to know about what lies ahead because of our children for example I'm I'm a subject matter expert in a number of areas one of which is not cryptocurrency right but I can speak about it and look forward to talking to you guys about it because I understand um the way in which military technology is the very Foundation upon which everything you guys are invested in and I want to know more about cryptocurrency because my kids think think it's you know the greatest thing in the world and they might be right David I was just thinking uh I wonder how many people in the CIA own an nft it's probably a non-zero mount isn't it well that I think that's part of the subject matter that we really want to explore not necessarily the nuances of that particular question but really just understanding how close are we to some of these intelligence agencies like to what degree do they walk among us are they adversarial to us or do we walk shoulder shoulder to them and and there I do enjoy the the meta-ness about talking about these intelligence agencies as we do know that some of them are probably listening to my words right now uh I that's a little bit funny and and also kind of the the point of the episode is that theirs is a world out there uh of intelligence agencies that is unknown and foreign and mysterious to most people out there by Design that's kind of the role that they they play they operate in the shadows and I want to illuminate some of that world today but before we really go into how much of that world relates to crypto Annie just to help um illuminate this world can you just perhaps summate the body of your work and talk about how you go about doing the work that you do how does one investigate the very dark and Mysterious World of the global intelligence agencies that exist out there so you could call me a national security reporter that's one title I'm also a Storyteller right so I I write narrative I write narrative non-fiction meaning I believe that readers are most interested and most apt to learn about things if you tell them it in story form there's plenty of people who are going to write a polemic but that's not me I'm going to go out and interview the people at the very heart of the matter and then interview their competitor and then their adversary and you know their colleagues and their former so in that way I build my narrative after choosing the narrative what I'm going to write about um Area 51 you know Operation Paperclip Nazis DARPA um Biometrics right whatever then I will I look at the different military agencies and intelligence communities that are involved in those that are stakeholders you could call them or players and I begin to first and foremost go after the people and talk to them and begin to build the architecture of what the most interesting part of the story is and then I begin sourcing what I am told by Witnesses I begin to source that information in the national archives in Declassified documents and then I also look at the work of journalists who came before me and I kind of always thank them in my forwards of my book Because as a journalist you stand on the shoulders of the journalists who came before you who did the digging and every single one of my books you know I have a 400 page book there will be a 100 or 150 Pages worth of notes in the back of the book for those of you that still read analog um because uh that gives other people ideas that's where I get many of the ideas and many of the of the leads um for my work by reading other journalists work they may have a tiny tiny footnote about some document in a bundis archive in Freiburg in Germany I want to know about that I will go there to that archive hire a translator find that document look at it and that could set me off down a rabbit hole and so Annie I want to open up the conversation to the crypto World specifically uh I've called the crypto movement movement is a word that's frequently used the crypto movement uh I've also described it as a counter cultural dissident movement um it's very anti-state it's very anti-powers that be and so Annie using your expertise um like uh shedding light on the parts of the world that we are unfamiliar with the intelligence agencies and other three-letter agencies of that sort from that perspective what does the crypto movement look like as in does it relate to other movements throughout history uh does it rhyme with a lot of the other movements uh perhaps like the counter the actual Counter Culture movement in the 60s and 70s from the perspective of intelligence agencies what does crypto look like what patterns does it fit well first and foremost I I imagine and again I'm speculating here because I am not a member of the intelligence Community right but I I've interviewed enough people to kind of be able to imagine how they think and I and and with almost certainty I would say that the world of cryptocurrency is looked at by the intelligence Community as a non-state actor okay which is a little bit dangerous or rather a little bit adversarial for those of you in that Community right does that make sense because a non-state actor is a threat okay so and again I'm speaking in analogy or metaphor here but it is applicable because um particularly where we are in 2023 what has been happening for you know since the kind of last half last decade of the war on terror is this incredible federal government movement toward biometric identification of everyone at all times and we can get into that in detail it's very dystopian um there are allegedly some upsides of that we can talk about that having to do with rule of law but that is the way in which the world is going and I was writing about this long before covet happened and there's huge ramifications in covet in terms of you know body tracking biometric body tracking but um because cryptocurrency is fundamentally uh pseudonymous right like you some people would call it Anonymous but I would say it's really more pseudonym because everything is tied to something so there's a pseudonym for it but that if you look at now if you asked me to apply intelligence Community terms to this that's very much like a non-state actor who is hiding their cover right so you know billions of dollars trillions of dollars have been spent against counter those are called counter-insurgency movements right now when when they're at when they're foreign adversaries so I'm not by no means saying that you know that it's that it's adversarial per se but I that is the first way in which I would examine the world intelligence Community can I can I uh make sure that we understand these terms um so am I right that an intelligence agency might group the world into kind of two camps there are State actors and there are non-state actors and you said that they probably see crypto as a non-state actor I'm assuming a state actor means um something that can be governed by or controlled by some sort of nation-state out there and um the advantages for a nation and a state actor are well we sort of know how to deal with State actors don't we there's this International rule of law international kind of community you can send diplomats to the other state actor and talk to them in the physical locations the physical location they can kind of exercise control over some jurisdiction it's kind of a known quantity like there is a recipe book not to say that all of these other state actors will be friendly some will be friendly some will be not friendly but they are um easier to kind of quantify and and deal with there's a Playbook and then on the other side there are these non-state actors maybe these these various movements of sorts that don't necessarily have a flag aren't recognized by the United Nations don't have a strict geography and uh more and more perhaps like these are these these non-state actors and communities are organizing themselves on the internet I don't know to what extent that is the case some of these non-state actors might be viewed as um hostile the US are enemies of an intelligence agency some may not be maybe some are kind of in the unknown but am I right in saying that non-state actors sort of make nation-state intelligence agencies uncomfortable because you can't really send a diplomat uh to these groups like who represents the voice of crypto and um it does seem like the US anyway the last 28 years or so sort of like the war on terror that has largely been a war with non-state actors has it not for I guess maybe give us some more detail about these boundaries of of State actors and non-state actors so we can understand these categories a bit more broadly well keep in mind also that and again this is like 101 here but I think you did a terrific job in in summation yes but like the military is looking at International threats the military cannot perform in the United States people forget that there's a Posse Comitatus you cannot you know you can send in the National Guard and certain but in general the the Pentagon is looking overseas and then the same with the intelligence Community okay the CIA cannot operate in the United States um the FBI is a law enforcement agency we are not talking about that okay FBI deals with crimes after the fact so when we're talking about preemptive considerations of situations right hmm what should what weapons should we build to you know for the future War here uh CIA saying hmm which area of the globe should we be concerned about for a potential X Y or Z unknowns they are always watching States and you're right it should be called nation states right Iran China you know North Korea those are all St those are all nation states technically they wear a uniform but a non-state actor is a terrorist organization okay so like there's Iran and then there's Hezbollah which are their non-state actors that are funded by Iran but they're the guys running around without uniforms number one you know identifier of a non-state actor of an organization that's hostile is they don't have a uniform on Al-Qaeda doesn't wear a uniform Isis doesn't wear a uniform okay so so the defense department is really at odds because who are they going to shoot at now again keep that as a metaphor but I'm talking about bass line query if I was in the intelligence Community how I would approach the crypto Community would be mindful of that these individuals could have a lot of power because I the intelligence don't know who they are if I were the intelligence community no with that said I do also know a number of serious players in your world who I have a very strong suspicion slash almost certainty consult with the intelligence community so there is a quid pro quo there because the crypto Community as far as I can tell and certainly the individuals I know that I have you know communicated with in in other areas have no intention of being a hostile player so they're they want to they want to my understanding is the leaders of the crypto Community want to be able to maintain pseudonym pseudonymity none right but not anonymity they are saying wait I am identifiable I can tell you what it is you would like to know I am not a hostile player I we right however we are making our own new rules and that's where it becomes a bit of a day taunt and that's where I find cryptocurrency this world extraordinarily interesting because more will be revealed interesting yeah yeah Ryan you you talked about how um non-state actors don't have a flag which we don't have a true we don't have a nation-state flag but we do have symbols non-state actors who have symbols banners that uh are they organize under and you know perhaps the the first kind of examples of non-state actors that come to mind at least for me are we're all ones that are religious right like religious movements inside of and and across uh nation states uh like the Taliban was the first one that came to mind which took over the the state of Afghanistan but it was a non-state actor operating in in that yeah I mean I suppose like the Catholic Church would be an example of this right of a non-state actor in some ways and it's not lost on me uh they would not be okay I I can certainly identify the Catholic church it's the guy in the robe right and I know where their capital is is the Vatican oh okay and I can go to their library and if they won't let me in I'm gonna write you see that's that is a that is a definitive that is the Vatican plays by the same rules they even have at their own stake right yeah which is probably uncomfortable right tell me about your organization's founder uh Satoshi I was actually actually going to ask you about this individual um well I'm asking you because it's you he's your he you know reader I I mean I think that that is uh part of the the secret ingredient of of crypto is no one really knows I mean there's lots of speculation on who that individual might be there's even some sort of what I might put call in kind of the conspiracy uh Theory Camp there's speculation that this individual might be a representative of a three-letter agency as well um I don't happen to believe that that's true I believe that this was one or a small group of individuals working together to achieve some common purpose but this individual um chose to remain pseudonymous and that is part of the the strength and and um Power of this uh entire um I guess movement as David called it earlier is that it is leaderless and it is opt-in and also I think something that is distinct maybe from the other non-state actors that intelligence agencies are are looking at it is completely non-violent it does it is an opt-in movement where you decide to run a particular node or purchase a particular coin and hold that coin there is no physical manifestation of it and certainly there is no coercion or a notion of violence so in some ways it is similar to a non-state actor as you've described it Annie in that it's I'm only remember you know caveat here is I'm just telling you how if I were in the intelligence Community I would approach it I'm not telling you my approach to assert no certainly understand that but but this is part of it is we want to get in the head of the intelligence agency because we honestly we have no idea how they how they look at that but you know does that description right now because they either absolutely know who your or your leader is or they don't and if they don't then then the organization is a is a considered a non-state actor to them I mean if they do then they have a lot more power more than you think and that would be very that would that meant that's that creates a vulnerability within the organization that is should be considered well what are the chances that the intelligence agencies of the world don't know who Satoshi is I mean this is I you know this is all conjecture so I'd I'd be very interested in your thoughts Andy but I'd also be interested in your thoughts David like what do you guys think about this well it's neither or as far as I'm concerned that because there's no way of knowing they you know they either do or they don't but but though if they do as I said those two lines of thought then the way in which intelligence Community perceives the organization is entirely different well as far as the peaceful movement I would also tell you that the intelligence Community would say this any organization that alleges utopian ideals right is of incredible interest to both the military and the intelligence Community because nothing ever winds up the way it was intended and you can look at Che Guevara you know I write about Che guevar in another of my book surprise kill vanish because the CIA trained The Operators who killed Che Guevara and that is an absolute fact and I interviewed him for my book and so when you know you people people's perception and this has to do with naiveite versus understanding the facts about something which is important because kids of my um children's generation you know will wear this Che Guevara t-shirt and you know Jay has an idea about having been uh the perception of him is one thing but if you really look at che's own writings and mind you I've been a guest of Che guevara's son in Cuba so if you look at chegebara's own writings you see how incredibly militant he was and how many people Che assassinated like gun to the Head who no longer adhered to his utopian his originally utopian ideas and so the intelligence Community are big understanders of History even though they also have a lot of Amnesia around history but they would think of that in in in approaching the world of cryptocurrency based on what you just suggested about well-intentioned it's definitely worth noting that even though Satoshi Nakamoto kicked off this industry uh they would absolutely not consider themselves a leader which is why they disappeared into the shadows in the first place and that's created this culture inside of crypto of there is no leader if there was a leader of crypto it would be a failure of the mission of crypto so the mission of crypto is to really be a non-state actor as soon as we become a state actor that is failure mode for some of the uh movement the the motivational movement behind this whole scene and uh Annie I'm definitely guilty of doing this uh many of us in crypto are of touting a uh idealized Future Vision of the world based off of crypto values and it's a movement that no one can stop and all you have to do is build this system but there is no leader but all we are there are people of influence but there is no leader but there's definitely a brighter future ahead and I'm starting I'm going to go ahead and guess a lot of these same pattern patterns are discovered throughout other movements in history and so Annie I want to turn to my next my next question for you is what about this crypto movement uh now that this leaderless uh semi-organizational organizational list uh movement what about crypto might be of interest to these intelligence agencies that are out there what do we have that they want or how what do they want to do about us well technology is changing so rapidly it's astonishing and in the pentagon's brain I write about the birth of the computer right so again no one man can really take ownership of inventing the computer but John Von Neumann who was sort of the original pentagon's brain right after World War II developed kind of the first computer he called it the maniac it's an analogy it's an acronym for something and when that computer was built with you know almost 2 000 vacuum tubes in the basement of uh fold Hall at the Princeton Institute for advanced study John Von Neumann would stand there and be able to because he was a polymath and he could calculate very fast he could beat the computer at a calculation at a very complicated calculation and he and his students were building the computer to learn faster and that after you know several months the computer beat John Von Neumann for the first time and he then predicted that one day we would have artificial intelligence and his words are far more interesting than my paraphrasing of him but I do write about it in the pentagon's brain so then you fast forward to where we are now right and you can also look at there's another guy I write about in that same book called JC lichlider who is kind of the they call him the Godfather of the internet he was kind of the Johnny Appleseed of the internet right so the reason to why crypto would be extraordinarily interesting and is is because of the of the appeal that it has and the power that it has and the interest that it has and the fascination that it has coupled with this idea that where the compute forget Moore's Law I mean computer technology is moving so much faster than Moore's Law that it is impossible to predict how crypto will unfold in the next six months one year moving forward so that's the interest you know the the intelligence Community has a has a duty to look at or movements that are could potentially be um extremely powerful to the financial the previous idea of State stability in terms of Finance so one of the main differentiators that I see between crypto and other counter-cultural dissident movements in the past some count certain counter-cultural dissident movies are more about tearing things down with crypto our ideally hopefully we also come with Solutions so not only do we want to disrupt old structures of power we actually have the plans to replace them with brand new structures of power and so perhaps it's like not it's less of a detail about than the details of crypto it's more about the fact that there is energy here also that energy happens to express itself in the forms of capital and also massive amounts of people who are aligned with these values and so all of a sudden all the intelligence agencies all over the world their Radars just start pinging and they don't know what but they know something's out there and they want a piece of it is that kind of how they're they're thinking well absolutely and and the intelligence community you know has a responsibility at least in their in in the construct of that world to have more power than not right so and that gets us into the concept of rule of law which is fundamental and foundational to the to what's happening in the United States um and and rule of law is just simply based on law enforcement courts and Corrections right and so Along Comes this new player the world of cryptocurrency and it does threaten to upset rule of law and so with certainty the FBI is looking at the at your world as well hmm I um at this point I I almost feel like I want a quick tutorial on uh some of the intelligence agencies that we're even talking about and um I mean please uh you know do the 101 course here Annie because I think we have lots of people listening that um have heard of different agencies but are more familiar with the kind of the Hollywood version of these things and really don't understand what they do um there was something that they mentioned earlier which is like sort of I think two camps you mentioned that the FBI um is the one that deals with domestic issues and really it's like the CIA and maybe the NSA you know these sorts of agencies are mostly about foreign threats can can you take us through some of these agencies sort of what they are and what their jurisdiction is and then maybe once we kind of understand that base level we can apply them to like what their interest level might be in in crypto a bit more crisply so like the CIA the NSA the DIA Homeland Security what are these and and how about the FBI like what what are these all of these acronyms doing for us so there are 17 known intelligence Community intelligence organizations right so the CIA is the most well-known Central Intelligence and then there's NSA um and then every military organization has an intelligence Department right so Dia is the defense intelligence agency the DIA is the pentagon's CIA right it sits in it was created essentially around and during the Vietnam war only when the military was like wait a minute the CIA has this is the short the CIA has too much power we want a Dia right so they have their own struggles within them but but each intelligence agency is basically reporting intelligence to that organizational structure right with the CIA kind of the overarching NSA is very important to to the to your world I would think so for for the reason of what what's called um second right so there's different Intel are you familiar at all with the intelligence like any of the terms about what oh synth is for example or second not at all okay so I mean we don't want to bore anyone but so intelligence collection okay that's an INT i-n-t right so o sent is called open source intelligence so anything I read in the New York Times or wherever is ocent open source intelligence and when we started this conversation you said wait a minute is anyone watching right in the old days the CIA had a division of you know um of ocean Clippers they would people would clip articles out of the New York Times and file them away now that is just being compiled you know by computer systems because of the massive amount of data storage that exists and what we just spoke of a moment ago with Moore's Law and how how much data you can store which is its own other problem and we could talk about that I mean you know there's so much sensor technology that is pulling data everywhere every you know that that there's one of the generals said to me that you know we're swimming in we're drowning in sensors and swimming in data there's just too much how do you process it well now we have these advances in AI algorithms that are able to you know look at massive amounts of data comb through Haystacks looking data Haystacks looking for the needle okay but going back to your intelligence Community question all of the intelligence communities are essentially looking at National Security meaning keeping the nation right you think of America safe from foreign adversaries coming in law enforcement deals with internal threats that's the FBI's job so when you hear all of these you know arguments about you know people NSA listening to me that's because the NSA is not supposed to be listening to Americans NSA is supposed to be listening to Al-Qaeda to Isis to you know Russia to that is what we are what the in the intelligence Community is supposed to be doing is defending the United States against future military attack FBI solving crimes is there a group within let's say we'll take the United States as an example is there an intelligence agency that effectively like um spies on American citizens or gathers intelligence maybe on American citizens um that's illegal that's okay that's illegal so they can't do that they shouldn't be doing that and well that's why Snowden is not in Russia now right well so like what if what if there are um I guess uh citizens the United States that want to overthrow the government let's say or what if there are um terrorist cells domestic terrorists yes yeah domestic terrorists or terrorist cells that are in the United States what organization handles that is that is all the FBI or is there is there a Homeland Security kind of division yes it is it's it's FBI and FBI Works in concert with Homeland Security keep in mind Homeland Security didn't the Department of Homeland Security didn't exist until 2004-5 right it just it was a creation of the war on terror because when the war on terror happened when 9 11 happened uh the the FBI was caught flat-footed they didn't know those terrorists were going to do what they did maybe some people would argue and the CIA who was tracking some of the terrorists was like wait a minute we're not in charge of what's happening in the United States that's FBI's job and the Department of Homeland Security the birth of that organization was the result of that complete failure uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for

go back to this this this question that David asked earlier of okay what might these agencies be looking for in crypto why might they be gathering intelligence in inside of the crypto industry and um one concept I sort of want to throw Float by use this idea of National Defense right and so let's talk about those agencies like the CIA and Dia and those types of groups that are trying to protect the United States from foreign adversaries there have been in the last couple of years a series of high-profile hacks uh in crypto and particularly decentralized Finance I don't know if you've seen any of these Annie but uh here here's an example of a clip I'll just read it from CNBC this is January of 2023 and this is a recap North Korea linked hackers behind a 100 million dollar crypto Heist the FBI says this is there a series of like smart contracts in crypto that house a lot of tokens and a lot of crypto assets and value allegedly some of these Bridges have been hacked by um foreign adversaries one of which is called the Lazarus group this is a group allegedly operated by North Korea and is just kind of looking for vulnerability in smart contracts in in crypto custodial um and and then draining that money and I think it's been expressed though we've never had a guest talk to us about this on on bankless that um when this started happening the National Security apparatus of the United States started to to perk up its ears because um I believe they had been working very hard to kind of cut off Rogue Nations uh you know us adversaries from um means of funding their their militaries of course and so certainly North Korea has been cut off in all these various ways and sanctions and such and now here is this this way for uh North Korea to make money right in this in this kind of dark market and to do so fairly easily I think like some estimates are that the Lazarus group was able to acquire like billions of dollars in crypto Assets in the last couple of years so what what do you make of this is this um now a reason for the National Defense group of the United States like these intelligence agencies protecting us against foreign adversaries to to enter the ring and what might their interest be in crypto as a result of this type of activity well they've been in the ring for a very long time because um if you look at so all of the money the Lazarus group you know North Korea is is a is has enormous presence in hacking right and they it is financing look think of the think of the simplest term of all follow the money okay and that is the beginning and the end of it right there so if you can't follow the money that's a problem there was a during the war on terror again there was a problem uh of the way in which a lot of the Middle Eastern countries were exchanging money was a you know called Hall wall I'm I'm not saying the word right but that was that same kind of lending system that was essentially bankless and the FBI and the CIA and the entire intelligence community and they work together to put an end to that because that was the only way to stop you know financing Terror right now with North Korea the money that the Lazarus group at all is is creating the wealth that they're creating is directly financing North Korea's uh nuclear program it's ballistic missile program and that's been going on since 2004. and that so eyes were on that then and continue to be on that and for the intelligence Community to be able to disrupt that means disrupting the ability to finance those programs right most of North Korea's from what I understand from the people I've interviewed much of North Korea's technology is is stolen and bought right but you have to pay for stolen goods they pay for it in if they're paying through for it in a bankless manner that is now a national security concern and you can the intelligence Community is all over that because they want to stop that from happening returning back to the metaphor of the crypto movement as a non-state actor again we're building all these new structures in in the crypto World these new power structures these D5 protocols these systems that are organizing humans around them uh and I like that you use the term Bank list to describe the way that these um the middle eastern states are using to transact with each other and that perhaps offended the intelligence agencies out there because they can't see into that world nor do they have very much control over that and so looking at crypto as a non-state actor a bunch with a bunch of bankless money systems uh really emphasizing the name of this podcast of course uh it it would it just really uh begs the question it's like well there is this headless movement with no leaders that is about producing new systems of power new structures and all of a sudden in the last two years all of these structures started being used for purposes that are against the goals of the United States intelligence engine he's let alone all the other intelligence agencies out there and so since this is a leaderless movement it really seems like it is like the Crypt the crypto world is um this Monopoly board that no one has claimed yet and now all of the intelligence agencies are like oh we gotta we gotta claim this that we gotta claim the land and so that that's kind of how the the mental model live started to develop well listening to this while listening to you Annie is like there's this untapped real estate and all the intelligence agencies need to figure out how to plant their flag and control this headless movement and and sway in directions that align with their interests would this be an app description of what we've covered so far absolutely and also you know the powers that be let's call them right the government per se is very threatened by the power of the people you know um sure it's like if you've got like an anarch you know domestic terrorist it's like rule of law should go in and quash that movement but you can also have very well-intentioned movements like the crypto Community is right now right that can that can literally topple a trillion dollar defense world and I'm going to give you a direct example which is again why it's threatening to the powers that be during the Vietnam war the military-industrial complex was enjoying you know it's rain okay it had been going on for a decade and the peace movement begins to become more powerful than the war movement and as I Chronicle in the pentagon's brain hands down it was the Peace movement that stopped the Vietnam War the government couldn't control it and so and the government wanted to be in charge the government wanted to finish up that war in the manner that it wanted to finish up that war and it could not do that because the people were more powerful than the military-industrial complex in that very tiny moment of time and I think that's just as important an analogy for for all of us or a historical moment for all of us to understand um you know then we can talk about all kinds of ways in which the CIA and Etc then went wait a minute we can't let this happen again and then develops new means to control people so I'm you know I'm all for um you know I just think creative ideas and creative thinking is is the very Hallmark of democracy and it what and and optimism like you were talking about Ryan right there's a you not necessarily utopianism which I which I think is a fantasy but optimism and sort of the betterment of things a better system that's what I hear you guys talking about when you're talking about this world you're so enthusiastic about and I think that's brilliant and all I'm saying is there you're you're you get pushback from the powers that be because there is historically that sense of once people have power they don't want to give it up well that that's um I you know that's almost encouraging to hear you say that is just as powerful as these um agencies are and the National Defense apparatus is there is a hidden power that the people actually have to um push these institutions uh toward their will and uh thank God for that thank God that we are able to stop uh when we rise up and change hearts and Minds um Wars that are unjustified that the people don't want to wage um and maybe that is also the way uh the crypto movement gains power is David and I often say is this is really a battle for hearts and Minds you can see how some of these intelligence agencies may want to stop it but if we have the hearts and Minds on our side if there are people in the United States that are receiving economic benefit and able to use these systems to improve their lives and if this becomes as powerful and we think one day this will will as the internet of a force for progress and change then um the intelligence agencies and defense apparatus the U.S really won't be able to to hold it back or at least that's the hope and there is some analog here to us between the early internet and uh in crypto and so the the internet is a communication technology of course um it uses encryption as well crypto is a a value transfer technology so it's rather than translating messages and transmitting communication translates value over IP Internet Protocol so it's kind of an analogy here and from our understanding of the early kind of like 1990s there's this thing called the crypto Wars where there is certainly this battle between the people let's call it of the United States and uh the National Defense apparatus of the US for encryption technology um these encryption Technologies were on sort of the minutes list of banned things things that shouldn't be in the hands of of private citizens um so we we couldn't use basic cryptography to encrypt our internet communications and of course the internet became so valuable and so useful uh and propagated so far wildly that this is no longer a defensible position for the National Defense apparatus to kind of take and I guess my hope is that we evolve in a similar Direction with crypto I I can see how encrypted technology in the internet could be a very disruptive Force for these intelligence agencies do you um have you read or have you gone into detail much about that of how intelligence agencies witnessed the birth of the internet and what's very interesting I know you've written a book on DARPA which is like DARPA was actually the original Research Institute behind the internet and sort of gave civilian access to this technology what's what's kind of the analogy here and how does this fit with our story foreign well the intelligence Community didn't and the military Community didn't witness the birth of the internet they created the they are they gave birth to the internet and it began with a guy called jcr lichlider and this is during the Kennedy administration um President Kennedy was worried during the Cuban Missile Crisis that almost led to thermonuclear war with the Russians when he realized that for him to call Khrushchev on the phone you know there was a rotary phone you picked it up and you went like this you dialed okay now just you guys are too young to you dial the phone has to go back think of the seconds that are that you are wasting it takes 1 600 seconds from a nuclear for a nuclear weapon to get from a launch pad in the Soviet Union to Washington near do not want to be wasting seconds trying to tell Khrushchev not to push the button for the rotary phone to dial and that is the literal truth Declassified documents that I report on in the pentagon's brain why JFK said we need something faster can we somehow I'm paraphrasing him you know this newfangled thing the computer thing we've got them they're the size of a house they're over there in the Pentagon let's get jcr lick lighter on the system and see if he can't figure out to make how to make computers talk that is the birth of the internet and that's what DARPA began as a program jcr look letters idea was that he was going to create an Intergalactic computer network that's what he called it and there was a couple notes and this is moving forward to 1969. there were literally a couple nodes on the internet and it was called um it was you know it was it was it was mil then it became milnet military right so for for decades the only access was internal and and then of course you know the power of the people it's sort of like this is you know you can talk to the early the event surfs of the world who will explain to you how Internet Protocol was built to be able to you know not be siled at the Pentagon and that has to do with this very interesting again narrative fact that these scientists that get co-opted into the government to work on Military technology issues and they get co-opted into the government usually because the government has the biggest pocketbook and is more interest an organization like DARPA is interested in their ideas even if they're not going to produce it's not going to produce money right away and these scientists are often inherently you know very plebeian very of the people and so they tend to build things into their systems that are are very Democratic fundamentally and I want to ask about because one of the purposes uh about bringing you on to the show today is to educate the bank bankless listenership about how they might with or without their own knowledge be interfacing with some of these intelligence agencies but I'll have to admit uh I'm interested in this at a personal level uh because of one of the topics how this this idea for the subject matter came at hand is that there is this social group of crypto people in New York City that all hang out and and that is a place of perhaps infiltration so I'm wondering about like as it comes to um how intelligence agencies may attempt to capture and coerce and steer either aligned or misaligned with crypto's own goals uh what are the strategies for how intelligence agencies might find themselves in positions of power in in the crypto world well when you say find themselves in a position of power you mean hanging out with the guys who are leading the industry how will intelligence agencies attempt to steer the ship of crypto in ways that align with their own goals what like if there are strategies for getting that done like how do they start like how do they engage with this and like how did they do it during the 1970s against the peace movement for example mm-hmm well that I would see in as a direct conflict right so the peace necks were were absolutely in you know up against the the the defense department you know holding sit-ins at the Pentagon I mean there was no question that they were at in series I see the community of cryptocurrency from the point of view of Silicon Valley that's just me it might have to do with my age and it's with the knowledge that Silicon Valley is entwined with the intelligence world and always has been so um I have a strong sense that there is a partnership and I would tell your listeners if they have any doubt they can Google inquito i n q Dash t-e-l which is the hedge fund of the CIA and you will see hold on a second the CIA has a hedge fund so you if you Google this you will see a lot of people in your world involved in that world hmm so what is this so it's it's not it's not so like there are CIA agents who are in our discords or in our telegram chat rooms or who are trying to infiltrate their ways perhaps more through just not back Channel alleys but just more um just more directly let me give you another metaphor right like this is almost poetic right so like during during the war on terror one of the ways in which terrorists were communicating was through by playing video games and um having you know Communications I'm not a big video gamer but I knew this and so a couple of the sources that I was working with were these gamers right so Ryan looks horrified right Ryan's on the CIA I I still can't get over here sorry we moved on too quickly from that um of like the CIA has a hedge fund Annie look it up of course they do so what is this this is I I tried to Google it very quickly but I'm I'm afraid I may have missed some of the digits here so uh what is it in it's called in kutel right Q tell it's been around for a while I mean I spoke to one of the original Founders a guy called Jacques valet who interestingly is the world's most interesting ufologist you know Jacques valet is an astrophysicist who's had a top secret security cons clearance since 1960 when he was working um he also mapped Mars you know and I wrote about Jacques in in one of my books called phenomena which is the cia's interest in psychic functioning right so does the CIA you know really believe in psychic functioning read my book is the CIA very interested in people who believe in psychic functioning in UFOs absolutely there's a an incredible to me incredibly interesting statement which is which is by a psychologist named Dr Thomas and it goes like this if men Define situations as real they are real in their consequences and to me the whole bankless world of cryptocurrency could absolutely be summed up in that manner you know if a group of people decide that this is how they want to bank well there are very serious consequences for the pre-existing Banks I'm on the inqutel website right now and this looks like it's yes indeed a fund almost like a venture capital type fund um here's a excerpt you shouldn't call it a hedge fund it's really more of a it's more VT yeah yeah I see what you mean it's definitely as they call it in the CIA Adventure Capital right and so this is it uh incutel was founded in 1999 as the global technology evolution is underway the internet is widely available and the CIA and government agencies once Innovation leaders recognize they were missing out apparently they don't want to miss out on this technology so this appears to be less uh about um Returns on investment Capital maybe that's important to someone in government and and maybe more a way to kind of Forge alliances and Partnerships and um Bridges and relationships and perhaps recruiting to some of the most Innovative technology in the world coming out of the Silicon Valley so that's what you're saying that that you see crypto is having a role in something like this being like an invest of some sort of inqutel type of CIA VC Group Well more than anything what I see it as is a technological Forerunner right so in other words um DARPA and the CIA are are more similar to me than different the Pentagon is very different the Pentagon is a big giant bureaucracy and it functions as such this the CIA is is very decentralized ironically right as is DARPA DARPA has a hundred some odd program managers who go out into the world and build little units of scientists and create projects that change the world DARPA has what's called a chicken and egg philosophy right if you have a weapon system that you need if a need arises for a new weapon system and you don't already have it you haven't done your job that's the chicken and eggs near so they have to be 25 years out the agency ha and when I say the agency I mean the CIA it has to be ahead of other intelligence organizations of other technology organizations it has to be otherwise it's not doing its job and so I don't you know and with that said I'm not saying that's good or bad I'm just simply saying that is what it that is its job and given how safe and secure we all are here in the United States and enjoying rule of law you know and if you have any doubt just turn on the TV and look at Turkey right um and their building codes just by way of example right I mean I'm I'm very proud to be an American do not call me a nationalist I'm just a a proud Citizen and that is because we have a government that in essence is meant to you know provide for the people is it perfect absolutely not are these agencies you know the more I study them the more interesting I find the history of the intelligence communities and I hope that they continue to go on a trajectory where I do see them going which is you know fixing problems and then innovating toward the future because if you look back at the the way the National Security apparatus All Began in 1957 in 1947 after World War II no one had any idea that technology would take over the way it has and and so you know the duties of the powers that be are insurmountable at this point and and then was my last thought on this is like you look at the North Korea Rush any of these China these totalitarian governments that have no responsibility to the people whatsoever and and and treat them like dirt you know they have so much accumulated power at the top that they are even more threatening than they ever were with technology in their hands because they don't have to have as many tanks and airplanes and that's why Crypt that leads me back to crypto right right and and any I want to ask you that like what are the ways that we should know about as it relates to intelligence agencies entering our communities but I but I do know that the way that you've done your research and written your books it's as time has passed and as information eventually becomes Declassified and more information makes its way up to the surface I don't think you have the actual explicit answers as to like here is exactly what the CIA is doing inside of whatever Dao or defy app that exists in crypto because that's a secret but if you could put on your speculative hat and just for for me and all the other people who are operating in these various communities in circles what should we is there anything that we should like look out for like how can we identify these people what are they trying to do it's like is there if you put on your speculative hat like what what comes to mind David wants to know who the CIA plans are okay I want to know which one of my friends is in the same podcast Partners I mean how much do you really know about the person you podcast with I mean I guess I'm not I'm the one thing I'm missing is is the Sinister aspect of it right so that fill me in a little bit more like what is the what is the threat so there is this General Vibe at times in different crypto circles and depending on how far down the crypto like Community Rabbit Hole you go you'll find yourself into a Discord group a Discord or telegram group and there's messages flying everywhere because it's an open group sometimes individuals will split off and start to engage more directly in in private DMS and there is this overarching meta uh me like meme perhaps about uh people will take a screenshot and it will be of this one account on telegram totally and on account uh and they are trying to get this person to like engage do tornado caching oh you can uh tornado cash is a smart contract address that has been deemed um illegal because it provides privacy right of crypto chains and so like one of the jokes was that like uh this one person was like oh yeah you can still totally use tornado cash and then trying to go this person into doing tornado cash in order to do something illegal so that maybe they could get themselves in trouble and bring them to jail was the joke and so the the idea was like this person's a fed or this person and and so like the joke The Meta is like it's mostly a meme but people sometimes think it's true is that there are everyone you don't really know who's out there and someone might be among us who is part of this intelligence agency and we don't know who I mean and I don't know if that's just like raw paranoia speculation or if that's real well okay so I'll give you another analogy right so or a story from the past um in the 50s I believe it was maybe it was the 60s a new a magazine a literary magazine called the Paris review came to be a very famous Paris review I don't know if either of you have heard of it right it's kind of like old school now um one of the partners was a true journalist you know novelist the other was a CIA person and the truth about this only came to light maybe around to the year 2000 okay but for decades this functioned in this manner another example is the um one of the surrealist painters was also a known agency person and he had a gallery in Paris and the idea at the time was to try and interest the the reason Paris was such an important location was to try and entice Russian spies to Liaison with them okay because that was a world in which they might populate and that would be and again I'm speculating here but if there's an intelligence Community or a federal agent inside of a of a of a crypto Community they're not after like David's you know personal information or Ryan's you know bookshelf they are looking for someone from the Lazarus group right and that would certainly be the authorization that they would have to be there in the first place it would have to be a national security um operation and it would be very sensitive and it would be in concert with the FBI because the FBI has to be the lead because um you know the CIA cannot perform in the United States you have to have a lead FBI agent and so that's what they would be looking for not you know not spying on okay I I think I've got a better refinement of of my question and after thinking about it a little bit it's like crypto is a movement we are here bankless is here for specific crypto values that we see ourselves as stewards for and we are trying to get more people to align with this movement to bring what we see as this technology with a ton of potential and a ton of good for the world we're trying to get that technology manifested now going back to my Monopoly board metaphors like oh this brand new crypto land just got birth out of the internet and now all the intelligence agencies are trying to claim as much of that as possible I feel threatened because I want crypto to be expressed in its purest form and I don't have I have no interest in helping Steward this very uh optimistic future technology into the world if it just means that the CIA or the Lazarus group or insert your intelligence agency here sees it as real estate to be captured for their own bidding so I feel threatened from that perspective do I am I justified in my in my feelings there or do you have any thoughts on that no because I think those are like deeply personal thoughts it sounds like like things that you think about and which are fine but but I I mean having having written six books on the intelligence community and the military world I have an awareness of where and why the federal government has a presence in a certain place and again we're just speculating here but because of the um newness and the radical acceleration of people's interests in cryptocurrency I would be almost certain that there is a presence and perhaps the way to look at it is that that it's it's observational right which is in a way what you would want your government to be doing it's not spying per se right and that's why it's probably maybe not even the intelligence Community right there may just be individuals um examining things for oversight issues Annie do you think there's any so David talked about kind of like a more more personal type of infiltration but I'm wondering if any of these intelligence agencies use a tool to influence um large groups of people so of course um you know we talked about like Russian bot form farms for instance and and certainly in crypto this is uh prolific across all social media you say something about a specific uh crypto topic on basically anything and this swarm of what looks like non-human type Bots but you can't really tell because they're all pseudonymous if they're human or if they're not human if they're sock puppets or they're real people kind of will swarm various topics and almost try to influence group opinion towards One Direction or another is this a tool that our intelligence agencies have at their disposal and what they ever use that domestically to kind of shape the ideas of specific communities in One Direction or another well what I know for certain is the totalitarian governments use tools of what are called Mass manipulation regularly because they can and because they achieve certain things so um you know for decades the state department was very serious this is before this is when the Soviet Union was the Soviet Union was very concerned about you know rumors that and again this is the old school analogy of it that makes sense right um there was a rumor by the Soviet Union's a very famous case uh purporting that aids was you know I mean so Preposterous I'm forget that aids was a defense department germ meant to get rid of the gay population okay and the Soviet Union the office of disinformation worked over time to spread this disinformation into the media then it was all analog Media newspapers and television to create paranoia among people against their government now It's tricky because the government has also done some pretty nefarious things you know the United States government many of which I've written about in my various books but that happened to not be one of them as far as I understand and so this is a a very old tactic and it's just gotten you know like you can't even use the word it hasn't been weaponized it's been thermonuclear weaponized in the age of information that we are in of electronic information um and so you asked me if the America if America does it right I can't answer that question directly because it's terrible and it would you know it's illegal but what I can tell you is that the government is always or often uses as an excuse for bad behavior saying it's our off it's our defense to their offense so they did it so we're doing it and that's where I would suggest you know I wrote a book called surprise kill vanish about the cia's paramilitary organization and um I have people write to me all you know all the time or on Twitter they say like oh my God after I read that book now when I read the news I see things differently because again you just have a piece of information you have a little bit of knowledge again based on just historical examples of oh this is what might be going on and what I why I believe that's useful to an individual is because then you can say on balance you know this could be going on right as opposed to becoming either paranoid which one doesn't want to be or naive neither of those you know mindsets is going to serve you moving forward either as an individual person or as a citizen of the United States we've talked a lot in this episode about the the possible threat crypto might have to some of these intelligence agencies into National Defense but um something in what what you're saying um a little while ago and he sparked another question in my mind or another thought which is what if there are a whole bunch of wins for the U.S national defense and this technology and here's sort of what what what I mean is you were talking about totalitarian regimes and how they can weaponize and use this technology like different Technologies to kind of control their people one thing that's interesting about crypto is it is truly a technology for uh individual citizens individual internet citizens to essentially be their own bank or take digital property under their custody uh and um with some private keys or a seed word in their head transport money across borders and while this is threatening in a way um to National Defense of like well what happens if this gets into a nefarious non-state actors hands and they're able to better organize I would think it would be even more threatening if you were a totalitarian regime so maybe a Russia for instance quite possibly and I'm wondering if the U.S national defense group might see the Winds of this as kind of a a technology to bring about democratic values in some of the same ways that the internet is a free and open internet in the borders of a totalitarian country uh you'd think would give more power to the people their ability to communicate the ability to sort of rise up and talk freely encryption in case your government's spying on you in such a totalitarian country you have protection against that well crypto and bankless Technologies provide the same thing except for money for economics and I'm wondering your thoughts on that idea if there is possibly a win here for free open Democratic countries to propagate to actually want to export this technology to the world because if totalitarian regimes non-democratic regimes get this technology their citizens do they can leverage it to possibly overthrow their overlords is is this a a thought process that makes sense given given any of the history that that you've seen well I would say that the quote unquote overlords have long thought through this problem in advance right it's why you see a shutdown on on Twitter it's why you can't have you know why the the Chinese government doesn't allow X Y and Z in in terms of the internet so the governments the whether they're a theocracy or any kind of totalitarian government is is is is absolutely making sure that citizens don't have any of this kind of access Power Authority um as far as win-win I I'm an inherent optimist so I always love the term win and I love the term optimism but I do also consider that on balance the idea of dual use right because everything uh has a everything that gets created by science and technology ultimately can be used for for good or for bad you know it's the it's the inherent uh look at nuclear energy so I think that everything that we've been talking about is all great food for thought and sort of personal armor to be able to move forward in the world in which we all three of us live where we do have freedoms to be part of these new technologies you know in a really exciting way so Annie thanks so much for spending our time I feel like we've we've gotten inside of the maybe the pentagon's brain at least the intelligence uh agency's brain and that's something that um we often encrypt I really really don't think about and I'm wondering if as we close out I could ask sort of a you know final question um to you so um given everything we've talked about how do you think the crypto Community should perceive the intelligence agencies around the world um should we trust this Instinct of hostility um should we view them as as fellow civilians should we be concerned about them should we be friendly with them uh what final advice would you give us as uh as we think about these things right you know it goes back to that Eisenhower principle because because one of the things that I'm very concerned about is far more of far more concern to me than the intelligence Community doing something nefarious is the military industrial complex under which we all live you know an extraordinary amount of money is spent building new weapon systems of the future that is what they are called and they get used and then new ones get built and that is pre-planned and pre-programmed and I only see more money being spent on defense and I only see more wars being fought and I only see public talk about you know Mass manipulation um my closing thought for people to think about would be this is that when I was reporting on drone Warfare during the war on terror people were horrified you know there were protests inside the capital how on Earth can we assassinate people from The Heirs what people were shouting in the streets of America and now drone Warfare has completely shifted around to be seen as the Hallmark of you know taking out those bad Russians well you're still killing people with pilot you know with with unmanned aerial vehicles and now they're turning into drone swarms this is exactly what the military-industrial complex hopes for your support okay that's very different than the than the intelligence Community call me naive here but I would like to believe this probably has to do with my Nostalgia from for all the guys I interviewed for Area 51 who were the original overhead Espionage pilots who spied on the Soviet Union from the U2 aircraft and their idea was wait a minute if we can stay ahead of the game in terms of intelligence we can prevent actual shooting Wars I I understand how naive that is and how almost falsely optimistic but that's how I look at the intelligence Community versus the military-industrial complex and I encourage people read my books and you may actually agree with me Annie thank you so much awareness is the message at
