welcome bank this nation to the final episode of the eth cc experience yes i'm sad too it was a fantastic conference it was a lovely three hours with some of my favorite people in the crypto space bringing up the rear we have kevin owaki and austin griffith when you put these two separately they're very serious individuals but when you put them together they are just two dudes from colorado who have a good time so we're bringing in the most comical conversation out of this whole entire series to bring up the rear and to close out this ecc experience i hope you've been enjoying these episodes i had a ton of fun producing them and this is what this is what i try to do when i go to all these conferences i try and bring back the experience that if you did not go to the conference well if you listen to these i hope that you felt like you did uh kevin iwaki and austin griffith two dudes from colorado and these two individuals are of course public goods enjoyers we also have a ton of fun recording this episode we make a little bit of a game out of it i'll let you uh experience that for yourself as you listen to the game that we play austin and kevin of course are some of my favorite people kevin is relentlessly obsessed with trying to get people to coordinate austin is relentlessly obsessed with getting people to speed run ethereum that's his project but they are both on a quest to get people to go more bankless so i hope you all enjoy this fantastic conversation with kevin owaki and austin griffith we usually do our pre-recorded ads for these episodes but because they are so awesome and so fast we're doing a speed run of these ads here we go one of the big themes of each cc week was the launch of the zk evm three different teams all launched their test net and while everyone is trying to claim who was first we can confidently say that zk sync has been focused on the zk evm for the longest the golden end game of the zk evm has been the vision of zk sync since the beginning and during each cc week they launched their 100 days to main net plan which is now already down to 93 days so if you're gonna join the zk evm wars make sure you post about it on lens the first decentralized social networking graph in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto but on lens we say not your keys not your content own your own social media handle choose your own algorithm and mint your profile using the secret code word in the show notes and something that's likely going to be talked about on lens is of course the ethereum merge and the merge is why you should be staking your eth with rocket pool it's a decentralized ethereum validator network where you deposit ether and get your r eth in return and then you can take that r eth into d5 and if you run a node you can let other people deposit their ether into your node and you earn 15 of their staking commission as payment for your node operating services and then maybe you want to take your r eth over to arbitrary for all of your d5 things arbitrary is where you have to be with over 35 000 contracts deployed and one million unique addresses arbitrary is leading the way into the age of rollups you know how i know those numbers because i watched arbitrary's talk at ecc which you should definitely also watch but not before you're done watching this video first but in order to get your money over to arbitrum so you can buy your reth natively then you should use juno because juno is the fastest bridge from your checking account to an ethereum layer two a checking account to an ethereum layer two is absolutely crazy and it just takes minutes juno is your cryptochecking account for the crypto era but when you're doing all of these things make sure that it's on a privacy first browser which is why you should be using brave it blocks all the browser ads it's got a native web 3 wallet and it puts the user first the web three way i hope you use all of these sponsors on your quest for going bank list and now i bring you my in person conversation with kevin owens and austin griffith kevin austin what's up guys what's up hey i believe both of you were at ecc last year but here we are again here we are here we are yeah yeah uh how's it feel different same same different how does it feel how french is it it's so french this is so much i haven't gotten covid yet this year so yeah you and i got covered last time i had the delta variant like the alpha version yeah yeah that's cool austin you you escaped from covert last time right i don't think i got it in portugal i think but i didn't get it in paris oh yeah you missed the paris covent poep yeah yes uh okay kevin you have a talk austin did you have a talk i did yeah i talked about tooling today all right let's do a tldr of kevin stock and then we'll go to austin's yeah so we just launched get coin passport which you can get at passport.getcoin.com basically we just allow you to take the civil resistance that you have on git coin grants and bring it to any other d app in the ecosystem so if you're a d-app developer that needs civil resistance for your app then you can just integrate bitcoin passport with a couple lines of code and instantly find out how much proof of personhood how much personhood score your user has so uh get coin passport get it passport.getcoin.com and there's like a kind of a meta shift i've been calling it towards the world of like identity and reputation uh coins leaning right into that but you guys have been building that out for a while yeah you get three years of civil resistance and all of our thinking and the fraud defense team at get coined out at your back if you integrate get coin passport sick uh austin what was your talk about mine was about speedrun ethereum if if you're in a web 3 organization and you're bringing in web 2 devs and you need to get those web 2 devs up to speed just go to ethereum.com it takes you through scaffolding takes you through you know you'll get the syntax quickly but then it also teaches you the mental model of what are good things to build on ethereum and what are not so in your guys's talks who said the word coordination more definitely have it's got it yeah i think you probably said speedrun ethereum a couple times yeah did you or i did no you you did yeah that's the austin griffith drinking game is how many times did you say speedrun ethereum if you'd run ethereum.com that's like seven for this interview i think they were doing good there should be like a little countdown if i could say coordination as many times as you say speedrun ethereum i wouldn't put it past luke if luke is editing this i bet you there's already a number counter up on the screen okay cool well uh great coordination luke yeah uh okay so what are the themes of the recent state of crypto that you guys have really been leaning into what what's been like floating around in guy's brains uh kevin go first well number went down and it went down again and then it went up and i think that we're all kind of building through the bear market i think that the next cycle i'm really excited about projects that have object level impact on people's lives and do good for average people not just rich people are going to be what's a big part of the next cycle so i think about this as like the region investment cycle how can we disrupt ngos with impact dials and leverage the properties of blockchains like uh transparency immutability global scale and implant disrupt the impact sector there's actually 25 trillion dollars per year that's spent on public goods through governments and we can do it better with impact dials so uh basically building regen stuff is what i'm focused on right now because just when i provide utility to everyday people using impact dials and uh i actually have a an op-ed going live in bank list called front-running the regen opportunity which we'll link in the show notes that's all about that uh one of the themes that i've been tapping into lately is repairing krypto's broken image after the mania that was 2021 so like gamers now hate us a lot of art arts our artists hate us for like you know nfts like people just like oh crypto we got way bigger and like way more injected into every single conversation and now we have like a lot of repairing to do with that with that broken brand we need crypto games that aren't ponzi schemes we need some like actually support the artists and how that not be a meme but i think also the etherium merge plays into this but also kevin i think public goods and legitimacy through like public goods funding also plays into this have you thought about this as well yeah totally this seems like a really good opportunity to show my book uh which i just wrote uh let me get out of my bag here uh it's called green pilled how crypto can regenerate the world and so there's lots of opportunities to create what we call regenerative use cases of crypto that help everyday people and increase their capacity over time and you know i think the first thing is first do no harm so let's reduce the climate impact which the merge is already doing i think the ecosystem has to develop an immune system against scams and ponzi schemes and you know the next tara uh hopefully won't be able to rug so many people because there'll be an immune system for that and you know i think bankless did a good job of calling out tara before it had even grown and if we if more people had listened to you then hopefully people wouldn't have gotten rugged so much so first do no harm and then we build these impact owls that are actually good for people and good for the planet and good for the world so uh so anyway in sum you can get my book at greenpill.party which is all about how crypto can regenerate the world austin you interface with a lot of developers for like their first time into ethereum and just crypto at large does like crypto's brand have does that make difficult uh things difficult for you or are you not really uh interfacing with all that i think so i think that like my target audience is web two developers that are interested in web three and when their first interaction is with some nft bro like mansplaining to them about crypto like as a developer they're kind of turned off by that so i do think that we do have like some image stuff to work on but every time almost all developers i know like good builders start to tinker with smart contracts and just get bit by the bug they get you know goosebumps on the back of their neck when they start thinking about the fun things that they can build with it so you just have to get them through that initial stage of there's some garbage but there's some awesome tech too yeah so if i'm one of those developers there's a site that i can go through like say speed run yeah the development process what is it it's uh it's speedrun ethereum dot com okay so you'd run ethereum.com cool yeah guys what are you doing after this uh we're at the close of the second day uh we got one more day we got thursday i think we're probably all here in paris until the weekend though uh what are you guys looking for what are you guys doing after this today and then what are you guys doing for the rest of the week you first i uh so i have a nuts workshop we're doing a full day workshop on friday where we start with what is solidity and we end with uh like building a dex and learning how to audit smart contracts we're going to and probably drink some beer on a boat too nice yeah nice yeah uh for me uh sustainable blockchain summit is thursday and friday so talking about how we can coordinate is that with juan yeah i'm not sure who it's about they put things on my calendar and i go to them um and then tonight going to the to a dance party so you're gonna teach me how to dance yeah yeah yeah some of this okay i got it like this that's it according i'm so coordinated yeah like physically we can speedrun it later i can take it through it okay i can't move that fast on the dance floor with a sloth so um yeah coordination is hard in the real world that's why i got to talk about it in the metaverse so much right yeah does it count to talk about coordination is that a form of coordination i mean i think it's not just a larp it's all a larp right it's all a large everything is yeah totally uh is there any like other talks that you guys are looking forward to or you guys talked about some of the things you're going to but just like other people you're looking to engage with or uh into also like just like the other conversations that are going on in the space that aren't speed running ethereum or coordination was another like well it's all coordination at some level but okay no i'm excited about dallas in the future of work i've talked to a couple of mainstream outlets you know yahoo finance cnn that are talking about how daoz and web3 can allow access to a western middle class style of living to people across the world and you know so going along with the themes of of what has object level impact on everyday people instead of just the rich people uh the fact that you know on git coin you can earn a six figure salary with grants and with uh the bounties on there and you can earn from anywhere is really compelling and you know we kind of take for granted having access to western labor in the united states but we have users on git coin that are from nigeria and are from eastern europe that just can't trust their banking system and if they were to get payments through the fiat system their bank might seize it on the way to them but they can get paid within 15 seconds on the ethereum network when they work for a dollar they work on get coins so future work i expect to be a big part of the next cycle or i guess since it's already happening the president of work that sounds very bankless yeah oh yeah i'm behind and i'm behind in the word count but i should be saying vanquish luke david to the scoreboard he's on the board mine counts as 10. i need to catch up and i would lean toward like juan binet like juan bene is talking about incentives and how we can actually like make real changes happen in the world by creating the right incentives to to drive that kind of thing so like this like mechanism design game theory kind of uh thinking about behaviors and how we kind of move people toward the behaviors that we're looking for and even going back to like a mean at imcon talking about like nation states failing to coordinate and how it's not uh right there yeah yeah oh shoot speedrun ethereum there we go thank you all right just just what else is on my guys in mind just generally anything anything particularly rise up to the surface building like just getting builders in getting them to speedrun ethereum did you guys have the same level of as soon as the bull market happened at like the start of 2021 like because like we were in the bear market and but like we saw 2020 happen and that was like the first part of the bull market that was pretty exciting but then like the second half of the bull market in 2021 really got kick-started and then that was when like irrationality was just like off the table and what we were being what we were building was just like it was confusing to me and so like 2021 was for me was like super exhausting did you guys kind of feel that too yeah a little bit i mean it's a marathon not a sprint at this point when you've been doing it for five years but uh 2021 had some crazy things that happened in it for sure yeah and some of those things give us those bad images like talking about like you you were saying crypto has a bad image but the word web 3 was working for a while and i think possibly it got tarnished in that enough that like i go to speak at a at a react conference and as soon as i say web3 there's a couple people that get really excited right and then there's a bunch of people that just like check out and they're out of there like this grifter's trying to scam me somehow yeah well we rebranded crypto because it was it had all the negative branding from pre 2020 earlier like it had the ico mount cox et cetera et cetera and then there's like this new thing this web three and then we effed that up too yeah it's a permissionless ecosystem anybody can say they're web 3. you know any jabroni can throw that at the top of their twitter and then act like an idiot and then do you think this is a thing that we're just gonna have to fight for i think the rest of time yeah next week we just need the honest builders to outbuild the dishonest builders i think what you need is to have headlines grabbed by things that are like good for the world and good for people instead of just the ponzi schemes and you know vitalik talks a lot about in proof-of-stake how you want to build a protocol that's much economically cheaper to defend than it is to attack and that's how you create anti-fragility in the proof-of-stake protocol the analogy that i'll use here is like if you think of a scoreboard of like d-gen versus regen use cases um or like ponzi versus regen then basically what you want to do is you want to make it the incentives of the builders such that it's like not profitable anymore to to build like the next ponzi scheme but it is profitable and like attractive uh and to build like more regen stuff and things that are good for the world and so you know if we can shift that incentives if like capital could rotate into region projects then i think that that kind of solves for the incentive like and then it'll just happen naturally like i don't think this is a narrative that we can that we can meme until it's actually true and happening and so trying to engineer that is kind of like what i've been focusing on coordinating one of the the themes that we're talking about with van spencer in our most recent podcast with him was like what is the next like mania in the world of crypto like what's the where's what's the next meta that we shift to uh and we were talking about like layer twos because they're the easiest thing to spin up and produce a very significant amount of capital which is kind of kind of like a grift but like it used to be like proof of work fork and fair launches and then it used to be like uh you know the d5 yield farms uh if it eventually shifts into layer twos like i'm sure it can be just as degenerate as the mania before them but in that particular version of like a mania if there is a layer two mania it produces a ton of cheap block space as a as an exhaust which of all byproducts cheap block space that's hooked into ethereum securely via layer two doesn't actually sound like the worst negative byproduct it actually sounds like good coordination yeah i mean we'll say that we we just built uh thank you by the way count it luke we just built uh voting.getcoin.com which is a way of staking on get coin grants that you think are quality to provide signal into the quadratic funding mechanism and one of the neat things was that we we bridged gtc over to i didn't do it actually you and danielle did it over to uh optimism and what's really neat is that you get the security of the ethereum mainnet at like a thousandth of the price and you can just deploy any contract to it because it's evm compatible evm equivalent equivalent yeah that's right that's the word uh and so i don't know i just it's really great for builders to be able to build stuff with the security of the ethereum main net and a thousandth of the price i think that that could drive alone a bunch of different new use cases that have been priced out of the main net thus far yeah and speaking of danielle he came through by doing speed run ethereum he's part of a regen system where i'm streaming eth to him and now he got hired at git court yeah like a single developer coordinating at get coin yeah yeah more coordination maybe he could come back and help me a little bit with speedrun ethereum though yeah i don't know that'd be a coordination failure i think as long as he's bankless it's okay okay yeah there we go we're all just gonna be reduced to a meme at the end of this video guys this is gonna be the last interview because it's also the funniest interview i've done so far is at the very end of the show uh and so since this is the end of the show goodbye listener thank you for tuning in can we say bank list ten times fast ready three two one you really ran up the scoreboard david has the home field advantage and he won what a shocker you guys are just like the banks actually think about it [Music]
