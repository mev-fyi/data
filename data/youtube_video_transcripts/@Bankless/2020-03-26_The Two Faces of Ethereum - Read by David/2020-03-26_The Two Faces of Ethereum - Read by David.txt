hello everyone we're going to read the two faces of ethereum this article is supposed to illustrate the spectrum that exists on ethereum between fully robotic totally humanless applications and then totally centralized human dependent human run applications what does it look like to have an application at either end of the spectrum and this is a spectrum so what does it look like to have applications in the middle so that's what these this two faces idea is all about in eric weinstein's podcast the portal he brought on vitalik and vitalik was walking him through the dow hack and why the dow hack was a big deal it wasn't necessarily about the loss of funds it was the uh repercussions of how the the loss of those funds were dealt with after the fact so i start off with this quote from the podcast we always think in a sci-fi movie that something you thought was human would then rip off its mask to reveal itself to be a computer and this is that's like the terminator reference right like haha there's actually a robot behind the mask and this is the reverse the computer faces ripped off revealing the human humans behind it all there's a debate in crypto about whether these crypto economic systems bitcoin plus ethereum blockchains are functions of social contracts or functions of autonomous and humanless code who runs these things humans or computers the bitcoin thesis is that we ought to remove remove humans wherever possible the thought that human to human trust systems aren't as scalable as human to computer ones therefore any amount of human involvement in cryptoeconomic blockchain protocols what do we even call these things anyways is meant to be met is to be met with caution and skepticism humans things up computers run as programmed in my theory in my opinion the ethereum world does not pay attention enough to this concept this is a fundamental concern of ethereum's defy ecosystem it's not totally d there are humans at the helm the two sides of crypto kill all humans a core thesis of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is that we can relegate financial tasks and transactions to fully autonomous code we no longer need humans to manage our value the computers can do it just fine better actually but how much human involvement can we actually strip out of these systems is it even possible to strip out a hundred percent of all human activity hazu a prominent crypto commenter tweeter and writer very very intelligent uh hazu always thinks not bitcoin is the embodiment of a fully computerized system where all human input has been totally stripped out but according to hazu that does not mean the social contract of bitcoin isn't still an important component of these systems bitcoiners will argue that the social contract itself is something to be removed the incentive structure of proof of work and a fixed supply asset creates strong enough incentives to turn humans into brainless satoshi addicted zombies that serve the chain forever now the other side of the spectrum is full human control and that might resemble something like my company realty we issue tokenized real estate assets that pay out rent on a daily basis and it just takes minutes to sign up and register buy real tokens today receive rent tomorrow oh yeah no u.s citizens and also we can revoke your tokens we are centralized as the cool thing about ethereum is that it enables companies like realty to exist we don't need a blockchain necessarily to provide our product but we do need ethereum and its defy ecosystem to have a competitive advantage versus our paper and inc competitors which brings me to the core thesis of this piece between realty and bitcoin is a huge landscape of possible human to computer protocols this is a nice little graphic i have of uh you know an ai generated human like just the average human with this robot thing and then i just kind of kind of arbitrarily just place different companies along the spectrum uh in my opinions of where they lie on the human trusted side of things to the totally untrusted totally robotic side of things uh where uniswap is at the ultimate end followed closely by our auger in this game called fomo3d makers in the middle of the robot and the the cyborg maker the maker protocol if you go and mint die and pay back collateral and and use a cdp and use dye it's a protocol it's fully robotic it's fully autonomous the governance of maker dow is closer to a hybrid um the you we need mkr holders which are people to vote on things now that's kind of like a bitcoin mining ecosystem right where you are supposed to rely on the incentives of every different individual participant to create the system as a whole and so that's why mkr governance can be considered perhaps to be cyborgy or more on the computer side of the spectrum if we if we assume that bitcoin miners are uh fully autonomous and trustless then we should also assume that mkr the incentives that drive mkr also fulfill that same role however at the end of the at the end of the day humans need to do something where in minors you just with mining bitcoin mine you just plug in your machine and you let it go but with maker you need subjective choice uh and active participation uh and then there's also the issue of price oracles as well i probably just um this is probably what this paragraph is about to be okay maker dao is criticized for its concentrated mkr distribution the token that represents governance over a system needs to be well spread to have that governance be decentralized however there are three things to bring up one make maker dow isn't a blockchain it doesn't need maximal decentralization two there are sixteen thousand mkr holding addresses comparing that compare that to the voting members of a company that's orders of magnitude more decentralized and more importantly permissionless as anyone can add themselves to the board of a company by buying mkr on the secondary market and like all tokens mkr exhibits entropy time creates decentralization 99 of the activity on maker dow requires no human oversight or input maker dao is a protocol it is autonomous in the sense that there is no human processing of all consumer-facing applications unlike realty but like bitcoin the only human involvement is with protocol changes and upgrades a software update if you will bitcoin creates an incentive system to turn humans into brainless satoshi addicted zombies the maker system is comparable rational economic agents make economic decisions that will converge on choices that are good for the system here's how maker dow creates incentives for mkr addicted zombies oh yeah this is another article i wrote one day i will read that there are differences here too bitcoin is a plug and play system that doesn't require human choice after making the choice to plug and play maker requires subjective choices by individual economic agents and hopes the same mass psychology that produces the efficient market hypothesis also produces the secure maker dow system the same rules apply the more mkr distribution and voting activity the more brainless brainless mkr addictive zombies there are working to maintain maker dow the distribution and voting activity of mkr along with the engineering security of the maker dap protocol will allow for maker dow to tap into the same energy that powers bitcoin anti-fragile autonomous software with minimized human involvement however maker dao will always have comparatively more human involvement in its maintenance than bitcoin because it requires human action the big questions has maker dao stripped out enough human requirement to be socially scalable is it always better to strip out as much human involvement as possible or is there just a threshold that needs to be achieved how does the degree of human involvement contribute to tail risk how much more likely is maker dow to experience a black swan event than bitcoin specifically due to the human governance what is the ratio of the benefits of maker dao versus the costs of its black swan susceptibility unit swap is another good example to look at vitalik buterin frequently cites uniswap is one of his favorite ethereum applications because because of its simplicity and its complete stripping of all human involvement remember vitalic is a bitcoiner i recently put out a tweet that suggested a hypothetical future scenario where uniswap the unisop exchange takes their liquidity provider tokens the tokens that are a claim on the assets in a uniswap pool and turn them into governance tokens this way the governance tokens could govern over the fees of their particular exchange we could let uniswap lp token holders govern their particular exchange in the same way mkr governs overmaker dow the idea here is that um anyone can add liquidity to a uni-swap pool right so you can add ether and die into the ether die pool and then you get a token back as a receipt and then you that token represents a claim on the share of all the assets in the pool you as a token holder of that pool and all the other token holders of that pool can vote to increase or decrease the fee of that particular pool uniswap sets it at three percent by default and what is possible is that you could give the ability to change the fee for a particular market you could have that be a vote by the token holders who have the skin in the game and so they are incentivized to make the right choice however hayden adams the creator of uniswap came to talk about why uniswap is going to take the fully autonomous human stripped path where there is no there is no governance voting uh let's see my thesis my thesis or a thesis the the unit swap lp token holders would pick the right fee for their particular exchange by matching supply and demand to best suit both parties hayden's thesis if a protocol is able to fully function with entirely autonomous code then it should the core thesis of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is that we can relegate financial tasks and transactions to fully autonomous code hayden claimed that if you allow a tote a token to govern over a protocol you are allowing for two separate sets of incentives to be created these sets of incentives of these sets of incentives may or may not be aligned the risk of a black swan event for maker dow is a function of how misaligned mkr holders are from die holders if you think this risk is too great you might be a bitcoiner if you think this risk is imaginable is manageable you might be an etherean if you're a developer building an app on ethereum it's okay if your app requires humans bitcoiners are going to yell at you and be mean but you can ignore them ethereum has space for you but if your app can operate without humans perhaps default to that because the bitcoiners are saying these things for a reason a landscape of autonomous code ethereum's white paper was able to strike people's imaginations because of the combination of unstoppable code and during complete coding language when the early stakeholders of ethereum envisioned the future they didn't imagine realty they imagined uniswap ethereum's future can be many things one of them is a landscape of fully autonomous unstoppable applications with uniswap we've got one in the bag and auger possibly fits this too other apps come close but don't have the comp complete checklist that uniswap has and again that's the power of ethereum it doesn't matter we have a wide variety of applications on ethereum that span the human computer spectrum and so far so good most are still standing and new ones are cropping up every day the ethereum apps that have human skin exposed have so far been sufficiently protected from nature's weather however as many bitcoiners fear winter is coming or maybe not i don't know maybe ethereum skips into the future with limited nation state friction and little regulatory resistance maybe ethereum is welcomed by open arms by the powers that be maybe andrew yang gets elected and puts together a pro crypto task course yang 2020 unfortunately at the time of recording that does not look like a reality maybe joe biden gets elected and thinks that bitcoin is for drugs i don't think that we will be able to make accurate predictions to what degrees the powers that be will attempt to thwart these systems all the faces ethereum is a hydra it has many faces when ether delta was taken down by the sec it's because it was far too human it was an easy target ironically the first ethereum application to fall was quickly replaced by its first completely autonomous alternative uniswap also it requires just one transaction to trade on unit swamp you know swap first the eight that it would require to make a trade on ether delta making uniswap highly user user friendly and easily composable when the ether delta ether delta head was chopped off the ethereum body a new uniswap head replaced it this time with no humans and objectively a better product ethereum the hydra while i said it was pointless to guess to the to what degree the world's authorities will take offense to the activities found on ethereum there is still an important point to bring up imagine there are a bunch of ethereum applications that are doing illegal things from the perspective of the world's powers according to hazu that's the main purpose of cryptocurrency anyways hazu runs a poll or excuse me jill carson runs a poll that says the chief use case of cryptocurrency is engaging in the illegal activity 78 of people said that was false hazu disagrees he says that 72 percent of people don't understand crypto generally shocking result the idea here is that most or all of crypto activity is meant to be legally gray at best uh it's meant it's the primary use case is to do things outside of the regulatory environment my thesis is that haso is right for now future growth of crypto will add many compliant businesses like realty for now uncompliant and illegal applications come first because they have no outside competition here's a thought experiment imagine a world where over half of ethereum applications were doing illegal things and the powers of the world coordinated together to stop the illegal activity in this world who do the powers target ethereum or the applications that are doing the illegal things i don't think targeting ethereum is really realistic especially when it's the application that's doing the illegal thing not the not ethereum itself remember ethereum is an agnostic platform it is just a coordination layer it doesn't do anything other than allow for coordination and coordination is not an illegal activity attacking ethereum costs money which is a really good deterrent no one wants to lose money attacking ethereum applications either costs the same as attacking ethereum in the cases of uniswap and agar or cost less than attacking ethereum due to central parties managing applications like maker down compound it's worth noting that some applications like pool together have human components to them but can be easily patched if necessary writing a version of pool together on ethereum that removes the humans is trivial pooled together and many applications like it don't do this because of the huge benefits of being able to maintain iterate and expand their systems however nevertheless there is the option to do that darwinian battleground ethereum's core feature is its turing completeness turing complete code is what enables ethereum to host human-controlled crypto applications that otherwise could not have been built this freedom is what has enabled ethereum to have its 2018-19 cambrian explosion of interoperable apps the freedom of turing complete code is the freedom for all possible applications products and services to be able to be built on ethereum this is a double-edged sword with great potential comes great risk we have seen applications come to ethereum and explode to dow be soft by authorities ether delta or witness levels of growth that silicon valley startups dream of apps like maker dow and uniswap are clearly fit apps on ethereum i frequently call ethereum a landscape inside of ethereum's evm is a 3d landscape of digital value applications check out my background it's a 3d landscape across ethereum's limitlessness is space for all possible applications to be built on ethereum applications can fill any niche in ethereum's landscape across an infinite infinite variety of spectrums one of the most critical spectrums in ethereum is the computer to human spectrum code is dna every application on ethereum has its own dna each app is unique and fills its own niche inside of ethereum each app has its own nutrient requirements users and value and some apps are more successful than others while there is room to build all possible applications on ethereum there is not necessarily enough room to host them all if ethereum applications are subject to the survival of the fittest ethereum is two things a landscape for all possible applications and the set of all applications living on this landscape this landscape will be the battleground for ethereum applications battles between apps and other apps over users value and liquidity other battles between apps and the outside world probably also over users value and liquidity both will be battles of territory ether delta was clearly not fit to live it took advantage of an extremely lush market cycle and had zero competitors but ether delta was not long for this world even if the sec hadn't killed ether delta uniswop's far superior ux would have killed it anyways growth of ethereum will fill a vacuum the applications that see product market fit on the ethereum will naturally come to fill a vacuum this shape of the vacuum is determined by one the wants and demands of the users how fertile the landscape is and two the capacity or incentive for outside influence to interfere how hostile the landscape is application growth for the next 10 years will follow this pattern provide a product that answers to users demands see if it can withstand with hostile environments over time generations of apps will be deployed and tried on ethereum the survival of the fittest will shape the set of ethereum applications to fill the most fertile parts of the ethereum landscape naturally over time ethereum applications will find a balance between one how much pie there is two how much competition there is for that pie and three how exposed that application is while it eats the pie ethereum the hydra as ethereum ages it will eventually represent a landscape of applications that were able to pass darwin's trials of the most one of my favorite metaphors came from kenny rowe where he labeled these crypto economic blockchain protocols bitcoin and ethereum as young organisms going through their growth phases kenny illustrated bitcoin as a street toughened teenager who could probably survive on its own and he said ethereum is perhaps too young to be able to survive without help as ethereum goes through the trials of nature we will see weaker apps be killed eaten or starved and be replaced by tougher efficient more robust ones naturally over time ethereum will come to fill as much space as possible each app on ethereum that passes darwin's trials acts as infrastructure for further apps to build off of not only does composability help increase the number of possible apps on ethereum but it also helps other apps pass darwin's tests each autonomous unstoppable application on ethereum lays foundation for further autonomous unstoppable applications making ethereum just a little bit more anti-fragile every step of the way thank you for reading if you have not yet already please give this video a thumbs up please subscribe to the bankless youtube channel and also subscribe to the bankless podcast where me and ryan go through concepts like this and other ones very relevant to it uh every monday once a week podcast subscribe to all those things and if you can give us a five star review on the podcast too we really want that bankless podcast to show up higher than ico 101 which hasn't released an episode in over nine months so if you could do that we would really appreciate it
