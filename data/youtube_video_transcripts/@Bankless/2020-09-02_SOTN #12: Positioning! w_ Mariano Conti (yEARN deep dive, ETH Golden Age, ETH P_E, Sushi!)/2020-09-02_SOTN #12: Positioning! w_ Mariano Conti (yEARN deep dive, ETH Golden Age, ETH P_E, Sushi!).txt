all right welcome everyone to another episode of state of the nation this is episode 12 and we have a fantastic show today we're going to talk about wire and we're going to do a deep dive we've brought a special guest as well mariano conte who's going to help us with that deep dive we're also going to touch some other topics such as what everyone is doing in the crypto space everyone who's changing leaving moving to new opportunities and we're going to hit a few lists try to drop some insights and action items just as a reminder this stream is live on tuesday mornings we're doing it a little bit early today um but we usually stream at about 10 a.m eastern time so you can pick up the stream you can ask us questions live we try to get some questions answered as well we release this on youtube and then we release it in audio format on the podcast feed as well i always start with this uh question to david and then we'll get to some quick announcements and get to the rest of the show but david what is the state of the nation this week my friend the state of the nation is positioning we are positioning and that's why we brought on mario nakanti who will be here in a quick second but a lot of cool things have happened a bunch of people have left their long-standing careers to go off and do new ventures in this space there's been a ton of seed investments being thrown around into different projects that are just now getting started there's a lot of things that people are repositioning themselves in order to prepare for what seems to be a coming bull market which is everyone's talking about it and because everyone's talking about it it therefore exists and so people are positioning themselves i feel like they're not only positioning themselves from a career perspective uh but they're also positioning their capital which uh it is certainly something that you have to do in the bull run you have to be in the in the right place at the right time you have to start early that's the number one rule for crypto investing is start early can't wait to talk about it all right a few quick announcements as well uh david we had an incredible podcast that released yesterday with vance spencer from framework that's on track to be our most downloaded episode it is just going absolutely crazy david like can you give folks who haven't got a chance to catch up just a quick taste of that episode yeah it's it's hard because it was so good it was so dense and i think uh every time we have a state of the nation van spencer ran through and and framework ventures ran through that state like months ago like they positioned themselves a long time ago and one of his lines that i really liked in that in that episode was that he has more conviction in his fingernail and fingernail than than most vc firms or hedge funds have in their whole entire body and that has been absolutely true and has absolutely paid off for him uh vance kind of gave us like the dissected recipe of like the bull run so far and like where he thinks it's going um and it's really just an all-encompassing story as to how he got here and to where like this liquidity mining yield farming vegetable vegetable fields thing is how this came to be and like where it fits in the grand scheme of things which is a really important conversation to understand so you gotta listen to it like according to its download charts like all of defy listen to it so if you haven't listened to it like you're behind yeah definitely uh listen that episode to catch up we also launched the merch store so finally so you can you can hit that at merch.banklesshq.com um pretty simple items right now we're going to be expanding later but you can at least buy one of these shirts that david and i are wearing that has been popularly demanded for quite some time so pick one up we also have hoodies um also last thing we have a great deal that we've been working on with ledger so if you don't have a hardware wallet or if you have a ledger but you want to position yourself for the bull run you can go to the ledger store so ledger is a hardware wallet and pick one up at 20 off so just type in bank list you get your 20 off it's a week only deal just wanted to mention that because um if you're in the market for ledgers i am from time to time 20 off is probably the best deal you're gonna get david before we get into the episode we should talk about our main line sponsors do you want to start yeah yeah so one of the the cool new products that i've been using that is also one of the companies that has received seed investment lately uh is zapper and zapper is this awesome tool so i don't know ryan if you use blockfolio but like every time i do anything on uniswap i have to go open up my blockfolio to like make a change right yeah i'm a terrible bookkeeper which means like my blockfolio is always off and so i've actually started to use zapper now because zapper is like it's like a it's like a portfolio aggregator but it does it with using actual truth of ethereum like block folio doesn't know what ethereum had the data on ethereum zapper does and so i go and i put in my multiple wallets into zapper and it gives me a nice little report as to like where all my capital is where all my assets are and like i i don't know when the last time no one really has cash anymore but like i put on a pair of pants the other day and i found twenty dollars and like when i put in my wallets into zapper it's like oh i still have that like liquidity you found money i found you i found like it's in your digital pockets in my digital pockets yeah because zapper told me because it knows where my money is better than i do so you can go to zapper.com and you can input your ethereum wallets and it will tell you a nice report as to like where all your money is and then also it has a cool little tax tool and the the automated tax tools are getting really really good which again as a terrible bookkeeper is really useful for me so check them out dapper's the best all right uh also want to talk about crypto.com so super excited to have crypto.com as a sponsor they are one of the best ways one of the first steps in yeah that you could do to bridge your fiat to crypto we've talked about this so many times on bank list where you have sort of your fiat money on one side you have this crypto world on the other first thing you need to do is bridge it across crypto.com has one of the most cost efficient ways to purchase crypto out there um you can buy it with the credit card and they waive the 3.5 fee for all crypto purchases they also this is really cool i've been using it for a while they also have a visa card so it's a crypto enabled visa card uh in the us it's actually hard to get a good crypto visa card particularly if you want to spend cool defy assets like eath and die i don't spend my eat but i do spend my diet so if you want to spend dye on a credit card buy your starbucks coffee with it crypto.com in the us is a great way to do that and they will give you 10 off things like food and groceries gift cards 20 back it actually works so i have a krypto.com card right now in my pocket and i use it from time to time to spend my diet in the real world you can download the crypto.com app and get some of the offers that i mentioned including the 10 off things like food and groceries until the end of december bankless listeners you'll get 50 in their cro token which is like their loyalty token if you sign up with the code bankless we'll include a link in the show notes awesome sponsors this is going to be a fantastic episode david let's bring in our special guest bankless nation want to welcome uh mariano conte to the bankless state of the nation he's been on the podcast before mariano how are you doing sir hey how's it going thank you for having me and thank you for doing this uh at an earlier time to accommodate absolutely mariano you know yeah i'm east coast so it's like this is the perfect time for me but david did wake up early so you know cheers david we'll see the sunrise behind him as we as we watch i'm just gonna get brighter and brighter as time goes on well we all get brighter when uh mariano's around mariana all right so let's talk about um you know i almost introduced you as uh the uh the maker guy i i wanted to almost introduce you as the head of oracle's there for a second but i refrained so what is your official title now sir are you ambassador for defy are you you know just a simple yield farmer what do you call my title now until yesterday i was still employed by the maker foundation but that's happening today it's either retired or a simple farmer or an ied so yeah anyone else will do i think i think simple farmer is good because um you know retired is definitely not something you can do these days when you are farming it's like uh all of the time you've got to be checking on what's going on in in the farming space and keeping up with these protocols dave and i really wanted to talk about share with the bankless nation a bit about the y earn protocol the urine protocol so we had andre on the podcast a couple of weeks ago folks can check out that episode and get kind of a download and intro to what uh wiring is and it's basically sort of like a a robo um yield optimizing protocol right that's the the quick one sentence version of what it is but keeping up with everything that wiring is doing is almost like a full-time job um dave and i have joked about like we could just fork the bankless like media podcast everything we do and just have an iron bankless version and have enough content to do a weekly podcast and to do a daily newsletter maybe like multiple times a day um so what we thought we would do is maybe just do a quick i guess brush up on things that are going on in wiring just in the past like week or two maybe since we talked to to andre and talk about five things so talk about ave and wiren talk about insurance talk a little bit about staking and wi-fi governance talk about funding the doubt and then finally talk about something that i know is close to your heart which is the um why aren't you um a vault that is is coming about soon so does that sound good mariano yeah that sounds perfect i think the first topic is actually uh the topic of the multisig signers uh mario can you can you start with the multisig designers uh yes so and and let me stress that that is right now the only thing uh that i am for for the wiring uh protocol there is a multi-sig it is uh a six out of nine uh i believe that controls the treasury of the ym pro and i proposed myself when they were looking for new members just because i'm online pretty much most of the time and they voted me in because yeah i i voted for community for a while i voted for you and how did you guys vote did you vote with uh wifey tokens absolutely the one and only yes very good you voted for yourself of course he did i voted for myself and uh for a few others nice nice this was this was encouraged the uh i was told that i should vote for myself and uh so yeah for the past few days i've been a member of the multisig but really probably out of the nine people in the multisig i am the one who's done the least amount of work like literally all i've done is sign a few transactions uh look at a little bit of code but that is the pretty much all my my engagement so far so so why did that interest you just as a fan well um because wiring um waifus the the the wi-fi token andre that is probably the most interesting things that have happened to d5 since d5 started um and it revitalized my love for this space and i felt like i needed to be close to it one way or another and being a multi-sig signer and just following a telegram and having to uh click confirm on my ledger every once in a while felt like the least amount of work for the best benefit of being closest uh to that so mariano why like why is wiren so unique why did it kind of reignite your excitement about d5 all over again uh there are there are so many things first off um the protocol itself generates money for users and uh since day one uh that is that is one of the main reasons it's it's useful since day one easy to use um the the wi-fi token has an immaculate conception story not seen since the days of bitcoin um you know a chad founder i test improv uh android figure which let me say that is not the case anymore so yeah he does test in production he just deploys and gives us mainnet addresses to review but there are so many people looking at the code now that um it has become mostly a myth that he tests improv it's like there's a lot of people looking at what he writes yeah um and and and yeah just the fact that that this story took everybody by surprise of course the price of of the of the wi-fi token let's not forget that it's it's been incredible it's it has changed so many people's lives in a month a month and a half um so yeah can we talk about the price among the things can we talk about the price real quick just because that's kind of fun david do you remember when we had daryl on the podcast yeah do you remember that that was the nation a month ago all right a month ago it's roughly okay three thousand dollars give or take we're at the 3 000 mark then and i remember commenting with daryl who's another multisig uh holder i believe right um that wow isn't this amazing like we went from three dollars to three thousand dollars a one thousand percent gain isn't that incredible like that was already the story of the time yeah that was all right yeah okay so a month ago and now here we are mariano uh your comment about price we hit close to 40k right or did we hit 40k so from in a month in another month we went from 3 000 to uh over you know over 30k right so like when is this thing stopping what's the market cap right now so the market cap is 708. oh no that's that's the trading volume that's our trading volume so market cap is over a billion so it's a unicorn now like was it the case that this thing was just undervalued or are we getting into a full hype cycle now does anyone know i still think that it is uh seriously undervalued wow this is that this is a token that that gives money to his holders if you were probably going to talk about it but if you lock up your wi-fi token you start earning money instantly so one of the big themes that we came out of with vance spencer in the most recent podcast was that like community is is almost everything right like you have start every single protocol lives on top of its community and that's why i think the the why earn protocol is so strong in addition to like what it actually is on a technical level the the immaculate conception was the biggest community birthing story ever and like and mariana you said like you've been in into crypto before ethereum was a thing and so you like you and and maker dao you know arguably kicked off what we know as defy right so no one has a better perspective as to like what defy and community is all about and so when you tell me that like yearn rekindled your love for defy and and i see like this um this massive uh just community involvement and community um uh governors of the protocol stewards of the protocol that's what gets really i mean it gets me really excited we've never really had a community rally around this protocol ever before ever yeah you're totally right and that there are probably many reasons for that you know you have the you have the meme of the 30 000 supply mm-hmm you have blue curvies all around uh you know pumping doing memes but also explaining like out of the blue starting to explain how everything works uh friendly community mixed you know with a bull market i i know that there are probably many things that went right uh by accident but many more were products of uh you know hard work by the people involved yeah and that's another really fascinating subject is because andre spun this thing out all by himself but then if you go to the yearn governance forums you see so many proposals with so many strategies that there's no way that one single man could could ever do this anymore so like we are now well beyond andre and and the amount of just shipping of code coming out of this community is absolutely insane and that's kind of like again part of the fundamentals of this whole entire project so i think that kind of turns us to the why eath faults because as somebody who is straddling the world of maker in the world of yearn i feel like no one is better suited to be able to comment about the why ethe fault so so mariano could you just kind of uh explain to us what the why e faults will do do you want me to start with that one or should we save that one for last do you have another one in mind well we could talk about some we could yeah let's just talk about um let's start talking about the youth first that sounds cool okay let's do it um so it is live today uh it is live right now there is no ui let me tell you what it is um the most popular vault right now for the wiring protocol is one where you deposit uh y-curve ycrv tokens and they earn you a very high percent uh in apy i believe it's around 100 a year uh what is this what is this token so uh curb finance um has a um has a token that represents a liquidity pool of four different stable coins these are dye usdc usdt and through usd and you can deposit any of these four and you get an lp token a liquidity provider token called the a y crv or y curve and then anybody who transacts uh in that pool between those table coins you earn a fee so that is the that is the y or y curve token the most popular y vault um it's what was called the the yycrb or y usdc what did you do you put in that lp token in you deposit that and it would try to farm it will try to find you the best yield and this is also where yield farming comes from from it's you were already earning yield just from this lp token and then this vault will find a way to earn you even more on top um it used to be it was it was farming yfyi which is the first clone of uh of the wi-fi token then for the past couple of weeks it's been farming crv token uh from from the the curb dao token and it's all very interesting but it's all using stable coins right you to go in you need to have uh one of the four this new vault the y e fault i call it the the triforce of d phi what it does is it takes ether ether i think we all agree in this group ether is the perfect lateral in decentralized finance it's the native token of ethereum um it is the one that everybody has or needs to have to transact and yeah it is the highest quality collateral so what happens here is people with ether are going to be able to deposit into a wire vault and behind the scenes what happens is this the vault grabs your ether it locks it up in the maker dial protocol it generates dye it puts that dye into a curve into this y curve token and then it farms yield using the strategy that fits best or the one that is uh you know the highest performing so you're earning in the end a lot of money on top of your ether without losing exposure to your either and this is i call it the triforce because it is good for ether because it's gonna drive the price up it's gonna it's gonna get it uh locked up into d5 a lot more it's gonna be good for maker protocol because uh it's gonna drive the price um the peg down for die so it's gonna get it back to one it's gonna generate millions if not tens or hundreds of millions of new die uh therefore the stability fee can be raised and mkr can be burned and the maker protocol can generate money and of course it's going to be good for the wi-fi token because it is the money robot that is uh that is executing this whole strategy so that's why i say it's eth nkr wi-fi and that is the collateral the protocol the money rover it's uh probably the the the best three-way symbiosis i've ever seen uh in d5 absolutely and so dai has actually had like a pretty hard time getting that peg right and for the last like six months it's been pennies over a dollar which is a meaningful amount oh you're drinking mate i'm so jealous um so and and part of that is just because like there's been so much demand for crypto dollars inside of d5 right and so what what you're saying is that because now ether is now involved in the urine protocol via the why eth vaults which comes from maker there's now like a a super strong vehicle for leveraging your ether collateral inside of defy using maker as a bridge into yearn right and so ux you're expecting that people that are interested in receiving ether denominated returns um will submit their ether to the yearn which will then send it to maker dao and then maker dao will draw die and so then you owe a debt and then that die submitted to urine and then the urine goes and farms in order to pay back that debt and so as a mental model this is like by getting a mortgage to purchase a house and then you're putting a renter in that house and you're using that rent money to pay off the mortgage right and so you add some time in here and then you have a whole entire house right and so that's kind of like the mental model here uh i'm i'm stoked and i'm really excited to see see what happens here because the the triforce model i think is is very very very elegant and this is also something that we were talking about in the van spencer episode where we can talk about composable communities where this is integrating like the ether ether bag holders ether stakeholders who love ether is integrating the maker dow community and is integrating the urine community all in one to generate this really powerful primitive that i think will carry us off into the future uh yes i agree and and there's a lot of things that i didn't mention i'll just say quickly one which is of course since it is using maker vaults behind the scenes and it is locking up ether of course ether is a volatile asset it can go up in price it could go down and depending on the amount of high debt that the vault has it uh could be susceptible to liquidation right it needs to maintain 150 collateralization in the case of this vault it always tries to maintain 200 percent collateralization just to be uh safe above and the other thing that it can do it is natively integrated with maker oracles so it can read from the oracle security module so it can know the future it can always know what the price of ether is going to be for the maker protocol the following hour and it if it knows that it needs to rebalance the people are incentivized to call the rebalance function on uh the white fault and earn a commission for doing that it so it is uh that i call it unliquidatable of course that is uh that is not the case it could happen but people are incentivized not to let it happen so it acts as um you know uh you talked about keep keepers who essentially serve as a liquidating force it acts as like a super keeper right and pulls all this capital together and is and is smarter maybe than the typical keeper it also saves on gas fees right so if i'm trying to do that sort of strategy and i'm doing it solo on my own without uh wiring i'm gonna be paying a lot in gas whereas with wiring it's just kind of aggregating all of the the transactions and the capital in this in this one kind of you know gas fee also gas is at an all-time high today so oh god what is it three is it three hundred yeah man yeah so like even even um wifey as a like a gas savings mechanism is incredibly powerful just that alone let's talk about some of the effects that you were um that you were mentioning so i want to share mariana's tweet here because um you know you made reference to it mariana but this to me was like tweet of the month uh my friend so this is ethmaker wi-fi the collateral the critical and the money robot that's the trifecta that we were talking about um and anthony put together this fantastic meme i think of like what it might look like visually when wyon starts to you know deploy that vault and implement the strategy where it essentially becomes another eth eater um i also saw you tweet this mariana recently that i think um you know reflects your point so this is d5 pulse um and again you got to watch this on youtube guys to get all these fantastic visuals so but let's sort by eth right so look at how much eath is getting locked up economic bandwidth as we're found fond of saying a massive amount just in the last month we've locked another two percent or so of eth inside of d5 protocols uh and this is a really fascinating screen so when i clicked eth i'm now sorting by the eath eaters the biggest like eat eaters on the d5 pulse board and you see maker as you're saying mariana is a massive eater it is locking up 2.6 million each it's just very hungry for each so is uniswap now what we're going to see is wiring start to rise up those charts so why aren't or will it be under maker i guess it will be under maker you tell me mariana so wiring right now is um locking up a lot where is it uh i can't find it here yeah oh okay because i'm sorry there it is number six it's it's locking up over close to 800 million um but not very much eth what will be the case when it starts to deploy its vault um i we need to ask uh scott lewis but i think that the eth should be under maker because that is wow yeah right for the for the collateral is going to be the maker protocol so what's going to happen is maker is going to start locking up a whole bunch more eath right and then die there's going to be a whole bunch more dye minted right now how much dye is there the urine protocol the ether is going into the maker protocol is that right um yes i don't if you go back to uh to tvl usd and hover over the wiring protocol yeah um can you see under where it says 777 it should say it had a pop-up that said um i just clicked into the details calculating it well yeah i don't i don't know if um if that is attributed to to wire yeah there it is so warm finals is built on top of curve its tbl is credited to ym finance and kerp but not double count for aggregate stats okay uh i believe in this case yes die will be uh counted on ym finance and eth on the maker protocol and right now there's like 150 million die minted probably 350 of those are backed by ether so the bulk of it and yes the maker protocol has historically been the number one um holder of dye in d5 we've now seen thanks to sushi swap a big increase uh in ether locked in uniswap but even then it's still no match for the amount of be flocked in maker and that's exactly why you're bullish on those three assets right you're bullish on makers because total locked value increases its potential to extract uh make or burn fees you're bullish on yfi because it's just eating all of these assets and charging fees for every you know additional um asset that that's locked up inside of it and you're bullish each because it's being used as mega super collateral economic bandwidth as we would say and a whole bunch is about to be locked up inside of d5 even more it's at six percent now so maybe we get to seven eight nine percent ten percent and this is all pre-staking by the way we haven't even talked about how much staking is going to lock up that could be another 5 um yeah that that's the bull case guys right i mean for those three assets it's not any it's not complicated you can see it playing out um if you're paying attention to defy right now um mariano maybe just uh just to quickly go back so we've been talking about this why e the vault and how big that is but maybe just to finish that conversation off and then we'll take a step back when is the why eat fault coming so i saw a contract deployed yesterday i think but i haven't seen a user interface or any sort of detailed instructions is it close um it is very close i believe that there's already a version on mainnet that people are testing it may or may not have uh around 10 or 15 either when we started our call i have not seen how much it has now that slight smile on your face mariano tells me everything i need to know [Laughter] uh iui is coming maybe tomorrow i uh no no promises there like i said i am not involved say for you know being on a telegram and posting funny memes and commenting signing transactions every now and again but it is so really very close uh to being released into the world fantastic is awesome we are very excited about that all right so maybe now let's just take a quick step back and talk about some other things going on in y urn um because yeah go ahead before we start can i say the last thing about the the why vault it was mainly not written by android it was um it was contributed by a third party i i i don't know if i if i should mention who but maybe maybe they will come forward later but it was a strategy that was written by somebody else and the best thing and also one such a cool thing about the wire protocol is the person who wrote this strategy every time somebody uses or interacts or makes money from the iron uh from the wyatt vault they will get five percent for being the writer of the strategy wow and that is to me uh it is like incredible so it also incentivizes people to write code for the protocol and earn it's i i've never seen a better alignment of incentives truly so i put out this graphic yesterday which i had my my uh ultra vile.eth twitter friend uh uh produced for me and it's of this like cthulhu space like octopus thing and it has all of the different protocols like in its grasp and like the brain is wiring itself and like that's because it this thing is a like extra dimensional virus that is just latching on to like every single protocol because of the incentives that every single protocol has like every single protocol has reason to be stitched into the y earned system right and not only are the natural incentives there but like the individual incentives for some individual to take it take it upon themselves to make that bridge uh to build that bridge are also there because they can also pay themselves you know a little bit of money five percent though five percent is kind of kind of a lot like or is it maybe my mental model of like uh how like what that what that actually means is is is wrong oh yeah there it is but here's your octopus david five percent of what mariano like can you kind of go into details as to um how that'll work uh yeah i i need to double check the code and and maybe maybe i'm i'm messing up the number but if i'm not mistaken uh it is five percent of the profit okay so it can be a big amount so yeah so uh 95 of what the urine protocol earns for the y ether depositors goes to ether depositors and five percent of what is made goes to the writer and i'm assuming at some point in time like governance like maybe this doesn't go on for like you know forever but like this guy whoever whoever wrote this like gets it for the next like six months 12 months like whatever some some initial like bump uh of funds and or i mean somebody else writes a strategy with a with a lower fee or something right yeah or or a better strategy and then that better strategy yeah something like that so the genius thing about this is that it's incenting itself to like this is uh you know the the dow vision of 2016 where all of the ethereum community was going to come together and create like this uh venture firm essentially to contribute funds into and go fund itself and go fund if they're in go fund cool projects and make profit on it that's what yfi and why iron is becoming right only it's like using the substrate of all of the like all of the different um lending and borrowing protocols and all of the the money protocols nephi protocols that are getting built on top i one thing about this little graphic is i just love how smiley that little ghost is he's just so stoked to be like part of a part of the urine octopus that's the ave ghost all right so um ave david i think uh you mentioned me that you're messing around with this but but part of wi-fi's growth this week may have been as a result of ave so ave ave added it navi ghost added it to its interface right so i can see if i can see it here so that just happened i think last week so what happens if you deposit wi-fi into ave yes well um there is not that much that happens you can borrow again um there is if you deposit uh wi-fi navi i think the apy for depositing is zero yeah it is zero right now so you're earning anything for for borrowing it but uh sorry for supplying it uh but you can borrow against it and you don't have to sell it you don't have to sell it you could borrow against it you don't have to sell it yes i am i'm not going to say what i'm borrowing but i'm borrowing against my my wi-fi to farm sushi which goes back to the episode with vance where we talk about the the farming premium that all these tokens have because like yearn synthetics they the ave they all produce a capital asset but they're all collateral or more potential like capital or valuable assets that you can leverage inside of farms and so like the value of yfi token is now a function of how much return you can get outside of outside of the wi-fi token just farming which is just insane this is why you guys have to go listen to the episode and also yeah and then sushi i could learn directly with a wi-fi eth lp pair but i that is the only asset that i don't like getting any impermanent loss it's like even though with the apys on sushi i'm probably making money because it's like a 2 000 even then it's like no no no uh automatic market makers get your hands off of my wifey so i don't this is uh this is the the sushi user interface mariana that you're talking about right so this is a user interface where you could deposit wi-fi in addition to some other defy tokens and eth of course uh and these aren't just um you know straight tokens these are actually you you first have to deposit them as liquidity into uniswap and then you can deposit them here and sushi is is trying to be sort of a um like people call it a vampire protocol but it's trying to suck liquidity out of uniswap and be the next uniswap that's the attempt and just fired up over the past uh four days so that's what you're talking about with sushi right yes it guys it's a ton to keep up with here like even going back to uh to wire in itself so we touched on ave um like we could talk about what another thing they added last week was delegated funding dow vaults right so this again is the like they were inspired by fair launch capital which is providing um no strings attached seed funding for getting audits done prior to the release of like a a token or protocol like a yam for instance and uh wifey said good idea governance like we'll do that too and so now you can actually get capital uh from wi-fi as if it was a dow right to build something really cool so that was just added you can also the entire time you've been able to add um you've been able to vote on these things through governance right and this is another the genius about wi-fi is they seem to incent everybody to do things like they incent the behavior that they want so one of the things they want is an engaged government's community to vote wi-fi holders to vote on things so what do they do they reward you for voting so if you deposit if you stake your wi-fi then you can now vote on things on chain and uh through voting you get some sort of a return i don't know if you guys have you guys uh voted on things yet i got paid twelve dollars for voting for mariano to become a multi success so it wasn't just out of the goodness of your heart you're getting paid yeah i know yeah i i owe mariano some lunch well okay so how does that work um i've not done it yet so are you get like while you're staking do you get some sort of yeah for apr so you stake it in the governance contract uh and then and then you go and make a vote which is just signing a message and the thing is like gas prices are kind of expensive so like voting for mariano cost me like four dollars um and so like it's good that the wire and protocol is paying its voters because without it there might be like selfish selfishness and people like well i'll let other people vote because i don't want to pay for the gas fees well the people that do vote get compensated and the people that vote more get you get profited right so like so long as you are continuously voting you will continuously receiving uh compensation for both your attention and your energy and your gas yeah exactly so you take the wi-fi token and then you're earning on top of so the protocol earns a lot of money the people who use the protocol earn a lot of money and some of that goes to the protocol and i think this is by it's either by consensus or it's actually in the smart contracts anything above 500 000 dollars that's in the treasury goes to people taking in governance so and and that treasury got filled in three days probably the the five hundred thousand got filled in three days and any extra spills over to the uh people who are staking but you can only you can you can get the rewards but you can only withdraw them if you vote so if you don't vote you still see the number go up but you can only uh grab them if you vote and then you have to uh lock up your wi-fi for three days again back to incentives genius and so is this the only so the the the prospect or the the bold case for for iron is that it has that treasury that you mentioned and then it pays out that treasury to the the wifey holders it sounds like what you just said is that it does do that but only if you vote so if you just buy and hold wifey are you are you leaving money on the table like are you is there no prospect of you receiving any of those dividends uh i believe that at this point yes you're not receiving any of those dividends but i maybe this is this is probably stretching uh my knowledge of of the protocol and i may already have said a couple of things that are incorrect so i don't think anyone actually maybe except for andre himself i don't think anyone can really tell you the complete all-encompassing state of the wiring protocol which is also something to be creative i think there is so much one other thing so um that we could talk about i don't know if you know how familiar you are but i i saw the the why insurance piece of things come through so this is wi-fi again um deploying something that looks to be kind of revolutionary so this this appears to be some sort of uh smart contract d5 protocol insurance um that maybe stacks on top of nexus mutual in some way i'm actually i haven't i haven't done much due diligence here i just haven't had time mariano what do you know about it i know very little uh as well i know that it launched recently i note that it didn't get the fa uh you know the the reception that it should have i haven't seen a lot written about it but i know that it's still revolutionary it's a couple of clicks and you already you have insurance either i think in ether or in die um over i would say your deposits in different protocols you have uh like most of the big ones ave balancer compound uh curve synthetics and even wire and some protocol and the the back end is nexus mutual that's fantastic so it looks like through the the y insurance interface the wiring interface i could get some cover available and there's uh almost a hundred and oh ten thousand okay uh ten thousand worth of eth in cover available and i could say i want to cover get insurance that means for um the amount that i've staked inside of balancer as a liquidity provider for between 30 and 365 days it looks like i can just generate a quote and get that covered here um just crazy that that the pace that wiring is developing i think um it's very clear that it is only it is not just one person anymore it's an entire it's the entire it's an ethereum dow basically um it is the entire the version of the dao that we originally thought of when we thought of the dow in 2016. except now there's just more there's just more of everything more other protocols more tools more developers more community members more capital there's just more of everything it's fantastic um all right so mariano i know we're we're up on time and you've gotta run we've got a couple other things to cover on state of the nation for you guys um if if you are looking to get started with wire and we will include a tactic that we wrote up on bankless i believe we published that last week to get started with some of these vaults you could see to get started with a volt these are the strategies that we were talking about you just kind of go here scroll through it you can see the various aprs that you can earn through each of these vaults and it seems like we expect to see a wyeth vault here on this page sometime maybe this week which would be quite exciting so there's ways to get started with wiring of course this is incredibly risky i test in prod remember that all of d5 is tested in broad so be careful about what you deposit you could lose it if there's a smart contract hack if there's some unforeseen event but for those of you guys you know willing to live on the edge a little bit and risk it this is a very compelling way to do automated yield farming all of the money robot sorts of things you could do and uh mariano we we so much appreciate you coming on thank you specifically for sharing about your um your trifecta asset thesis i think that's going to be uh yeah i think that's that's one to you to watch certainly and um might become bankless in the future yes i think it should so thanks for joining us uh now uh to you both uh thank you so much for an invitation um especially to david uh congratulations on uh going bankless full-time i i i think we mentioned that uh we didn't have time to to touch up on this but yeah there's a lot of people going d5 full-time yes and and it also coincided with you know the meteoric uh rise of of wi-fi so i i think it's gonna empower a generation of builders i hope so too i hope so too and mariano saying like congratulations to you you you saw maker dao from the very beginning to to its maturity so like you know tip of the hat for being such a pioneer in the space you were bankless before before any of us here so congrats on that thank you thank you and yeah i i want to say that even though i'm not in the foundation anymore i'm still very much involved with the protocol i think that i can yeah i i can help make her dao a lot more now from outside than from within so very cool i'm gonna become its biggest shiller thank you for having me cheers absolutely it's been a pleasure all right bye mariana bye-bye david um that was just fantastic you know i hope that was a deep dive on wiring for some folks who are trying to get caught up on everything that's going on before we get to a few other topics i'm super excited to talk about we should talk about our sponsors uh again david do you want to start with ample forth my friend ample i keep calling them the the king of modern rebasing uh so a bunch of protocols have integrated this rebasing mechanism lately and ample forth was the whole entire concept of invented the whole entire concept of rebasing so ample fourth it's a pretty simple protocol with a lot of significant implications it's very much like bitcoin in the sense that it is a non-dilutive asset so there is a fixed fixed it's not even a fix supply there is a fixed uh value of of ample fourth but the the the price of the token unlike bitcoin stays the same over time but the supply of ample fourth fluctuates wildly just like bitcoin price fluctuates wildly so while the price of ample forth is pegged to 2019 that doesn't mean it's a stable coin because if you buy an ampliforth token you will see the value of how many amplifores tokens you have in your wallet fluctuate up and down right and so if a and what a rebase mechanism is is every 24 hours ample fourth will mint or burn tokens from your wallet in order to make sure that the token tracks 2019 so it's like bitcoin but like inversed right so it's pretty crazy they have this liquidity mining incentive program where if you add ether and ample fourth tokens to the uniswap pool you'll get an extra little bonus of of amples uh so very much in line with this the yield farming narrative that that we are have seen and so you can check them out at ampleforce.org there's a lot to unpack with with ample forth it's it's there's a lot more to what meets the eye so you can check them out at ampleforth.org all right also want to tell you a little bit about our sponsor monolith so monolith is an incredibly exciting i think a set of tools this is primarily for our european listeners because it is mainly available in europe though they are looking to expand it and i do hope they come to the us very soon monolith is a crypto visa card but it is a bankless crypto visa card so they never take custody of your funds this is one of the revolutions that can only happen on ethereum it essentially wraps your entire ethereum address inside of a visa card so you can deposit things into it like die for instance or even they recently added the ave version of usd so a die or ausd so it acts as a savings account basically anyway that's all in a smart contract um but the output is you get this monolith visa card where you can spend all of that crypto in the real world you could go to amazon you could type in your visa card number and you could buy something um that is really the most bankless way to use crypto that i know of today it's sort of the vision and the dream that we've been talking about in crypto since you know 2011 2012 using this stuff in the real world it's starting to happen it is a one-to-one replacement for it hsbc or a revolut if you're in europe and what you need to do is get started with it at monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card highly recommended uh on your journey to going bankless all right david we talked iron um big time we've got a few other things big that was a big topic and this episode's going a little bit long uh do you want to maybe just finish off that because i know you've wanted to talk about this and my bad dude we should have announced this at the very beginning so david is joining bankless full-time media i've been i've been doing this close to full-time for for a while but david is joining me and going full-time david it's gonna be awesome man we i'm super psyched about that that should have been in the announcements but hopefully folks that are with us are not catching that yeah so no if this is part of with the state of the nation right so like i am not the only person to leave their previous career to go off onto a new venture right and so uh through the bear market like i've been working with realty to to get tokenized real estate up and running realty is about to release their balancer system which produces the realty asset which puts realty in the game right like realty then has the token and so like i feel good about where i brought realty and to be honest like my skills as ceo of realty were great for that time period but realty just like every other d5 protocol is like getting bigger and bigger and bigger and so they need somebody who has stronger and stronger skills and you know as we all know i'm much more suited to be like a content producer an evangelizer uh you know a flag bearer of sorts and so i'm really excited to to be able to just like max out my like content production skills uh and david promised that he would deliver even more content than he's doing today so i have no idea how a human being is actually capable of doing that but we're gonna see there's gonna be a lot of content coming churning out of the bankless nation so i'm really excited about that but but yeah like like i said like i'm just one of like six seven eight people that have announced that they're they're leaving their job that got them through the last two years in order to do something that uh more aligns with what they want to do mariano just said like you know he he was working with the maker foundation for like the past four years um you know you can just go on twitter and like every every time there's a new yield farm like somebody quits their job so yeah you know what it's just like um all right so this is how this is how sectors are built this is how silicon valley was built right you know um why is facebook why are instagram why are these web 2 companies based in silicon valley well it started with like intel back in the 1960s and 70s right so intel built new silicon silicon valley silicon ships right turned that area into a computer manufacturing zone which birthed the next generation which was microsoft and apple in the 1980s which what birthed the next generation which was like hotmail which got like bought by and then turned into youtube and facebook so the paypal mafia this is what happens right it's like uh it's like in physics you know supernova of a star right it's not just a one-time explosion all of that material out of a supernova then goes and creates a second generation of stars and then a third generation is born that's exactly what's happening though i would argue at an accelerated pace in crypto and d5 right is first wave maker is successful right make her successful now it's in a place where mariano's like look i can contribute to the dao but i can leave it in good hands now i'm going to my next week is he leaving crypto hell no he's not no one is leaving crypto no one's leaving crypto he's taking his money and he is reinvesting in the space he's taking his talent and his skills and he's reinvesting those in this space that's how this place becomes like the capital silicon valley the programmable money silicon valley and it's all in the ethereum economy which is super exciting to me yeah so um yeah mariano he he's pretty public about his most recent seed investment in zapper our our bank list sponsor uh and and so and he's not the wait so he paid for this episode yeah so exactly yeah that's why we got him thanks mariana well your check's in the mail mariano uh and so um and like he's not the only one like like it's like i said like six seven eight people have quit their jobs like i've seen like a bunch a bunch of the people i know contribute seed investments and the thing is like seed investments are for products that are going to come out like zapper is already a live product so you can go check them out but like for the for the other uh seed investments that i've seen that that you know may might not be like so well known in this space like these products are going to become live in like six months to three years like very very long window right but like this bull market uh the last bull market lasted two years but there's this also this idea of you know the lengthening cycles theory like every time bitcoin has gone through a bull market and a bear market each one has lasted longer and i that just kind of just makes sense as things just get older they just like take they move slower and so i think this bull market is going to be long and drawn out because like as the energy of of yield farming and liquidity mining and fair launches like that that i don't know how long that can sustain us it probably can't sustain us for three years it'll probably sustain us for a year or something and then maybe there's like this nft revolution that's really hot we're definitely definitely hot on that um but the thing is like people are shifting and positioning that's why the state of the nation right now is positioning themselves in order to like build something that will like also uh sustain ourselves into the future and so i think that this is the golden age of ethereum the golden age of defy because as one thing dies off and its energy kind of dissipates like you said it will reform itself into new energy and sustain ourselves i think that this is going to be a bull market for the ages well if you if you if you think about a little bit like the internet after the collapse right so like dot com collapse 2000 2001 and amazon by the way lost 96 of its value its peak market cap value it's interesting ethereum lost 95 of its peak market cap value but then if you started getting into the internet when everyone thought everything was dead in 2001 2002 um it wasn't just a another cycle right it's that's been a good investment for the past 20 years to have internet skills right and look at amazon i mean it hit its uh market cap in 2008 and then blew right past it now it's is it the most valuable company in the world competing with with maybe apple yeah to be that like the last 20 years were owned by the internet it wasn't just a boom bust cycle boom bust cycle that's why i think it is important to be in the nation now in these early phases because not only the capital right but also the skills that you're developing now are going to pay dividends and and also the network the community right like absolutely you know who you know at this point in time they're going to move on to do great things because they're simply front running everyone they're simply early so it's a great time to be early it's a great time to go bankless um yeah i couldn't be more excited and i do think that you know it could be a multi-year bull run absolutely david um i'll go ahead one last note on that one one of my favorite lines from eric voorhees is that like bitcoin doesn't go through bull market well bull markets and then bear bear markets it's just it's been in this like decade-long bull market right and we knew about this in ethereum too where like their 2017 bull market and then the 2018-19 bear market i don't know about you but like in 2018 and 2019 so much more was built in those two years so much more than like all previous years combined so like price prices aside the bull market is in the development right and now the bull market is also in the development like just talking we just spent like an hour talking about just one protocol and all of its one protocol and one week in one week and so like that that development until bull market continues and now also the prices are following right and so again bull market for the ages yeah yeah super excited dave and i are bullish we're both just a speech but here's why look let's talk about our next thing real quick uh and then i want to get to eth this is uniswap protocol okay so we've been we've been talking about unit swap for a while been waiting for this moment for a while it finally happened over the past 24 124 hour period of time uniswap the decentralized exchange the little money robot that was you know founded with less than a hundred thousand dollars and hayden adams has another atoms represent is uh his first his first not crypto project his first coding project like ever he learned he learned to code and this happened what november 2018 you talk about things getting built built at that in that time period well its volume now surpassed coinbase unit swaps volume surpassed coinbase in its 426 million its first bull market its first try it's first right like okay so i i put out a tweet like a while ago that basically said um i think uniswap will be the largest market in the world like we're talking like tens of trillions of dollars potentially in volumes in the next 10 years right this is how it happens exponentially right like it just i bet people thought you were crazy when you said that they did they you know another shill fest type tweet from ryan you know like that's what we've come to expect right i'm just saying like it's happening guys it is freaking happening like protocol sync thesis it's happening like unit swap being used by other you know um d5 banks uh crypto banks it's happening all of this stuff is is kind of playing out um so that's crazy that's exciting um i don't know david you want to say anything about that anything more about that or is that just yeah that's that's kind of it it's just like bitcoin maximalists or like bit hyper bitcoinization is happening around us and like we are like the protocol sync thesis is happening around us i like art and by the way and by the way bitcoin is part of the protocol synthesis it kind of fits but that's right the problem with max maximalism is it's just like there's only one thing there's only one yeah there's only one room for there's only room for one protocol in the protocol seeing thesis but there's a lot more yep yep all right all right so uh real quick then so sushi is like cloning unit swap yeah you think about sushi have you been doing something no i haven't been able to follow this one but so it's like yams the mining mechanism is like yams we talked about that right and it even looks like yams except you you have a sushi chef at the top rather than a um you know simple farmer composable communities composable composable communities so they're composing together all of these communities they're trying to vampire suck liquidity out of uniswap it does seem to be a legit project um whether they're just juicing it for the returns and then everything's going to collapse like it's over a billion in market cap which is already insane it's not even weak and we haven't seen unit swap v3 fighting back yeah which is going to be pretty exciting i have a feeling that that's going to be something to watch um but i don't know what do you think do you think this is this good for d5 or is this basically just hype hype machine um like where people farming this stuff are getting carried away with fleeting memes and um you know uniswap is the one to watch yeah so i think as time goes on it's going to become much much more of the latter and much less of the former right as time goes on we should start to be more skeptical we as time goes on we should be more wary because you know there's just like in the ico world and i wrote a market monday piece in bankless about this where like the initially the ico was good right ethereum killed it with its ico auger killed it with its ico the ico for those things were really beneficial in doing what they were supposed to do which is spreading out the tokens to a large amount of people and that's exactly what these things are doing and so like uh wifey and yearn good like nailed it nailed it out of the park yams so good nailed it nailed it out of the park sushi i think is also good like sushi i think is is a very viable product and is and the the whole con thesis about the market monday post that i that i put out yesterday was every single protocol on ethereum there's incentives baked in to try and fork and fair launch it and so like i think over the next like six months we're going to see a bunch of fork and fair launches because the incentives are there and i think that's also going to be good because like that they that every single protocol deserves to have its fair shot right like and so like if we can fork and fair launch something let's try it out like that's by no means means that sushi is going to be the next unit swap uh it doesn't not mean that like things are yet to be determined and the thing is it's up to the community because all things rest on community all things in ethereum and d5 rest on community and so it's up to community to determine whether this thing is worth it or not and a large part of the community's perception is to how fair the the launch is right and how good the product is and so ultimately the free market will decide because and the free market will decide based on how dense if the thing is in the protocol sync because the fairer and more equitable the launch is the stronger the community it will generate and the deeper down in the protocol sync it will be and so i right now i'm all for it like i've seen some some shady clones of you know you know some of the wifey clones weren't so hot but like right now you know we're we're on a pretty solid str uh a track record of like good things wifey yams sushi swap um i think those are the big ones yeah i agree i'm pro experimentation the market will figure it out in time look no no one is forcing you to buy sushi right if you want to risk your capital and keep in mind guys this is a risk when you put stuff into a farm you don't know about hasn't been audited from a like a team that who knows anything can happen you could lose it all but if you're willing to risk that capital i mean the way to do it is to farm it right you don't have to buy sushis you can just kind of farm it and and see what happens see if you like the community see if the product is any better i'm definitely pro experimentation too but i'm also pro uniswap fighting back to be honest i hope they do chalk it up with an experimentation look dodo came out which was uh remember haseeb talked about that that came out this week they're doing liquidity mining right so that's a different curve it's another automated market maker you guys can take a look at but um like when these liquidity robots fight we as users defy users we as the ethereum economy we benefit because they just get better and better they level each other up absolutely yeah i'm very excited let the wars begin fight guys and robo fight nick carter uh talks about like this fight as like if in the crypto banks world like the bitcoin banks because like that he thought that the the era of free banking when gold was the standard was like the best for consumers and you know i love nick carter but like yeah for some reason he likes bitcoin but like this same free banking competition is happening but it's in d5 with the protocols the protocols are totally free banks it's free they're fighting and fighting tooth and nail for compute for community acceptance they are like please community accept us and the way that they do that is by doing things right right there's no other way to do it it's the freest market in the world right now the freeze market in the world like ethereum is just it's the freest market for experimentation in the world and it's beautiful anyway all right last thing that's the last topic um let me share my screen this is a this is something on um the price price again of ether so all the stuff is happening in the ethereum economy but something i've noticed um something we've been tracking for a while is this so if you take a different lens for eth we've talked about this many times i tweeted this out last week uh sometime the price to earnings ratio so what's the price earnings ratio in stocks it's how we assess capital assets like stocks so if you're buying netflix one dollar one share of netflix right um for um it's market price right now you are essentially paying 88 for every one dollar in profit that the netflix share generates does that make sense that's what the p e ratio is so it's the price to earnings so you purchase it and then in 88 years you'll get the value that you put in back and then you'll exactly and then you'll also have the netflix stock exactly and this is all hypothetically because most of the time these what these companies do is they don't pay out dividends they retain their earnings and they reinvest it back in the business and shareholders like that they prefer that they vote for that because ideally the executive team can uh generate a higher return than you can it's better for taxes all these things so you when you're buying one share of netflix you're paying 88 for profit when you're buying one share of amazon you're paying 130 for one dollar of profit you make your money back in 130 years okay if you buy zoom today you're paying 100 1777. for one dollar in the previous 12 seventy uh months profit so what tends to happen is you can kind of see it here is the market is expecting zoom to grow faster than amazon to grow faster than netflix in terms of its profit that's why the p e ratio is higher for these companies do the same thing for eth like do it right and they've done that on token terminal which you can do the p e ratio for eth ether the asset is 38 right now okay all right so this wait wait i thought crypto was ridiculous i thought i thought crypto was the weird one these stocks are like trading at very high flying like money prenatal um p e ratios now they are they just are but the p e ratio for eth is is 38 so that's two percent of zoom right so this is the next global money system that is growing at the rates we've been talking about for the past year and it's it's valued at two percent the price earnings of the video conferencing app good on zoom we're using them right now i like zoom but it's not ethereum i could easily substitute to something else man we could go to webex or whatever um so it's just i think eth is stupidly underpriced not financial advice but it is it's hilarious it is it is no it's not financial advice but it is hilarious it is hilarious it is hilarious yeah okay and then so this is the token terminal we can see this so token terminal has done a great job of doing they call it uh not priced earnings price to sales that's a bit more accurate it's more like revenue right same metric though right very similar right it's just earnings is like after all of your expenses and some of these protocols have expenses etc so if you were to look at ether as a capital asset um one of the expenses might be running a validator potentially right so you'd have to take that out but look at eve 39 here it was 37 the other day 39 right if you sort by pe for all of the other d5 protocols uh a certified price to only bancore has a better pe everything else is higher why is that so what is when when we talk about price to sales the price is what you pay for eth right the sales is the transaction revenue so that's all of the fees and by the way this is just transaction fees not issuance all of the issuance fees earned by uh miners okay so here it is if you chart it out this is revenue this is what is earning in transaction fees market cap is not following suit right why maybe maybe because it's hilarious is that is that an option to front run the opportunity ryan is that what that is i don't know maybe you tell me right it's like i'm just i'm just throwing the data out here okay so you have the price earnings and people are like okay um but it's it's not it's not uh apples to apples right uh comparison with stocks i agree it's not apple stops and then people say you can't compare well you can compare um because even if it's apple to oranges both are fruits and you can compare fruits right so i'd also like to compare the stocks which has money printer goldberg behind it and ether and bitcoin which don't so that's also something to take note exactly so uh back to you eth is a triple point asset right so what is price earnings actually taking a look at only one pillar of the triple point asset thesis only one pillar so remember triple point asset thesis there are three pillars that make ether valuable three things one it's used as a money store value two it's used as a commodity denominated money so you pay use it to pay for gas and then three it becomes a productive capital asset and staking this is just the third one this is just productive capital asset and staking and it's got a pe of like 37 to 39 right now so what happens in staking is when eth2 comes around that eth that you hypothetically own becomes a capital asset that you can use to stake and you get two things one if you're a validator you get a share of transaction fees and then you also get issuance by the way issuance is not included in this p e ratio it's not included just transaction fees and then if you just hold eth in eth 2.0 all of those transaction fees you don't even have to validate all of those transaction fees at least a portion of them that go to eip 1559 burn okay you get those essentially in burnt supply not as a dividend but actually as burnt supply roundabouts so a roundabout dividend so a more tax efficient dividend so the um the pe right now is a bit more hypothetical okay but when eth2 comes around it becomes it becomes real and it's only one pillar one one leg of the triple point acid stool it's just valuing ethan as a capital asset and it is by the way absolutely insane to value eath just as a capital asset right absolutely crazy to do that you need to value it as a monetary asset as economic bandwidth because six percent is locked up in d5 right and maybe that increases to ten percent growing just grew two more percent in the past you know three weeks why ethanol is technically deployed haven't seen haven't seen the ui yet we'll see what happens when the ui is there and then as a commodity as well so all of these transactions you need you better hold some eth right uh to pay for all of the transactions so i don't know dude that's all i want to say do you know that that website that compares uh protocol fees bitcoin ether uniswap do you know that one off the top of your head ah yeah what is that yeah i know you're talking we've shown that one before um anyways well you could look at you could look at um so on that website um both uniswap and balancer now are ahead of are ahead of bitcoin in terms of fees right mm-hmm um so bitcoin is like number four so it's like ether is generating more fees units swapping out for generating more fees and then bitcoin is number four for the first time bitcoin's number four huh if you looked at bitcoin's p e it is 561 and again this is purely hypothetical for bitcoin because it actually uh is not a staking asset does not turn into a capital asset it's just hypothetical but if you compared it that's what you'd see right now with ether if somebody's watching in the youtube who knows that website that we're talking about please drop it in there okay i would like to get that up but the point is is that like there are protocols on ethereum that i mean we've we've said this before protocols on ethereum are making more fees than bitcoin itself right and that's that's bullish in of itself ethereum is a protocol of protocols and no one really knows how to evaluate it yet but like we do know it's undervalued that's for sure it seems that way it quite seems that way for sure i don't know but so um yeah why why hasn't it fallen why hasn't it followed suit d5 going crazy why hasn't it followed suit do you have an explanation for that yeah it's it's a one-of-a-kind asset that no one understands except i mean i i think i think i understand it to a decent degree but like i
