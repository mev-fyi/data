[Music] hello everyone gm gm happy friday or whatever day it is when we're listening to this we're gonna get right in today today's show i am talking about some recent drops that happened and got big what i'm sort of watching out for some projects i'm keeping my eyes on and i want to start with like a brief market update overview i don't want to spend too much time here because this is why we have our new segment moment of zeneca every other week with our favorite zenica 33 he will be back with me next week to do a deeper breakdown on what's happening in the nft market in a macro and to some extent micro sense but worth worth touching on it today as well so uh crypto remains sort of down or i think the better way to say it is somewhat stagnant and that has been good for nfts as zenika mentioned last week nfts tend to do best and thrive the most when crypto is steady not dipping not pumping and that i think is what we are seeing that has continued to be the case the dummies version i want to give a quick dummies version of why crypto is down from some of its highs many of you probably know this but for those of you who don't here's like the quick idiots version crypto is basically doing bad because the the fed the federal reserve has signaled that they will likely raise interest rates and when the fed raises interest rates that means better news for things like really safe assets or things that are perceived to be safe assets like bonds and when people put money into bonds they usually have taken money out of their riskier assets like stocks or crypto and so if interest rates go up money will probably come out of these markets and into things like the bond market there's a lot more complexity to that y'all can at me at twitter for everything that i'm missing this is not supposed to be a conversation about macroeconomic theory but did want to just give that little bit of insight for anybody who is unfamiliar with the fluctuations of the economy everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse unstoppable domains is the number one provider of nft domains with domains ending in crypto.x or dot nft unstoppable domains that lets you replace your long complex wallet address with a human readable address using unstoppable you can verify the ownership over your nfts log into web3 apps and join tens of thousands of people using them as their twitter usernames with unstoppable domains you can have all of your crypto addresses registered to one single domain so it doesn't matter where crypto payments are coming from or where they're going by registering all of your crypto addresses to your unstoppable domain all of that is taken care of in the back end better yet with unsolvable domains you don't have to worry about gas costs or renewal fees because you own it buy your domain and you can show it off as your new twitter username so you can get your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com what i really want to do is highlight a project this week that i've been tracking that i think is really interesting and is worth talking more about so that is the rug radio launch by faroq great influencer in the space long time community builder on social media f-a-r-o-k-h go check him out if you don't already follow him so this week faroq launched the rug radio genesis nft i'm gonna walk you through everything that's involved in this drop because it's it's pretty extensive i have to say and also i'm the idiot i i hope i make you all feel better with all of my mistakes in this space because i make them so dang often i had i'd managed i'd gotten on like the white list or the friends list i think it was called to get a member pass which would have allowed me to mint a genesis nft got myself on that list and then like promptly i don't know blacked out for two months and like ignored every post in the discord saying like hey it's time now to actually get your member pass you're on the whitelist for it go get it and just like completely yeah it was the holidays i don't know i don't know where i was just completely blacked out and didn't get it so of course now i've had to go back on the secondary and and buy into this project that i could have been in already uh so the the struggles of having a full-time job and a podcast and trying to keep up with everything is my excuse i'm gonna walk you through what the sort of four components of this project are like i said it's this is an involved complicated project i i respect it for its for how complicated it is but i want to break this down so there are really four tokens i think that you need to know about and each leads to the other so we started with this thing called a member pass which is what i was on the white list for and then never claimed the member pass will apparently have a long life in this rug radio ecosystem and that's your your first step here your member pass the first thing it did was give you the right to mint a genesis nft a rug radio genesis nft and that as far as i can tell is sort of the first fundraising mechanism to fundraise for this project which i'll explain a bit more the genesis nft will also allow you to claim a utility token we've talked about utility tokens on this show i'm sure you're familiar with what they are so it'll allow you to claim it and i'm assuming an erc20 token called rug and that utility token rug will allow you to ultimately buy buy with that rug token r dao which is the governance token for the rug radio dao that's four different there's a member path that gets you the genesis nft which gets you rug which gets you art out so what is this whole thing basically rug radio is a decentralized media platform that's what it's aiming to be founded by faroq who as i mentioned has been building communities on social media since he was a teenager he's still really young i believe and it's built on the premise that creators and hosts and the people creating media narratives should be rewarded and be the owners then of the company quote unquote that's enabling them or you know helping them to build that narrative and this is born out of feroc's own experience having been a community builder for many many years on all these centralized platforms like instagram like facebook tumblr etc where he felt like the the people that were benefiting the most from his ability to build a community were those social media platforms and and weren't actually him himself he was really just creating more ad revenue for i guess now meta or you know for uh for tumblr rather than himself getting to own the the platform in which he was contributing so much so that's really the idea behind this you're going to have different hosts who host shows as part of the rug radio network he's said and i'll get this quote exactly he wants rug radio to be a launch pad an incubator a brand builder an accelerator a creator fund that will grow to be even more with time so it's attracting the kinds of people who are talking about the web3 space talking about it well and giving them a wider audience to reach in that pursuit and then allowing them to benefit from that ecosystem if they themselves create a lot of value for that ecosystem for this rug radio ecosystem okay so we have our four tokens right our member pass our genesis nft our rug utility token our r dao and how this is going to work is this dow structure is going to be rolled out slowly over time so i mentioned you could use your rug utility token to buy ardao which becomes the way you govern the the dao but that's happening very slowly the amount of rug that you're that is being output as part of your genesis nft means that some people won't be able to buy ardao for a full year right they won't even be able to buy into the dao for a long time and they said that that's intentional this slow release structure is intentional because they feel like they need to be slow and and what i'm about to say i totally agree with in in how they move from centralized to decentralized so the initial structure here for rug radio is that faroek and and others uh are gonna kind of govern the community it's more like a delegate structure like what we saw with ens where you have the community votes for representatives who will really run the dow and then over time as more people are able to buy into the dao using our dao it'll become increasingly decentralized but that will happen slowly to allow for not just total chaos and mayhem at the beginning of the project so as of right now the rug dao has something called uh rug bank which is their treasury of course fifty percent of all sales from the primary uh genesis nft sale has already gone into rugbank i think it's like a thousand eth and moving forward seventy percent of all secondary sales will also go to rugbank so rugbank has a pretty sizable treasury to start with and that treasury will only grow over time and rugbank itself is the holder of genesis nfts and therefore will accrue rug tokens which it will then those utility tokens which it will then pay out to its hosts and creators if your brain is exploding right now i apologize i want to get some of the mechanics in here because i do think this is a an impressive and ambitious project and i like to educate you all on things that i think are impressive and ambitious so that is what i'm doing that's the general mechanism i think i i fit most of that in there i guess the only other thing to add you know faroq has said that in his broader vision here i think he wants this to be like a 24 7 platform that runs and so really you know like a i'm sure he would hate the comparison but a cnn or a msnbc or a fox or whatever right where it's 24-hour content but in this case it's because you have so many creators from around the world who are a part of your ecosystem they own this ecosystem and they're now directly benefiting from the content they're putting out at all times across different time zones etc i'm excited about this i think i am a a pretty strong critic of media i've i've publicly criticized media companies i don't think this solves everything i think some of the problem with media is just a human problem that we can never fully solve narratives are always going to be malleable people are going to have different interpretations of events people are going to spread misinformation unintentionally or intentionally i think it'll be really interesting to see how a model like this handles bad actors my assumption is that the dao will be able to remove a creator if or a host if that host starts to spew things or say things that folks don't like but you know that that's a that's a central tension right is is this question of censorship that we're coming up against in all these web two ways that will continue to be a problem in web 3 because it's a it's a fundamentally human problem it's not it's not something that can be fixed with technology so i'm personally fascinated by media and by media ecosystems so i'm going to be tracking this project like i said i bought into this project i have literally no stake in it other than the money i put up which was as you guys know i'm like terrified of putting too much money into any one thing so it wasn't crazy but uh but i want some skin in the game because i want to see where this goes and i want to see how it evolves and i think it's cool so i would encourage you go to to go check it out ferro has a lot of good resources out about the project right now he's done a bunch of twitter spaces about it he's got a long twitter thread tweet thread he posted about it we'll include that in the links and we will see where this goes from here the next topic the next drop upcoming that i'm sure you all have been hearing about and i want to give you the lowdown if you haven't been following it closely cool cats pets it's happening cool cats pets is finally coming i'm excited about this drop though i am not a holder of cool cats unfortunately because william pister who is our wonderful blog writer newsletter writer at bankless who writes the metaversal newsletter as part of our 2022 predictions episode william predicted that cool cats pets and the drop the launch of cool cats pets would catapult cool cats into board ape and crypto punk territory in terms of how big the project is i have to say i think he might be right let's talk about what this is in a little bit more depth though everything we know about cool cats pets so it's launching next friday which is january 28th i'm recording this the friday well the thursday but it'll come out the friday prior to that i posted this on twitter they have a badass trailer promotional video hyping up the launch of cool cats pets and it's like this like kind of deep intense hype music which i'm so into and it's hilarious because it's such a funny contrast to the visual style of cool cats which is so like fun and family friendly and then they have this like intense height music underneath it i think it's great though the price of the cool cat's pets are going to be 0.5 eth which has created some controversy but we'll talk about that i think that's a central piece to talk about here the way to get a cool cat's pet other than buying one on the secondary market is either hold the cool cats in which case you can then claim a pet or or to be on one of their allow lists and many projects in the space were hosting raffles so that members of their communities could get on the could get on like an allow list for a cool cat pet i sadly i submitted i entered into some of these raffles i did not however get onto an allow list unfortunately so if i want a cool cat pet which i do i will have to buy one on the secondary but we're gonna have to see what the prices are before i commit to that simultaneously to this cool cat pet launch there's going to be these quests that are going to start and people can compete in the quests to earn gold and then to own milk which are tokens on polygon and ethereum respectively that are the cool cats utility tokens that they are launching those cool cat those those tokens the gold tokens and the milk tokens will be able to be used to purchase items and other things within the cool cat's ecosystem and items crucially this will bring us back to cool cats pets can be a guest given fed to your to your pet to make it grow into its end state so a critical piece of this cool cat's pets drop is that your cool cat pet that you will get is starting off as an egg you will feed it items using your milk and gold tokens and it will then evolve into its eventual end state there are four categories of pets i will say fire water air and grass so it's like the four elements and that is how this whole system is gonna work so it's a bit gamified i'm gonna do a fun game called what will the price of a cool cat pet be on the secondary market i said the price to buy one is 0.5 eth or the the initial price to mint is 0.5 eth that caused a bit of a stir because people felt like it was too expensive it obviously is very expensive on the other hand i think no one among us will suggest that it's not going to easily go for more than that on the secondary markets so if you do buy one via mint you will immediately be able to flip it for a profit if you'd like so from that standpoint i think it doesn't bother me so much it's not like they're over pricing these things they're still almost certainly under pricing them people would have paid much much more at mint but i understand it's about an accessibility thing there are people who maybe are on these allow lists who simply can't afford something that's fifteen hundred dollars i i understand that frustration my best guess as to what the price of a cool cat pet will be on the secondary market is three eth so i'm gonna walk you through my thinking on this i think after mint it'll go to three it could go much higher but but here's my thinking there's comparisons to being made to like the kennel club canine what's called board ape kennel club right the the dog companions that were released as a part of the board ecosystem they currently trade at around six eth that's seven percent of the 78 eth that board apes themselves trade for and it's you know about 30 or whatever 33 of the 15 eth that mutant apes currently trade for so the the kennel clubs trade for seven percent of bored apes seven percent of a cool cat cool cats right now or around 12 eth would be 0.8 eth so if if the cool cat pets were the same ratio to cool cats that the kennel club is to board apes we would expect them to trade around 0.8 but i think that's clearly too low there's no way people really want to get into the cool cat's ecosystem there's no way if these things are being initially priced at 0.5 that they they start selling for 0.8 and on top of that the pets feel like a bigger part of the cool cat's ecosystem honestly than the the kennel club feels to the board ecosystem in part there's a gamified component to this this feels like a launch of a broader gaming ecosystem in which the pets play a role there's a a sort of tamagotchi feel to this there's sort of a furby feel to this it feels like a more ambitious project than the canines were which were simply an airdrop to to the board ape holders so i think they'll trade for significantly more from a percentage standpoint than the the canines did to the board apes so i'm getting three e i'm betting three east for these people know they want them they know when they want to be a part of the the the cool cat ecosystem maybe it'll be a little less maybe it'll be a little more but that's my bet tweet at me your bet we'll see what happens come next friday when these things actually go on sale i also wanted to make another point on this price question i heard jim mcneillis at a talk actually during nft nyc say that part of the reason gas prices are such a problem is because projects are under pricing their drops and this is a really smart point that i i don't think is necessarily a point people love to hear but the reality is if drops themselves were priced much higher people would be then priced out of them and there would be less competition for them which would mean the price of gas would go down and more money then would be going into the hands of the actual project creators as opposed to you know going to minors which feels a little bit more like a waste sorry miners right it feels annoying when you know the majority of what you're paying for an nft is going to gas fees so jim was like the the gas problem in this space is also partly a pricing problem in the space of course it's unappealing to think about projects pricing their their drops way higher so that only whales can get in on them i mean that's what it feels like anyways when you have these gas wars of course this is what white lists are trying to fix this is why presumably cool cats pets is doing this allow list and you know there's there's ways projects try and get around gas now but i i did think that was an interesting point in terms of gas and pricing and worth flagging for y'all some food for thought there polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their d5 goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maiden nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes that players can collect as pets players aim to battle breed collect raise and build kingdoms for

corporate world uh this week specifically microsoft announced that it would be buying activision a huge gaming company the maker of the the game call of duty they had merged or bought a blizzard a while back so those are they're sort of two separate game makers that had merged into one they do sort of different things but they're all under one umbrella now and they are all about to be under the microsoft umbrella i don't have any wild insight to give here beyond what y'all have probably heard obviously this is a boon for anybody who's bullish on the metaverse i mean nobody in this space is questioning at this point that the metaverse is coming and it's coming fast and the fact that these big corporate players are doing everything they can to get their slice of it is only further proof of that we obviously started with meta we've now we now see microsoft making its moves i think the takeaway here that all of us who are in this space deep right now those of you who are listening to this podcast right now and therefore are early in this space our responsibility is to fight as hard as we can as this all continues to evolve for a decentralized interoperable metaverse that is not dominated by a couple big companies the way web 2 is it's exciting to me on the one hand to see these big players getting into the space because it is such validation of what we all already know and it's such validation of the conversations we're all having and on the other hand it also threatens what i think we all want to build which is a space that is not run by corporate overlords in the way that web 2 is and look this ties us back to rug radio and what farooq is trying to do with with decentralized media platforms so it's up to all of us to continue to fight for that world as we see how things are evolving and to encourage these companies like microsoft like meta to allow us to to live interoperably between whatever they're building and the sandbox and decentraland and these other players time will tell my friends okay two big drops this week the two that i want to highlight we have the ozzy osbourne drop he dropped crypto bats we're going to talk about that and we're going to talk about hape beast which is the other big drop this week i might piss people off with my commentary on hate beast so we'll see we'll find out we're going to start with with crypto bats ozzy osbourne launched his nft project it's called cryptobats and it seems like a cool project i have to say so the the basic premise here is that or or i should say the the headline here in my opinion is that there's this component to the crypto bats project that's called ancient bats and basically that's this massive treasure hunt that apparently you have ancient bats hidden all around the world and if you're a crypto bats holder you get to participate in this like ancient bats treasure hunt and it's super interactive and you have all these incredible artists who have worked on designing the ancient bats and i don't know i think that's fun i think that's the kind of thing this space should be doing and it's ozzy osbourne who is giving it the try it was trying it in this latest round the other thing to highlight about crypto bats is that they have this biting power which does strike me somewhat innovative basically every crypto bats is able to bite one of a handful of blue chip nft projects those projects are board ape cryptos subducts alien friends cyber kongs they can bite one of those projects and it will then become like a mutant bat that is has taken from one of those blue chip projects and mutated i kind of was laughing at this because i think this is cool and it is innovative and so it is something that seemingly will excite people this idea of like biting another nft it reminds me of wolf game the way that wolf game allowed you to have an nft that could steal another nft this nft interacting with another nft thing is something we're starting to see and that i i like but it does make me laugh a little bit because it feels like we're in this phase of web 3 where things that will be commoditized in the future are new and exciting and therefore can drive valuations like it feels like in the future an nft interacting with another nft or biting one or whatever right like this is not going to be exciting this is going to be really commonplace in nft projects that you have this kind of technology built into it but right now it's so new that we're like yeah like 10 eth whatever it takes like i just get get me a part of this cool innovative project the the floor price on these are not tennis but i'm i'm being hyperbolic but like i was trying to think of what an equivalent to this might have been during the the like rise of the web 2 era i don't i didn't come up with a good example but but the example i did come up with is like search functionality on like a web page like if you came across a a website that like really easily indexed and searched through the site to find what you wanted and we were like oh this is so exciting that probably was never a thing that people were excited about but my point being like something that is now so commonplace and so commoditized for the internet that we wouldn't even think twice about it i think some of what we're seeing in these projects that we think is really cool and innovative because it is is also something that in i don't know as soon as a year or two years or five years or something we're gonna be like oh my god i can't believe we we bought into projects simply because they could do x or y again you may agree or disagree with that analysis would love to hear your thoughts i also want to say i feel like there's like a vampire attack joke here somewhere vampire attacks in tech are when you steal the users of another project for your project so we talked about this recently in the case of looks rare and open c where looks rare dropped tokens to open c users to try and attract open seas user base to the looks rare platform the famous example of this is also uniswap and sushi swap and i don't know there's a there's a vampire attack pun in here because you're talking about bats and these bats are quite literally biting other nft projects presumably that will get other nft projects interested in this it's not a perfect comparison but there's a pun i was trying to like i was trying to do one of these puns on twitter and i i don't know i couldn't get there they were too dad joke-ish but there's something in there so anyhow that's all to say interested in this all the osbourne project i think it's kind of cool floor price is like two and a half eighth 2.25 ethan i don't know something around there last i checked and i i'm not buying in because that's too expensive for me and i was not on the white list again just not paying enough attention but good for aussie seems like he's doing something kind of cool in the space the other project i'm gonna talk about that dropped this week was hape beast this was also super hyped people are gonna be mad at me because i'm sure i don't know enough about the in-depth of this project but i also feel like nobody knows enough about the in-depth of this project because i feel like the point of this project up to this point has been like mystery and like we're the cool kids club like who doesn't tell you anything about what we are which is like part of the draw and it just makes me want to roll my eyes so i'm going to give you my honest reaction to this and i'm sure the team is talented and it'll probably be worth 10 trillion or something insane but my reaction to this was kind of like cringe the website is cool so so what this is hape hape beast is the narrative they're painting is they're like a fashion brand culture music brand built around apes but okay apes have been done 10 trillion times so they've created this lore that says back in time whatever the apes fractured into like 10 000 different ape tribes but at the center of this ape multiverse were the hapes and these hape beasts are the the kind of centerpiece that will reunite all of the apes i'm probably missing something big like i don't know one of the founders is probably somebody who's really important and super involved in all these ape communities and so this is actually something that's built directly from from ape communities or something but for me it felt a little like i don't know trying too hard isn't a fair way to phrase it but it feels like okay you're just doing an ape thing again but trying to acknowledge the fact that there's 10 trillion ape projects i mean look their website is super slick their promo video is super slick and it was a super hyped drop that a lot of people wanted to get into the team genuinely doesn't talented i just find the whole thing a little irritating and on top of that the pre-reveal i haven't checked this morning but as of last night you know pre-reveal for these things they were going for like seven eighth cell if you got in on mint for one of these sell that [ __ ] thing for seven eighth before it reveals this had mecha verse written all over it to me if you guys don't remember the mecca verse drop it was also wildly hyped it got up to like 10 eighth pre-reveal it felt so obvious there was no way they were gonna be able to sustain a 10 eighth after reveal happened and of course they didn't and reveal happened the price tanked the price is now around i think like it's like underneath now for for one of the makaverse and that's not to to dunk on that project it's a totally fine project it's actually not really their fault it's just to say that when something is valued that incredibly high before reveal you want to get yourself out and trust me it'll fall you can buy back in later okay that's my hate beast take again i'm not the most informed on hate beast so you all can come at me explain to me what the heck it really is why it's the sickest thing ever why they're revolutionizing fashion or something but for me feels a little over hyped feels like it's trying really hard to create that hype by telling you nothing about what they're really going to do i also had a problem getting into their discord so i think i'm just bitter not like they wouldn't you know they did that intentionally again the whole thing is intentionally designed to be exclusive and i get that that's the thing so i'm just like you know on the outside looking in and being bitter i'm sure but it was very cryptic how to get into their discord and i couldn't figure it out and i felt like an idiot so whatever that's my take closing today with i don't know i'll call it what i'm feeling and i'll be curious if some of you are feeling this too i was i had this conversation with with somebody else in the space yesterday which is i'm a fan of of long-term holds right i like buying into projects for the long term i've been open about that i'm not i've never been like a great flipper in general that's never been my scene the problem with being somebody who believes in like long-term holding is that you're not selling stuff and so you just keep putting money into the ecosystem and you you're not getting profits out and so you just start running out of money so i'm feeling this hard right now i also like to keep a lot of eath like it makes me it makes me nervous not to have eth and i don't know there's products i want to buy into but i'm not like liquid enough to be doing it so i'm trying to figure that out that's what had actually led me to sell one of my boss beauties which was a terrible decision i talked about this i sold it at like .27 literally the day before it exploded they're they're now over an eath and i also i i don't i haven't aped into a lot of projects so there's not a lot of projects where i hold like 16 of them or something and i can sell off five and create that liquidity like i hold my holdings are sort of sparse for each project that i hold and so i would love to change that but that would require selling off some of the projects that i hold in order to buy into new ones sharing this in case it's relatable for folks and just to say you know we're all in this we're all navigating this together and uh i'm really grateful to have this platform to be able to to share things like this with you all because typically i get nice responses back with people saying they can relate so anyhow that is the show for today i'm so grateful to you all for tuning in let me know what you think let me know your
