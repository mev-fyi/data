for what it's worth like if you tally up all courts inside the united states there's probably like a pretty good number of decisions done per day the united states is like the original model of a doubt like it is the og let's push decision makings towards the margins let's have a representative democracy we'll have the central government but then we'll have state rights and states governments and the states are like well we're also kind of big too so we're going to go down to the counties and the counties go down to the cities like think about that if we actually created a system like that within a doubt like think about how much more productive and efficient we would be rather than everything rolling up to like a single body right now like that is our only option that we have currently yeah it's kind of ridiculous it is it's crazy
