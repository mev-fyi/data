foreign ation how you doing on the Pod today we have dial drops which is an experiment in retroactive public goods funding built by diorg and supported by the ethereum foundation 250k retroactive public goods funding round that is happening in q1 2023. so I'm joined by Ori and magenta who are from diorg and are administering the round I gotta say that Dow jobs is just beautiful I love their website I love their Vibe I love that they're experimenting with public goods and so on the Pod we talk micro uh we talk we talk about dial drops in round one we talk about and then we expanded all the way out into the ultimate vision for Dow drops and the collective Vision that we have for crypto regenerating the world with public goods in a pluralistic mechanism of all these different dials and mechanisms that are going to be funding public goods um the ones off the top of my head that I'm thinking of here are doubt are Dow drops optimism retroactive public goods funding get coin CLR fund giveth there's there's a dozen others that are building this ecosystem of funding public goods and how crypto because its main export for to the world could be public goods and then we kind of uh just focus in on dial drops in in the experiments in retroactive public goods funding that they are running and I just think it's such an exciting time to see a beautifully designed app by an org that I respect so much djorg that is is working on public goods funding and so we get really into the why what how uh who of Dow drops and and um for that reason it's one of my favorite episodes on public goods funding that we've done so far so coordination I hope that you enjoyed this episode with Dow drops working in web3 is awesome but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work tax time is coming up opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity generate proof of employment through pay subs and receive a W-2 at the end of the tax year are you self-employed and forced to spend money on expensive healthcare insurance with limited coverage

extreme poverty Goes Down Glow is a dollar backed non-profit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty glow is basically the same business model as usdc with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stable coin on ethereum on the other but instead of being a for-profit company Glo is a non-profit that donates 100 of all yields from the globe Reserve to give directly's basic income program give directly is a charity that gives people money no strings attached to people living in poverty and is a charity that vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past with glow you can reduce poverty just by holding a stable coin glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist at glodollar.org greenpill that's Gro dollar dot org slash green pill what's up y'all thanks for joining me yeah maybe here so maybe we'll tee off with a round of intros magenta you want to go first oh sure I'm magenta I'm a project manager with djorg um based in New Hampshire and I generally work on public goods and refi projects and also doubtly with both diorg and Bloom Network great go ahead Ori yeah and I generally work on governance Dao's public goods have been in this space since getting my feet wet in 2015 uh with a cryptography Professor I was working with at UVA on researching how you could layer in incentives into the tour Network and then figuring out how you could do what we would call Dows now on on bitcoin uh pretty smart contracts and then got really excited when ethereum launched and since then have been uh writing smart contracts and then then shifting over to like operating Dows and kind of getting people organized around uh how to solve different coordination problems with mechanism design so doing that mainly through dorg with magenta and 100 other awesome humans around the world and yeah yeah well uh when I saw Dow drops on Twitter and just the vibe of of coordination and public goods and the sort of vaporwave design uh for it I was really really excited about it so so yeah can you tell us can you tell us about Dow drops and the retroactive public goods funding experiment that y'all are doing there sure so really briefly down drops is a pilot it's an experiment and how to just put the decision-making power into the hands of the people who know best uh what to do with it and then just dropping money into a mechanism that can aggregate their preferences and giving money out in that way and so the framing for Dow drops is to select and vote on people that have already contributed to the public good in the ethereum ecosystem so it's not like a grant system for future work but it's more just a reward system for past work and the idea is that if you evolve a mechanism like this you do it repetitively eventually continuously then you could actually alter behavior and drive people to spend more time working on the public good because they have a credibly neutral reliable mechanism that will reward them for doing so okay well we'd love to dive into round one it looks like it started on or you all launched on January 12th and round one is Distributing 250k USD DC so we're recording on February 23rd where are y'all uh what's the status as of February 23rd of that first round we're just finishing up the the and official information gathering from the final nominees um so uh we gathered a smaller subset of all of the nominees um kind of ruled out folks that weren't quite aligned with public goods funding um and kind of optimized for uh kind of under visible underfunded sort of corners of the ecosystem and um then uh so we're just finishing up that info Gathering process and then we'll load those finalists into the UI of the app and then like Ori described the people who have voting points from their on-chain activity will be able to drop those points it looks like a really cute video game this part I'm excited for and you can drop your points into the projects that you want to receive a percentage of the overall funding um and that will happen we'll probably start that round in a week maybe two weeks and that'll run for I think we have that running for two weeks possibly three okay so um it's February 23rd right now uh I've got a couple of East Denver episodes we're gonna push out for the next week and then this episode will probably go out the first week of March so uh as the listeners as this is hitting your ear then uh will it be in the phase in which people can actually vote if they have on chain history which allows them to be to to be voting and it sounds like it's kind of like a cute fun game where people can allocate Capital to those projects retroactively is that right yep and that's about the right timing so be sure to uh check in the app if you have voting points with multiple different wallet addresses likely we pulled data from um the Devcon and East Denver poapps from the Galaxy shadowy Super coders list so if you've deployed smart contracts on ethereum um and then lastly if you participate in Dows we pulled the data list from Dow drops or sorry uh deep Downs analytics so you know any of those activities uh check yeah check the wallet addresses and you probably have points there's I think 113 000 wallet addresses 130 000 that have points so definitely uh take a look so the URL if I'm listening to this the URL I want to go to is dowdrops.io is that right yeah okay I've got it up on a monitor right here and I gotta say it's it's very beautiful and in vaporwave and so I'm excited to see the the actual user interface of the game it looks like it's you all put a lot of Polish into the design so Kudos on that yeah that was Colin what's Colin's last name Marie expense yeah yeah and uh Maria burata amazing well great work Colin and Maria uh I'm a I'm a SIM for vaporwave kind of design so great work um would love to to talk a little bit about the the origin of the project so why retroactive public goods funding um you know how did this project come come about and in in a world in which y'all are maximally successful what is Dow drops look like in I don't know around 15 or around uh around 69 uh play it play us forward a little bit in a world in which you all are maximally successful without drops looks like definitely definitely so starting at the beginning I guess um the idea has probably been out there in different forms for a long time but I think vitalik did a good job of crystallizing it like a year or two um with a blog post and a talk he gave on retroactive public goods funding the idea being that most of public goods funding is forward-looking it's people promising to do stuff for a grant but it's actually really hard to vet how well people will do in advance and what the impact they have will be if they're trustworthy to pull it off if they're run into roadblocks so it would be better potential actually for for certain kinds of work anyways if you could just look in the past and reward people in some way for that and that way people who did kind of maybe minor things at the time uh maybe on their spare spare time uh that actually ended up having a big impact um could be rewarded and so this could drive Behavior going forward um and so I think Vitale kind of put out there as an idea and then optimism might have been the first team to really put it into action with their I don't know the exact details I think it was with their airdrop they allocated a portion of the op Supply to um to projects individuals that had contributed to the public good according to some sort of heuristic that they used um and then there's other kind of more sophisticated ideas out there for how retro rpgf could work in the future um and some of them include sort of tokens that you would buy ahead of time that might be not worth anything and then if the the action ends up being good for the public then a retroactive public funder which could be big organizations High Network individuals or crowdfunded um could purchase those kind of tokens in the future so we didn't go with one of those approaches because I think they're still like regulatory uncertainty and a lot of r d that has to be done there but we wanted to do something more straightforward and most importantly for us is empowering um the crowd as the evaluators and doing so in such a way that we're measuring people's past on-chain activity to decide how much power different addresses have and in a way that doesn't actually require us to check identity to know that it's one person one account since the scoring is just based on actual things you've done it doesn't matter if you did it through one address or through seven addresses so that's a little bit more about the context of the I guess the idea of public goods funding and then the mechanism and I guess that the short version of the story of how we got here is that someone um from the EF who was formerly at the EF basically reached out to us with this problem of you know the EF is a small organization they have a lot of money that they have to get out fairly intelligently fairly quickly and how can this you know small non-profit know all of the areas in the ecosystem that most need resources and so they you know we talked with them and brainstormed ideas um kind of went really wide at the whole design space um looked at the last of Bitcoin has done uh stuff optimism did and CLR several other projects and then came away with this as kind of a good way to trial the idea um and to do it in a way um that's round based where there could be iteration where we didn't have to like over design or over build the first time before we had any learnings so the idea really is to do it polished and and well thought through but a little bit quick and dirty right like a little bit get it out there ship build in public get feedback do a report afterwards with what happened we've already learned so much and already like people have come to us with ideas um and we've amongst ourselves come up with them kind of as it's gone on but yeah like really kind of grateful that the EF was willing to run this experiment with us and kind of give us a little drop of funding to kind of give get out there and hopefully um eventually this could I guess to answer your question about the grand Vision I would love it if this went really well and then round two is slightly bigger and got more sponsors and on and on and eventually this was at least for the ethereum ecosystem one of the key uh places that they could just drop money and then they'll know that there's an intelligent swarm that's going to allocate it um to where it needs to go some other kind of future Visions is that um mechanisms like this whether it's you know us doing it or not um should be kind of really core to large ecosystems anything from like l-1s to um large defy Dows or even like networked States you know you need a way to kind of allocate resources towards Network Goods um and so we think that this is like some a tool that you could eventually use for like let's say taking the whatever taxation your system has or inflation so like monetary or fiscal policy it could be like a decentralized way of allocating resources that are collected in whatever manner an ecosystem has access to magenta anything to add oh one of the areas is interesting for this project instigate and also develop itself is around algorithmic governance so how you pull on chain data or even in more real world applications um Real World experience that people have to make sure that diverse stakeholders and diverse mixes of different types of experts or stakeholders are able to make decisions about where um Finance Flows In an ecosystem or a um you know Coalition that sort of thing and um yeah as we run analytics on on-chain activity and start to have you know all kinds of things of interesting combinations of that use machine intelligence to know what would be learned over time what are good combinations of types of diversity that you need to um you know limit uh bad consequences or you know a certain small group of people having and a disproportionate amount of resources and attention in an ecosystem that kind of like shoots the ecosystem in the foot right because they're like missing really key ingredients or in the case of like real world public goods um you know messing with like not getting the market dynamics quite correct with uh actually rebalancing local ecosystems and the the whole market dynamics of that regionally and globally so yeah the whole field of other in the governance I think is like very underexplored um and I think this project like opens up a window into what's possible there yeah amen well I'm just so long on collective intelligence for Network Goods I Envision a pluralistic um infrastructure for funding public goods that where there's a pluralism of mechanisms quadratic funding retroactive public goods funding give backs dominance Assurance contracts probably a bunch of mechanisms that haven't even been invented yet and um people will be earning from completing public goods from these pluralisms of pluralistic uh set of mechanisms and each mechanism might be good at X and Y but but bad at Z and a b and c and it's the pluralism of mechanisms that allows each mechanism to do one thing and do it well um and and and I think that like I'm really Aaron McMillan and I uh aren't started CLR fund and of course I'm a founder of Bitcoin I've been talking about this idea of practical pluralism for a long time about how these public goods funding mechanisms can kind of coexist with each other other and inspired by the ethereum clients and how they have client diversity with one another um can kind of coexist and and um you know the client diversity at the at the base layer of the ethereum network creates an anti-fragility in the ethereum network because if one client uh gets messed up then the network doesn't Fork um but in the same thing should be true with public goods funding is that you should have a pluralism of mechanisms that support public goods in in different ways and um I'm just really here for it like the the Gestalt of all the different mechanisms together is really cool and and I think the ultimate sort of pluralistic thing that we that we could do is is all be supporting each other in order to creating this world of of public goods together and I'm just I really believe that crypto can regenerate the world when when we've got a pluralism of these mechanisms and they're well funded and starting to scale uh to funding the world's public goods so I think that um I think that my vision is is is somewhat aligned with Dow drops uh Vision but you know I'll be curious if you have any sort of reaction to to to that or to that prompt in any way yeah I definitely think the composability is key that we're all running these little experiments and they're all in an aggregate scale like rapidly iterating uh spreading or dying and so we have this nice kind of like evolutionary process right now running where the best things get copied and the things that didn't quite work uh wither away and so I think the fact that they're happening on these common substrates of like open public blockchains makes the composability like really compelling and natural so in the same way that um the first couple airdrops you know uniswap and then um the others um they could quickly copy that mechanism and they realized for a little bit they thought it worked and then it wasn't working as well and people like refined the way it happens uh Bitcoin obviously had a way more sophisticated one because they could have they were able to learn from the the pluses and minuses of past approaches and I think there's still a lot of missing pieces and that's why the conversations are important that have in between projects like Bitcoin CLR Dow drops because we're ultimately we could be reducing the work uh by by reusing common components and I think like a really good example of this I've been talking to Hoke a lot um at hyperserts out of protocol Labs so yeah I think something like that's really cool where Bitcoin could plug into that um and maybe you know real quick let me just explain what hyper yeah exactly all right let me get up here I just want to explain what hyper certs were to the audience yeah let's both try it because I'm gonna do a bad job but so my attempt will be it's like a way to have an on-chain um certification that you did something and you don't necessarily know if that thing is had impact yet but it's basically a tokenized uh representation of um like some attempts at public good that you did and then it could be purchased in the future by retroactive public uh funder did I do a good job I'm curious what you would say data because it's a fairly New Concept yeah yeah so I mean I would I would describe a hyper cert as like a carbon credit but on any impact Vector so like I took 10 tons of carbon out of the atmosphere or we could have a hyper Surfer I took I fixed 10 potholes in my street uh I funded 10 months of Open Source software and so whatever the plur the plurality of types of capital there are whether it's spiritual capital or intellectual capital or material Capital you commit to hypersert for it and then once you've got impact owls that are issuing hyper certs if you can engineer buy pressure for those hyper certs then what you've done is you've given every impact out people are creating value a way to capture value because they're they're printing hyper certs and with buy pressure that means that you're generating Revenue by generating impact um and it gives every impact our business model from there in like a granular way of tracking impact which is important for impact evaluation but also um you know like the buy pressure is important for funding public goods and so um the combination of these things is that with retroactive public goods funding if if I believe in the present that I'm able to um generate a hundred million dollar exit for investors by just supporting public goods um then then like VCS and angels will start investing in public goods on the expectation that in 10 years that between like Dow drops and optimism and all these other things they'll be able to have a 100 million dollar exit and that allows in the present people to like invest in those projects seeking that exit in the future and Hyper certs could be like a way of connecting the impact that you've created now to that future payout in in the future that's the way I sort of Stitch the ideas uh together but as I'm saying it I feel like Charlie and Always Sunny like have like kind of like really try to stitch it together in a crazy way but um the sketch is there like I think the skeleton for how webpage can fund public goods in a pluralistic way is all is all sort of there what's your reaction to that totally I and I think hyper sets are really nice because they're a data layer and it's really agnostic to what you do with the data so the way I've understood it is you could have evaluators of different sorts and different sorts of networks or protocols like or even centralized bodies acting as evaluators and then there's an even different layer which is the funders right so it's nice because it's this building block stack where any one part can kind of fail or be experimented with and it only kind of like improves the whole and so I think hyper sets are really nice as a bottom layer and then you have things like verifiable credentials another cool project that reached out to us like the ethereum uh to station service and I know there's other like a lot of projects in the like verifiable credential space and so and then you have things like Claris where you can have like these subjectivity oracles and so I I really like the way things are going right now where everyone is in their little pocket of this net and is is like you know really trying hard to make it work and then seeing how they can link up to other parts and every once in a while I think we'll have these breakthroughs where it's like like the again like the git coin um quadratic funding where it's like that was one of many ideas that were talked about in in the space but it kind of it was able like to have the right um ux the right mechanism design and the right kind of um storytelling to make it actually like impact the real world right and not just be another um idea that's floating around in the mechanism design space yeah the other thing I would add in that is that those data layers and Hyper certs also present the potential for peer learning so ways to access the data like I heard a person from agroforest Dow describe like if I was working with a new seed because of the climate in my region is Shifting and I have to find plants that are adapted to that and learn how to grow them for the first time I can look into the hyper certs and see who has used that in their verification of carbon credits or some kind of food system sovereignty thing um and then maybe even contact them or find how to get in touch and like ask for tips on growing this or maybe that's packed into the hyper cert um so and like the collective sense making of that and also the potential for like IRL Community adoption and Leadership with these sorts of tools is the other kind of potential that comes to mind with these you know open system collaborative approaches to it because well I once those people grab hold of those tools they're not technology anchored right they have like a kind of a different mindset and so the creative ways that they use those um yeah I'm just excited to see this space now that the ux is starting to be more and more usable by people who aren't Engineers um that just opens up a whole nother possibility space of like how the public goods funding tools get used but also the leadership diversifies of who is um kind of directing the development of them so that's a really exciting like cusp of development that's I think happening right now across the ethereum ecosystem yeah totally um anything else that's in the Dow drops Vision or the world that you want to create that uh that you want to say within the within the next 10 minutes yeah I'll piggyback off what magenta said about taking this kind of outside the crypto space into IRL so I think like we and a lot of people in the space see crypto as the natural testing ground for these things because they're using smart contracts they're using cryptocurrency and so it makes sense to test those with public goods funding in those communities right but um people like shouldn't forget that that's not the goal right like that's one step along the way to the goal but for us like um you know like I was saying earlier the vision of having like L ones and things like that use mechanisms like this to fund Network Goods is like one massive important um stepping stone and then we don't want to delay for too long the extension of this into like communities that have nothing to do with crypto and so I think magenta and I both in different ways are involved in these IRL communities where people are experimenting with um provisioning The Commons in new ways and we want to be you know part of the force kind of bringing crypto in light ways smart contracts into those spaces and so like I think uh some people interesting people reached out about using doubt drops like running it um for like different kinds of IRL public goods funding and just generally like I think currency design um quadratic voting and all these different things like it's really interesting to start to see where the first place is what are going to be the first dominoes to fall of where people are willing to experiment with this [Music] um offline or outside of crypto so you know municipalities or like Federated co-ops or maybe there's like um larger scale kind of like large ngos or corporates um or other kinds of communities like online communities that um find this useful that you know as the kind of different building blocks get into place like wallet ux and Peru social recovery account abstraction you know all these things that we've imagined for a long time become more possible and a lot of times it's crypto people we forget about that we just assume like oh yeah like there's too high a barrier to entry but actually that barrier to entry is going down all the time so it becomes more and more possible like every couple months that go by to try something out like this that touches like um worlds outside of our our smart contract crypto bubbles yeah for sure I remember uh I did this experiment with Zach Herring and Katie Johnson who are two of my compatriots back when Bitcoin was at consensus and uh we just we just yellowed together a 25k round um and a completely new platform for doing quadratic funding in downtown Boulder Colorado in in mid-2020 we had saw that our our local community that that the retail businesses on Main Street had seen their rent dropped by uh or sorry not the rent dropped uh their rent stay the same which is part of the problem and the foot traffic for these businesses went down 99 and so we did a quadratic funding round for downtown Boulder and you know we abstracted all the blockchain in the back it was kind of like a blockchain mullet uh you web 2 ux in the front and we were able to fund um a quadratic funding round with a comic book shop and yoga studio in a bookstore and a couple other downtown stores in Boulder and it was just so cool to see this mechanism that was prototyped in crypto as an ecosystem development tool um be used for real World public goods and you know it was much more Nimble agile and effective than I think what the local municipal government could put together it was also way less administrative overhead and I would love to see that like Dow drops and retroactive public goods funding and quadratic funding more and more people hit Main Street um public goods because public goods are good and like they're an end in themselves but I also think crypto has a reputational damage like we shouldn't talk about how crypto is good for the world until it actually is good for the world and this can be like an export like the national export or like the network State export of crypto can be public goods at least that's how I would State my my vision I don't know how that that jives with with y'all's BuzzFeed I like it um well uh anything else to say about the macro macro Vision uh I guess I'll just ask the question that I asked 10 minutes ago in a world in which you're maximally successful uh what does this look like what is the dense in the universe that this has over the next 10 years yeah so I think the point for me of focusing so intensely on mechanism design for like the way money works and the way money flows is actually to bring money like into the background so I think today for so many people whether you're working in like for-profit sector public goods non-profit government like money is so front and center to everything you do like both organizations and individuals like you work you you spend and and everything's a calculation you know with money and so I think like the big impact to have is if something like this can run in the background and then just be silently allocating money to all the places where they're needed most where there's been a lot of impact and there could be more impact if money is sprinkled there so what we want to see what we want to do away with like the 10-year vision is like grant writing is not a thing like organizations that are doing public good don't have to spend 60 of their time asking for money right they can just have like like kind of automated flows reporting what they do building in public you know social media Etc and then various mechanisms not one grand mechanism but like various mechanisms that they're in like this like internet of public goods or something like that are spewing out various kinds of tokens at them and they're automatically kind of like reinvesting them in the places where they needed to go so I think that's what it is it's like kind of cybernetic quietly humming like money Forest where like money's just like actually growing on trees and like going but intelligently growing and so to get more concrete about how dad drops could play a role in that is that I think eventually we don't want to see it be rounds we would like it to be like a continuous flowing stream so imagine if there's just this like black hole anyone can throw money into it and then it's just getting spewed out in real time to like all these different like hundreds of thousands of organizations and individuals and as they're doing activity like if they do more public good the evaluator Network starts to like point at them and their stream goes up and if they stop doing good they you know go MIA they're streamed gradually like winds down and so you could think of it as like a Ubi for all the different like micro activities people are doing that contribute back to various sorts of public good yeah I'm in um uh I I would yeah I agree with all that except uh I'll use the word uh uh intelligently routing value instead of spewing out uh money would be the winner I like it not to not to troll you too hard um go go um like sorry one thing I just wanted to add was like it's easy to like you know I'm a systems nerd and I get into all these like complex systems but I just want to like collapse it down to the like the agent level view which is just like if you can make money for supporting public goods then you can quit your corporate job you can quit your like sort of like private job and you can just work for the public and we can pay our mortgage by working for the public so I just want to like collapse that down into like the agent level design also that's that's kind of what I what I view this is as as creating an incentive system for the world totally and I think something that really upsets me is to see so many of the smartest hard-working hardest working people I know like spending all of their energy and like investing it into systems that like are not doing good for the world or actively doing like harm to the world and they're just like yeah but that's the only way I can keep making X thousand dollars a year and that and that's like you know what else am I gonna do it's so expensive to live in the city that I like so you know if there could be Alternatives that say Hey like like you're saying it you can quit your this job uh you can go do stuff that like is interesting to you and helps people um that's that's game changing if you can do that at scale there's this quote uh that really slaps hard for me the best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads at Facebook uh sums it up I don't know it like hurts my soul a little bit to hear that um magenta it felt like you had something to add and I I'm I'm sorry if we veered away from the point you were gonna make but I wanted to give you space to say it no all good I am just Greening huge it's so fun to be here and listen and dialogue with you both um what was I going to say uh uh I I don't know it was a while back but also one thing that comes to mind is um in that kind of open ongoing Grant sort of system um I often think like this came up on our round to so it takes a bit of effort to make a Bitcoin Grant listing right and you still we have like separate listings on Dow drops um and so one thing I'd like to see is more I guess hyper search is one solution but also when a project has a profile for public goods funding on these different platforms um to not have to create that multiple times I think my meta from metagame is working on a kind of open profile system I think they're using ceramic but something like that could be a potential solution um that just came to my mind in in the course of talking about because these these systems are so much better right like you can see each other you can build relationships wherein like a you know competitive corporate world or a non-profit world you have like these closed doors well you know in the corporate context you get between divisions between sectors and not a good flow of different types of expertise and Industry collaboration on the non-profit side there's just you know totally closed process where you can't see the other people it takes you three months to write an application so yeah there's that shared profile of projects or or individuals that are you know hey I'm available for Public Funding um it'll be really helpful and maybe add another thing but I can't remember it doesn't matter yeah yeah um well I know that uh interop between all these different public goods funding mechanisms is going to be something that is in the web 3 ethos so I hope to see someone building a grant aggregator where I can uh apply to Dow drops and apply to CLR fund and apply to giveth and apply to get coin and sync the my profiles across all the two uh all of them um there's this XKCD comic though where there's like 11 different markdown standards is the first panel of the comic and then the next panel is like someone should make a standard that's all the standards and then the result is like there's 12 different standards say like I worry that that's the world that we're going towards especially with the modular uh architecture of l2s and everything on ethereum but even if like the systems can talk to each other and you can transpose the between one standard or another I think that would be a step forward for the space so um that's another area where I think that um yeah our Visions are aligned yeah definitely transposing them and just not choosing a winner just being open to oh you can plug in all these different identities and then over time the ones that are just like more useful for different areas can just keep being popular so yeah I agree we won't get to like a a clean like you know there's one system for this one system for that and they just touch each other it's definitely going to be a messy road but it's going to get like better progressively yeah yeah it's all right it's that messiness and that chaotic sort of co-evolution and Gene transfer and competition between all these things is how progress happens like I view very much web3 in an evolutionary perspective and I think that there's gonna be an opportunity for um cross-pollination for these mechanisms like what I really want to see is not just like interoperability of Grants though is coordination mechanism uh interoperability like could I take dowel drop style arch pgf and put it on bitcoin Grant stack um or Bitcoin Grand style quadratic funding and take it to some other grants registry like the the interoperability of the mechanisms I think gets really interesting in a world in which all these ecosystems are coordinating like basically that just allows each uh like each Community each hole on whether it's it's like a Dao or a layer one or the city of Boulder to just choose whatever coordination mechanism it wants and like install it in their community and and that's the world that that I'm here for because like I don't believe that there's gonna be one and ultimate coordination mechanism for all of humanity there's going to be all these like different rings and like groups of humans that have different values and there's gonna be different coordination mechanisms that are that are best for each of them um or maybe like a top three where like most thousand in 2026 will have quadratic funding and rpgf and give backs and Assurance contracts like I I just I don't think that there's one coordination mechanism for all coordination um out there and and so that pluralism I think is like important as a base principle totally yeah and it supports you know anti-brittleness as well it's scary if you're just relying on one system if it goes down or it gets corrupt for sure yeah tell me about it um well I think that we've gone we've gone wide we've gone macro I want to collapse the uh down down to the micro which is which is Dow drops round one so um by the time I am listening to this in early March there's gonna be uh at Dow drop side IO I can go and I'm going to be able to vote in dial drops rpgf round one if I have been participating in a dow uh if I've been to event ecosystems and I have a poet for it if I've deployed smart contracts and that's that's the main thing that I want the audience to like I want them to participate in in that but is there anything else to say about round one and the actual mechanics of of the flow of the round and the dial drops experiment itself yeah so the like everything you just said completely the that's actually the full picture of this next round there's this next phase of the round um and one thing I just want to put out there is that people should really um you know look at the projects um the the web app kind of randomly generates the order um but I think it's important to basically um look at the different ideas out there and distribute points like according to what you think is um fair right and so the thing that we're trying to avoid with the design of this which um the curation step and the nomination step were really key parts of is turning it into a popularity contest and that's one of the hard things especially when you're um decentralizing to the crowd is how do you avoid um kind of people uh evaluating based on like selfish or like social grouping kind of metrics and so um yeah that's that's something that we would love to get feedback on once people go through the experience and and so I would definitely encourage people to to talk about their experience publicly positive or negative or any other way once they go through and click through it but yeah it's really like meant to be fast and people can make small decisions and the idea is that we aggregate all these small decisions so no one has to be an expert but everyone who has those points is obviously like somewhat knowledgeable in some corner of the ecosystem um and then um once you allocate all your points you just click um uh the button and it's going to generate a message to sign and so it's no gas because all of the scoring kind of just gets aggregated by the app and then the money gets dropped all at once and that way that was also like um a design um concept to increase participation as much as possible to not have the complexity of gas on L1 or some sort of you know choosing which L2 to go on and so in future rounds definitely the idea is to bring more on chain um you know abstract weight gas as much as possible but for this one we thought it'd be easiest for everyone if it's like okay just sign in uh take two minutes 10 minutes 20 minutes of your day uh to to be a small part of like making this decision yeah the only other piece I would mention is and this is for for the for the next round but it may occur to you as you're playing with the app um we're looking for more data providers um to again iterate on and improve the algorithm or you know the how we what on-chain data we pull and why um and then also sponsors for the next round so that there's a diversity of people contributing funds into the next one so data providers and uh sponsors or financial contributors are two things that we're looking for as we go into the developing the next round amazing um yeah I should um if you're interested I I I'm no longer at git coin I'm disaffiliated because it's like a dial and everything um but uh I could I could introduce you to the people who are working on data science uh within within git coin I think that you all might have some simpler problems to solve so that'd be amazing well uh we've got five minutes left is there anything I didn't ask that you all want to say oh I just want to hang out for a weekend and talk about Regional regeneration and oh yeah it's nerd out on all these things but also make them happen yeah um that's how I feel uh also um so like early on when I was still at Bitcoin we used to think about like interop with other projects as like social interop um and then you would do like technology interop which is like our systems integrate with each other um and then like economic interop which is you know some to the extent that any of us is generating Revenue uh like sharing that with each other and you start with social interop and so one of the things that's been really important for me uh over time and it's the reason why Bitcoin hosts shelling point and we had a conference in 2020 called sustain web3 and it is like convening the people and and and once you convene the the smart people who are well intentioned and have the resources and hopefully like a pluralism of like a diverse group of people um not just like the same old you know the same old representation that that I think that we've seen too often is that once you create that container for the social stuff like the economic and the technological interop and the momentum flows from there and that's why I started this podcast is is to try to like stimulate that movement and that that action so um the podcast is the green pill podcast is one way to do it uh shelling point at Denver uh is coming up and that's like our regen web3 conference there's funding the commons and um yeah I'd be it'd be great to see Dal drops integrated into all the the regen web3 refi ecosystem regen's unite is another one uh there's there's a bunch of great people who are working to stimulate this movement and I'll just end and by saying that I want to live in a world where we're rotating capital a talent in attention towards regen web three like away from the pump and dumps and the ponzis into region web3 um of which public goods funding is a big part of it so I think we'll keep up keep uh doing experiments and having the conversation and uh trying to meme that world into existence and and that's what I'm trying to do and um I'm glad to be at the dance with you all so uh so thank you for dial drops it's really exciting for me and I can't wait to see what you all learned from from round one um get any response to that rant or anything else you want to say before we wrap definitely second everything you said I think the community like that that we're building here is really important and keeping that pluralistic and diverse um because we don't want to make mistakes in um having tunnel vision around particular ideas um that come from a particular subset of the population and so that's what I think like the regen um branch of crypto has been really great for for kind of bringing the pluralistic nature because I think defy and nft land and like scared away a lot of the people who are excited about decentralized governance at first um they kind of like washed out a lot of those people um because it got so loud but now that's gotten quieter kind of thankfully to the bear market and so now the regen thing can um Can flourish and I've seen this in person also it you know regions unite and gonna go to the crypto Commons Hub soon and check out more of these um events in person funding the commons and in Paris at the summer yeah some of these I wouldn't I wasn't even um I work full time in the space I wasn't even aware of some of those so we should compile a list of all the different totally Circles of regions that you can join and and what I really want to do is like if we can route the newbies to the the next Market cycle if we can route the new entrance to the to the ecosystem to regen web3 and around all the ponzis and the pump and dumps and like straight into those communities man that's a puck in public good for the space in it in itself so yeah um it would legitimizes crypto but it also routes the capital attention to like where it really matters so um yeah maybe that's maybe that's something we could start collaborating on totally yeah how people first got come into contact with the space is so crucial sorry go ahead oh just the the only other thing I'd add listening to that is importance of foregrounding Grassroots participation in refi it's still very missing from the for example carbon Focus or the technology first Focus um and then also a feminine leadership I still find even refi is very broy like culture wise and I don't know how to articulate it exactly but there's a a a missing of the the feminine like ways of organizing and like creating a technological business container that is very there's a lot of possibility there that I think is not as like loud as it could be across the space so that Grassroots and women voices in refi specifically I think more of that will be like nutritive in a very good way yeah I mean I think that a criticism of the space that's totally valid is that it's got a lot of overlap with people who are privileged enough to have computer science degrees and the and like if it looks more like the global South and um uh like the actual communities that it serves then then I think that there's like a symmetry there they that gets really nice uh and and doing it across a bunch of vectors not just like gender and and like race and geography but um you know many different types of collective of intelligence is that pluralism I think is an important Vector of pluralism as well yeah well um this I really enjoyed this episode um I'm so thrilled about dial drops and um as someone who's been working on public goods for a few years welcome to the party uh really excited to have you and can't wait to see how dow drops evolves over the next next several years so Ori magenta thank you so much for joining me on the green pill pod for sure [Music]
