what is your most legitimate steel manned argument for why maximalism is good the best zoomed out description of all this is not even uh from myself it's from suede star codex i think it's called a thrive survive theory of the political spectrum it does a great job of kind of describing these two possible worlds where one is like a utopia and the other is a zombie apocalypse and how like very bright leaning values make sense in a zombie apocalypse but are just totally stupid in the utopia and a lot of loft-leaning values make total sense in the utopia but are suicidal in the zombie apocalypse are you acting like the world in which you're operating is fundamentally fluffy and safe or are you acting and thinking like the world that you live in is uh fundamentally a place where if you uh turn your attention away for even five seconds the tiger is going to run out of the left side side of the visual field and it'll have its uh teeth already around your neck by the time you can react and you know the maximalists take one side of that grand civilizational question
