let's start where we always do give us the the macro update what's happening with nft prices how are you feeling about everything i feel good so i mean i don't like to say we've bought and bottomed like no one actually knows but we've obviously been in a bear market for ages and things were crashing and crashing and we saw just low volumes across the board volume is still very much on the low end of the spectrum but the last couple of days i think things have been picking up turning around maybe two three days so we're recording this uh it needs to come out tomorrow on the 26th anyway but um yeah so you know bought apes got into the 60s 65-ish at one point they're up to 75 again uh mutants were down at almost 10 they're at 14 and almost 15 again uh a lot of things that had you know oddities were down at 0.7 and they're close to two now so a lot of the quote unquote blue chips and obviously yeah blue chips can still fluctuate 50 80 90 but they are recovering yeah and we're starting to see a bunch of older projects also come back obviously pudgy penguins as you mentioned but on one force i think is is making a thing happen and there's a lot of projects from 2021 that you know they haven't rocketed back up to like massive floor prices but they had been slowly bleeding for a while and maybe they've found some resistance and a flaw where eventually you run out of sellers and as long as there's enough people in a project that have conviction in it and the team is around doing stuff you got to hope that people eventually come back in and the prices will go up and we're sort of in that stage i also say though with the merge coming up in a few weeks there's a lot of i'm a little surprised that you know i thought of i thought we'd probably just continue to bleed leading into the merge and maybe we'll turn around again and that'll happen just there's a lot of uncertainty around that entire event obviously and there's just a lot of lack of aware like awareness or information like people like what's gonna happen and um proof of stake proof of work the two different chains or nfts exist on both where the ip rights go you know do we have to do anything is there any action involved from any of us and there's all these questions that you know many people don't know the answers to many people don't even know to be asking these questions and then there's a whole you know is it going to be a success what's going to happen the price of eth is how if eath rockets up is that going to impact nfts is is it going to be a sell the buy the new sale the event type thing is so many questions and uncertainty so i i i really think we'll probably just be in this holding pattern still like maybe we go up a little bit more and it's nice but everyone is sort of like waiting for the merge and then after that it'll be like all right now let's now let's see and it could be a catalyst for a bull market it could it could not be it's it's but it's going to be interesting i'm so confident in the merges success yeah that i feel like i'm projecting my confidence on to others and assuming that that the price will fall a little bit right after the merge because uh like like i i if people were really uncertain if the merge was going to succeed and then it went through and it succeeded i feel like you would see a price pump but i think it's kind of priced in that it's going to succeed and so i imagine we'll see like a little dip immediately after but i think i could totally be wrong on that and i should say that like shortly after that dip i would expect i i'm fairly expecting a price bump i mean macro will affect it all but like i don't i don't even remember if i've really talked about it on this podcast i i talked about it extensively on uh middle x podcast i'm doing now that one that'll be coming out next week but like the supply demand economics that are coming because of the merge are so damn favorable and i really don't have a beat on how much people understand that or not and so like how priced in or not that is um but it's it's remarkable and clearly the broader world probably doesn't fully understand it so again in the long term i would expect that it it does really amazing things for the price of eath but to your point it's so hard to know what's going to happen in that short term there yeah no i fully agree with all of that i think for the most part almost everyone i talk to and believe like they say okay it's going to be a success it's so many test runs there's so many it's checks in like seven years amazing like very smart that's not a success oh boy i don't i don't want to jinx anything but easily yeah in my opinion but like you said it's going to be the supply and demand dynamics and the deflationary aspect of just like the cell pressure that is going to be alleviated after the merge is just i'm not sure that's priced in i'm not sure enough people are aware of that as well as the fact that longer term like the environmental impact is something that is not spoken about so much but like okay i'm i mean i keep saying i'm gonna do this but i like actually need to i have all these ideas around like memes i want to put out like funny videos because to me we are so under talking about what a big freaking deal this is actually you posted a tweet i think that was like what's the next meta or like what's the next topic of conversation gonna be because we had that like cc0 period and then we had the artist royalty thing which we might talk about because you and i haven't actually talked about it yet um but and i was like the next thing should just be all of us just bombarding people with information about the environmental impacts having gone away because this is so big all we've heard from the mainstream for i feel like a year plus whatever has been the environmental concerns around crypto and nfts and like that's effectively going away and and the water is going to be warm now for brands who maybe were dipping their toe in but we're a little nervous about the environmental pushback et cetera like all it's going to be warm but only once the paradigm has shifted in the minds of everybody like only ones everybody knows so we have to do the work of like explaining to people that like it's not a it's not a concern anymore or to the extent that it's a concern because it's not like there's no energy usage it's a concern to the same extent that like microsoft needs to be concerned about it or google needs to be concerned about it we're no longer some sort of outlier industry yeah speaking of course specifically about ethereum so i i totally agree let's let's maybe break down just real fast here and i don't have to harp on it too much if folks already have opinions about the merge but like i think two big pieces when we talk about the supply and demand economic thing so you have first of all the amount of eth issuance is going way down right now i don't know exactly what the numbers are but miners get x number of of eth as a reward for mining yeah a day and that's going to be like cut tremendously um because the rewards to stakers are not going to be as high as the rewards to minors so already now issuance is going down and you have the burn mechanism with with fees so you know when volume gets high enough this is where eth becomes deflationary because you actually are going to be burning more eath than you're even issuing because issuance is getting cut and then on top of that you have you do have more rewards going to stakers than are currently going to stakers i think that's like tripling because now all the rewards that we're going to minors will now go to stakers which should mean that more people will stake eth than currently do and all of that staked eth at least for the foreseeable future call six next six to 12 months after the merge goes through is locked in a stake in contract so you're literally taking that supply like out of out of the flow of ethereum so you're locking up a of money you're reducing the supply you're reducing the issuance and inherently you're now rewarding people who are long eath in a way that miners weren't necessarily miners were you know sold a lot of the ether they got as a reward for mining in part because they had to recoup the cost that they spent on energy and also in part because they're not a minor isn't necessarily like bullish on eath the way a staker is like oh my gosh that's such a crazy confluence of factors that are super bullish freeze yeah and that that whole shaking piece is super important and something that i also think isn't spoken about enough and it's it's probably not even understood that well because staking for the last 12 to 18 months in the nft space has become this thing that's totally separate from what eat staking is meant to be and is going to be and a lot of people like for the most part projects are like well if you stake your nft you'll get some erc20 token and you know it's like a reward for making some gas transaction being like hey i want to take it off the market and not sell it's very pointless and very ponzionomics and there's no value to it kobe had a really great article or a part of his article about this i think he's talking about apecoin and how apes are going to be able to stake their apes for apecoin and he's like well the whole concept of staking is to lock up eth or a currency to secure a blockchain there is utility and then all these other projects being like um uh co-opting the word and being like well we're just going to start staking and lock up your ape or lock up your whatever token and you'll be rewarded but the the locked up piece is not securing anything it's just like this social contract where people are like hey we'll just lock it up and get rewarded it just doesn't make any sense when you break it down but eat staking makes total sense and you're totally right it's going to take so much supply off the market yeah when you're an eat staker exactly you're securing the network so you're getting rewarded for the job of securing the network we've in the nft community have abstracted away the like work part which is the curing part and just kept the reward part so i had um blake finnegan fanucan i'm sorry blake you know i struggled with your last name but i love you she was on the pod last week doing the the recap with me she's fantastic if you haven't gone and listened to that episode she's like so knowledgeable about things and just amazing um and she was talking about this concept of like staking as storytelling and and being like we can infuse sticking with meaning and highlighted 10ktf and i think jenkins the ballet as projects that do this where they have you come and i think 10ktf in particular will have you come and stake your thing for like 20 24-hour period where you can get a particular where you'll get a reward you'll get something but it's really a mechanism to bring your attention back to the project because okay i want the reward but you come back to the project and and the narrative is being furthered in that moment for some for some reason and i was like that's really cool like that's applying a reason for staking other than just we don't want you telling you so that our floor price goes up yeah do we just want to take supply away from the market now that's a really good point and i think jenkins and tanketf are really excellent examples of doing things like that uh i guess on the flip side as someone who's like i hold tokens in both those ecosystems and many others it it does become overwhelming to sort of stay on top of all these intricate things whereas like you get a stake and attend missions and stuff but that doesn't mean they're bad it just means that maybe the project is not for someone like me and it's for someone who wants to be more involved and invested and can take part in that and maybe people i think it's a good thing overall yeah i i agree i think it's it's a way to really identify who are your most engaged community members and fundamentally this space is supposed to be about rewarding that community and rewarding those who are really engaged and again to me it's like the opposite of why i have issues with um land sales right which is like you're now rewarding people who had kind of money as opposed to rewarding the people who are engaged and so anyhow um around a thorough project into the ring that i think did does this exceptionally well is forgotten ruins wizards club where forgotten ruins wizards guild club club guild god i'm i'm losing my mind forgotten runes uh they since the very early days have rewarded their active participants of the community and i think they did something where they said any community member can go and add law to their nft and like on chain you know you type a backstory in upload it and and they didn't say that you'd be rewarded for this but then retroactively they went back and said okay so anyone who did that by a certain time who took a snapshot they can they got air dropped or were able to mint this nft and that was rarer and had utility and like you know people got tremendous value out of that and they've done many other examples in instances of rewarding the people that take part in their lore and world building and storytelling and active members and i think it's a it's a really great approach i think i have an email in my inbox from the forgotten roon team or somebody being like do you want forgotten runes on and you know i get a lot of inbound and so a lot of things called through my cracks forgotten runes wizard's cult sorry i just okay it's not club it's not guild it's a cult it's a cult okay uh well this makes me want to go see if i'm right and if i do have that email in there and if you're listening and you're part of the forgotten ruins team i'm sorry i again i there's a lot that i miss but uh maybe i'll try and i'll reach i went back uh i have this dm from the cool cats team that they sent me like in june last year and it was like hey just to let you know we're launching this project you're interested and we actually had a little bit of back and forth but i was like um i think there's too many projects launching now i'm not like there's like three cat projects there's gutter cats and you know i wish you the best and yeah i found that like eight months later and i was just like huh probably should have taken more attention yeah it's satisfying to me i i have the reverse of that which is like i can go back and find myself when i first launched this podcast reaching out to like andrew wang and like danny cole and these different people asking to come on and totally understandably like not getting a response and now i look back and you know i've had all of that so um okay let's talk well i don't know we were we referenced it so let's talk about pudgy penguins the the don't call it a comeback i've been here before or whatever the lyric is i mean pudgy penguins is back man um have you followed sort of why this has happened i think i have a general sense of it but i don't know if you've been tied to anything there yeah not super closely tied i definitely followed along i i minted pudgy penguins way back in the day the eggs and then they hatched and like i sold i had like 20 of them i sold most at like 0.01 or 0.02 or something like i think a lot of people and then they had that first like rocket in price where they went up to like two or three or four eighth in the summer of last year based on the back of i think like there was a new yorker article in new york times article times and a bunch of like twitter influencers and and people i think specifically a lot of people that were not traditionally in the nft space like maybe like crypto twitter and and that side of the space got behind the pudgy penguins they're cute they're very memeable so they rocketed off and um i had a few and sort of followed along and then uh there was a lot of drama revolving the leadership with cole being involved and and how they basically just siphoned money away from the community they did another the little penguins drop and it just got split up between the founders and didn't go back to the community and all sorts of bad stuff and uh the community was like revolting and uh there was i think one community member in particular uh nine by nine by nine yeah who owns like a ton of them like 100 200 i think um and he was in talks with the leadership team trying to sort of take over the project and buy it from them saying hey you know i i have a vision and a direction i'm you know willing to offer what do you have in your treasury and stuff like that and they're like well we don't have anything in our treasury we've taken it all and then he went public and sort of shared those dms and that blew up the project and i think caused the price to crash a bunch and then um eventually it led to the project did get sold to luca schnelser speaking i'm sorry we're sorry uh luca s and uh apparently that uh well he picked it up for two uh 750 eth or two and a half million at the time in april yeah and it's sort of just been this comeback story ever since then where the like the community they always had i think a really strong passion of community i think there was even an instance where vincent van doe perhaps who is like a big collector in the space and a fan of cc zero rights and and stuff like that uh created a contract where people could wrap their pudgy penguins and trade them on a marketplace or in a way that did not give royalties back to the original founding team i can't remember if that actually happened it was just an idea but it was certainly something that was floated around anyway eventually it got sold and uh since then it's just been they've made really good decisions and uh just everyone loves a comeback story so in this bear market they have just flown to new heights and there's a 400 eth sail uh just a few days ago for a left-facing um budgie penguin which uh i think is awesome and uh yeah just that's that's them they flip cool cats and they flip world of women and they're like three to four eight now yeah i think when this all was first going down it to me felt like such a cautionary tale to young people of prioritizing or against prioritizing short-term games like out games like i was looking at coltherium who i think is like 20. like this kid is so young and clearly has made himself a millionaire off of this thing and i'm just thinking anybody he was you know he had a lot of influence he was featured in the new york times like i'm thinking man like think beyond the next five years of your life when you you know like like think for your long career you could really establish yourself as a thought leader and you know and do all sorts of cool amazing things and instead you've burned an entire community so that you could make a few million dollars as a 20 year old and it just was one of these things where i was like this is a case study in my opinion of what not to do for career longevity now i don't know i i think he's talk so i think we know who he is in real life but i don't know if this will like follow him other places but that that was always sort of my almost take away from from the whole penguin story was like that and to all young people like don't don't be like that um but it is really interesting now to see this come back and and to see them really leaning in i think to like their ip which has always been their strength is they have these cute characters and i've also seen fudgy penguins of the last x number of months as sort of a an optimistic tale potentially for cool cats who did not flame out in a dramatic fashion like like pudgy penguins but yeah obviously had this sort of just like slow anticlimactic decline um and i think part of that is is because they really got away from what people originally loved with them which is just this beaut like this ip and the art and the characters uh which is exactly what what pudgy penguin's strength is so we'll be interesting to see if cool cats sort of lean starts leaning back into their their ip as pudgy penguin sort of has and and um but credit to this new team and and you know congratulations to them certainly for for pulling this off and i agree now that you have new ownership in there i'm like rooting for the comeback yeah i'm tempted to pick one up uh it's it's dipped a bit and uh i've seen some like images of the i think like merch they're getting like soft toys created and like you said like they're really leaning into that ip side of things where they're cute cute images and uh yeah um okay speaking of comebacks i i don't want to harp on this for too long but moviepass is back do you know what moviepass is i have no idea i saw this on the list of the document and i'm guessing it's an american uh membership thing to view movies at the cinemas or something like that yeah that's exactly right so moviepass became this like phenomenon i don't know five years ago or so it had started in like 2011 but it got really big like five years ago and i'll give a little bit of history as to why but essentially the it got big because you could pay 9.99 a month and go to one movie in a movie theater every day wow movie it cost like 17 for a ticket to a movie in in america probably more at this point i don't know because i don't really go to movies theaters that often anymore like most people like we just don't go and so um so for 9.99 a month to get to go to like however many it was crazy um and like i said this this is a company that had started i think back in like 2011 and initially it was like 50 bucks a month um which was obviously economically made a little bit more sense but it wasn't popular because i think people just didn't want to spend 50 a month because they didn't necessarily know if they were going to end up using it or go to the movies that often whatever but ten dollars was that price point which it was like okay this is a no-brainer so it was founded the company was founded by this guy stacy spikes and then uh a private equity firm came in and bought up whatever some big chunk of the company and that's when they made this move to drop it down to like ten dollars a month or whatever to get all of this energy around it but of course that math in the end did math and so the company folded stacy spikes has now come back and repurchased the company essentially that has just like languished for for years and uh sent out this very sassy email that i kind of loved i first realized this because i got an email because i was on the movie pass you know subscriber list i guess so i get this email from moviepass like out of the blue being like we're coming back and it's stacy spike's being like like a brief history you know it got bought by the private equity firm who ruined it and like ran it into the ground and so i brought it back like you know clearly he's a little bitter about about how things played out and there's this long time article really detailing the history i'll link to it in the show notes and um it's a fascinating story i just i'm always curious about about the inner machinations of of successful or even maybe more so like unsuccessful businesses like wework or theranos like i love kind of tracking those sagas and and moviepass in its own very different way is is sort of one of those stories but you know so so what we're hearing so it's going to be relaunched this summer or you know very soon it sounds like oh this morning actually i think you could get on the i missed it dang you could get on the um the wait list to basically get like the first movie pass and and if you get on the wait list um you can invite like 10 people to join and that's the only way to get on the list so they're doing this like scarcity model of like very limited number of users for it um and they've implied it's going to cost more than 10 now uh moving forward but there's much more appetite for it it seems from like movie theaters potentially because of what kova did to everything this model suddenly makes more sense to movie theaters who are really struggling um though though other theaters have sort of said we don't want anything to do with this so a little bit unclear on all that front however what i want to call everyone's attention to is it seems there may be like a blockchain piece of this as they try to figure out how to monetize the model seems to be okay we might lose money on the like we'll have people pay the subscription but we'll still probably lose money buying tickets from movie theaters and giving them to people who pay the subscription but if we have enough users and we have their attention through our app can we monetize in other ways for example um have it basically pay pay to engage like paying you to watch ads through the app right paying you to uh watch movie trailers for the app i don't know things along those lines and um so i'll read a little a little uh sentence here to that end spikes will try to build a subscriber base quickly with several changes from its original incarnation including tiered pricing options and in-app credits that customers can earn by watching ads they will be able to apply these credits towards tickets for friends and family members who don't subscribe to moviepass and eventually spike says users will be able to trade credits among themselves via blockchain technology so as i was reading this whole time article and sort of his new vision all along i was like it feels like there's like an nft blockchain thing here going on and then you know many many paragraphs down in the story they finally got to that so putting on people's radars because i think this is an interesting story stacey spikes seems like an interesting guy and um the uh there may be a blockchain tie-in that's super cool that's that's the other comeback i'm more excited about this is my twitter poll are you more excited about the pudgy penguins or the moviepass come back i think in some ways moviepass because i would i would like to take part in this new incarnation of it though i uh i missed the window this morning so we'll have to see if there's any weightless spots left no i'm i think i think it's right to be more excited about i'm more excited about it too because to me it's doing what we all hope to do and that's like bridge web 3 in the real world and and find a way to bring utility into real people's lives and add value and reward people for just being part of a ecosystem and you know if if they can do it and it sounds like they they have a massive network and you know are a big they're a household name in america at least it seems like or at least a lot of people know know what they are um they they have that capacity to potentially bridge that gap which is very exciting yeah yep i totally agree so we'll see fingers crossed um okay token proof announced they'll be that proof is going to be their first partner for their like online token gating we all know token proof as the token gate like irl token gate company if you went to eight fest you use token gate token proof technology token proof is a no-brainer of a company to me solving a a clear problem which is we all connect our walls to all these things and then we get scammed this is like a one-stop shop you connect your wallet to tokenproof they then have access to like look into your wallet and confirm for you know third parties yes carly has an ape token in there at this moment so yes she's entitled to xyz and they're basically looking to bring that model to uh digital communities so like you could you can get a role in discord via token proof without having to like additionally connect your wallet somewhere no-brainer i think yeah they're doing the just tremendous things in this space they did in real life and now they're going online uh it's a problem that has needed solving for a long time now and i'm surprised it hasn't been solved yet or it hasn't maybe it has but it just didn't gain mainstream attention or adoption but token proof is a household name in the space now they've they partnered they did a fest like they've partnered with at nfc nyc they're like every event was token proof gated basically if it was a token gated event and so everyone knows where they are and yeah it should hopefully solve the issue of people you know signing it like going to a website to collect like if you claim with a wall that has your ape in it or your proof pass or whatever um then you run the risk of you know signing a malicious transaction going to the wrong website clicking the wrong link but if you no longer have to sign a transaction in metamask then and it's just like i think they're using qr codes and some interesting hybrid of technology then it should stop a lot of people losing assets so it's it's awesome i i interviewed fonz who's the founder of tokenproof and it was like one of the harder interviews because i was just like yes no yeah glad you're doing that yeah yeah good i think you interviewed him too and i did as well i was just nodding along going yeah yeah exactly i'm like i don't it's like i'm like i'm actually finding it hard to like really i don't even know what to ask because you just explain it i'm like yeah that makes a ton of sense we clearly need that yeah just keep your interview over you know like yeah just say whatever you want um so and then speaking of proof we had the proof grails to drop uh give us the the spiel on this yeah yeah uh so grails to set the gift perspective is something that proof did for the first time i think at the start of this year january february maybe so it's like shortly after they launched it was their first sort of thing that they did and the concept is that they got together 20 artists very high profile artists in the space for the most part actually a handful of them were like just big names in in various industries who had never actually released nfts before got them to create a piece of art and then uh showed each piece to the community and and everyone who had a proof pass could mint one piece per pass and you didn't know who the artists were in advance you didn't even know like so you didn't know which artist created which piece but didn't even know which artists were involved with the project and it was very hush-hush and all you could do is like base it on the actual art and it was really like i wasn't around for grails one but grails two is happening now but it's just wonderful thing to see where people are like looking at the art seeing what they like and buying based on that plus there's this really interesting detective sleuthing event that happens where people are like really analyzing breaking things apart like getting disseminating the layers they'll troll through like years of history of like deleted tweets from accounts me like did someone tweet an image that looks like this one is this their work and uh at the end after everyone has chosen which one they want there's a reveal process and and then there's you know obviously additional secondary market activity after people find out who is behind each piece and so to give some perspective in in the first grails there was uh tyler hobbs dimitri cherniak garyvee tim ferriss it's it's like just the hackathon there's so many big names and grails two is now um you know and you know there was uh lava labs that did a piece as well it was like a a prototype for the autoglyph project which is the first on-chain generator it's like some of them sold like 85 eth and you know proof members could admit these for .05 eth yeah i think this is proof getting back to what proof does best in many ways which is appreciation for art the emphasis being on art and really a community in many ways around a community around community but but also around art and kevin leveraging his badass connection yeah it's crazy you know which you know they can pull this off in a way that you know many other people couldn't just because of kevin's reputation and his you know years of building and partnering with people so i think it's awesome and uh i'm excited to see the the kind of reveals as they come out yeah it's it's super exciting so grails 2 is there's this time there's 25 artists and they actually rewarded they did it a little differently where you they airdropped a mint pass to everyone and then you could use that min pass to sell or to claim a piece and so one went to everyone who had a proof pass but also anyone who had a moon bird with a grails trait got one airdropped as well and you know they were trading for between three to fourth for the most part and so that was like the price to mint one of these is about a thousand eleven hundred in total and it's just so much fun the reveal is actually today so everyone has minted um their passes uh some got minted like 130 140 times some only got minted 17 times um and we're going to get to find out who is who someone like known already like one is very obviously grant yeon um one it seems very likely to be um rafiq and adol um i think uh uh drifter shoots is in there and you know but then there's also like it could be anyone because you had tim ferriss in there you had gary you had people who had maybe not traditionally known for releasing art and the other really cool thing is that a lot of the artists will get involved and like intentionally try and hide their piece and not make it obvious so the greatest example of this is in the first collection dimitri cherniak you know fantastic generative artist he did ringers known for being a journalist he submitted a photograph and so no one knew it was him it was just like he's still an artist so you can you can really play with it and i think the artists love that does it not that it should be just about the money of course but like once it's revealed that it's dimitri but it's a photograph where does the price point fall in the scheme of his works because his his art blocks pieces go for i feel like a lot of his ringers is like 50 um yeah i look it up i think i think it's still very highly valued um i think it was like 20 or 38 for his photographs but when you hear this it does make it so absurd to think of like the backlash that proof got over like fanny packs where you're like do you know how if you were in either proof collective or even you got into moon birds like you well i guess it's only if you have the moon bird um with the grill but it's like this is just an idea i'm like there's so much value being created yeah you know in this project like oh my goodness yeah let's give them a break one more thing i'll say is like you mentioned how they're getting back to their roots about being about art and collectors and i think they're really they're leading more and more into that which i think makes a ton of sense and totally i can't remember if it was kevin or justin who said but uh there's a plan to sort of take the grails collection and turn it into this a physical collection that travels around like galleries and museums and is presented in like again because they have connections and the ability to make it happen and like maybe you get a book that's like a grails it's just like they're trying to bridge the real world and the collectors in traditional art with nfts and uh the collectors in this world and i think that they're really they're nailing it on that front like grails is it's it's spoken about in like the last week almost any discord i'm in there's been some discussion about it and uh it's cool to see there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven

on chain like nft universe course university um are you a speaker uh i'm not a speaker but there's some incredible speakers lined up like just insane incredible speakers lined up you know i'm excited about what 6529 is doing i haven't fully tracked all of it i got one of his nfts you know he did these like the free one well but i think i bought i think i paid for them so maybe it was after they were free and i bought it on openc maybe or maybe you just paid for something that was free or wait oh don't wait wait well maybe i paid gas i definitely paid something maybe gas yeah though like i definitely didn't pay a lot but it's like the um what what what's the gosh it's all it it like plays on like soviet tropes i feel like right background looking one um yeah it looks kind of soviet what what well see this is i'm clearly not prepared enough for this podcast episode um oh and now it's madam ask wants me to sign in i was gonna look on open c like see it's not like sees the memes of production though maybe it is does it say that it says like seize the means productivity 2022 block bloc 711 is that oh you're talking about his uh that's a different collection uh so he has another collection called the memes or sees the memes where he's been releasing yeah those ones are definitely paid and and different okay there's one which is like i feel better yeah yeah those are a different thing and uh i i don't know how what the interplay or the relationship is but over the last couple of months i think he's been releasing these memes he since day one he's been all about memes the power of memes um one of his greatest threads was on memes i'm pretty sure and memes in like an open metaverse are the two things i think and writing fantastic threads is what uh and collecting great he's just i what a wonderful account totally yeah but yeah memes is is something that's so powerful and so there is that collection but this is there's a separate collection which is basically access to this online university course thing it's free for anyone you go to the website freeman and uh unlimited it's open edition and i think it's open for like a month or something like that okay well i'll have to check that out this is what i was saying i haven't like followed his every move per se but obviously like love the open metaverse you know die diatribes he goes on and and like being a part of anything he's doing so i i think i grabbed like two of his sees the memes you know part there was like three pieces that he sold there and i bought two of them um there was some backlash betty obviously rightfully pointed out that when they went out with the initial announcement about this course this on chain like nft metaverse crypto course it was like 30 dudes and i think claire silver was like the only woman listed as being a part of it or there's like one woman for 30 dudes and betty was like come on man do better and and you 6529 was like oh we haven't finished announcing everybody you know that was an obvious gap or whatever and it's like it's a tough one i'm like maybe should you just wait and not announce if it's that you know if the ratios are that kind of distorted and um anyhow i i know he's they're going to rectify it and make sure that there's diversity on that on that you know kind of end panel but it was a little bit of a odd look it was just so out of whack like you know we're used to it in this space but 30 out of 30 to one was uh was not a good it's not the best luck um okay the irs there's this new bill that was passed i guess it's the inflation reduction act i think it's in that um and the irs is adding 87 000 new irs agents where they're going to try to add 87 so crazy i mean so many you know like i mean maybe it's it's a good thing but and um and the biden administration was saying hey we're not trying to go after like middle class we're not trying to use these agents because these agents are going to audit people like we don't want to go after like middle class people we're trying to go after you know whatever big big whales so to speak to deport a term from nft world um and so republicans tried to insert into this bill a um like that part of it was that they couldn't be used to go after people or businesses that are making under 400 000 a year democrats rejected that that addition so that's kind of freaking people out that they're going to start targeting kind of mid to small size businesses you know if you're making less than 400 thousand dollars a year as a business that's not so big relative to all these other players um and you know i listen to the all-in podcast and those guys who are all very very rich are like it's hard to imagine like chamoth who's a billionaire was like i literally use a top five whatever accounting firm that like fortune 500 companies use for my own tax returns because effectively when you're this rich like it's very complicated and i get audited every year just as a matter of principle like nobody who's you know worth this much money is not currently getting audited so these 87 000 new agents are going to be going after like the only people left to go after are kind of smaller fish i don't know if that's entirely true whatever but where i'm going with all of this is like it seems very very likely that they're going to want to target crypto people in particular because there's no tremendous love for for crypto folks you know on capitol hill and um there's a lot of there's a feeling that there's a lot of like tax evasion happening and so if you are in the crypto business i would say uh make sure your taxes are real tight this year because it does seem entirely likely that there's there's a lot of audits being run on on crypto companies this i i just just reminded me i i literally had a dream last night maybe it was a nightmare where i was getting ready for just going through some annoying tax thing or i had forgotten something or it was it was not fun so yeah and yeah it makes me nervous because it is so it's just such uncharted territory you know i did my very best last year to be as sort of scrupulous about all of it as i possibly could be but is it possible that like i messed something up like for sure like you know it's it's crazy you know like this whole thing like what's the cost basis of the east i used to buy this nft because it might be at the time my cost basis was probably different than my cost basis ended up like it's it's impossible to fully navigate and so um so anyway just uh flagging that and on a similar note i think around just like governments and i haven't talked yet about the tornado cache situation here on this podcast i think bankless has done a lot on it and so they really have it covered from like if you want an overview if you want updates on what's happening in that situation um but it's funny because bankless did a piece and they mentioned that they were making i think a very strong point which is banks get used for money laundering all the time banks are used for nefarious purposes all the time we don't shut down the banks or frankly even arrest bankers historically speaking even when money laundering is found to be running through a bank and yet we're arresting this developer seemingly simply because he wrote code that was used for nefarious purposes and what a double standard that is but it's interesting because um one of the the historical like bank frauds that they that that bankless called out was with uh danska bank dan it's a it's a bank in denmark um and 230 billion dollars was laundered through danska bank of like dirty primarily russian money and i was like why do i know the name danska bank and i don't think anybody was arrested or maybe i don't think anybody was arrested in that case there were a couple of these bank money laundering cases where somebody was arrested but not sure that it was with dancing bank and i was listening this morning to an interview with um bill browder do you know who bill browder is he he wrote a book called red notice he was at one point the largest foreign investor in russia he started investing in russia shortly after they began privatizing in like 1994 after the soviet union fell and he became the largest foreign investor in russia and was ultimately driven out by putin and um and basically has become a massive human rights advocate because he had his lawyer ended up being killed in russian prisons essentially for working with him um and and he started going after the assets of russians and it was really like at his it was his work that got like danska bank caught quote unquote for laundering watching money because he started going basically going after the money of russian oligarchs that was being laundered through the west because they all you know so much of it was stolen um and so all of this just got me thinking about you know with sort of my my world's colliding i'm a big fan of bill browder and his book read notice whichever one should go read and um i'm like you know yes crypto can be used for these nefarious purposes but clearly so can banks and the big difference is that crypto can also help like regular people get their money out which we talk about you know like you can if you're in ukraine you can cross a border with your ledger wallet and actually you know in a way that you can't you can't get your money out from the banks in in ukraine or whatever the case is and that's not true of like the banking system like the banking system works for super super ultra rich people who are doing nefarious things it doesn't work for regular citizens who don't have the means and the lawyers and the xyz in order to try and get their money out even if what they're doing is good and so as we talk about like oh crypto's use for this cryptos used for that it's like crypto can be used by anyone the banking system basically works primarily for the super wealthy and um anyhow wanted to make that point here as all these things are going down uh one thing i'll say on that is obviously it's terrible what's happening and it seems that it's very much overreaching uh a lot of people ask or say well tornado cash is only used for money laundering what's a legitimate use case for the tornado cache if you had nothing to hide why would you use it and vitalik came out actually uh my other podcast co-host jamie told me this i didn't actually see it myself but he said vitali came out and said well i'm a russian citizen and i donated to the ukraine army uh i didn't want to do that through my public account so i might have wanted to i don't know if he did explicitly use tornado cash or not but he's like that is a very valid reason that someone might want to send money anonymously and uh there's a lot of yeah there's 100 that was exactly my thought this morning as i was having all these little pieces come together this bill browder piece and the donska bank you know money laundering is like innocent people being wrongfully accused of things or being seen as like on the wrong side of an authoritarian government is a is a huge reason somebody might want to use tornado cash now bankless has said that you know analysis has been done and about 35 percent of tornado caches you know uses were illegitimate or you know or for illegal or nefarious means i have no idea how you do that kind of analysis yeah and i'm a little bit skeptical to trust any of it but um but it does go to show and david hoffman has said he's used tornado cash before i don't i don't know if he's explicitly outlined the reasons behind it but like clearly they were not to illegally launder money or or like you know you know because he didn't hack some bridge and then he's trying to steal the money and get out so um anyway we'll keep covering it as it progresses uh okay uh maybe final topic here i talked about this a little bit last week with blake but you and i haven't gotten a chance to speak about it the the zero royalty situation that really was ignited because pseudoswap dropped their royalties to to zero for for artists um and creators i know you've talked about this a bunch i saw you interacting with 6529 i think a little bit about it give us your your take here i wrote a uh so i don't know last week or the week before time is weird in this space but on on a saturday uh i like to take weekends off and i was like especially looking forward to this weekend off because it's been a long week and i was like i want to unwind and this whole thing started blowing up and people started talking about creative royalties i think giancarlo who has a fantastic youtube channel made a video on pseudoswap and i watched that and then i tweeted something about it and it just like it just continued to blow up and then i spent the entire saturday just like knee deep in twitter threads and chatting to people and then i was awake to about 8 am writing i made this newsletter article and it's a good job me taking time off but i was very into it for a few days and it's still very much on my mind um it's a really fascinating area because well the crux of it comes down to and this is something that's almost like a dirty little secret in the space that most people don't even know is that royalties are not enforceable on chain on the smart contract level they are just not and so everyone thinks well the beauty of smart contracts is artists and creators can get royalties perpetually and no it's like there are mechanisms where that can work but it's reliant on and uh people said it best is the only way to enforce royalties is to have people want to pay royalties and the way it works now is that marketplaces enforce them so if you buy something on openc the creator of the collection goes into the open c sets their profile up and says what the royalty is openc during the sale transaction takes that percentage out and then manually sends it out to each creator or maybe they've automated some of the process but it's very much they have to agree and decide to take part in their process um and every other marketplace has sort of adopted and actually i think um i read this an open letter from a bunch of artists uh sent to super air i think in 2020 or maybe a little earlier basically petitioning for a 10 artist royalty to be the industry standard and uh it became the industry standard for artists uh at least to have a temperature of royalty and now we're seeing with the introduction of suit and they've always been people who will get around royalties like people do over-the-counter trades you'll use um uh you know if someone says i'll agree to send you five eth and you send me a pudgy penguin or whatever um you bypass royalties you buy and sell the thing without anyone paying any royalties uh it would happen on art blocks a lot except it was usually done to bypass the open c fee so if if two people came together and it's like i'm gonna i would like to buy this piece of art um from you they green up on a price and then they trade it um for the most part art blocks collectors and i think high-end and one-on-one art collectors they want to honor the royalties so they'll say well we'll do our deal and then we will chat with the artist and send them the percentage that they're due because of the you know the royalties that they had stipulated from the beginning but you know eliminating the openc from that equation and recently i think like two months ago pseudoswap which had previously been used as a website for just doing these otc trades where people could go and trustlessly transfer one nfp for some eth or one entity for another nft or a bundle of nfts for you know you could kind of do whatever you want and there were no royalties involved with that they came up with like their own marketplace where now people can basically it's a little more complicated they have like liquidity pools and stuff going on but effectively you can buy and sell individual nfts and there's no there's zero creative royalties there's no way for a creator to add them or implement them they just do not honor them the only fee is a 0.5 percent marketplace fee that pseudoswap takes and then um technically uh as people create these liquidity pools like the creator can set their own separate fee and so an artist could create their own liquidity pool gets complicated but then someone else could come in and undercut them and it just seems like this race to zero for royalties on their front and so that that's sort of like what instigated this entire conversation and opened this can of worms up and it's just such a fascinating topic and i think that again people said it best in order to enforce royalties people have to want to pay royalties and i think for the most part buyers and collectors of art and supporters of artists will want to continue paying royalties and i think that that's something that we should very much encourage and continue this social contract uh someone else made a really good analogy where it's similar like tipping in the united states where it's not 6529 said this i like this it's not the law but it's um you know it's a social contract most people do it occasionally someone doesn't and and you know that kind of sucks but 99 of people do it society gets by and i think that for royalties for artists that is the case i think when you get like these 10k collections it gets trickier where it's harder to get 10 000 people especially when a lot of anonymous and a lot of people are not there to collect or support artists they're just there to make money then they'll be erased to the bottom and uh it's a whole thing i do think this is where the thing working in our favor are being the people who are really in support of royalties is is enforcement by the buyer because they want the project to succeed so if you're buying into a project apparently you have some skin in the game in that project and you should want the creators to get paid because presumably they're putting that money back into the project at some level to make it better and so i think that's where the incentive is in la is aligned it's not for the seller right who it was presumably exiting the project unless they hold others of it you know whatever there's obviously caveats but it's it's the buyer who should want this to be enforced and should want even if it means you have to pay a little bit of a premium either you love the art or you love the the project and so you want to support it for that reason or you're in it just for speculative reasons and then you could actually make a strong argument that sure pay a slight premium because it'll help the project succeed i also think there are these mechanisms we could potentially explore and i think i said this last week that at least get us a little closer like you you could i've heard a couple ideas floating around one would be to have some sort of list that can be continually added to of marketplaces that support creator royalties that future smart contracts for projects could check right you can have a call function you get some sort of function in the smart contract that checks this centralized list and if you're trying to list the asset on one of these non-pre-approved marketplaces you actually can't even list the asset so yeah but it's that's messy and uncomfortable and who's keeping that list and it's a little bit of like applying centralization to a space that we're trying to keep decentralized i'm also curious if there are ways that the smart contract could read the code could read code in the marketplaces to to see that there's a function that's enforcing royalties i i don't know there's a lot of ways around that too because you could have another function later on somewhere in the contract in the marketplace code that undermines it like it's there's to your point there's no sort of perfect solution because we really can't just like the smart contract alone can't do this yeah um which is a shame but i think i i've heard there's actually a um proposal put together by mitchell chan who's a generative artist and a great writer in the space for that exact idea about like building a protocol into smart contracts that allow the creators to you know put on put marketplaces on a ban list or an allow list and yeah it can get messy with uh the centralization aspect it'll be a cat and mouse game where a new marketplace will pop up but it's a lot cheaper to add an a contract address that can't be traded to a contract than it is to deploy a bunch of contracts for a marketplace like it's expensive and all that kind of stuff so that's one option another option i've heard which i think also makes some sense is uh tracking the nfts on an individual level where potentially there can be some indicator where the the project can know or the smart culture can know if a nfc was traded and royalties were paid or not and if not then that specific nft doesn't have the same utility as the rest because at the end of the day if you're buying an nft get access to a discord to get access to live events to participate in a road map thing but you're not paying royalties when you purchase it then maybe you shouldn't have the same level of access that everyone else has had who has paid royalties up until now or you know is paying royalties and that's interesting uh i i don't know how technically feasible it is but i think it's something i would like to see explored more um at the end of the day though to me it comes down to the terms and conditions of the sale of the nft and like are people agreeing to pay royalties uh when they buy the nft at mint or on the secondary market and some projects have gone as far as to include that i know artifacted and v friends have in their terms and conditions they say part of the terms you agree that as when you if and when you sell a percentage of royalties comes back to the company obviously enforcing that is another thing but if you at least put it there then people can and should know that that's what they're buying into and agree to that and when they go to sell well they're potentially breaking it if they're gonna buy then they're breaking it and then you can sort of have these repercussions and have some sort of justification for it um at the end of the day it is a bit centralized again but all these projects have a level of centralization to them anyway yeah you know i i don't want to say i'm not worried about it right now but i worry less about it in this especially this bear market where anybody who's still here is like really tracking what's going on right and we're in this kind of insular community where people can check oh is there a royalty set here it's the mainstreaming of all of this that um that makes me nervous like you know again we're trying to break we're trying to take barriers away from people engaging in this not add barriers to it and i worry about the person who just doesn't know anything who buys something with royalty-free not even being aware of it and then being cut out of utility and being like well screw nfts like this sucks like how was i supposed to know that i think all of this stuff does i'm optimistic you know that that we'll figure this out but i i do and and if there are some sales that go through without royalties i think that's okay i think it's about how do we make it so that 90 or 95 like the vast majority it's deeply inconvenient basically to try and pull off a non-royalty trade i think that's we have to do it because we're not going to make it impossible but if you make it deeply inconvenient you ensure that the majority of people will will be trading with royalties and i think we can get to that deeply inconvenient place as this goes mainstream i think so too i have a couple more thoughts one on the mainstream side of things and i totally agree uh well so so many artists specifically they're drawn to the space by the idea of royalties and i've i've had so many conversations over the last few weeks where i'm chatting to an artist and they didn't realize and they're like well what are we doing here that that's what i thought this was all about and that's what this technology i totally get that by the way that was sort of 100 i've known that this wasn't enforceable on smart contracts for a whole long time and i was a little jarred the first time i heard that but i it was one of those things you just kind of like put aside you're like you're not gonna think about this because it's inconvenient and i'm just gonna put it over here and like kind of ignore it dirty little secret um yeah i was actually watching a youtube video a week or two ago and it was mostly negative towards nfts but the creator was it was fairly neutral at the end of the day it was like it was a level-headed approach where most nfts are scams worthless not but then um he gave the creator gave a few examples of things that interested him um i can't remember the specific uh projects but i don't know generate about he he was a fan of generative art it was a creator who had a rug on his wall behind him that was created by generative art many years before nfts even existed and so he said yes there are rally use cases and then towards the end he's like and the best thing is there's creator royalties that are enforceable on this and i was like oh no no we're already having we're already having enough problems um the other thing i wanted to mention regarding royalties is for these 10k projects i'm not so sure that it's the best business model and and it aligns incentives in the best way i'm actually i'm fairly convinced it's not because royalties as a business model incentivizes churn turnover volume trading you sort of you like when people sell your nfts that's when you make money and it just doesn't really work to me like a long term this is massive mismatch of alignment incentives you should people you should want people to hold but then it's like how do you generate revenue and and then it's you know there's various additional options and then we get back to like subscription models or selling more nps or higher initial mint price with zero royalties and and looking for alternative revenue models as the business and i think i think at the end of the day that's one of the most important things like if as an nft project your business model relies on people buying and selling nfts or tokens and like buying more tokens that you release trading them on secondary market i think eventually you're just going to run out of steam and that's why finding additional ways to generate revenue as a business is something i think is extraordinarily important i agree with that all that was coming to mind as you're speaking is like elon musk like imagine if elon musk got even richer based on volume you know like it encourages a certain kind of like crazy twitter behavior like i i love elon but obviously his twitter behavior can at times leave something to be desired but like that's essentially what's incentivized because he'll just like you know pump the market dump the market like it it creates a lot of volatility and when you're prof when you profit off volatility that's a that's a strange incentive to have yeah like some like i'm certain different projects will have different levels of like nefariousness with relation to this but like you've seen it happen where a project will perhaps potentially make an announcement that will tank their floor price or in the short term causes panic and fart and then a week later be like announced something massive that's amazing and tremendous and um we've actually kind of seen it happen with proof now i don't know i was just thinking that i don't think they were intentionally potentially doing it but it's an interesting by-product but they've had a series of bad announcements where there's a flurry of um trading and then they got a bunch of money um and then they did the pre future proof announcement and then grails and then future proof coming next week that you know prices are going up and there's more trading and it's just like that churn is benefiting them um again i don't think that i'm almost certain it wasn't intentional but uh for other projects i it just i i'm sure that especially the rug pools they you see it all the time where they'll tease the community with announcements and string people along and just like trying to extract every last bit of eth from the dry stone and um it sucks and i think that it it works because of royalties and uh yeah yeah yep very interesting all right well i think that's time that's our show i do want to leave because we didn't leave with this because we didn't like fully get into it um i i mentioned i have a i started a newsletter i launched a newsletter zanika you've been very supportive i appreciate it i have a an article coming out today probably thursday august 25th so by the time you listen to this it should be out um i've been seeing a lot of chatter on twitter and this was really happening i feel like around some of the licensing and rights conversations that happened because of cc0 but saying like does yougo labs basically saying that hugo labs never actually had copyright overboard api club people are saying that's why yugo labs is suing rider for um trademark infringement instead of copyright infringement you have the funks saying larval labs never had a copyright over punks and that's why they didn't crypto funks wasn't actually taken down or the dmca quote unquote didn't work um for openc which there's actually other reasons that that's none of this
