[Music] hey y'all gmgm welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs this is a a very special and important mini episode i was able to grab a few minutes with nadia from riot and trippy of trippy labs who are behind the ukraine dao which is raising money for the situation over in ukraine specifically around medical care for ukrainian civilians and and soldiers and really wanted to chat with them at least briefly we could only grab about 20 minutes to talk about the work they're doing highlight the work they're doing um and and talk to nadia generally about the situation for those who don't know uh riot and and nadia is an activist artist collective based out of russia this was a surreal moment for me i first heard about nadia and riot from a 60 minutes segment like 10 years ago i was probably 16 or 17 years old saw this segment about these feminists these like punk feminists who were protesting putin and were actually arrested for it nadia served years in prison in russia and was just blown away by them as a young woman who was around their age so getting to talk to nadia was uh is special to me and we will hopefully have her back on for a future episode where we can go a little bit more in depth on the work that she has done and since since her her days of being arrested and uh and and now as we move forward so uh trippy who was also on this call we look forward to having back he's an incredible artist and also an activist in in a variety of ways so very grateful to them both for joining us uh it was a little chaotic nadia was coming off of a plane i think trippy was also in transit so please forgive any sort of audio discrepancies or audio challenges we may have had just felt like it was important to get this out as soon as possible and very grateful to them both for the work they're doing and for for hopping on hello everyone welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs this is a really special episode to me i am so incredibly grateful to be joined by trippy of trippy labs and artist collective and nadia from riot uh many of you may be familiar with both trippy and nadia but i am so excited to have them here because they are the founding team behind ukraine dao which has raised several millions of dollars for the situation in ukraine over the last several days we are going to be talking about that but first i want to start a little bit with nadia your background some people may be very familiar with who you are but i think there are a lot of people out there who know your name and maybe don't really know your story you spent two years you were sentenced to two years in prison in russia under putin for protesting putin um you have a very specific vantage point at which to come at the situation between russia and ukraine um why don't you tell folks a little bit your your background and journey how how you would frame it um my name is nadja i started um with a couple of colleagues of mine um and a proudest art collective is called right um it's a fun name to travel with and say at the border what is your profession my profession is busy right um i hate borders i hate governments i hate nation states um i'm an anarchist and a lot of people who are part of  right is are anarchists and our goals from the very beginning are feminism protecting lgbtq as people in russia they're in really terrible position and fighting with uh authoritarianism and our ultimate goal is to get rid of flashy mercury and he doesn't like us um understandably so we were um organizing since 2007 in order to remove him from power because we always believe that it's dangerous to concentrate so such an incredible power in hands of really just one individual and what's happening today in ukraine just shows that we were right the world was wrong when they didn't hear us about um screaming about dangers of assumers putting power um and you know he basically decided by himself that he is going to destroy lives of so many ukrainians he's going to destroy peace in europe um and that's what happens when one person accumulate too much power in 2012 we ended up in prison for two years i served two years in a labor camp um was psychologically tortured and also had to work the way um very outdated equipment that resulted in multiple injuries uh and i was released from jail started a couple of organizations one of them was mediozone that became one of the most influential media outlet these days in russia and i started an organization that helps prisoners especially female prisoners in russia and ever since um keep creating my art and other members of right and we have a lot of members because it's uh i refer to possibilities the first ever existing dao because we never had any leaders everyone um the organization was really flat and if you have um any sort of leadership it's based on um based on respect and based on your expertise in certain areas but we don't have any set of leaders in even um i as a co-founder busy right doesn't have any more power than anyone else who joined later um a year ago i started my journey in crypto and i believe that we can use crypt as an amazing tool for activism uh we are building something that's called pussivers that will bring much more equality for women and lgbtq plus people in digital art space because right now it's not equal enough um and uh so i've been working on that for the last year and when um where in ukraine happened when putin starts um started wearing ukraine it became a really uh quickly obvious for me and trippy and other people involved in unicorn doubt in ukraine doubt today um that we should use our connections and to use all our resources um people we're in touch with because we were in touch with incredible people and that's what i love about crypt everyone has unique expertise and something um and they're ready to contribute to a greater cause and that's what we're seeing happening today with ukraine doll amazing so we're going to obviously talk quite a bit about ukraine dao but i want to ask you as somebody who has arguably had a better read on putin from the beginning than others as you said the world didn't listen and you guys have been quite literally screaming and singing about this for a long time um can you give folks context into what you feel putin's goal is here you hear like he just wants to stop nato expansion into ukraine is this something more sinister where we're we are facing world war iii and this is a hitler figure like what is your read on what this situation is what the end goal is here putin is quite desperate um and nobody expected were in ukraine ukraine was not an aggressor um he started wearing a crane out of the blue nothing nothing led to that and it makes him a really dangerous figure just because we don't really know how what happens in his brain i think he's his brain is apparent quite are i didn't really know what happens in that brain but he definitely doesn't think as a normal person i think it's there is some level of sociopathy happening right now because i don't really understand how he can um just invade um peaceful country out of the blue what is his goal the biggest um the biggest trauma for putin all his life and he said about it out loud multiple times he believes that the biggest strategies tragedy of the 20th century was the fall of soviet union he called it the biggest geopolitical catastrophe and i believe that because of the last 22 years he had close to absolute power he really believed in that he is this historical figure who is sent to the world from above uh to restore soviet union he was trained as a kgb agent he um he sees the world in cold war paradigm us against them he doesn't really know how to communicate with people how to collaborate um it's his mind is really outdated so he's not he's not the right figure to represent my country on a national level um but unfortunately he still does his power has his power i think he's uh he's i'm i'm i'm not i'm not able to read his mind but uh as as far as i can tell um he wants to divide ukraine um in a fashion um in in eastern western germany fashion uh to protect himself from nato from european influences i think what's fascinating you know how closely it does feel like it echoes world war ii in the sense of like lost german pride loss of their sense of their place in the world a leader comes along who can seem you know who who taps into that frustration and promises to restore that sense of pride and that sense of dominance like it's chilling it feels like the kind of similar the echoes there yeah and i think it's scary because we see this happening throughout the world it's happening at such a large scale between russia and ukraine right now but this sense of nationalism or seeing a certain type of people as being more valuable than another for whatever which uh historical reason is quite crazy and there's groups all over the world who face such travesties daily because of it regarding your question about third world war um uh there's i don't think anyone can told but uh stakes are really high right now uh putin's generals are saying that they did they have their nuclear power prepared for an action and it after they actually started a war and people are dying i'm not skeptical about them going even crazier and actually starting um you know um you know starting a nuclear bomb explosion or something it's um it's how did you just lose i'm losing my english guys yeah well i understand this big congression i unfortunately cannot speak any russian how did you see russia evolve in your like over your lifespan and and like has putin you know been the same man or do you think the megalomania is getting worse i think he's getting more power he's consolidating more power i'm not um okay i think this is a valuable work to try to read putin's mind i i'm not one of those who like to think about putin just for the sake of my mental health i don't think about him and whenever people ask me what would i tell him if i see him nothing um i think just what's important for me that this amount of power doesn't have to be consolidated enhanced with one single individual it doesn't matter if they're good or bad we don't have a lot of stories of a lot of stories of good dictators um it's just um and i i just generally i mean i guess like what i wanted to say here is the world that is committed to ideals of democracy they have to act much tougher on people like autocrats from russia from china from north korea from india they cannot just play nice just because they want to make business with them um i believe that it's just it's um it at least the situation is like the one that we see today so if you really want to leave by your ideals i i think um situations like putin has to be how putin had to be sanctioned in 2014 and grammy was next because um he didn't start full-blown war but he invaded um as he invaded different country and um believed that the world had to react at that time now it's a little too late but it's better let's talk about ukraine now because this is obviously the the thing that we really want to get to here and the work you're doing to help folks on the ground give a little context into what ukraine dao is how it operates and and then we'll we'll dive in deeper ukraine daw was formed three four days ago when war started was formed immediately have folks from all different countries and backgrounds have a large ukrainians here and we uh what was important for us is to be as close as we can to ukrainians who are on the ground and listen from them where do they want to use the money and so we're making this preparational work for two days to add a lot of discussions where it should be sent funds and had conversations with the fund itself and we decided finally to channel the money from this current sale to and the current race to a foundation is called come back alive and in particular they are going to use this money for medical help to ukrainians that suffer from the war how it operates just as a regular tao we have a couple of chats we have have discord we have uh multi-sig um and it's flat it's pretty flat we don't have leaders and there are kind of two tracks if i understood it correctly there's make a straight donation using crypto to this organization which is essentially a donation to then come back alive and then you have this ukrainian flag nft piece of it can you just explain how that works um you can donate directly if you prefer not to play nft games uh but i feel like this is such a powerful uniting symbol for us ukrainian flag we had a lot of conversations in the first day of um existence of our dao about should it be whose artwork should it be because we wanted to initially make 10k project somebody else's artworks and then we decided to do one of one but whose artwork should it be and then i i said that it's not actually about anyone's aesthetics it's not about what color you prefer it is about um it is about ukraine it's about ukrainians it's why we picked ukrainian flag and in a way it's a strong conceptual art statement from us um regarding this situation because i feel like right now we need to um get trade as much as we can of our egos and do not care about being credited or that much i mean they can't fully get rid of your ego but um i guess that's this is a statement that goes behind this flag we all unite to help ukrainians to survive and defend themselves and defend their motherland and so is it is it ten thousand individual ukrainian flag nfts that folks purchase or you're coming together to to to bid on this one nft it's just a one of one that we're party bidding on and then a dot if address that people can donate to we originally thought of doing 10 000 um nfts and thought and thought that it would be too convoluted and we just want this could go on for a while and we could come up with a lot of other iterations but thought it was important to have a clear concise way to get the first round of money to people on the ground and you've raised at this point nearly four million or over where are you all at in terms of your fundraising efforts i think it's four point four i don't know here on my computer i think it's 4.4 is the plan to keep this open and running indefinitely so long as there's a war no um they i mean the the wallet address is going to be valid indefinitely as long as the word is going to happen but um our 101 is going to close in a day and a half why did an nft cell feel important for this and trippy this is i know something you maybe also wanted to say something on like the importance of nfts and crypto well we think with crypto we're avoiding a lot of red tape uh that comes with traditional fundraising um also the community crypto twitter is a vigorous community that loves to unite behind important causes so uh after the successful year a lot of people have had in crypto setting up these dows and initiatives to channel some of those wins and some of those earnings into the places that where capital is most needed i think that's exactly what we should be doing if we're going to be setting an example for how capital should be stewarded i think the question was like why do we why do we decide to use nft uh instead of just publicizing a wallet uh i think the gamification around the party bed and uh i think that that draws a lot more interest to it it's kind of following a model that has been seen to work for free ross or constitution or assange dao um i think it entices people to uh be charitable more so i think so and i would like to just reiterate that i feel like a ukrainian flag here is an artistic statement and me and type e and other people involved in it a lot of us are artists so having um having this statement was important for us and when you you speak of that gamification trippy it's that that y'all are bidding and then somebody else comes along and bid and you have that uh sort of competition in a way that inspires folks to to okay i'm gonna give a little more so that we win the bid is that what you're describing in that yeah it's it's it's it's inspiring for people and also fun to are we going to win the bid together collectively or is some whale going to come in and and win it on their own and there's a fun story around that that's much more interesting than just donating to an address i had someone coming in at um 1050 east and maybe someone will come with even more um we'll see and nadia do you have anything you want to say or thoughts more broadly on the role of crypto and nfts sort of in repressive regimes obviously we're starting to see this with folks who are crypto's their only source of wealth but i think it'd be interesting to hear you speak on that a little bit it's fairly difficult to use fiat when you are an activist in the oppressive regime uh banks frozen your accounts because it's so easy for rigged robbed rugged courts to um to just froze through your bank accounts i am so grateful for you coming on talking about this so we'll hang back on some day to talk about all the other amazing workouts i love that yeah yeah and and for now at least we have a little something we can we can get out talking about this project in particular because i think it is so important um and thank you for coming on thank you for watching trippy are there any last points you would like to raise things you feel like we didn't get to cover about ukraine specifically or this more broadly that you want to get out there for folks we'll obviously include links for anybody who wants to contribute um are there other thoughts you'd like to share yeah i'd say other other thoughts in general is people are reaching out how to help besides just donating or sharing um i think sharing it around on social media is super helpful i think sharing it directly into private group chats with context and explaining in a few sentences why this initiative is particularly important too can be more beneficial also diving deep into the discord and actually being a part of the community and coming and participating that's that's seeing the discord be as active as possible and people convening on ideas and helping to direct where things go in the future that's the most important and just with with free rostow we saw a lot of energy at the beginning and then after some of the news died off who was really left around to really figure this thing out long term um so that's where i would press people like really be a part of the community on discord in depth if it's something that calls them well i would love to have you on as well i would love to talk more about free roster i was tracking that at the time and i i've always found the ross albrecht story interesting um and obviously you are a tremendous artist as well and so we will have to talk again i won't muddy this episode uh i i think we keep the main thing the main thing here which is obviously the situation in ukraine and and the work y'all are doing but we'd love to have you back to talk more broadly about the work you've um you're doing in this space which is is varied and many initiatives yeah we'd love to come back and i'm in the car nadia's moving around but or just getting off the plane and we'll both be uh able to talk with more clear internet connections but but thanks for thanks for rushing this out it means a lot and even if it's a bit chopped together it's the best we can do in times of yes at the end of the day yeah a lot worse going on in the world than uh some choppy audio so really grateful for you coming on making the time and uh we will talk again soon thanks for your time appreciate you a lot thanks trippy bye [Music]
