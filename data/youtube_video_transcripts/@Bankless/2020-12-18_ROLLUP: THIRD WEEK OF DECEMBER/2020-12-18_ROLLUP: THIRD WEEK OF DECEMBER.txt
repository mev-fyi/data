roll it up it's rolling in the week of december happy friday morning this comes out every friday morning so you drink a cup of coffee and catch up on crypto in about 25 minutes david what do we do give us the topic list we take five different topics and we roll it up into five different minutes each we talk about the market what is the market saying we talk about releases what got released then we talk about the news then ryan and i share some of our takes and finally we finish off with what we are excited about there is a ton of news to roll up in this week so much happens and so we are going to roll up a whole entire week's worth of information inject it straight into your brain so you can keep up with the crazy world of crypto ryan are you ready i'm ready man let's do it okay let's start with the market the question is what is the market saying i feel like it's saying price go up i think it says number go up what a week man let's start with bitcoin all-time highs after flirting with it for i don't know how many weeks feels like like four weeks yeah yep it hit it tell us about it yeah interestingly enough at three years to the date that bitcoin painted the almost 20k all-time high in 2017 we broke it on december 16th uh three years later cruising through the 20k mark all the way up to almost 24 000 in the last two days bitcoin has painted two almost two candles at two thousand dollars each that is crazy the volatility's back baby do you know what this means david i was thinking about this it means every single person who told you that bitcoin would never reach all-time high again is wrong and every single ever doubted bitcoin is fun about history they're wrong like they've been wrong and it kills me that people give advice without any skin in the game naseeb taleb talks about this and it happens all of the time these analysts and these experts and these economists give advice without any skin in the game right and it cost them nothing when they're wrong well they were all wrong bitcoin came back hit all-time highs again and no signs of slowing down should we get to ether price uh right before we do this feels like the starting pistol for the game where like if it feels all the whole like 2018 2019 slow ramp and even the 2020 slow ramp like the game didn't start until all-time high was passed and so like the game starts now like congratulations like we all have been talking about like yo the bull market's here but we never really felt too confident about it now that like bitcoin is at all-time highs you know blasting through its previous levels officially the bull market is on there's no there's no other way to have a bull market bull market's here you can't interpret this any other way what have we been saying we've been saying this is 2016 next year is 2017. we'll see how it works out let's talk about eath price eath price go up two yeah each number go up all the way eat painted eight a hundred dollar day uh yesterday going from just under six hundred dollars i think it was it was uh like 590. uh and then it reached i guess it didn't do a full hundred dollars but then it reached a peak of like roughly 680 earlier today and then it's taking a bit of a tumble back down to the 630 a little bit off the all-time highs but still you know really really strong crazy seems like only yesterday david when in fact it was march of this year when eath price was under a hundred dollars right it just went up 100 in a day but within recent memory in the last nine or ten months it was actually under a hundred dollars uh pretty crazy um ethan is actually up 370 on the year which is super impressive bitcoin up 180 uh both having very good years phenomenal years breaking the the back of the bull market i would say we should also talk about total locked value in uh ethereum because that is up to all-time highs it looks like yeah it was even higher much higher earlier today earlier today it was at 16 and a half billion it's down to 15.9 billion but that's still much higher than the 14 billion it was at last week same thing with the dpi uh d5 pulse index last week it was at a hundred and one dollars now it's at a hundred and twelve dollars actually but as as all far as as far as number go up goes that number didn't go up very much dpi kind of lagged behind d5 has not made the big moves that bitcoin or ether have d5 the dpi that dave was talking about of course if if you're new that is an index of the top d5 tokens on ethereum uh pretty insane weeks for both bitcoin and ether as an asset there's also been some insane premiums in the grayscale market so look at these of course uh grayscale you could catch our episode michael um sun and shine from grayscale this is a way to buy trust type products get some eat exposure get some bitcoin exposure in your retirement account if you want to do it that way um wow that premium premium is insane 200 200 versus spot price if you're buying ethy in your retirement account you're paying over 200 more than somebody who's buying it on the coinbase exchange that just shows you how much like institutional locked up demand there is for these assets well it also shows retail demand right because e is just like okay what's this ethereum thing how do i like access it where do i go to get exposure let me go to where i always go which is my broker oh there's this e like trust thing that gives me exposure to if the ether i'll buy it and then they just hit the buy button they don't really understand what their what they're buying it doesn't matter but that's where that premium comes from the fact that people are willing to pay basically what's going on is people are paying almost double for the price of ether for the for convenience right and so there's there's a lot of people that are really want ether uh quite a lot apparently yeah um absolutely all right i thought anthony cesano had a really interesting comparison the last time ether price was above 500 percent he goes through some 500 500 excuse me was uh so last time it was at 500 november 29 2017 versus today of course it's above and unique addresses so the increase in basically ethereum bank accounts these are ether dresses 900 increase from five years ago or from excuse me from three years ago when the price was 500 so he goes through some other stats active addresses are up 60 um 24 hour transaction count up 80 the fees the revenue on a 24 period hour period of time the the demand for block space up one thousand four hundred and seventy percent d phi is up like infinite amounts from ten million to like well if it wasn't billion d five basically invented right so like this paints the picture to me david of like an ether price of 500 november 29 2017 it was based on unfulfilled dreams like potential the ethereum of today has brought a lot of these dreams to life and it's a massive amount of i guess like real world traction that we've seen uh yet the same similar price point pretty crazy what's your take on that yeah it's also good to remind ourselves that like ether is still roughly 50 off of its all-time high now like i don't really ascribe too much weight to all-time previous all-time high prices because of how incredibly fleeting they were like bitcoin was at like 19 700 for like 10 minutes before before it dropped and ether was at like the all-time high price of like thirteen hundred dollars and thirteen hundred seventy dollars for just like moments right so it didn't really put too much uh you know history or meaning into those numbers but at the end of the day like ether price is fifty percent of its previous all-time high meanwhile the network has like improved by multiple orders of magnitude some things like d5 exist now that just didn't exist last time ether was at this price uh and you know that that discrepancy between those two things looks like opportunity to me you know another thing that didn't exist for ethereum david it's taking staking my friend there's now one billion worth of eth in the e2 deposit contract so this internet bond we've been talking about this digital internet bond is now worth over a billion dollars which is pretty incredible some other um ethereum stats we should talk about the number of ethereum addresses passed a milestone with over ethereum addresses with ether in that in it oh excuse me with with ether in it passed over 50 million actually i'm not sure if i have this chart up but that that's incredible that's like an all-time high for any crypto network the number of ethereum addresses with the asset ether in it over 50 million right and importantly that's a number that can go down where like a total number of ethereum addresses that have had a transaction with them only ever goes up the this is a closer to like actual usage right like strictly the the number of wallets that actually hold a balance of ether uh just you know reaching all-time highs every single day it looks like pretty crazy we've got usdc that now hit over three billion dollars of course all settled on ethereum um eth option open interest that's at one billion dollars too so eth options we'll talk about some really interesting news around ether options in just a moment but even on um crypto exchanges like darabit and okay x that's at all-time highs to 50x increase this year the options market for ether this year has come a long way pretty crazy as well yeah and i'm i'm i'm not totally familiar familiar with the options world but i'm pretty sure at least with things like there a bit or perhaps even all options i'm not an expert but like you need ether collateral in your account to like play with these options right and so while these things are centralized people are the volume the open interest volume requires ether collateral to make that work let's talk about some other big options news let's get to the new releases david this has been something that's been i guess for um weeks not months the cme group this is the chicago mercantile exchange the biggest financial derivatives exchange in the world for traditional markets for anything they finally announced that they're going to um release an ether futures product so bitcoin of course has an ether futures product and the cme has had that since 2017. either literally a week a week three years ago to the week uh bitcoin futures was offered by cme really weird like like three year anniversary is going on right now very strange timing i'm not sure if they just do stuff in december or what but three years later now this is the second crypto asset to be added which means if they are successfully added uh ether really has the the green light to be um considered a commodity by u.s regulatory authorities which is which is pretty incr incredible has to be decentralized enough to be a commodity this is just going to open up the institutional floodgates for ether as an asset as it has with bitcoin i wouldn't be surprised we've talked about this before david but all of the the fund managers and institutions who are saying we love bitcoin like we're buying bitcoin announcing it and part of the reason is because now they can get their hands on it right so like they don't announce until after they've bought the thing like they're not gonna tell you that they own bitcoin until like they have tons of bitcoin they just moved into a position i think the same thing's going to happen increasingly with ether these large institutions are going to go buy some ether then they're going to tell you about it maybe a few weeks or months later because this has opened up the gates and he takes here yeah the the main takeaway here is is in addition to just opening up the options for big money to have exposure to ether this is also something that needs to happen if there is ever going to be an ether etf which i totally think there will be uh the bitcoin etf's probably gonna come first but the thing is like big brother bitcoin fights the hard fight with the regulate regulators and then ether just like slips right through i'm a younger child uh i have an older sister a much older sister she fought with my parents to get a cell phone and when i had to fight for my cell phone i didn't have to fight so hard that's like ether and bitcoin that's not fair mom she said that a lot exactly right well it might not be fair but that is indeed what is happening um bitcoin is is leading the way for ether the asset this is interesting in releases as well swivel finance is an interest rate derivative protocol it's built on ave and compound um they just released we're seeing like new d5 protocols emerge every week what's interesting or special about this one david yeah there's two ways to make a money lego on ethereum you build one from scratch or you connect two other money legos with your third money lego and that's what this swivel finance is it's an interest rate derivatives platform which is just uh increasing the final financialization of the defy world uh you know this is a product that legacy people would find themselves familiar with but now is in a d5 context you know just inevitable before something like this comes out so cool glad it's finally here dope circle is a crypto bank they are releasing a new earnings account it's basically a high-yield usdc business account for businesses again we think that yield is going to be a big driver of d5 products in a world of decreasing yield to zero percent below zero percent that's what you find in traditional finance when d5 can start to offer these things even crypto banks can start to offer these things that's going to bring on mainstream any hot takes here david yeah once again ethereum proving to be the last bastion of yield in this financial world uh and being proven out by like the way if people on the podcast who aren't seeing the screen there what circle is offering is 8.5 interest on your usdc deposits and some and depending on on uh the product that you choose if even if it's a fixed term they are advertising as high as 10.75 that is high if you go out and tell businesses that they can get almost 11 yield on their cash it's a no-brainer it's like yes please give that to me that is something that the world absolutely wants these days and just can't be found anywhere outside of ethereum yeah and and by the way with the news that we announced uh three weeks ago about visa essentially enabling a payment rails for usdc this this pairs so nicely with that now you've got a like business bank account where you're receiving high yields and then you've got a way to pay for uh pay for things with usdc using the the visa crypto rails uh pretty incredible kraken is launching lightning integration in 2021 it like feels about time right like um a lot of bitcoiners and crypto exchanges been talking about lightning for a while like i'm glad they're doing this this this feels like a long time coming any any takes here yeah it's good to see lightning kind of finally coming into the world right like exchangers would be the logical first people to implement lightning uh and for payments uh there's a bunch of skepticism especially out of the ethereum world as to whether lightning is even legit or not i think this is going to be a really great list litmus test to see do people actually want to use lightning as a real solution to a real problem or is it just kind of this hypothetical tinkerer's environment lightning is about to quote unquote go mainstream and be put against the free market so let's see if the free market wants it something else we've been tracking has been the emergence of digital currencies in places like china and i don't have the link open but but david um i looked at an article that actually showed somebody paying with a uh digital one using using touch pay on their phones so basically one smartphone to the other and they use the chinese china's new central bank digital currency made a payment like i think people don't realize particularly maybe in in europe and and north america that digital currency central bank digital currencies in asia at least in china like they're here they're being in the they're in the process of being rolled out right now in a year a year and a half like or two years time they're it's going to be everywhere and other central banks are going to need to compete with that level of infrastructure like it's happened it's here and it's going to cause everything to accelerate um and become more digital yeah asia moves faster than we do uh and yeah they let's not let's not to be like like flippant about it they are way ahead of the west when it comes to central bank digital currencies and the west is going to if they are not already going to feel extremely threatened by that yeah space rate race is an interesting analogy for what is about to happen i think wow we talk about these releases but like they seem to fit kind of a common uh mold of institutional adoption someone every week is building something new in a money protocol on on d5 the crypto banks are becoming more like mike like fintech central bank digital currencies they they always seem to fit a similar mold david so i hope listeners are seeing the trends here and extrapolating those trends let's move on to news the big news i think of the the week other than the all-time highs other than all-time highs other than ether being listed on the cme maybe number three is coinbase is announcing the confidential submission of draft registration statement what does that mean it means they are likely gearing up for an ipo in 2021 the first large crypto um initial public offering i think that that we've probably ever seen that's that's gotta be maybe in the double digit billions by the times they list pretty massive david what's your take here yeah this is coinbase is i'm pretty sure crypto's largest company right and definitely crypto's largest company in america so a coinbase going public is an extremely big deal in so many different ways it's extremely legitimizing to our industry it's a way to people like coinbase quote unquote sells shovels right and and traditional investors who maybe don't want don't care to purchase bitcoin and ether but are definitely interested in selling people shovels would definitely purchase coinbase uh also interestingly they announced this the day after bitcoin all-time high day i think that that was a very strategic move i think that they had this ready to go in their back pocket to announce the day after bitcoin broke its all-time high and they are very strategically positioning their ipo to come during a mania period right during a hype cycle while everyone while the premiums for bitcoin on grayscale are super high while there is just com incredible interest in bitcoin coinbase is going to ipo and the timing couldn't be perfect and it's just going to be so it's also just another thing to propel the bull market this is a super bullish development i i totally agree and the timing is right and um like well played on coinbase's part they've been talking about this for years and now it's here right in time for the bull market as david you mentioned um this this was pretty big news as well it feels like another theme on these rollups is every week we announce some institutions some billionaire some hedge fund who has just purchased more crypto assets bitcoin uh primarily but this one caught my interest as well this is um one river asset management see the cio ceo eric peters just put in another 600 million uh into you into two things bitcoin and ether it's interesting because we had that conversation just this week uh david with ryan sulcus talking about how bitcoin was the only asset that's really getting put on institutions balance sheets but very clearly in the bloomberg terminal you have the purchase of almost 600 million and adding to about a billion dollars of bitcoin and ether both of those assets together are being institutionalized what's your take here yeah dude like there is no such thing as tribalism outside of the crypto world the legacy world the legacy investors they don't care about tribalism they see bitcoin and they see ether and they want exposure to this world when they just purchase bitcoin they don't have anti-non-bitcoin asset opinions like many bitcoiners do uh so you know the diversification is like the the name of the game when it comes to the legacy investors and so they look at all the possible investments to make in the space in addition to bitcoin and ether is a close second right uh and the the market cap of ether is like one fifth or one seventh the the market cap of bitcoin which means that one dollar into ethereum one dollar into purchasing ether means so much more when it comes to moving the price simply because of ether's lower market cap yeah that's an excellent point that last bit and the interesting thing about this is it's really a two horse race it's bitcoin and ether and nothing else it's like both of those assets um they are not going to put something like xrp on their balance sheets okay um let's talk about this too so our friend hugh carp we've had on the podcast before go check out that episode he's the ceo of nexus mutual his defy insurer d5 protocol uh he just got hacked for about eight million in nxm tokens and the way he was hacked david super super scary um it was actually the hacker had remote control over the computer he was using and hugh is an experienced deep defy operator of course like he covers his tracks his good opsec was using a ledger with metamask and the attacker somehow like rewired metamask it would display some different output and channel a transaction that he made from his ledger his hardware wallet to a different destination than he that you intended like so that's a story that's kind of still developing but what's your take on that yeah i always knew that something like this attack vector existed but i never heard anyone making any noise about it so i just never really bothered to like protect myself from it what happened was that some hacker got so access to hughes laptop and did a hot swap of metamask right installed a malicious version of metamask that looks exactly the same and there's and they're like i don't know how many transactions you make where you just don't really verify the data because i mean it always works and so like you know i never do that i never do that anymore now i something i've also haven't done since this is make a transaction on my ledger via metamask because i'm a little bit scared right like you and i are both very public people like so is hugh and and like that's kind of kind of worrisome uh we are having we are going to have hugh on the show once this um once this whole ordeal gets settled because there is a little bit of a police chase going on right now interestingly enough the hacker the only way that the hacker um knew or some something to do with the fact that the hacker was a customer of nexus mutual which means that that customer is kyc'd uh which is really interesting uh and that's not a really a great position to be in as the hacker and so there is a police chase going on right now the the nexus and hugh are working with authorities to get back his money um so that'll be an interesting development and once the the silence is lifted from that whole story we're going to tell it on the bankless youtube yeah absolutely make sure you stay tuned on you know into that just for your own ops purposes right so we can kind of uh figure out how like individuals who are going bankless can protect themselves against this sort of thing that'll be part of the story as well david let's talk about the office of comptroller who um has been pretty bullish lately on ether and on crypto assets is making some statements this is in the us uh wanting to more formally integrate stablecoin issuers into the existing banking system i think this is uh brian brooks who is doing this does it seem inevitable david that um stable coin issuers are going to be regulated in in some way we just had a conversation with rowan gray who of course is the proponent of the stable act he definitely wants to regulate all of the issuers but it feels like it's going to come in one form or another and some of the issuers the the centralized issuers anyway are sort of um like proponents of some light regulation as well what's your what's your take on this news yeah rohan grey's uh argument is that like if it walks and talks like money it needs to be regulated like money and to some degree like something like usdc i kind of do support that right because they are they are in the meat space world they are connected to the legacy banking system uh and so there should be some amount of regulation i guess like regulation isn't evil by nature um uh so to i think this is kind of just a natural evolution of the industry like the the the parts of ethereum that connect to the united states banking system they're going to get regulated like i'm not interested in fighting that too hard i don't even see what would be beneficial about it um another interesting i guess a news development is somebody created a way uh to stream long-term incentives on ethereum this is a developer by the name of james james fickle can you talk a little bit about this open grant project david yeah so this is just trying to solve the principal asian problem in my opinion where like a lot of ethereum development should be incentivized like financially and it is but it should what this project is trying to go after is trying to incentivize in east nominated returns right and so people that are working on the ethereum ecosystem are by proxy increasing the value of ether the asset right and so this is a way to uh reward developers working on ethereum with ether denominated returns rather than us dollar denominate returns meaning that if they do a good job then ethereum will be better and ether will be more valuable and they'll be able to access that upside that they created for the network so just a really good incentive alignment system and that's really what ethereum is all about is like offering tools for you to tinker with incentives so that we can produce the outcomes that we want yeah it's uh it's it's really great to see like between things like this and of course git coin the community is really solving the public goods problem of how to fund this sort of infrastructure which has always been part of the bear case i think for cryptocurrencies it's like great you're rewarding miners you're rewarding validators uh but but how do you reward like the the equivalent of of the hospitals and roads and the public infrastructure that that needs to be developed for these systems and the community's coming up with really creative ways to harness the money protocols that we have to do this and that's super exciting super bullish um david have you kept up with the whole nft art scene at all because there are some artists that are having some massive success and this really feels like to me like this is going to be something really big is going to come out of the art scene uh the crypto art scene and the nft scene in 2021 and maybe it's already starting so this artist people just made 3.5 million dollars in an nft auction dude that's crazy 3.5 million dollars for digital art right yeah uh i first came across people because joe rogan tweeted about him saying that he thinks that his art is really cool and his art is really cool it's very unique it's kind of also odd i would say it's odd art definitely worth checking it out uh beeple dashcrap.com uh where you can go check out some of his work but yeah he he auctioned off devon nfts for 3.5 million dollars so first off congratulations to this this guy second off this is just oh going to open up the floodgates towards digital art right this is how i this is how a digital art mania gets started i expect this to be kind of like like bitcoin crossing the all-time high i expect this to kind of be a starting pistol for digital art and artists coming to because if somebody's making 3.5 million dollars by selling digital art a lot of people are going to take notice and be like i can also get a chunk of that dude this is some weird stuff read is like donald trump running through fire but apparently this art piece is programmable and it was like if trump wins the art itself changes to a vis a video of a sexy boy king trump like what is this well this is part of the this is part of the art right like the people guy is like a really creative kind of off-brand guy that's part of his brand that you're buying into when you buy one of the nfts wow super creative super interesting david that is uh we've gone through market releases news it's time for some takes if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wire will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing what is your hot take this week my hot take is about this bull market and it is different this time tm this bull market is different this time and there's just a number of different reasons why it's different this time first and foremost obviously we are in times of money printer gopur we are during we are in the middle of an economic contraction while we are also simultaneously having monetary base growth and inflation right and so while the economy might be down there's so much more money in the world and and so that's that's already quote unquote it's different this time what's also different in this time is as a result of that the investors coming into this base are different they are funds they are you know boards of people making governance decisions about treasuries they are like long-term holders not the fickle retail who were like you know the price of bitcoin drops by like five percent and then they get scared out of their positions these people don't get scared out of their positions they are here for the long haul right they are not trading bitcoin they are taking it and removing it from the market and there's a lot of them meanwhile we have like three and a half million dollars being purchased on nfts that's also something that's totally different it's also different like like we've talked about previously on previous rollups and basically across every bankless channel d5 didn't exist last time like there's different surface areas for investments gaming like it's all happening all at once like this bull market is not the same thing as previous bull markets because of how much optionality there is to express bullish opinions in different investments and also just the different players the the 2017 and the mania of 2017 crypto was like a household name everyone knew that this cryptomania was going on i think people are going to understand that a lot sooner and i think the crypto is about to become just a very common talking conversation point from everyone not just the crypto folk wow like i i i agree you know so my can i make my hot take sort of a a riff off of your husband is that allowed i feel like that's how this podcast goes oh okay um so the like it's different this time tm right so just building off what you said another way it's different is this time we actually have defy capital assets we have tokens that are capital assets and here's what i mean by that so like 2017 all of the token mania had no substance behind it these tokens didn't have cash flows associated with them they didn't even really have value accrual mechanisms it was just some nebulous thesis that yeah i buy a token bitcoin went up ether went up so therefore this token should go up right um the the the era of utility or futility tokens as we call them that is not the era that we're living in right now so what i think is going to happen is mainstream finance first they're getting their arms wrapped around bitcoin and digital scarcity okay done check mark right next they move into ether and this whole ethereum economy and ether the asset and they start to understand digital bonds the internet bond product a productive asset the ability of ether as an asset to generate revenue from the economy that's building okay check mark in progress right like that's happening right now they're also going to understand this cycle defy tokens capital assets things like yfi which just released a quarterly report last week it was generating something like 3 million in like quarterly revenue right like this is real revenue these are real financial um assets and they are producing returns for investors and i haven't heard anyone in a financial mainstream talk about that yet like they're not even aware that this world exists they understand bitcoin maybe they've maybe they've heard of ethereum but they don't understand that there is a future s p 500 that is in the process of being built but they will this cycle uh we've got some really interesting analysis tools this cycle too so we just put out a how to use token terminal to calculate like price to sales ratios and price to earnings ratios and it's like financials like kind of uh stuff we could start to do that now we're understanding these assets more than ever so you know what david you're right this time it is different it's different time tm tm when the investors of the world where the investor class of the world the funds whatever and they come to ethereum and they see that there is a open sea of impossible investable assets that are worthy of their research and attention they're going to get really excited because they thought that they knew about all the assets of the world but turns out there's a bunch of new assets they didn't even know existed and you know what they're going to do when they discover all of those new assets what are they going to do david probably subscribe to bankless [Laughter] probably what i mean you know what bank was q3 token report that was a great token report they should but like um i'm excited for them to come david but you know what i'm more excited about is the bankless community front running them yeah like we've been talking about this for the last bags front run like this is this is part of it they're going to slowly wake up to this but because we're using these systems every day like we know what's about to happen so guys subscribe to bankless continue to front run the wall street investors who are about to jump in here all right um i don't know that was takes but i felt like that was a bit of what what what we're excited about too is there something else you're excited about what else are you excited about david yeah i'm i'm actually excited about an article that is coming out on the bankless newsletter that i'm writing called ethereum is a trust plant uh i like plants as you guys can tell i have plants behind me but i wrote an article about how ethereum is similar to a plant and i think if you really want to understand how these systems work the right perspective is actually one of biology and that's kind of what i make the case in in the article one of the things that and this gets to what i'm the thing that i'm excited about it's not only to release that article and for everyone to read it and tell me what their feedback is but also the with the the way a good healthy vibrant plant works and lives is through redundancy right and we are seeing coming out of defy a bunch of redundant systems right there's a lot of dependency on dye right now dye's not all that redundant but actually we're getting new projects like empty set dollar and a few other uh decentralized stable coins as redundant systems like we've now we also we have in addition to compound now we also have ave and now we have like redundant money markets and the best thing about defy into the room for redundant systems right if ave goes down compound's there to replace it right hopefully with maker goes down there's a new alternative you know decentralized stable coin to replace that uh and so what really gets me excited about is is with the anti-fragility i'm seeing growing out of the d5 space if something breaks something else in d5 can take up that and bear that weight and the collapse and the structure just won't collapse because of how we have redundant structures guys you knew it was only a matter of time before david combines both of his passions botany and crypto into a single article i'm excited to read that to you my friend yeah no it's it's almost done coming out uh i think the 30th of december so so pretty soon david does these reads too on the youtube another reason to subscribe or he'll actually like walk through and read the article to you so you can get in your brain that way too really cool yeah i get i put some voice and emphasis into it too so it's fun to listen to it all right ryan what are you excited about you know okay so the cme news is so big with ether so we're having this debate with ryan sulcus earlier this week right kind of a is eth money debate and it turned out that that wasn't even the debate because we actually both agreed that if you use the definition of money that that i use and you use that ether is money and he said yep i agree but what i don't agree about this is ryan selkiss um who runs uh crypto analyst for missouri he's what i don't think is going to happen is that ether is never going to be a monetary asset in the way that that bitcoin is and if i'm to paraphrase him the main reason he said is because um institutions like micro strategy like large hedge funds paul tura jones of the world they are not currently putting ether on their balance sheet and they won't in the in the future so one of his points was the institutional of ether is a myth right so we debated that back and forth and then two days later david two days later ether like cme announces that ether is going to be listed they're going to have like futures on ether in the same way that they have uh futures of bitcoin bitcoin like the only other asset besides bitcoin to be listed on the chicago mercantile exchange the world's largest derivatives market nothing else is even close to that right same day uh this asset management company um one river asset management we just talked about earlier release press that they bought 600 million of not just bitcoin bitcoin and ether right so love ryan sulcus i feel like forwarding those links to him and like telling him like buddy just get ready let's have this conversation again in 2021 because it's already happening right even the conversation two weeks later would be different right so um i think it's important guys that um you you like catch these trends early crypto crypto is very much about trying to see the future but but also like catching trends and things that are happening very early before they become like consensus crypto ideas um the institutional of bitcoin institutionalization of bitcoin is now a consensus crypto idea like everyone sees it um they don't yet see i think the institutionalization of eth and that these same funds and asset managers who bought bitcoin are about to buy ether and i think there's alpha there we've said it before i think alpha there's going to be massive amounts of alpha in ether the asset this cycle but of course you guys know we skew ether bullish all the time just a little bit just a little bit i put out a tweet here i put out a tweet forever ago that was like this is right after like microstrategy i think bought their first bunch of bitcoin and i said like uh you know by the end of 2021 more companies will have ether on their balance sheets than bitcoin and the reason why that's true is because they're going to need to purchase ether in order to transact on ethereum i'm not saying that they are going to put their treasury into ether i'm saying that companies will need ether to to pay for transactions so maybe they're not putting millions and millions of dollars maybe they're just buying a hundred dollars worth of ether to put it to so that they can use ethereum the network to do whatever they want to do on ethereum the network and to me if you know every like uh 10 times as many companies are purchasing ether to pay for access to ethereum versus purchasing bitcoin to put on their balance sheet and it's just a little bit of ether that sounds like money to me that sounds like what money is absolutely well we will see what happens the next year is going to be big david we've got a little bit of overtime but it was an overtime week in terms of the news and it always is it always is guys this has been the weekly rollup from bankless as always this is not financial advice both bitcoin and ether and d5 are risky you could lose what you put in but this is the frontier we're headed west thanks for joining us on another episode of bankless
