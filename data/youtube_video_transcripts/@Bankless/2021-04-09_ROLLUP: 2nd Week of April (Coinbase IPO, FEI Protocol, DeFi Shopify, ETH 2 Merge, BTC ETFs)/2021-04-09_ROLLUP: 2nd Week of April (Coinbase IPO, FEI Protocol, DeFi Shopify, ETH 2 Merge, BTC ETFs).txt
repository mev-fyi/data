[Music] all right bankless nation welcome to this edition of the bankless weekly rollups we got a unique episode here today because ryan is on vacation and so we are bringing in a substitute teacher anthony cesano welcome to the banquets weekly rollup thank you for getting tapped in here brother hey mate yeah good to be here good to step in for ryan even though we don't look anything alike you know it doesn't matter i think we're both like super ethereum balls so this should be a fun show that's exactly right if this is your first weekly roll up happy friday morning we're bringing the energy we're bringing a full week's worth of news in the in friday morning get your coffee ready because we are coming at you with everything that's happened in the last week of crypto starting with markets what's happened in the markets in the last week then what got released in the last week the news what's happened in the news cycle and then some ecosystem takes who had some interesting opinions and then finally we will finish up with what david and anthony are excited about and of course last but always the most favorite the meme of the week anthony are you ready to get into it let's do it before we do however we i have an announcement out of the bankless world to get your bankless badge there is a way perhaps multiple long weeks of giveaways coming uh we are going to give away a bap which is one of these shirts so if you've ever wanted one of these shirts we're going to give one away to a raffle uh in a raffle to a bankless badge holder we're also going to give away an ether a whole ether to a bankless badge holder as well as some nfts i'm talking with my uh my buddy who's got a coffee startup for year multiple year-long coffee subscriptions the bankless badge is something that you want to own anthony do you have a bankless badge yes i do dave yes i do good you're gonna make it brother all right let's go ahead and get right into it all right guys we are starting with bitcoin bitcoin is at the kind of high price of 58 and 300 dollars again the last week it was just over 60 dollars i believe and then it even got down to as low as fifty two thousand dollars and now we are back up towards the north side of that and fifty eight thousand three hundred dollars anthony any comments on the bitcoin price yeah i mean bitcoins just seems to be continuing to go sideways as the rest of the market is starting to i guess like catch back up right bitcoin had an incredible run over the last few months or even like i guess the last year or so and i think it's it's basically just consolidating in this area giving some other kind of i guess crypto kind of coins uh crypto coins crypto tokens are a kind of like chance to catch up and everything like that but yeah i don't think it's going to stay like this forever i mean you know this doesn't just apply to bitcoin but i think over the next few weeks we have so many bullish catalysts coming up one of those being you know the biggest one being the coinbase direct listing that you know i can't see bitcoin kind of like staying under 60k for much longer yeah look at that look at that 30-day chart pretty all over the place but overall flat over 30 days and usually in bull markets bitcoin does not stay flat for very long uh we have plenty of coinbase related things to talk about in the rest of this weekly roll up so we are going to uh that will be a reoccurring theme of this specific roll up all right ether price either price over two thousand almost two thousand one hundred dollars at the time of recording we have a new high of ether price at uh 2151. uh anthony what do you think about the ether price yeah i mean as i was just saying now that bitcoin's been going sideways other other things can catch up and and ethan's definitely been gaining especially on the eighth bitcoin ratio so that's why we see eighth back over two thousand dollars here and you know eighth in particular from what i've seen looks looks much more bullish than than bitcoin at least over the short term and i think it's about time right it needs to needs to you know i i i i think if you still undervalued here i think it should be should be higher than where it is so i'm very happy to see making some some real strides here while bitcoin continues sideways yeah right in that same time period i was talking about where bitcoin over the last 30 days has been relatively flat ether has definitely been uh having a pretty strong uptrend it started 30 days ago at 1800 ending it at just under uh uh twenty one hundred dollars and a lot in the 30 day period uh and definitely showing that that trend that happens when bitcoin stays flat and then of course anthony i know you like this token uh the dpi 436 dollars i believe that's up from uh last week uh but just by a smidge just by a smidge anthony why don't you well tell us what's happening with dpi yeah so i think it's it's funny to see the the way the markets kind of i guess maybe changed a little bit uh you know there's this thing called an alt season where a lot of the other kind of coins rally and while bitcoin stays kind of sideways but i think we're now seeing kind of like a divergence but we have like a adult season and a defy season because the old season seems to be a lot of these other kind of like i guess like chains and a lot of these projects like just random projects just going up in value where d fires stayed flat but i think we're we're due for like a separate kind of defy season where people realize wow okay you know dfi you know isn't going anywhere it's here to stay like i need to buy up these tokens that are part of revenue generating protocols but you know it's funny because you can look at dpi against usd which is you know relatively flat um and then against eighth which is actually down against because uh you know you do you do want to measure dpi against eight for sure uh because they're in the same kind of arena but i think you know sooner or later it will reverse against eath as well uh and then ether probably go flat for a little bit uh go sideways sorry for a little bit and we'll have dpi kind of catch up here so it's a good measure i guess of the overall d5 market through usd but also kind of how bullish d5 is against itself yeah totally and i've been watching this downtrend versus eth ever ever since march so dpi has been uh trending downwards either since the very beginning of march where it hit the high of 0.28 ether per dpi and now it's gone all the way down to just over point 0.2 one um and i've been using this as an indicator of like exactly what you said defy season which i which is a good point and that's something that we have not yet brought on as a topic on the uh then bank this weekly roll up is the differentiation between defy season and altcoin season and what we're seeing what i'm seeing out of altcoin season is basically rotating into things that i consider the worst worst aspects of crypto things like ada ltc uh dentacoin uh and i'm very happy to finally be being able to like differentiate between what is alt season versus what is quality capital asset tokens season i'm glad we have a differentiator there yeah exactly and i and i think the reason why it works in cycles is because people tend to rotate money around so you'll see that the money rotate from bitcoin down to the others um you know and eighth down to to other things like d5 that's why i'm saying when a finishes its run and starts going sideways for a bit i think we can really see a default season there because a lot of the kind of like eighth natives and eighth people would rather go into dfi and they don't they're not going to buy all this other stuff that's kind of going up right now people who are buying like ave and uni and and wi-fi are not buying dentacoin those are different cohorts of people uh related to uh dpi is the index co-op something i want to bring up here is uh index co-op 150 million dollar tvl total value locked under dpi uh anthony what does this mean i mean it just shows the the pure demand here for the d5 pulse index i think you know index products typically haven't been super popular within d5 because of the fact that everyone you know i guess like likes to just buy into whatever they they um kind of can find and try and like get like a 10x or something because you know the dpi isn't going to give you a 10x in a month right maybe over the long term it'll it'll kind of give you that because it's supposed to be volatility dampened but the fact that we've still got 150 million tbl here from mostly what i would say like the d5 native crowd because it's not on um kind of like any major centralized exchanges yet i think that just speaks to the demand for this product and i think to get to like one billion plus kind of tvl without a kind of like major price rise in d5 would require some some fresh blood from these centralized exchanges because i think the the audience is very different there so i'm hoping you know the index co-op and i know they're working on this can get the dpi onto some exchanges like coinbase or something like that where we can kind of like open this up to to a more i guess like retail non-defy crowd and give them exposure to d5 as well at the end of the day absolutely yeah basically what a 150 million dollar market cap means is there's been a 150 million dollars worth of buying demand on the dpi asset right when you go to uniswap and you type in dpi and you purchase it you are increasing the price of dpi which means that the way that that gets arbitraged is that more assets come under the uh the dpi index right and what's pretty cool to me is uh lemonade alpha he's a part of the index co-op uh community the co-op perhaps uh and he's doing the math of the streaming fees that comes out of dpi and that's one million dollars in annual revenue for the indo index co-op treasury pretty cool uh we will be talking more about the index co-op throughout this weekly rollup uh last subject in the market section uh david mihal who's been an absolute machine in generating these really easy really digestible websites has made another one uh he's the one that made the crypto fees website that ryan and i talk about all the time and now he has made a open orgs.info open orgs.info which is uh he has his tagline daos are the new companies what's on their balance sheet and this is something that we've been uh saying on the bankless program over and over and over again dows have money and they want you to go and produce labor for the daos to produce something that the protocol wants uh uniswap sponsored a bank list literally the sponsor the call to action at the end of the bankless unit swap sponsorship is go submit an application go get a grant from uniswap all of these treasuries have a bunch of money that they want to pay you anthony what's your take here yeah i mean just looking at these numbers is crazy right and actually if you look at something like uni swap that's just the vested amount so unisoft has investing on their treasury over i think three or four years and if you take like the fully diluted value i think it's like 15 billion plus so they already have 5.2 billion invested here which as you said yes they can invest in like a bunch of different things out of the treasury they're already doing so you know we make our way down the list and it's just absolutely insane to see how big some of these treasuries are um and as i said some of them are besting the index cop is the same it invests over three years um and so you know the total vested amount is 52 million right now which i think is really cool because this i mean speaking of like the index card i know we're going to talk more about it but you know that treasury also goes to paying people to to work for the protocol essentially to paying contributors in index tokens um so i think a bunch of these other kind of dowels are doing that as well and that's the real power i think of this is not maybe not so much like investing in like ecosystem stuff but like giving actual kind of uh monetary value in the form of this token to people doing work for for the organization which truly does make it an open org or a doubt right um you know or or a do maybe not as autonomous as we would like it to be but a decentralized organization where anyone can come in contribute work and get paid in these tokens which i think is the really really cool aspect of these treasuries right we we are we know the web 2 gargantuans in facebook and google and all and all those people uh if you want to get a hint at what the web 3 gargantuans might look like go look at the size of these treasuries speaking of that uniswap ad we need to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get unit swap to be a sponsor for bank list and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless metamask is your go-to wallet for the bankless journey if you're going bankless you need metamask period browser and mobile get them both this is your tool to unlock the world of defy here's my favorite part now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe this has got to be the easiest way to trade ethereum tokens choose a token you own a token to exchange it with get your quotes if you like what you see you hit swap that's it what makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes it compares dexes aggregators and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fees and the least slippage this means you can swap a wider range of tokens and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity you don't even have to think about it try it out download metamask for desktop or mobile now at metamask.io and start swapping all right guys and we are back with releases the first thing that both i'm pretty sure anthony and i are excited about is our good friend dc investors released his new um his new newsletter the catalyst dc is really big in the world of nfts and overall in d5 we had him on the bank list podcast with anthony and eric connor for the bulk case for ethereum fantastic podcast go ahead and go listen to that um but also dc is releasing uh his new newsletter the catalyst uh and so if you want to follow dc's thoughts go and give that newsletter a follow anthony have you followed the catalyst yet oh of course i have i mean dc investor has uh been writing things for a long time actually he uh he used to be very active on red it still is active on there but you know pre-twitter days uh was much more active and he wrote a lot on there and i used to read a lot of it and it's funny because like when you read something on reddit you never kind of i i guess uh uh look at the i mean sometimes you look at who's saying it but you know a lot of the time you miss it i don't know if maybe that's just me but then i went back and i saw oh my god like all these amazing things that i used to read were from dc investor so yeah definitely go subscribe to this um it's not like a daily thing or anything like that i think it's a it's just whenever he feels like riding something thing which i think is it works really well i mean his first piece was on kind of like um what i guess like uh what what what the ecosystem looks like as part of i guess like a multi-chain future and like you know what what it takes to get there sort of thing and how that's how he thinks that's going to play out so yeah if you're interested in in just random thoughts i don't think it's just going to be nft i think it's just going to be anything that's on his mind um you know when he wants to write about it then definitely go give this a subscribe awesome all right on to the next uh there is a new protocol getting released uh what is this called this is called uh cryptex cryptex finance and they are doing a a synthetic asset a collateralized synthetic asset that is tracking the value of the total market cap of all of crypto and the the actual the interesting thing about this is not only is that is that synthetic asset really really cool but the the team behind this i think is also worth noting about um but we will get into that team later the cryptex system uses uh chain link oracles to uh get an aggregate of uh five different total crypto market cap uh prices or valuations so like the total crypto market cap from coin market cap from coin gecko uh these people have apis and they are reporting the total value of all crypto assets combined and the cryptex cryptex dot finance protocol which has its own governance token already uh is uh trying to generate a synthetic asset that's collateralized by uh by dye and ether and other erc20 tokens to produce this new synthetic asset anthony what can you tell us about this yeah i mean i saw this last night just before i kind of went to bed here um and it reminded me of like i guess what's happening with the index co-op of course like just the index product and things like that but it's good to see kind of like teams uh tackling i guess like a uh i mean i wouldn't call it like super different but like something something that's very unique like the total crypto cup is obviously something that a lot of people uh will um will quote right a lot of the time they'll they'll talk about it they're like oh yeah just got the two trillion dollars like look at the growth of crypto and there was no real way to track it that i know of before and now you can just buy this synthetic token and you can track uh you know you can basically track the entire growth of the crypto ecosystem so if you if you just want like a really safe token because realistically this is not going to increase like a tiny value over time right because you know the mark total market cap's already at 2 trillion if we go to like 10 trillion you get an 80 kind of gain there but if you if you think about it right that is like an 80 like to get to 10 trillion from here is going to take a while i think and an 80 gaining crypto is is just like very very kind of like small um so it's literally i think a very uh safe asset so if you just want really safe exposure you think crypto in general is going to grow and you think it's going to become like a really big asset class bigger than what it is now i think this is the product for you so really great product for that i mean i mean i could see it being part of anyone's portfolio if you just want something that dampens the volatility in your portfolio uh and still gives you kind of like that exposure to to the growth of crypto then this is definitely something that i think people should take a look at yeah if this asset was created a year ago in january 2020 it would have been i'm going to make up some numbers but the accuracy will still be there it would have been 20 and then today if that that twenty dollars would have turned into two hundred dollars uh so a 10x over um just a little over a year uh yeah again and uh kind of like how i said at the beginning the the interesting uh team uh thing about this to me is the team uh preston van loon is one of the the leads behind a prismatic labs uh and there are some other like core ethereum ethereum blockchain developers on this team uh anthony what do you have any comments on that yeah for sure and actually i just i did some head mats sorry i want to correct what i said it's not an 80 game from 2 trillion to 10 trillion it's like a 5x i was working i was working the universe saying like if it was 10 trillion to two it would go and minus 80 so still very very good like very good exposure there but yeah anyway no that's what caught my eye as well i was like you know preston van loon has been heavily involved with the eth2 effort for quite a while now um you know one of my favorite people in the space of course i'm working on kind of like ethereum protocol work uh but yeah i mean that's what i always look at i guess in general um for these new projects is like who are the people behind it now i know there are a lot of good projects right now that have anonymous um or at least pseudonymous developers behind them but they usually come with a name as well i know for example you know alchemix has stupid triples who's been around for quite a while yeah exactly so i mean it's not like someone just came out and created a protocol and then you know they're just totally anonymous which is obviously like a quote-unquote rug pull risk so yeah always looking at the team looking at kind of what they've done in the past um and kind of like you know where their kind of head is i think in this space that's what something i remember back in 2017 that was always like chanted on the on the reddits and on on twitter saying like hey if you're trying to evaluate a project go look at the team and me as a crypto noob i'd be like okay i looked at the team like i still don't know anyone and like the only reason why i'm able to do this now is because i've been in in this space for three years i know who these people are and that's the difference between maybe people coming in on their first cycle versus maybe their second cycle is like oh you understand and know people that have stills that have stuck around because the people that stick through the bear markets are people who you know are convicted and have the right beliefs about this place and and that's why i feel good about about scooby triples like he's anonymous but he's been around like he's not totally anonymous he's more pseudo-anonymous like he has a brand he has an identity uh and and uh people like preston van loon have uh uh have all that same thing but he's actually not anonymous and so that's definitely some of the benefits of being in this space a longer time you start to pick up on names and people and it's easier to evaluate things yeah exactly all right moving on to uh dydx on layer two we uh we did a state of the nation with both dydx and uh star starkware about this for so for those that missed that state of the nation go back and tune into that it was really fantastic um but layer two is actually starting to get deployed something that has always been a theme lately on the bankless program is like oh we are one to three months away from this scaling protocol coming like nope this one is here you can actually go trade on layer two with dydx right now and escape all of the gas fees of ethereum and only pay a small trading fee that you are used to paying when you trade on normal brokerages uh anthony are you stoked for this or what oh dude like this is just like some of the most bullish news i mean the i think the most exciting thing was that they went from like an alpha uh to like an open public kind of layer two in a matter of weeks right didn't have to wait very long at all and you know it's a full kind of suite built on starquest technology which is some of the best in the industry for layer two scaling they're already doing uh i saw uh one of the stock uh co-founders say that within the first 24 hours they already did 10 million dollars of volume which is crazy right because you know you think about people still have to on board into onto this kind of stuff right they stop to get their assets on this stuff to kind of like learn about it and do some trading or whatever so and it becomes like a compounding or an exponential growth after that so i do think that we're going to see some some incredible growth here rather quickly um because i mean something like dydx didn't even really work on layer one because it was an order book based exchange right on the on layer one those things don't really work we had the amms kind of explode in usage because they work much better now and and this is what layer two enables not just the fact that we can get like cheaper uh well much cheaper fees and faster transactions but we can also actually use a product like this now and grow it to rival the centralized incumbents which is what excites me the most 100 all right anthony i said we were going to talk about index stuff further on in the show and here's where we talk about that something new out of the index team is the metaverse index from the index co-op uh anthony what can you tell us about the metaverse index yeah so this has been in the works for quite quite a while now something that the community was very excited about it basically came from the community uh the index club community came up with this idea that the metaverse or this kind of concept of virtual worlds um you know with within like a digital asset space like nfts you know um collectibles uh you know uh in-game uh items and stuff like that you know the the the community kind of came together and said well you know we should create an index for this like this is a huge theme right now people want exposure to this but there's so many tokens they just don't know which one to buy and they don't know what's going to be around in the future of course or kind of obviously no one knows what's going to go up in value or not so this basically uh metaverse index takes 15 uh different tokens and there'll be more added in the future but 15 different tokens in the metaverse kind of ecosystem and just puts them into an index and you can just buy this and and just it's the same as like the dpi automated kind of um you know uh rebalancing once a month uh you know automated performance you don't have to do anything you can just buy and sell it uh and yeah i mean i'm super excited for this and fun fact the logo was also designed as part of like a competition as well so we did an open competition where people could design different logos and there were a lot of really cool ones um but this one kind of won out and i actually really like this one it kind of i think captures it quite well um this new kind of like virtual world that you can kind of go into um and yeah i mean i i just think in general like i'm biased here but the index cop is so great because of the fact that they work together and they're very cohesive and they can bring these products that are now at a 2.5 million dollar market cap to life relatively quickly uh and that's that's already streaming uh revenue to the index club treasury as well so it's just it's just been great to see this evolve and kind of go live and the index co-op releases aren't stopping this is actually something that we are doing here at bankless with index co-op uh the bed index the bitcoin ether dpi uh it's going to be a great meme get ready to hear a bunch about it on a bet on on bank list right get ready to get in bed with bankless uh ryan and i think that this is a great index uh just for really covering all your bases you know bitcoin how can you argue with bitcoin ether how can you argue with ether and then dpi is ethereum's app layer and it's kind of been the bankless thesis is basically this is basically all of what crypto has to offer uh and so if you just want passive like no thought exposure to the cryptocurrency industry i we think the bed index uh will be a great index to have and it is going into a a governance decision for the index co-op it doesn't yet exist we want it to exist if you are an index holder and you think that this index should exist go vote for it and that's that's the purpose of the index token is it's a governance token so if you think the the bad index should be a thing go ahead and vote for it i think the cool thing about um what we could do with the bed index is uh not just have ether just dormant ether but have uh staked ether um the the concept of uh r eth from rocket pool comes to mind whereas ether that is is kind of like um these the it's got the passive income of staked ether baked into it and then there's also other things that we could do with the dpi like there's other like with the ave token which is a pretty decent amount of the tokens inside of ave uh you can actually stake stake those ave tokens into the ave protocol for four percent and so the the uh the social contract that we are trying to make happen with the bed index is making sure that the bed is uh as trust free and attuned to the principles of ethereum and decentralization yet is also being highly productive at the same time so that's the goals of the bed index also not the only index being added to a governance vote in the index co-op synthetics debt mirror index it's also up for governance vote uh the index team really making just churning out new indexes uh nice job guys yeah i mean this is this is great i mean i i've been following this stuff in the in the forum and on the discord and definitely trying to churn out products you know much quicker here and not just any kind of products products that people actually want so i definitely agree with you that the bed index is going to be super popular you know especially uh as as a bank list you'll have like an audience to basically you know get on board with that get them kind of like get them into bed you know yeah exactly get them into bed that's right uh and then the debt mirror index is also a one that i'm really excited about because it basically protects snx stakers um from this kind of volatility that they find themselves in within the debt pool um so it essentially allows you to kind of dampen that volatility there so both of these products i think are going to be absolutely massive so i'm very excited to see them see them go live all right we talked about scoopy triples the reason why i say that name is because it's so fun to say but uh scoopy triples founder of alcomix is now proposing alchemix dao uh anthony i actually don't know too much about this and i know you talked about it on the daily way uh and maybe you could give us a little prelude of what is in here what's what's the alchemics dow what's the goal of that yeah so i i guess like this post just details what they want the the alchemic style to be and what they want it to look like and kind of like their commitments and their vision and mission sort of thing as well so the alchemics down i mean it's going to be very similar to other dows within the ecosystem you know as as we showed before um there's a alchemix has a lot of um a lot of uh money in their treasury already right you can see that yeah almost a billion right so you know it's definitely um time for them or almost time for them to to just transform themselves into a dow they have a very strong community already i mean i i i like the discord they're just they're just doing so many things on there it's really cool to see but the dow will obviously include governance so token holders will be able to um to vote on different things and vote on different kind of like parameter changes and stuff like that um it'll obviously um accrue revenue as well um from from the product so token holders will have a have a claim on that revenue uh they did tease in the post more stuff about you know if you're an alcoholics token holder there's actually more coming for you so more bonuses sort of thing and i think they're going to work with other protocols to kind of i guess maybe uh come up with like some sorts of revenue for alchemics token holders or other other sorts of things there and then what they also did in this process they spoke briefly about their layer 2 plans and you know what i really like is that there's a quote here um somewhere where they basically said you know they are there it's it's yeah it's they say by harnessing uh sorry uh uh where is it while layer two solutions come in several shapes we can't arbitrarily pick any layer two because we have zero knowledge about which solution will emerge as the winner but we're optimistic that dabs converge on one during the development of alchemics dialysis there's like three puns in there um but basically and then they go on to say by harnessing the throughput of layer two solutions alca mix that will be inclusive of all ethereums without sacrificing our ethos of decentralization first so they are extremely ethereum ethereum aligned uh and obviously really want to stay true to ethereum's ideals and that's i mean that's a major reason uh why i've backed alchemix and why i hold lkx tokens is because i know that they like this and the project itself is very sound so any teams that are just like super ethereum align like this is something that i want to be involved in but yeah this post got me really bullish because they already kind of know what they want to do i mean they're already one of the top d5 protocols and for them to kind of go launch this down and give token holders a claim on the revenues is going to be really really awesome i think yeah i i guess i should disclaim that i also hold alchemix tokens and so i'm biased as to perhaps the agenda putting the agenda agenda together but i have been chanting this this same um drum over and over and over again is like uh protocols that actually put collect fees which there are many protocols that do not collect fees for the token holders i think are setting a new paradigm quote unquote new paradigm um for what could be and one of my biggest criticisms of the equity stock market is that you know it's it's it's just it seems to be a game of greater fools because there's no meaningful difference if the equity isn't paying fees then you're just trying to sell that equity to the somebody who can pay for it at a higher point in time i'm hopeful that tokens on ethereum will not fall into that same trap and will instead be evaluated by the actual fees they are collecting to their protocols um there's also a second alchemix update which is their transmuter which is one of the core contracts that makes the alchemic system work got an upgrade it took a number of hours for this upgrade to complete um but the and the transmuter is how alchemics uh turns um it turns a l a a oh boy al usd which is their synthetic usd token into or excuse me it turns die into lusd so that the loans can automatically be repaid and that is basically what the alchemic system does it is a you deposit your money and you get a loan based on the future yield of your of your deposits and it does that by depositing dye into urine and so it's also very integrative uh anthony what can you tell us about this uh transmuter v 1.1 migration yeah i mean this is a pretty big upgrade here i think if you scroll down to the second tweet they explained that the transmuter and probably grown since since here uh now holds over 200 million die which is as you said deployed to your own financial and the effective yield on that at the time was 37 on your diet deposits and you put it well what they do is they basically pay your loans automatically for you so i mean this this kind of like i mean it's funny because when you think about it this is something that naturally lends itself to define and is very programmatic right we can do this in smart contracts but when you really grasp what's happening here will you get a loan against your stable coins so you know there's no risk of kind of liquidation here because of the fact that it's a stable coin kind of loan um and then you're paying back the debt so over time essentially your loan is being paid back by the yield generated on your principal i mean when you really grasp that concept i know it's been funny because like i think it's mind-blowing but i've been seeing a bunch of like traditional finance folks kind of attack this and say that this is like a ponzi or a scam but it's not like all of it is accounted for all of the the money is accounted for the yield is coming from a yearn vault which is doing you know a bunch of different things to generate that yield but it's all real it's not like we're printing money out of thin air like if there is no real dollars to come in and back this up or if there's no kind of i guess like you know uh demand for for borrowing assets or for like um buying the the the tokens that are being paid out sometimes then that it's just not gonna work right so i think a lot of people fail to grasp the fact that there is a lot of um it's all backed by real assets at the end of the day and real demand so yeah once i really wrap my head around alchemics the first time i was like holy  this is gonna be huge yeah every time i think of a loans that automatically pay themselves back i'm like oh those poor students with all those student loans out there they would really they'd look sure would love to have that um but there's a difference between uncollateralized loans and and credit loans so that is a categorical real difference anyways moving on some drama that happened in the last week i guess we'll actually get to the drama second but uh fey labs released the uh the fey uh stablecoin which is an algorithmic stablecoin uh which is kind of a new frontier in the world of defy innovation a lot of teams are trying to tackle the uncollateralized uh algorithmic stable coin and there's a spectrum of to what degree that the collateral is or isn't there um and this one uh had this kickstart like a genesis event where people could come and put their ether into a contract and they would be minted these new face stable coins and that ether would then represent the liquidity that backstopped uh at backstop the fae token so i guess it was to to some degree uh collateralized and then the the incentive behind this is that you could also be able to access the tribe governance token everyone likes governance tokens and so because this was like kind of an open release and you know permissionless and what ethereum is really really good at is capital capital formation a lot of money got allocated into this uh into this tribe contract and i i in my opinion it's things started to break down or have been breaking down um but not not completely i would say i would just say that it didn't it wasn't the smoothest start because people's expectations were so high people got this release and was like oh i'm just going to ape into this because it's a brand new governance token i'm forgetting that when everyone else also apes into it that like this perhaps is getting a little bit out over the ski tips anthony i know you're a little bit closer to the system than i am did i explain that okay yeah you did you did and you know i i think i should say that i'm a small seed investor in in faye protocol so just to get that out of the ways of disclosure but i mean yeah this was like the talk of crypto twitter for the last week or so like so many people were kind of i guess like hating on it because the sale didn't go exactly um you know as planned and for those who don't know the trdi is basically the sale finished and then the fey peg was uh was not at a dollar so basically immediately fell below peg it hung around the 95 cent mark for quite a while but the kicker here is that people wanted to sell their faye to get their eighth back right because they were just going into to get the tribe governance token but the way faye works is that the further away from the peg that it is there's this thing called uh direct incentives and what that means is that you're penalized um exponentially uh uh by by selling fei here so yeah you can see here for a band tag put out a chart that basically says if the fay price i mean as a simple example here if the pay price is 95 cents you you couldn't sell faye and only take a five cent kind of haircut here you would be taking an additional 30 haircut because the protocol would burn 30 percent of your fae before giving you the eth for it and this is a mechanism that is supposed to discourage selling when phase under peg but this only works if there's demand for fate now because phase of stablecoin is brand new it is not integrated into pretty much any d5 apps it is not um you know it is not something that people want to hold or that there's demand for and naturally there was just this absolutely massive kind of um cell pressure which kept pushing the peg down and now eventually the fae team turned off the the burn mechanism so that people could exit but the but the coin is still off peg like phase at like what 70 cents now or something like that so people are still taking this massive haircut but you can see like how rapidly it drops from like the 90s to the 70s when when the when the when the um i guess like the burn mechanism was turned off because people just want their eighth back you know it's running up as well right like you're probably like yourself okay well i'll take this 30 um haircut on eighth but like i'll make it back because it's going to go up or you know or something like that i'd rather hold my eight than than faye but you know from that point of view and as i said i am i am uh kind of biased here because i'm a small seed investor i don't think this is like the death for faye or anything i actually just think that the fact that there was just too much supply and like basically zero demand for the token is the reason why i ended up in this situation but i do think the mechanism can work you know in the right conditions given that there is not like this massive over overhang of supply so i think that's what the team is trying to do now is basically get to a point where supply and demand reach an equilibrium fae gets back to peg uh and then all this kind of uh i guess well and good there but yeah very interesting kind of thing to follow along with and you know at one point with the burn mechanism was on and the penalty got to 100 so if you sold your faye you would be left with zero you wouldn't get any it would just burn all of your faith so obviously they had to turn it off at that stage and kind of go back to the drawing board and see what they can do here the nature of uncollateralized table coins is inherently a balancing act and that that balancing point is always at the most chaotic point right at genesis especially when you know in when there's a contract a brand new contract which you get this brand new governance token it incentivizes ape culture this is what ape culture is people just ape in and people that are aping in to like way too much eat because like how much eat was it it was like 670 639 000 ether not dollars either and people were looking to make a quick buck and algorithic algorithmic stable coins probably not the best place to make a quick buck uh this is a long-term game that like to to what you say the mechanisms probably sound over time people that are just having short time horizons just kind of need to get washed out so the people with the longer time horizons can stay and they're the people that's really going to to balance the fa the fake price uh how do you feel about that take yeah i i think so and it's funny because like um it really is what you said like ape culture where people didn't read how this worked because if you knew how it worked you wouldn't have appeared in like this because i i didn't like i saw it and i had people asking me they're like you know should i go in i'm like you know i i obviously i i can't really say much because of my biases and kind of like my conflicts of interest here but i said to all of them like do your own research just read up on what this is before you put your money into it um because yeah i mean this is exactly what happened and you know i wouldn't say that i thought this was going to happen you know to this extent or anything like that i mean i didn't expect there to be over 600 thousand eight going into this sale but people thought that they could put their ether in right uh and then get this tribe token for free and then also get their eighth back out by selling faye and that's not what happened so now there's a lot of trapped ethio which i don't know you know maybe that's bullies short term for the price you know there's a lot of eighth taken out of circulation effectively here um but yeah i mean it's it's definitely uh basically ape culture and it's also scary because it kind of like shows that we're in like such a frothy market right now like extremely frothy and it kind of gets like you know how long can that go on for maybe it can go on for a while i don't know um but yeah it's still the fey protocol now has still almost a billion dollars to play with um as part of one of its mechanisms called protocol controlled value as you can see here so now what it can do is it can basically keep um re-weighting itself to get fade back to peg until eventually all the sellers are kind of exhausted they're out and then the eighth left is basically just people who want to stay in and and support the project and be part of the i guess faye pool yeah to put this into perspective 640 000 ether there's roughly 115 million ether and total total supply and 640 000 of that which is over one point billion dollar 1.3 billion dollars got deposited into this contract so obviously like for something at genesis like that's a big big mountain of capital to have to try and balance at genesis um anyway and you know what you know what's funny um thinking back to the last kind of um project that got such a big kind of amount of money in it so fast was maybe the the dow um and at the time it wasn't 1.3 billion dollars it was more east i think it was like 20 million each but because eth was only worth like 10 it was much less on a dollar value um but it's just funny to see now like how people just still do this right you know the contract here could have just easily has been as damaging as the dow there could have been a critical bug in it right um where you know this could have gotten drained so imagine if we saw like the dow 2.0 uh you know in 2021 that would have been a very interesting to see right right we probably wouldn't have gotten rolled back that's for sure we probably wouldn't know that the way that it was yeah exactly and there's no way it would have gotten rolled back all right so polygon continues to make a ton of integrations uh and this one's a little bit different actually polygon and connext partner to build the multi-chain future uh connext we recently did a meet the nation with uh connects uh very founder i think co-founder arjun bhuptani and he took us through the history of connects and connects has really been pioneering the world of state channels which is one of the earliest primitives for scaling ethereum and state channels is just basically like a bar tab right where anthony's the bartender i'm the the the beer drinker and i come and i give him my credit card and then we make seven transactions because i bought seven beers uh and then we close out the transaction at the end of the day and that's one transaction that settles on the visa network state channels are the same concept you know up you know effectively infinite levels of transactions between two parties and then they settle on the main chain after that uh connext is has really pivoted into uh something new which is state channels across l2s and that's where the this relationship between polygon and conex comes in where connext is uh helping bridge assets and liquidity across various l2s and polygon as one of the most in recently integrated uh l2 network you can't even go a week without seeing somebody integrate with polygon now k'nex is working with polygon to get uh assets and liquidity moving from l2 to l2 and even chain to chain uh using the connect state channels and anthony anything anything to add here yeah the disclosure i'm an advisor to polygon quickly there but essentially this is really cool to see i mean as you said this is kind of like bridging different l2s different kind of chains together and connects is basically at the heart of that because they've been working on this for quite a while now this is i think uh a critical issue not a critical issue but like a big issue that is going to get solved by connex is that we have these l2's all spinning up but a lot of them are siloed right now so how do we connect them right and i think you know connects is similar to other projects that out there like i guess thought chain and things like that they want to do this cross-chain kind of exchange and and stuff like that uh and that's what connex is doing here they're connecting polygon uh you know to i guess like if you're a mainnet to other l2s um and and it's doing it in a trustless way as well so the holy grail is creating like a bridge that is like fully trustless and um it's very hard to do a lot of the bridges typically these days are very very centralized they're not actually trustless um so if connects can nail this and then kind of scale it as well because i think scale is always the kicker here it's like you can nail it but like does it scale because if it doesn't scale it doesn't matter um so if they can do that then i think that's going to be a huge win for for them as a platform and a huge win for for the ecosystem because just having liquidity seamlessly go between l2s between side chains between chains is going to be a game changer i think absolutely all right we're going to burn through some of these because anthony and i like to talk but uh coinbase active users grew in 117 in q1 2020 2021 revenue topping 1.8 billion the reason why this is of course relevant is because coinbase releases recently released its s1 which disclosed basically all of the information about coinbase's internal books right because coinbase is going public in roughly two weeks uh and even less than that i think uh it's awake it's it yeah it's not even a week now it's like the 14th of april i think it's so close yeah i feel like people aren't talking about that enough uh some people are definitely talking about that but but not enough anthony any comments on coinbase public listing yeah i mean it's funny the fact that you know they obviously wanted to bring out their q1 earnings before the public listing was not an accident um because if you look at their their kind of results here it's absolutely you know phenomenal they have some of the most insane growth out of any company you would see like in terms of percentage growth uh this is just absolutely insane and because they're going to be listing on you know doing a direct listing there's going to be a ton of new kind of investors now that haven't touched crypto before that are going to be buying coinbase's stock and i saw one of the financial institutions basically re-rate coinbase's stock price up from i think it was like 190 to 440 so basically you know more than doubled it which means coinbase is going to open at a 200 billion plus market cap more likely and there's gonna be so much froth around this this is like if you think about it silicon valley based company right unicorn out the gate like massive unicorn like obviously like 200 extra unicorn in an extremely hyper growth industry being crypto you know the prospects here are just absolutely insane so this is going to be one of the biggest events for crypto ever i think in terms of like general awareness froth i mean you know it's going to affect the rest of the crypto market as well so trading this is going to be like pretty pretty volatile i think the markets are definitely going to be volatile around this event um but it's the first time a lot of uh i guess like people outside of crypto are going to get exposure to crypto because coinbase's revenues are directly tied to the performance of the crypto markets because it's all volume based the more trading volume the more fees that they make so if the crypto markets are quiet coinbase is quiet if the crypto markets are hot coinbase is hot so by buying coinbase's stock you are directly getting exposure to crypto um you know and the crypto markets and the crypto volatility there so yeah i mean i i can't see this being a small event that's for sure yeah absolutely absolutely not uh coinbase made 1.8 billion dollars in revenue meaning they were in profit in the quarter by uh somewhere between 700 and 800 million dollars uh and get a little bit of this this is absolutely crazy uh for all of 2020 total trading volume on coinbase was billion dollars and in q1 of 2021 only is was a total trading volume topped 335 billion let me repeat 193 billion dollars in revenue or in a trading volume all throughout all of 2020 and then in just q1 we are at 335 billion dollars uh that is crazy and i i don't think it matters what the valuation of coinbase is at day one everyone is buying that no matter what we are in a late stage credit cycle there's plenty of cash going around coinbase is the only asset on the stock market that gives you pure un exposure to crypto assets in general uh people are going to ape into coin no matter what and we have some uh some takes to talk about further on in the take section as well all right getting into ethereum news mark cuban says on on a on a public interview on his cryptocurrency portfolio i own a lot of ethereum because i think it's closeness closest to a true currency uh hot take from uh from our cuban one that i would agree with yeah very hot take and and you know obviously mark cuban's been very active within the i guess ethereum space you you guys have him on on bank list to talk a lot about like the nft stuff that he's been heavily involved with uh but yeah i think he just like he's he's like us right he he sees the utility of an asset to be uh the thing that gives it the most value and i think that i i totally agree with that right that's why i don't really hold any bitcoin is because i mean you can do stuff with your bitcoin on ethereum with kind of like i guess tokenized bitcoin but that didn't exist for a long time and also a lot of that is centralized so you know eth being such a productive asset and you can do so much with it i mean the nft economy is priced and eat all this kind of stuff happens you stay creative you put in d5 i think that's the the reason why you know mark cuban kind of likes it as well is that the utility value is just so much greater than than than bitcoin even though i think you showed it just before he owns more bitcoin than eight still but i think that's just pure on like a portfolio construction perspective where it's like a market cap weighted thing right but he's actually if he's doing it market cap weighted he's actually overweight eighth year yeah which is good which is very nice to see yeah wait not even so 60 bitcoin 30 ethereum and 10 the rest and i off the top of my head i don't know the valuations between bitcoin and ethereum but i think the ethereum is roughly one-tenth the size of bitcoin and mark cuban's portfolio has if ether uh weighted at one-half of his bitcoin allocations i think it's i think it's one one-fifth now actually um the size of bitcoin it's been gaining um uh but it's still it's still overweight he's still overweight yeah if you're doing a market cap weighted kind of index there and not only the big name to get interested into ethereum uh toby lutky i think is how you pronounce his last name the shopify ceo tweeted this out the other day hey defy twitter what are the comments commerce related opportunities that you are most excited about what role do you want shopify to play so shopify ceo getting his hands into the world of defy anthony what's your opinion there yeah i mean and this wasn't the only tweet that he put out he also put out another tweet i don't know if it came before or after this one where he basically said he was diving into ethereum smart contracts which was absolutely uh awesome to see i mean as you said shopify ceo right someone who uh has i guess other it is he put it out before um he was dabbling with eight smart contracts to understand how erc20s work i mean you know the given the fact that he's the shopify ceo you're probably gonna see maybe down the line some integrations direct integrations with kind of crypto here um and it's just i mean shopify is the biggest e-commerce platform in the world it is a huge company i'm pretty sure they're public and they're worth like uh billions and billions of dollars here um and obviously e-commerce just got like a massive boost in the last year because of the the pandemic so you know if he integrated uh some some kind of like ethereum sort of stuff within shopify that would be absolutely huge i think in terms of like integrations i mean and you know this just follows on from the visa news right where visa was just settling on ethereum imagine shopify doing settlements on ethereum and things like that i mean yeah i i just i saw this and i was like this is just crazy ethereum's going mainstream more more and more people are going to be aware of ethereum and everything that it can do and it's just yeah yeah i mean it's just really great to see and the the thing that comes to mind is that toby the ceo of shopify has 190 000 twitter followers which is very respectable but also what about all the other ceos who aren't on twitter like this guy just made a tweet because he's on twitter and he likes to use twitter obviously he has 100 almost 200 000 followers how many likes you know ceos of companies related companies are thinking about these same things and just don't really engage on twitter anthony and i are on twitter an unhealthy amount so of course we see this um what about all the things we aren't seeing what's below the scenes question mark all right moving on uh the um there is one week left to update your nodes for the ethereum berlin upgrade countdown you got one week to do that uh that is your psa if you run a node you got to update it anthony anything related to that you want to say just just update and if you're not running a node run a node absolutely all right moving on uh we we talked about this uh polygon is really just killing the game when it comes to l2 integrations here is a graph from the block tweeted out by kami kami russo of the defiant where this graph shows value locked of ethereum scaling solutions by type right many different uh scaling solutions there's plasma zk roll ups optimistic rollups validium plasma according to this graph is really outstripping the rest while the others have respectable growth plasma is really in the lead and all of that plasma value locked is basically just polygon it's just polygon uh anthony what can you say about why polygon has had out such outside success versus any of his other competitors yeah i mean and i think mihaylo one of the polygon kind of co-founders actually put a cl clarification here that the the tvl is split between polygon plasma and polygon pos chain so it's not just the plasma chain um but i mean there's a there's kind of difference of sienna and i'm actually having a debate with mahalo over this and definitions and stuff we're we're both trying to come to like an agreed upon definition of what counts as like a a layer 2 and like what that actually means so a lot of this stuff is actually quite murky right now but essentially the difference between these two technologies is that with polygon plasma you can go through the ethereum main chain to withdraw your funds for example because it's a plasma chain it it just it uses the ethereum network to to process deposits and withdrawals and things like that whereas the polygon pos chain which is sometimes called a side chain is using polygons own validators of which that you know they stake magic tokens and it's kind of like that there's slashing involved it's like a true proof of stake system and they also commit themselves to to ethereum as well so from that point of view there are there are differences there it's all about trust assumptions but the i i think you know that the tvl across both of them is huge right it's bigger than the other scalability solutions for ethereum right now but as you show you know uh zk roll up is gaining you know you can see it in the in the in the red or the kind of like reddish color there and that includes stuff like loop ring uh dydx it's going to include immutable x and things like that too optimistic roll ups right now is really just synthetics because they're the only app live on optimism right now on mainnet um and then is a is a form of kind of a zk roll up here as well but it's it's distinctly different so that's why it's kind of um i guess like plucked out of there and that's still very very very small right now but this is going to grow exponentially i reckon as we go progress further it's just going to get uh more and more kind of like i guess like tvl locked in these things all right last little bit of ethereum news a tweet out of justin drake says early polling suggests possible support for a 2021 minimum of viable merge target the merge comes after eip-1559 it's it's self-slated for the london hard fork in july or august uh and then he says minimum viable meaning no transfers no withdrawals no statelessness no major evm change and he posts a screenshot of uh an unknown telegram group where he asks the question it's a poll um safe minimum viable merge in 2021 it's possible let's die it's desirable let's ship it and then 86 percent of people agreed whoever whoever in this telegram group uh agreed with that statement i'm assuming this telegram group is a decent amount of like ethereum core devs uh anthony what does this mean yeah so what i guess like what minimum viable means here is as justin has described it it literally just means like the minimum viable kind of i guess like uh estate we can get to for the merger which essentially would be just the uh getting rid of work so essentially the eth1 chain will get off proof of work and be validated by proof of stake by the currently known e3 chain then post that like after that merger goes through you enable transfer so you can have like e2 transfers to e1 it's all one ethereum but you can have transfers from you know the stakers on that that are staking on the beacon chain right now to to kind of like eighth one there and withdrawals and things like that statelessness obviously is going to come later that's basically the stateless client effort um which people can kind of google and look up um and then you know no major evm changes so there would be no changes to on the eighth one side this would just be getting us to proof of stake and getting off proof of work which i think is the whole point i mean the major point of the merge at the end of the day because you know we want to get off of work as soon as possible and this you know for those who who are kind of like keeping score here this is a massive issuance reduction as well we go from a roughly four percent per year each issuance production under proof of work to uh 0.5 currently under proof of stake so this is bullish for both of those reasons getting rid of proof of work getting rid of miners and getting that issuance reduced by a large amount so very excited for this to me this is the emergence of sound money culture really coming up out of the ethereum community and saying hey like we know we had this plan but like we can make ether sound money ultrasound money sooner and so let's get that done and sound money culture in ethereum is alive and well and starting to actually manifest itself in governance decisions about the way that ethereum moves forward into the future um that's i think that's great i'm a big fan of sound money culture same side all right moving on to nft news uh leaving ethereum news on to nft news almost the same thing uh now just a subset of ethereum news ethereum startup immutable aims to cut nft costs with new layer l2 scaling protocol so immutable released immutable x which is an open platform to scale nft so disclaimer i'm a seed investor into immutable x so i guess we're just passing off passing out disclaimers back and forth um gazan change is a really fun trading card game out of the immutable team and it's very much like a combination of magic the gathering where you own physical cards and that's kind of like owning cash right you own the physical cards uh but it's also a combination of like blizzard uh hearthstone where you get this trading card game and you play you're playing online and you get all the benefits of a digital game but you don't actually get any of the benefits of owning the actual cards gauze unchained is the best of both worlds where you both own the assets and it's a digital game because they are nfts on ethereum the problem is that uh immutable with gauze and chain they were trying to make this marketplace for trading cards and the cards were sell for between one and five dollars yet the fees to trade these things were between five and thirty dollars so it really just hindered their ability to make the game that they wanted to want it to make and so what they did was they made immutable x which is an l2 scaling solution specifically engineered for nfts on top of starkware and so i think it's going to be really hot it's the combination of nfts and scale which both of those are hot and immutable x just getting released now anthony any takes here yeah i mean it's it's this is really cool to see uh this is built on on starquest technology uh you know this is going to solve a lot of the pain points of nfts i think especially for for god's unchained here um and you know this is an early release as well so the the what you can trade right now on there is uh one of the i guess like hard uh kind of card expansion packs they brought out called trial of the gods if you've maybe participated um in god's unchained as part of the genesis event with genesis cards those aren't available just yet to trade but there will be so still early days here but it is live and you know you can trade like lightning fast you know zero fees because they're uh they're kind of like there will be fees eventually but they'll be like very small but but immutable is kind of like paying those fees for for everyone right now so um yeah go check it out if you if you haven't yet i think it's gonna blow you away just how fast it is yeah and this is the future of scale on ethereum it's it's finally arriving same same platform that uh dydx we were talking about earlier it's darkware also powering immutablex so we're going to start to see announcements like these more and more and more in the other world of nft's super rare raises nine million dollars for to fund the future of art collecting for those that don't know super rare is an nft issuance platform kind of uh more specifically and uh focused on kind of fine art very not simply not open to everyone you can't actually just go there and just mint an nft they want to kind of curate it and they have raised nine million dollars in a seed round congrats to the guys at super rare i'm going to move right on anthony because we have we're going definitely going over time nine rare crypto punks from larva labs own uh for are now on christie's and so christie's is now has crypto punks it started with beeple and it's moved on to some other things and now we have crypto punks what a crazy story that we have crypto punks on christie's anthony what's your take here yeah i mean this just validates crypto pumps even more right like chris is is a huge auction house for for all sorts of art and things like that so you know and crypto punks have been uh obviously um in the in the scene for quite a while now but it's cool to see that you know this these these punks belong to uh lava labs uh sorry the creators of crypto punks so obviously they've come along and they're like okay well you know it you know we've got these punks and we want to do it in like a big way we want to sell them because obviously they want to be paid for their work because they're the original creators of it um and that they're going to auction it off here so i think this is going to get quite wild they haven't an alien um to kind of auction off here which is crazy because aliens are the rarest um crypto punks there's only nine of them so they have one here um which is which is absolutely insane and you know i actually saw as i kind of woke up today um that the crypto punks kind of flaw the floor price raised from like 32 000 to 41 000 because someone just came along and just bought them all up because this is going to bring so much fresh attention on to crypto punks um it's going to be insane i mean i i'm really bullish to see kind of like how uh how this goes on on christie's yeah i wish i had a dc investors tweet pulled up here where he uh polled uh people will we see crypto punks on christie's in 2021 and i think like 40 people 40 of people said no and dc was like you guys are all wrong and that was a number of months ago so tip of the hat to dc getting that right that's why we shield his uh his uh sub new step stack at the very beginning uh perhaps uh maybe getting overheated on the other side of things however is tom brady super bowl champion of many many times over again i'm not too much of a football fan uh is now launching an nft company uh anthony do you think the nft world is getting a little too hot i mean it is yeah pretty hot right it is um it is at a point where like most of the stuff in the nft world is not going to have secondary market value so if you're buying these things then you're going to have to pretty much come to terms with the fact that there's a high chance you're not going to get your money back it is not like a token where you can just dump it into uni swap and get something back if there's some liquidity nfts are very different in that you actually have to find a buyer if you buy a piece of artwork and you want to sell it right you have to go and find someone that wants to buy that off you can't just go to uni stop and dump it into a liquidity pool right you have to buy uh you have to find someone so from that point of view yes it's super super overheated um you know i don't i don't follow american football at all i know who tom brady is but i don't know how big of a star he is but this is just like you know people like to say just top signals but at the same time it might be adoption too like i know there's a lot of sports memorabilia so maybe they're just like taking the physical memorabilia and creating like nfts out of it which i think is fine and actually a natural fit so i wouldn't really maybe i wouldn't call it a top signal it's maybe just an adoption signal right i like to use that term these days yeah the the thing i would like to know is to what degree is tom brady the actual founder of this thing or what degree is this dress is he just a name and he probably bought an advisor so he's really i mean i would say he's just like yeah he just yeah yeah maybe that's what's going on here anyways in that case like the world of nft is like continuing to grow out at the very least uh another fun little story is the overly attached girlfriend meme uh this this is one of my favorite memes a number of years ago it's kind of phased out of popularity um but these old memes are going for insane values and so the actual over-attached girlfriend i don't know what her name is i just call her the over oh i guess her name is lyanna uh she sold this meme for 200 eth someone bought to uh this meme for 416 000 um damn that's pretty cool anthony any comments here yeah i mean it's funny to see like all of these kind of people who had memes created out that are created of them to come back and monetize it now right and i don't i blame them for at all for doing this the market is extremely hot why wouldn't you if i was a meme i mean i guess sometimes i'm a mean but if i was a meme as big as overly attached girlfriend i would definitely be monetizing it as well because you know i mean not only is she getting like money out of this but she's also staking her claim on this meme too like digital representation of her being like i am in this meme this is uh this is kind of like my original kind of um you know picture here and if you want to own uh this piece you can buy it off me essentially so i think from that point of view it makes sense but at the same time i mean i don't know if this is an adoption signal or a top signal this one stumps me like i don't know what i mean i wouldn't buy this meme for four hundred thousand dollars i wouldn't by any means 400 000 but i guess it's a percentage of your net worth so if you're really rich maybe 400 000 isn't much to you so you don't care so maybe it works like that for some people yeah to me the question mark that i have is like this this meme is definitely like retired it's a retired meme so like yeah that's still worth almost half a million dollars uh i i guess to someone it is like beauty is in the eye of the beholder synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quenta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since

weekly rollups the gbtc premium is under the actual assets that grayscale has in its uh in his treasury and it's and they are making this statement that they are committed to rolling gbtc in an etf into an etf which would actually just immediately nix that that uh the fact that gbtc is trading under the actual value under their assets the interesting part to me is that they made this infographic called life's life cycle of a grayscale product which is one launch private placement two obtain public quotation on secondary market which means like make this thing available three become sec reporting and then four convert it into an etf so is grayscale just turning into an etf churning machine question mark and they out they outline this for a number of their different products that they have where they are starting all of these new grayscale trusts the basic attention token trust the chain link trust the decentralized file coin live pier stellar lumens trust and then some of them have moved on into what they call public quotation this is where bitcoin cash is this is where litecoin is ethereum classic uh the digital large cap fund and then the sec reporting which is just bts gbtc and ethe the uh the grayscale bitcoin and grayscale ethereum trust and then they have this last panel which is unfilled but they're trying to get every single one of their products moved into this etf category uh probably starting with gptc and ethereum e not too far along after that so pretty interesting development out of the grayscale world and grayscale world anthony what's your take here yeah i mean i the atf's kind of like thing has been talked about for a while for bitcoin i would be very surprised if we don't get bitcoin etfs this year i mean look look at what's happening in terms of like i guess public companies putting bitcoin on their balance sheet coinbase now you know going going uh live like um going live on direct listing and things like that like traditional finance and the old world is merging with crypto and the etf is one of the biggest mergers that can happen the atf is an amazing product for a lot of people the uh you know the grayscaler products as they currently exist are not great a lot of the time because they either trade at a discount or at a premium to their net asset value whereas an etf it does not um uh and if it does it gets arbitraged away so it's very fair for people so yeah i mean i'm excited to see a bitcoin etf go live or multiple ones go live because then ether is next in line right neath is coming straight up after and it's not going to take you know years and years and years because ether already has futures on cme which is a prerequisite or or i mean i don't know if it's a hard prerequisite but it's definitely a spiritual one to getting um an etf so yeah i i i think there's going to be a handful of bitcoin etfs coming out there's not just going to be one and gpt i mean grayscale gbtc is definitely uh a top contender there totally all right anthony i'm about to burn through the rest of these so raise a hand if you want to lay a comment but i'm just going to go really fast through these grayscale or not scale micro strategy bought another 15 million dollars worth of bitcoin at an average price of 59 000 again they have this little graphic that they have been using and using and using and so this is just going to be again a reoccurring theme grace or my ricoh strategy is going to dollar cost average into bitcoin perpetually jp morgan adjusts its bitcoin price uh to a hundred and thirty thousand dollars i always think announcements of raising price targets is hilarious because targets are supposed to be met not raised but uh whatever uh so big institutions getting really bullish on bitcoin there is a class action lawsuit filed against uh ledger for their data breach which uh we talked about a a number of months ago there was a breach of the user's information and now there's a class action lawsuit against ledger also uh shopify for completely unrelated to crypto um but again a customer data breach as well and then lastly the uh ftx is officially becoming the uh the name of the miami uh miami heat i don't know a stadium in miami is now going to be called ftx arena again we talked about this a couple weeks ago uh but sam bankman freed literally just planting his name on an arena in america crypto's taking over the world in my opinion perhaps not the best move because it's you know sam bankman freed is not somebody that wants to have all that many headlines about him but i guess he doesn't really care about that let's get into some takes anthony i think this is gonna be where uh where you're gonna have a fun time here with the first three takes that we've got lined up are all about coinbase uh and so eric connor your good friend eric connor says don't buy the coinbase ipo after multiple insiders already got better pricing buy dpi instead anthony what's your take here yeah i mean if you do a relative kind of market cap basis between uh coinbase which might you know highly likely it'll open a 200 billion dollar cap and d5 there is a massive gap there and d5 you know unus is already doing more volume than coinbase on some days so and that's just one app right and then you've got the rest of the d5 ecosystem and obviously dpi tracks that so yeah i mean i i don't know maybe i take a position from eric is that like do do both but like weight more dpi maybe because that'll give you probably more more more growth prospects over the long term i think all right continuing the bashing of coinbase ipo or the listing which i don't intend to do but i thought this was a cool take too uh unit swap gave me 400 voting tokens valued at 12 000 coinbase gave my information to the irs i don't mean to be shooting on coinbase i just think it's a funny just a prediction yeah yeah it's a funny tweet i mean i really would like coinbase to airdrop their star uh they're kind of like uh equity or stock to people who use the platform um but i think there's a lot of regulatory kind of issues there and it'll be a nightmare for them i'm pretty sure they they probably can't thought about it and talked about it and probably thought uh we don't want the regulatory issues this is gonna cost us too much let's just uh let's punt on that yeah never never ever been done before however they do have kyc information of all u.s customers and if they are public they can give it away um the hurdles aren't all that high but i would imagine that there's a bunch i don't know about about how incredibly complex that would become all right last coinbase take uh ryan selkis says do you really want to sit on the sidelines in this dip when 1 000 coinbase millionaires are about to rotate out of stonk and into cryptos uh i thought that was pretty funny coinbase is going to be the one of the biggest ipos in history and there's going to be a lot of unlocked coinbase equity uh being accessible and turned into capital from people with coinbase equity and he said he he said ryan selkis founder of missouri says that this rotation out of coinbase donk into kryptos is going to be epic i think that's going to be a a good take good take yeah yeah i mean it remains to be seen how much will rotate into crypto but i think crypto covers stable coins now too so maybe people just go into stable coins and then yield farm with it that's to me the same stuff like that going to stable coins is fine i think sure yeah maybe it just adds a bunch of stable coin liquidity to d5 absolutely all right our first non non-uh non-coinbase take uh this came out uh not too long ago and i wanted to highlight this as a learning lesson for for just what it means to be in a bull market uh there was a a an announcement made that balancer would be integrating with el grand and helping add balancers at defy app to algorand and this turned out to be basically a fake announcement and fake announcements are a very strong symptom of a bull market announcements are just the blood of bull markets because people there's people are clamoring for attention so people will do what they want to do to get attention turns out this was not actually this didn't actually happened uh balancer just gave al grand a grant and not even to build balancer i'm not even sure why they gave them a grant and al and somebody at algrand turned this into a big hype story and so jeremy i'm not going to be able to pronounce his name last name sorry jeremy uh gave this uh tldr and a tweet thread that's saying it kind of broke down the story saying you know this this was a fake story that got turned into something that it wasn't and that's a lesson to be learned anthony any takes here yeah you mean you said it well it's partnership season as i like to call it where people just love to announce these things to pump up their token price you know i'm pretty sure the algorithm price would have probably gone up on this announcement right because balancer is a top defect protocol and people will be spinning the narrative that oh look top ethereum defrag protocols are migrating to you know this ethereum killer and look at the headline aims to be algorithms unisop like come on like this is just ridiculous um so yeah i mean yeah just hype and and this is how you get caught out as well like if something pumps on like news i've always seen like uh the short term it tends to just drop back down because it's not like real buyers it's just speculators being like i'm going to pump this up on this news and then i'm just going to dump it like uh you know in in a little while so yeah just be safe out there with these sorts of things be safe yeah and the last take actually comes from you but i i was the one that tweeted it uh ethereum's event horizon only grows larger and this is something that we talked about on our friday weekly live stream which by the way for those that haven't tuned into those so anthony and i do these every single friday except actually for this friday because i'll actually be gone uh but that's why we have anthony on the weekly rollups instead but anthony you said you said something about ethereum's event horizon could you explain that metaphor to the listeners yeah so essentially i can't remember exactly the context of what we were talking about but i think you know once you're like in the ethereum ecosystem it's just like very very hard to escape it right just like it's basically impossible to escape a black hole uh black holes event horizon um in space it's it's very hard to escape ethereum's pull on you like even if you're a fan of i guess like other chains and you want to spend time in other ecosystems ethereum is still going to kind of like uh draw you in right it's still going to keep you in its ecosystem no matter what because there's just so much opportunity to be had there's so much cool stuff going on you know it's very hard to not be involved and i would even go as far as to say that you know a lot of people who would then identify as bitcoin maximalists are using ethereum they're just not talking about it because if you if you want to make like even just make money right and and you have bitcoin the opportunity to make the most money right now is putting your bitcoin on ethereum and yield funding with it like you're not going to get that from the centralized kind of institutions like blockfly and stuff like that which you know bitcoin maximus also love but it doesn't matter so it doesn't matter who you are and you can do it all anonymously you don't have to tell anyone you spin up an ethereum address no one knows who you are right unless you kind of link it to something they could link it to you but most of the time it's it's very hard so from that perspective yeah ethereum just has this incredible pull on everyone in the ecosystem doesn't matter if they hate ethereum if they love other changes they think this their ethereum killer is gonna you know kill ethereum there's just too much opportunity in ethereum land and that that's what pulls people in i think yep absolutely all right we are now getting into what we are excited about again usually it's reserved for what's david and ryan's excited about but today we have anthony and so i'll start because i usually do start and what i'm excited about this week is um the perhaps the acceleration of the merge uh that is insane and i alluded to this when we were talking about the the justin drake tweet but the the what is happening in my mind is a bunch of ethereum developers and community members are planting a flag and they are saying yo it is time for sound money culture let's get sound money up and out the gate we have this proof of stake thing and it's ready to go let's use it let's prioritize it let's have some urgency and let's get this ultrasound meme actually into reality and the fact that this is manifesting in both the the values and prioritization of not just the community but the actual ethereum developers i think is really really cool and that gets me excited about the future of ethereum yeah yeah i mean i would i would definitely um you know mirror that as well but i would say that just to be a little bit different is that the thing that i am most excited about outside of that is uh the layer two adoption that's been happening lately and will continue to happen into the future i put a tweet out a few weeks ago and i still believe this is true today and i basically said uh layer two is here it's just not evenly distributed yet and what i meant by that is that all the technology is here right it is it is popping up in pockets in silos across the ecosystem but it's just not evenly distributed we don't have bridges right we don't have people adopting them just yet but that's going to come it's going to come in in waves essentially as the famous quote we are coming in waves right that's what's going to happen people are going to adopt it more and more people are going to are going to go to layer 2 um there's going to be bridges there's going to be more liquidity there's going to be more tbl and that's going to happen much faster than people think over the next few months i mean i use the kind of example that in may of 2020 unisop's 24-hour volume was 10 million dollars now it is consistently over one billion dollars a lot of the time or at least close to one billion dollars that's the same thing's gonna happen to layer two today it's 10 million like on dydx in a few months can be a billion right and it can probably grow even faster because of the fact that we already have a massive d5 user base right and then we already have a lot of new people coming into the ecosystem that may have been priced out of layer 1 that will now be able to experience ethereum d5 again at layer 2. so yeah that's what i'm super super excited about and i think that you know the merge is just as exciting just as critical but i think you know scaling i mean the merge is like a part of scaling where we want to get rid of like a proof of work go to people's mistake and then add sharding after the merge as well so the merge is like a a prerequisite to to sharding so uh which which obviously adds more scalability to ethereum so that's what i'm most excited about right now yeah the the list could go on we could talk about what we're excited about four hours and in fact we actually do on the friday uh daily gray bankless live streams again not happening tomorrow or i guess today when you are listening to this but literally happens every other friday that uh other than this one um so tune in to those when we do those are a ton of fun and well the other thing that i'm excited about is the meme of the week here it is uh the meme of the week from crypto wife who's had a number of other uh fantastic memes out uh just out of this twitter account a great her photoshop skills are absolutely insane she says guys i think we're ready ask me where we're going and it's vitalik tim bako and justin drake in astronaut suits ethereum themed astronaut suits and they look like that they are just ready to send it uh and that's the name of the week yeah yeah and then there's one five five nine in the background right little subtle um kind of uh a shield there i think but yeah crypto wife's just killing the meme game i absolutely love her meme so you know keep it up whoever you are for sure but yeah i love this one as well this is this is great all right guys congratula congratulations anthony we made it through the this marathon of the weekly rollup thank you for tapping in and being a great substitute teacher for ryan uh do you want to give yourself a little bit of

recaps of the of the ethereum ecosystem and then at ethub there's a weekly newsletter and weekly recaps with my co-founder eric connor uh and then yeah that's that's basically where i spend most of my time uh so yeah as you said like you probably troll through a lot of the things that i cover and everything like that i'm i try to stay like at the bleeding edge of stuff it's very hard these days because there's so much stuff happening but yeah that's the that's the self-shield for everyone fantastic and again thank you for being my news partner this week all right guys risks and disclaimers
