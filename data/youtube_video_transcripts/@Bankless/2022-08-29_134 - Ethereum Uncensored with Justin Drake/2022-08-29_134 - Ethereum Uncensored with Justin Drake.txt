ethereum in you know five to ten years will be close to Perfection um you know it will be futile to try and censor transactions because you just won't be successful welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys fantastic episode today timely episode uncensored ethereum the topic is censorship on ethereum is it possible we brought on Justin Drake who's one of ethereum's top researchers to answer this question in detail the question of how hard is it to actually censor ethereum a few benefits and takeaways for you today number one is ethereum really censorship resistant we asked Justin this question we find out where the weak points actually are number two how do we preserve censorship resistance in ethereum in the future Justin talks about the road map towards doing this he's bullish number three weak censorship versus strong censorship this is an essential mental model that Justin gives us for trying to understand censorship on ethereum and how it can occur and number four how the community can censor the sensors this is the nuclear option we talk about a social Fork near the end and what this would mean and how it would play out and the Dynamics behind it uh David this was a fantastic episode not the first time we've had Justin Drake on of course uh he was on for our ultrasound money episodes um Moon math cryptography there's a lot of other episodes we'll include in the in the show note details but uh I don't know this is one of my favorite Brits I guess uh you know because we get into a topic that we haven't really explored and it is actually linked to the sound money topic ultrasound money topic because ultrasound money does rest on ethereum being censorship resistant we talk about that too what were your thoughts yeah of course good money requires you know censorship resistance you can't have money being a system that only works for some people you have to have money that works for all people uh and that also goes with a very good Financial system so you know there are these core properties of what makes good money and good finance and of at the start of those of a long list of properties that makes up these things become censorship resistance so in order to have ultrasound money you must have Ultra censorship resistant ethereum uh and so that's really the topic of today's show with Justin and every time we have Justin on it we get down to what really feels like the basement of crypto economics or crypto Primitives and so it's why everyone feels so educated when they come out of a Justin Drake podcast is Professor Drake Professor Drake yeah we really get down to the bottom of things and we do it in a very thorough way these are long episodes because we cover absolutely everything uh and so I feel very educated coming out of this I'm reading this book Ryan called the the code book and it's just a history of ciphers and and cryptography before before cryptography was really about just like codes and it talks about this Armor's race between code Breakers and code writers and inevitably the pendulum generally shifts towards the Defenders as in the code writers and this is what cryptography has really instantiated ever since we like invented it in the 60s and 70s is that the power always shifts to The Defenders it's just a matter of can the Defenders come up with the mechanisms to keep themselves in power and with blockchains and public key cryptography we have these tools to put so much power in the hand of the Defenders and what that means is the individual the people who are trying to remain censorship resistant and free from oppression and so this is a line that Justin uses in the podcast is that we have the the core Primitives to always put Power in the hand of the Defenders and it's just about getting that power to everyone uh and so this is a podcast that explores how we enable everyone in the world to become censorship resistant in money and finance so listen to this episode with Professor Drake and you tell us do you think ethereum can maintain its censorship resistance over the decades to come of course premium subscribers if you are a bankless premium subscriber make sure you stick around after the show for the debrief that's David and I's opportunity to talk about the show that was it's our raw unfiltered thoughts to the bankless nation we've got some thoughts on this episode it was technically a very difficult episode to do if you were not a bankless premium member go click that link and upgrade and you can get access to that podcast as well well let's get right into it with Justin but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible lens protocol is an open source Tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps Bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media rocketpool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eth with rocket pool and get reth in return allowing you to stake your ease and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by taking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a note rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating notes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16eath to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking Commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if your bullish is staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pole community in their Discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so I'll see you there Armstrong is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely

are super excited to be joined once again by Justin Drake he is a researcher at the ethereum foundation you might know him as the guy who originally explained ultrasound money to all of us legendary episode that on the bankless feed uh but of course you can't have ultrasound money without censorship resistance that's got to be a core property of any sound money that's what we're going to talk about today gold of course can't be censored that's why it's been held up as sound money throughout the ages and our our sound money currencies have to be cryptocurrencies have to be censorship resistant to and now as we introduce Justin of course there's recent talk that ethereum can be censored it's been in the headlines uh lately and there's talk that proof of stake is a vector for increased ethereum censorship that all it takes is a government agency to sanction a few addresses and ethereum censorship resistance will be brought to its knees that is the topic we're going to discuss with Justin today Justin welcome back to bankless thanks for having me uh so here's what I think people want to know I know we're going to come about these questions um from a very bottom-up approach and base principles approach but I'm going to just set this out for the listener I think what people want to know is how hard is it to censor ethereum today how can we design ethereum to make that harder more censorship resistant and how does all this compare to other cryptocurrencies so we're going to get into all of those questions not sequentially but that is the thrust in the theme of this episode Justin you ready to dig in let's do it okay why don't we start with some uh foundations the the basics here uh why is censorship resistant and import resistance an important topic in crypto uh and uh and what is it right so censorship resistance is this idea that transactions that are valid and paying transaction fees should get included on chain and you know one of the reasons why it's it's important is because of this kind of mimetic chain basically censorship resistance is required for credible neutrality credible neutrality is required for legitimacy and legitimacy is required for monetary premium and monetary premium is required it has actual utility because it leads to Economic Security uh with with staking and it also leads to economic bandwidth when you start using IF as collateral money in the context of D5 and so if you start you know attacking or weakening your your sensitive resistance then everything starts to crumble apart and if they're no longer can fulfill its mission of being the settlement layer for the incentive value because you need trillions of dollars of Economic Security and you need trillions of dollars of economic bandwidth and you can only get that with censorship resistance so how core is it to ethereum values then and the promise of ethereum right is uh is censorship resistance uh one of the central principles the the pillars of ethereum or is it sort of a a secondary feature a benefit we can kind of take it or leave it right so the way that I think of it is as a pillar to Credible neutrality and there's kind of three pillars to Credible neutrality one the censorship resistance the other one is actually scalability and the reason is if you want a platform which is going to be the symptom of layer for the into the value it can't just cater for the one percent the rich uh it needs to be you know credibly neutral to to the to the whole world and that's something we're working on and then the the the third pillar to Credible neutrality is is full programmability basically Turing completeness because once you've reached that escape velocity with programmability um you can cater for any application without any bias uh within the the context of the the internet of of value you're not you know programming in a very specific application uh with all sorts of unintended consequences down the line and you know obviously ethereum has the third pillar of credible neutrality we're working on the the the the second one which is capability and I think it has a huge head start on the first one which is sensitive resistance and I think that really illustrates uh why this concept of censorship or censorship resistance in the crypto space is core to the ethos of this whole entire experiment the through line I hear between all of those three pillars is something like inclusion or accessibility where if we generate a crypto system a blockchain that only includes the people that can pay for the most expensive transactions then we are discluding the rest of the world and then the rest of the world will reject that system because they're forced to they can't participate in that so they they that system is not inclusive of them and when we talk about censorship resistance we're really talking about is everyone included and if we have two competing systems like two versions of ethereum and one is including more people than the other the version of ethereum that includes more people is going to be adopted and considered legitimate by the world and so I think really think this inclusion idea is really really important to run through as we talk about censorship resistance is that a fair uh selling point to focus on Justin exactly and it can be summarized in two words equal access certainly and can we talk about uh just let's define censorship what does uh two sensor mean inside of the context of crypto right so censorship you know can can be hard to Define because you know you might want to take the perspective of the sensorer but it turns out that in ethereum specifically we have an extremely clean definition which I call economic censorship and one of the nice things about this definition is that it doesn't involve any humans it just looks at open and free and inefficient markets and basically it states that if you have a transaction which is valid and which is paying the base fee and it can be included in the next block meaning that the next block is going to have some unused gas then if it's not included in that next block it's being economically censored so there's no kind of economic reason for someone to be censoring a transaction a rational a purely rational actor who wants to maximize fees will include that transaction because it's a valid fee paying transaction and there is block space available and the reason why I'd say it's Unique to ethereum is because we have eip1559 and one of the things that eip1559 gives us is this idea of a dynamic block size so we have a gas limit which is two times the gas Target so the gas Target is 15 million gas the gas limit is 30 million gas and what that means in practice is that the vast majority of blocks have unused gas and so if you're seeing simultaneously two things one unused gas and two a transaction which is pending in the mempool and could have been consuming this unused gas then you have kind of a a a mechanism to detect the the censorship and so what you're saying is that there is an objective way to see if there is censorship or not this is not like oh I feel like I'm being censored like no no like there is a like a binary outcome of like yes this is censorship versus no this is not censorship exactly and it's something that you know machines can detect is that censorship yes or no um and it's something that we can set up a you know alert for so if there is censorship then everyone within the community can get alerted you know very very quickly uh through automatic notifications how does it feel for a user to be economically censored like what does the user experience of that and I'm imagining a few things so if you're censored let's say um I want to send some eth or a token to a censored addressed um I can never complete that transaction validators miners never pick it up because my transaction is being censored is that one way user might experience it maybe another way is um I can't complete a transaction on this censored uh dap or this this set of smart contracts because the miners the validators never actually process it is that is that how a user would experience it or put us in the shoes of you user and tell us what censorship looks like at that level right so it turns out that there's two very different types of censorship type one is what I call weak censorship is this idea that transactions do get included on chain but they get included with a delay and the reason is because some of the blocks a fraction of the blocks are not including that transaction and so let's just take a few examples let's imagine for example that ninety percent of the blocks are censoring that means that your average block time is going to grow from one slot to 10 slots and if you perceived average block time right well no the actual like average block time like the time it takes for your transaction to get included on chain I guess I should call it inclusion time not actual block time okay cool so the inclusion time will be uh 10 slots which is 120 seconds which is two minutes um and so you know it's it's a ux degradation uh you know it's not too bad in the sense that it's still five times faster than than Bitcoin which has 10 minutes average block times uh but it it's still uh not ideal and then there's this other form of censorship which is strong censorship and this is the really really bad stuff is when your transaction just never gets included on chain and this instead of being rooted in Block proposals um which are censoring it's actually rooted in attestations and it's a form of 51 attack where the the economic majority is through attestations effectively completely uh censoring certain types of transactions from from going on chain and and here you know it's much worse than the ux degradation it could be like just the the total inability to use a transaction a a specific type of of contract for example so let's say you have deposited you know some e for some other asset in a small contract and you're censored from being able to withdraw you know you've effectively lost your money that could be one of the the worst cases wow I didn't even think about that possibility Justin can you define attestations I think that might be a new word for listeners which is like where how do we fit this idea of attestations into previously existing models that that listeners might have right so ethereum today the proof of work ethereum and and Bitcoin bundle two separate roles they bundle proposing and attesting now in the on the on the beacon chain we've separated this this role so we have two roles the proposals and the testers what the proposers do is that they include blocks on chain okay fairly simple what the a testers do is that they will basically vote for what they think is the tip of the chain and so they participate in the Fortress Rule and so if you have a majority of attesters that are voting for a specific chain then that will be the dominant one it will win the fourth choice Rule and so what the attest can do is basically only vote on blocks that don't contain a certain type of transaction thereby completely and utterly filtering out this type of transaction from its firm itself so if we are living in a paradigm where ethereum has fallen victim to censorship we are perhaps like a proposer proposes a transaction that has a bunch of tornado cash transactions in it the attesters won't attest to that block and they say that is not the chain tip that's not the the longest version of the blockchain it's actually something else and that something else is a version of ethereum that doesn't have any tornado cash transactions in it is that is that how we should think about this exactly like the the testers could basically ignore blocks and often blocks that contain uh certain type of transactions and back to your link right so if we lose that property of ethereum which is censorship resistance we collapse one of the core pillars of credible neutrality credible neutrality of course uh is the thing that is backing the ultrasound eth which backs all of the security of ethereum so you can see very quickly why censorship resistance is uh so important and I wanted to get this into listener's brain because we're going to spend a lot of the the episode talking about these two forms of censorship that um Justin laid out for us and it probably Bears repeating so we've got weak censorship and that's kind of like a delayed inclusion of uh sensor transactions the weak form of censorship is you just get a delay and maybe instead of it taking uh minutes uh it could take hours something to that effect call it partial call it temporary or like block based censorship and then the other part we have the stronger form of censorship uh Justin aptly named strong censorship so this is sensor transactions that never ever get included on chain and I think we're going to talk a lot about these two forms of censorship in the rest of this episode but before we do there we've got a few other high level things to cover um one question I have in the back of my mind uh Justin is like I think what we're talking about here is the censorship resistance of ethereum the protocol itself we don't care so much about the app layer on top of ethereum or even like the exchanges themselves that is beyond the scope of the the censorship resistance of ethereum sort of conversation so for instance um a centralized exchange like coinbase or Kraken or or binance it's kind of out of scope of ethereum we sort of expect them to censor and abide by nation-state jurisdictions we also expect some of our apps on the app layer of ethereum to be censored in one degree or another AML kyc and all sorts of various ways is that true are we mainly talking about the scope of this is the protocol level and ethereum itself and block production everything that happens at that level yeah exactly we're thinking about the sensitive resistance of the layer one and it is true that you know things that fall outside of the ethereum jurisdiction outside of the ethereum network State well they they don't have to follow our rules and and that's fine but I think the the trajectory that we're moving towards is basically the the scope of the ethereum nation stage just keeps on growing week after week after week and things like centralized exchanges become decentralized exchanges things like centralized domain names like.com become decentralized domain names.dif and one by one the ethereum nation state with its own self-sovereignty and its own jurisdiction is growing its territory it also does appear like censorship resistance somewhat like decentralization is a spectrum and you can have more or less censorship resistance would you agree with that characteristic and how uh censorship resistant would you say ethereum is today so you know a score out of ten are we hitting like a a six a seven an eight I assume we're not ten because nothing is 10 like 10 is perfection but like give us a sense for uh how well ethereum ranks on that score and whether it is indeed a spectrum right so I guess for weak censorship it can be a spectrum because it basically depends on the fraction of blocks that don't that are basically censoring um I don't know what the number is because we haven't really seen much censorship actually we have seen ether mine sensor sandwiches for example and actually it's possible that we have seen ether mine also censor some tornado cache transactions uh I don't know what the you know the the shadow of ethermine is but it's and I guess it's irrelevant right because they will be moving to proof of stake and it's kind of unclear what it will be but if I were to you know put forward a guess I'd say you know less than 50 percent uh of of blocks would be censoring and so your average block time is only the worst case gonna double so it's going to go from 12 seconds to 24 seconds so it's a fairly minor degradation in in in ux on the other hand um the strong censorship is is very much black and white um and the the good news is that you know as far as I can tell there's there's no entity out there you know that is you know credibly threatening to somehow attack ethereum with with strong censorship um and so that hasn't been a concern in the short term I don't think it will be a concern in the medium term but we still need to be prepared for the worst case scenario and I guess this is what this discussion is about um just making sure that even in the worst case we are prepared for for strong censorship and the there's two pieces of good news here both on the weak and the strong censorship on the weak censorship we have technology at least at the research stage which can essentially fully eliminate weak censorship so what that means is that not only will transactions get included but they'll all of them will get included in a timely manner without delay and in terms of the the the the the strong censorship we're also in the position of power and this this is a heuristic uh that we have in cryptography and cryptography The Defenders are in a position of power and this is a heuristic that extends to crypto economics even for strong censorship we are in a position to build crypto economic systems both um you know in code that automate actions but both are also at the social layer and one of the interesting things about the the strong censorship is that it does require some level uh of involvement from from the social layer and so the exercise becomes how can we minimize that involvement and to the maximum extent possible try and automate the process of recovering from these 51 attacks Justin I really liked what you said about uh ethereum as a nation and having censorship resistance as like one of our laws uh this is the ethereum protocol is extra jurisdictional from other nation states and what we're really concerned about here and why this has been such a big conversation is that with this ofac ruling of tornado cash we're seeing the laws of a nation-state imparts its values upon ethereum and that is really chipping away at the self-sovereignty of the ethereum protocol but what we're saying here what you're saying here is that no ethereum as a nation has its own values its own laws that are independent and Sovereign from other nation states and we actually have the tools and mechanisms in like ready to go maybe not today but soon TM to enshrine ethereum's values of censorship resistance at the protocol level is it is that is that a fair way of describing this exactly and as I was I was saying we had some internet issues um weak censorship we can fully solve with just technology and so that can be something of the past where every transaction can include be included in a timely manner and similar thing with strong censorship we can be in the in a position where technology brings us to a point where the involvement of the social layer to recover from 51 attacks is actually fairly minimal yeah so this is all about enshrining this these values of censorship resistance into the protocol as deeply as possible and Justin I just want to do this one more time defining strong and weak censorship just with one less model to really get this into listeners heads and also I want to check my own reasoning on this um weeks censorship happens above the protocol layer right we have these D5 front ends that can prevent somebody from accessing them selectively we have things like infuria or alchemy that can restrict certain transactions that go through their nodes there are other ways that you know different parts of this technological stack above ethereum can pick and choose to not include transactions or to include them and so all of that censorship happens above the ethereum protocol and that's what we're calling weak censorship and then there's actual censorship at the protocol level at the ethereum protocol and that's what we're calling strong censorship it's just a good way to define these things yeah so um I guess what one thing what worth mentioning for weak censorship is that this there's actually several types of participants there's the interfaces which are far from the layer one and then there's kind of the the builders which are you know maybe slightly closer to the layer one and then you have the actual proposals which are basically validators layer one uh participants so for for weeks actually that you do have a spectrum and part of the strategy that we're taking is to try and and Shrine more and more um of the the block building process into layer one and so for example with enshrined PBS um Builders have more of a of of of of a native role but uh philosophically I do agree with you that uh with with weak censorship you know you could argue that it's not ethereum itself that is censoring instead it's individual participants in their own you know nation state jurisdictions um that are doing the the censorship on the other hand for for strong censorship uh when you do get to this critical threshold of 50 of the attestations then yes you can argue that ethereum itself is censoring and the reason is that the amalgation of all these individual participants which might be subject to the constraints of their own jurisdictions as a as an aggregate they now have control over the the machine consensus and they they can they can control ethereum at this machine consensus level and the reason why I'm I specify machine is because there's actually two layers to consensus one is the machine layer consensus and the other one is the social consensus and even though the machine layer consensus could be compromised that doesn't mean that the social layer has to be compromised and this is where the social layer can come in and basically do a reboot a recovery of the machine in consensus all right so I think one last thing before we get into uh the details of how to fix both strong and weak censorship if we want to address some of the crypto critics who are listing this maybe it's their first time and they're asking themselves okay so why are the crypto people so obsessed with censorship resistance in the first place like aren't in the majority of cases aren't we censoring North Korea are we censoring the bad guys aren't we censoring the Russian oligarchs you know my take on this and and the case for credibility neutrality is uh we want to partake in a system where if we were not the rule Setter uh we would still be fine fine partaking that system so it's one thing if uh America is censoring you know North Korea or other Bad actors terrorists Russian oligarchs but what if uh China was in control of the ethereum networked and they started censoring NBA players who were speaking out against Hong Kong for instance what if Russia was in charge and just started censoring U.S politicians who are not supportive of their geopolitical actions you you could see why credible neutrality is a desirable property uh even at the nation-state levels because they want you all collectively participate in a system where no one geopolitically can't uh bend the real the the rules that's what we have with protocols like like TC pip and the internet right now pretty kind of balkanization of the internet that's why censorship resistance is a desirable property because it makes no geopolitical um it has no geopolitical bias it doesn't make a decision as to whether this group of actors should be censored or that group of actors should be censors it just says if you have an eth address and you can pay the gas fee then you get your transaction through and what we are saying is the crypto people believe this is actually a good property to have and will lead to beneficial things for Humanity more coordination fewer Wars uh like you know kind of a a crypto Utopia or at least like vestiges of of that and and hopes for that uh what would you guys say about that defense of censorship resistance and credible neutrality uh is that why we support it yeah I would I would agree with this um one of the things that I'd say is that um you know if if Bitcoin is is Swiss banking then ethereum is is all of Switzerland right like the the products that we're giving here is secure block space and one one of the uh properties of being secure is is is being censored resistance and we don't want to lose this this self-sovereignty we don't want to become a U.S chain or an EU chain or or a China chain and one of the reasons is that we want credible World War III resistance right we want ethereum to survive even the most extreme of of human situations and in order to get there we need to have immunity from nation states right we want ethereum to be a public good not a private good which is you know owned by some external uh jurisdiction I guess another thing you know worth mentioning is around permissionlessness right if you have censorship then now you basically as as an innovator you need to ask for for permission to you know from from from the sensor um and I think one of the the big killing points uh selling points of ethereum is that it's it's a magnet for talent and why is it a magnet for talent is because people feel like they can go build infrastructure on ethereum and it's going to last for decades and centuries you know and this is in stark contrast to apis like Facebook's API or Twitter's API which is known to have this inherent platform risk you know one day from another you've built this multi-billion Dollar business on top of Facebook and they just rug You by by censoring the the apis and so if we want to attract the best and brightest we need to have this this strong credible permissionlessness to it as well so Justin let's go ahead and start to get into some of the solutions that we have in the ethereum ecosystem for some of these various flavors of censorship and we'll start with weak censorship first and talk about all the mechanisms that we have to prevent and eliminate weak censorship and then we'll go to a strong censorship later but just just to recap week censorship is there's many different vectors of censorship here because of this text act there's website front end there's RPC endpoint providers like uh inferior or Alchemy we have individual block proposers or block Builders um and this week censorship would look like you make a transaction to tornado cash and you have to wait a few extra blocks to get your transaction in maybe you have to pay a little bit of a higher gas um maybe it's just a little bit more difficult to use ethereum and then there are some other like second order consequences for weak censorship as well and maybe we can go into those but overall like how would you say what what are the mechanisms that ethereum has as it at its disposal to prevent weak censorship right so because this block production pipeline is is quite complicated I guess it's maybe worth going through the participants one by one um and I'd say it's kind of easy to deal with the so-called secondary participants that play a fairly minor role so let's start with the The Searchers like Searchers are you know participants who will basically create these so-called bundles of transactions and basically that job involves inserting and reordering transactions into small bundles you know they do things like Arbitrage and sandwiches but you know their job is not about filtering or or censoring so Searchers are not to worry we can't move on I guess the next uh type of participant would be the the relays and here the the good news is that relays are a temporary thing with Mev boost once we have so-called enshrined proposal Builder separation and trying PBS we no longer have the the relays and so what might be a short-term uh censorship Vector won't be in in the long term and you know realistically you know we would be looking at let's say eight 18 months you know after the merge at least uh for for and trying PBS to come in but you know it can be uh prioritized if necessary what you're saying is from a relays relays perspective once we have protocol Builder separation enshrined in the protocol uh then relays are no longer a vector for censorship but that change is coming maybe not next hard for it but the hard Fork after let's call it which could be like you know 18 months plus away and so in that window of time we do have a censorship Vector for for relays but longer term you're not concerned about it because of critical Builder separation that's already on the roadmap that's already we have it defined solution to that we just need to implement it am I getting that correct that's correct and there's another piece of good news is that for the relays we benefit from what's called an you know an honest or non-censoring minority we just knew one or few relays to be non-censoring and that's enough and the reason is that it gives the option to proposers who don't want to censor to be using these nonsensitive relays and one of the events that happened recently with flashbots is that they open sourced their their relays and so that gives anyone in the world the ability to just spin up a server and not have the censorship as part of the the relay node we'll go on to the next part of the stack yeah sure so that would be interfaces um and you know I'm thinking here things like like metamask uh and and Ave so the the reality is that today the interfaces are you know largely centralized but the the good news is that there is a very clear road map towards decentralizing these front ends so if you take a metamask uh for example really what we want to be having is an in-browser like client so instead of having to go through you know RPC endpoints which is operated by inferior we have our own like client running within our browser or on our computer um and then when we're not subject to this uh to to to the censorship and the good news here is that proof of stake like clients are significantly simpler to build and proof of work like clients so assuming that this was kind of a friction point for for metamask uh in in the past post-match uh you know I guess there should be uh a reasonable expectation that that metamask will will move away from what will move towards like clients another thing with front ends is around the domains and and the hosting so we have ens domains they don't have perfect integration but we have more and more Integrations um sometimes native to to to to browsers um and you know over time I expect that more and more browsers will have native Integrations with ens um and that there won't be a censorship there you can also use ipfs for the the the the static content and you can also you know combine that with filecoin whereby you're in the position to to to pay to make sure that the data which is on ipfs is uh served in you know reliably and in terms of the dynamic content you know this is more ambitious than static content but there are projects like the graph for example that have this ambition to to process and index web 3 and do so in a decentralized fashion so that you don't have censorship and I think what will happen is that basically there will be incremental improvements to to decentralization for these front ends over time okay so for for from the front end perspective the interfaces perspective the ethereum solution would be we've got like clients for something like uh you know metamask uh and then we have also um something like ens for domain names and then we have decentralized storage providers like ipfs and filecoin and so all of these are being worked on and also from a data indexing perspective we have Solutions like like the graph and you think through this kind of cocktail of solutions we can be in a much better place from an interface perspective to not be decentralized you know I I've also seen um like some teams like uniswap for example uh basically open source their entire front end so someone else could run it so you could run this in a you know maybe a different jurisdiction without the same censorship you you know issues does that help solve it as well yeah exactly and I think there's actually maybe an opportunity for a dow to come forward and curate and maintain this decentralized set of of front ends most of which are open source and so as you said it's very easy to copy and just remove the censorship Justin for the listeners can we just quickly clarify what a light client is my mental model for like clients is that you are able to create a version of ethereum that's like native to your computer kind of like running your own node but it's a lot faster a lot lighter hence the name like clients and instead of having to like call inferior or Alchemy to ask what is the state of ethereum and also can you broadcast my transaction you can get a light client spun up in your browser pretty damn quickly that allows for you to have your own like Sovereign vision of the ethereum chain and being able to broadcast your own transactions is that a fair definition for like clients or what would you add to that exactly so there's kind of two components to like clients the first one is figuring out what the tip of the chain is and here for a proof of stake we have what are called sync committees and the reason they're called sync committees is that they help you sync up to the chain as a like client and this is Ultra lightweight in the sense that you have to download a few aggregated BLS signatures verify them um and then Tada you're kind of synced up to the to the head of the chain the other aspect of like lines once you are aware of the the head is to basically make queries so like clients have the ability to read the full state of ethereum and make our arbitrary queries at least you know fairly simple queries and the way that you do that is by asking other full nodes that are willing to serve these like Reliant queries so instead of making requests to inferior you could make a request to any full node that is accepting of like Quant queries and and so long as you have a few uh not non-censoring full nodes that are answering these queries uh then you have censorship resistance so this concept of routing around is now coming to mind and just to recap where we are so thus far if we have a centralized front end that is censoring our transactions we can route around that that censoring front end with alternative front ends using something like ipfs and or ens names or a front-end that is in a different jurisdiction another centralized front end but it's outside of the United States for example and famously of course there's like seemingly hundreds of different ways of accessing uniswap that are through other centralized front ends you know call it zapper xerion you know pick your interface or you could actually go to the ipfs version of the uniswap front end and so if the unit swap front end is is Banning you there are many many different ways to Route around that front end and so that that's one way to get around censorship and now with uh what we're talking about with RPC endpoints so things like the centralization and possible censorship factors of uh inferior or l Alchemy or metamask we can route around having to be dependent on those centralized node providers if they are censoring because we have this uh technology called light clients that makes it trivially easy to access the parts of ethereum that you need to access in order to do your D5 things like uniswap or you know tornado cache or whatever and so we have these different mechanisms for routing around both the the centralized front end but then also the stack behind that which is inferior or Alchemy are these mprpc providers with things like light clients Justin let's keep on going down the stack a little bit deeper to proposers and Builders uh thing people that actually put our transactions into blocks how do we get around censorship potential censorship from these parties right so the builders are the brains in the sense that they order transactions optimally so that they they maximize the value of the block they maximize the transaction fees and the Mev and so if the builders are are censoring there is uh something which I call altruistic self-building is this idea that proposes can build their own blocks uh for example using the you know the the tried and tested naive block building strategy which just orders transactions in the mempool decreasing by by tip and so if you're building your own blocks then you can make sure that you know yourself are not censoring one downside here is that you have reduced income for the self-building proposes it's a little hard to quantify uh right now but you know it could it could be like one percent API or something like that um there is also this kind of interesting hybrid uh solution where you self-built by uh by default but you you fall back to this proposal build separation if there is enough of a revenue Delta so if it so happens that Builders are are able to to create a block which is significantly better than what you're able to to build then you don't want to miss out on this Revenue then you can opt in to to using blocks built uh by builders and one of the the interesting things about altruistic self-building is that we only need a small minority of people to be doing that and there's been some vocal people in the community for example superfists that have been advocating for for self-building and even if we have let's say just 10 percent of um proposes uh that are that are that are self-building that that's enough to maintain a a pretty decent user experience uh in the short term and ethereum is known to have altruistic actors you know we have thousands of people running ethereum nodes around the world without any ins without any incentivization they basically doing so as a financial loss and yet you know these these people deeply care about ethereum and so I think there will be uh a non-negligible portion of people self-building in the short term and of course the builders are those that are actually ordering the the transactions uh they're they're not the ones that are proposing them for inclusion um those that are proposing them for inclusion those are more of the the validators um can we talk about that group how do we protect against uh proposer centralization or validator centralization right so this is where an Mev smoothing comes in so the idea of mev's moving by the way it comes from Mev research and there's a lot of intersections between sense like weak censorship resistance uh and an Mev and all the tools that we've built for Mev uh I I I apply here so the idea of Mev smoothing is that as a proposer you have very little choice you either accept the top paying uh bid from the from the from the builders or you don't get to include a block at all so it's a very binary thing where you don't get any discretion you you're basically reducing the role of posing in a single slot to one one bit either you pick the top paying block or you don't in which case you lose all the Mev and all the tips and all the rewards associated with that with that block and the way that it works is basically the testers are only going to attest to the the block that you're proposing if they observe it to be the most economically um like paying paying block um and so that's that's basically one way to to to remove the power that the the the proposers have and then there's uh another piece of technology uh which is uh known as censorship resistance lists or or CR lists you know maybe there's some better names for example transaction inclusion lists or or padding transactions and the idea here is that um it's a it's a mechanism to fight against the the the the the Builders without having to to incur a financial loss and the way that it works is that as a proposer I am going to put forward some transactions that I think are being censored and these transactions must be included uh in blocks that are not full so basically you're constraining the Builder to build blocks that must include these transactions if in these uh these blocks are not full and as we know it most of the blocks with erp1559 are not full um roughly eighty percent of the blocks have at least one million gas which is unused and if you want to have all the blocks uh being completely full then the base fee will kind of Rise exponentially and then eventually there will be blocks that are not full um so this is a way basically for proposers to simultaneously have the benefits of proposal Builder separation basically have the the the maximum income that you can get while at the same time being able to force through some transactions that you believe are being censored and so at this point in the stack we're pretty deep in the weak censorship part of ethereum so like we're well much deeper than front ends we're well deeper than like uh inferior uh and so now we're at the point of like the mempool and we're starting to talk about mechanisms that in that Force block proposers and block producers to include transactions that are in a list into the actual blockchain uh how how can we go through how that how how does it actually become forced it's like how does that enforcement happen of block proposers must include these transactions in this uh CR list this censorship resistant list how does that happen right so the way that it works is that um before the the the slot of the proposer the proposal has the opportunity to advertise transactions that they think are being censored and basically it's a it's a constraint to the the builders and the proposals are basically saying please build blocks with this constraint that you must include these transactions um if you don't include these transactions then your block is not even valid and won't make it on chain so basically it's a way for proposers to impose some sort of preference over the builders as opposed to the builders just nearly Willy being able to impose whatever policy that they want on the Chain so the reason why we came up with these you know transaction inclusion lists is because uh you know we were worried about a scenario where the building Market becomes extremely centralized you know that might be like a handful of of of of block Builders and the reason that the block building Market could become centralized is because it's very sophisticated you know you might need an army of phds and a lot of you know fancy algorithms and and lots of computational resources to build these the these often more blocks and so basically we wanted to design a release valve for the proposers which we assume some fractions are going to be wanting to to not censor to force through these transactions by constraining what these Builders can do and so listeners who uh read my article not too long ago titled like the ethereum Watershed we'll be familiar with this flow but there's a very specific flow of transaction inclusion in the future ethereum and Justin's already talked about um uh the the idea of Searchers and we will and that's where this really this this flow starts you have Mev Searchers that bundle up a bunch of transactions into a bundle then you have block Builders who add all these bundles together to build a block and that makes it really easy for Block proposers who are also called ethereum stakers these are the same people block proposers and ethereum stakers or eth validators are the same people same name and so the idea here is that we are worried that block Builders the people that construct a block that make block construction very easy for proposers because they're doing all of this work of ordering transactions on behalf of the eth takers what we're worried about is that act that activity becomes very professionalized and not really accessible and again accessibility is is another core primitive that we want to be have instantiated into the values of ethereum and so what we're saying here with this CR list is that the proposers actually go back to the block Builders and say hey when you are building me a block you got to include all these transactions or else I'm not going to propose it and so it puts the power into the hands of the East takers who are designed as an entity as a cohort of people to be much more decentralized than block Builders and so we have the possibility of solo stakers you know you just run your own nodes take your own 32 eth and these people have the power over perhaps centralized block Builders and say hey it's great that you can build me blocks but you gotta build me blocks with these transactions in it or else I'm not going to accept that block and that's how we have this forcing mechanism to ensure that all transactions ultimately get included into the blockchain because we're putting power into the hands of a more decentralized set of the ethereum like blockchain supply chain now can we I'm still a little bit confused on Mev smoothing how does Mev smoothing kind of fit into this flow and what what's the mechanism behind that and what does that do right so the idea of mev's moving is to try and have some sort of perfectly efficient market and remove the discretion that proposers might have right because proposers always have at least today they have the option to have their blocks be built by censoring Builders so in in almost the the same way that censorship resistance lists work where they say build up please include these transactions the the proposals can say hey Builder please don't include these transactions so basically this this technology of constraining the the the the the the Builder is is a neutral technology that can be used in uh either way and so what we want to do in in instead of uh having proposes have this discretionary power we want to remove this discretionary power and the way we do that is that we ask the attesters to observe the block building market so what is the block building Market basically you have a bunch of Builders who at every slot produce a block header and that header contains a bid so this bid is how much um The Proposal will get if the block header gets included on on chain and so basically what we're asking um our test is to do is to find the top paying bid and only a test if the proposal has included that top paying Bid And so in a way what we're doing here is that we're forcing the auction to be fair in the sense that whoever is paying the most for their block has a guarantee that their block will be chosen or that no other block will be chosen so we're reducing the discretionary power of proposals to just a single bit and now Justin we're pretty damn deep in this stack that I keep on referencing but there's one last layer deeper which is the mempool in its entirety uh and we have this idea of an encrypted mempool which I think is really just like this very strong final line of defense of preventing censorship of transactions can you go into this encrypted mempool mechanism and talk about what it does right so if we zoom out we have two different types of auctions within the block building process at least two one is the the block auction process and the other one is the the transaction one so censorship resistance and Mev smoothing is all about improving the block auction can we also improve the the the naive transaction auction and the the answer is is yes and the idea of encrypted mempools is that the trend you as a user you are going to encrypt your transaction before broadcasting it and then once the and only once the transaction is included on chain does it get decrypted so what you get basically is this in-flight encryption which um basically prevents from prevents the senses from knowing the contents of the transactions during this block building process um which you know makes it essentially you know very hard for them to apply the the the censorship so for example if you know a certain jurisdiction says you can't send transactions you know you can't include transactions that have this type of sender address or this type of destination address well now these sender and destination addresses are encrypted at least in Flight uh before these transactions get included on chain and so it becomes much much harder to to to censor and this technology was actually initially thought of in the context of Mev right because if as a user you don't leak the contents of your transactions while it's in Flight it can't get front run and so encrypted mempools kind of kills uh two two birds with one stone on the one hand it removes toxic Mev and and front running and it also uh improves the the transaction auction against the censorship and so it's this defense in-depth uh idea where you know in theory Mev smoothing and sensitive resistance lists could be sufficient but we have like this extra layer of Defense with encrypted mempools and this encrypted Mentor thing it sounds really strong it's like it's like putting a cloak of invisibility around the entire mempool and really just reducing the options that that uh that people have that block proposers have or block Builders have just like well I don't know what that transaction does so I'm just going to include the one with the highest fee and there is no really way to like understand what that transaction does whether it's like a tornado cash transaction or just a uniswap trade until after it gets included into the blockchain is that is that the gist yeah that's correct I mean in theory there is a way to to break it which is that as a block Builder you can require your users to have some sort of short cryptographic proof for example proving that your transaction which is encrypted does not you know is is compliant um and so it's it's not a a a a perfect strategy but then it goes back to what level of paranoia are you assuming like how dystopic is your nation state what kind of personal freedoms do you enjoy like in you know many countries at the very least you have the ability to you know own private Keys like like a fundamental pillar of personal freedoms um if you know we fight for you know this this idea of in-flight encryption which you know will last only a few seconds you only have privacy for a few seconds um then you know and maybe in in many countries it would be reasonable you know to to to not man mandate this additional cryptographic proof so Justin this is all we haven't gotten to strong censorship yet which we're going to in just a minute and I want to kind of conclude this section but just one thought that comes to mind is some people are listening to you describe the um the solution to weak censorship and they're hearing like this um many different solutions here and like it sounds relatively complex and we haven't talked about dates for this it sounds almost like a patchwork of different defenses and solutions but you know and maybe this is because I just recently went to London and and visited some castles uh over there but like this is kind of the way defense works right if like say the analogy of a castle right you fortify a wall over here you um build another Tower there you increase your affordifications and you dig a moat uh you install it in an entirely new perimeter wall this is sort of how you you fortify a network and so all of these are not just like single shot approaches but um we are going through a fortification process to try to solve weak censorship is that how we should be thinking about it and like what's the overall timeline on on these Solutions yeah I think that's a good way to think about it another way to think about it is this divide and conquer strategy so we have multiple actors in The Pipeline and how can we remove some of them from being able to to censor um and so we we talked about um and maybe smoothing as basically removing the the relevance of proposals like proposal just become dumb pipes that do one thing which is just select the highest uh buying block and so they are no longer a concern in in the big picture and one of the things interesting things about encrypted mempools is that they might actually be able to remove Builders or at least to a very large extent from the picture and the reason is that the vast majority of transactions can be encrypted and so it just looks like white noise and so the the naive way to build a block which is just to look at the the pool of encrypted transactions and order them by tip could just work just fine from from from a validator on a Raspberry Pi that's that self-building there's there's no need for sophistication there and so my guess is that for the vast majority of transactions let's say 95 of the transactions we won't need a builder and they will be self-built and the remaining five percent is where all the really fancy stuff will happen like like Arbitrage and liquidations and whatnot and so the block building process will be narrowed down to just this this top five percent of the transactions um thereby reducing the the power that the the builders have okay so let's conclude this before we we move on conclude the section on on uh weak censorship here so of course weak censorship it just sort of delays a transaction but you've described a whole bunch of different Technologies and solutions at various points in the you know blockchains supply chain of how we address the the center the censorship factors uh through technology so overall um does ethereum have a solution to this what's kind of the the the end game for for weak censorship with ethereum is this thing solvable so yes this you know it might sound like a strong claim but I believe that we have the technology at least at the at the research level to effectively completely remove weak censorship we'll be in a position where if you make a transaction and this transaction can be included in in in in in in a block then it will be included in a blog I you know either because your your transaction is is encrypted um and all because the proposers have no discretionary power and they have to include it because it's part of the highest building block um and all because even in the case where all the builders are censoring which is a very extreme position to take they will still be a release valve uh where the proposals can themselves Force Through the inclusion of of of these transactions and one of the I guess interesting things here is the concept of anti-fragility so we have this end game and the more we're being attacked the sooner we're going to see this end game because every attack is an as an opportunity to accelerate the inevitable like total hardening of ethereum from the perspective of weak censorship so what you're saying effectively is every time ethereum gets attacked in one of these weak censorship type of ways it's an opportunity to kind of get stronger it's almost like a Hydra in that way exactly yep Juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your checking account with Juno you can send money

completely solved or the attack is a little bit different this is I don't know if it's a bit less like enemies at the gate and a bit more like the enemies inside of the castle uh like it's it's a more pernicious attack it's harder to defend against and of course this is uh as we described earlier in the episode this means that the the sensor transaction never actually gets included on chain it means the transaction gets censored completely orphaned uh it's like full censorship up is another name for this or permanent censorship so I think we've described it fairly well and what the consequences of a network like ethereum a protocol like ethereum losing its strong censorship characteristics but can we talk a little bit about the solution here so Justin how do we solve strong censorship uh the strong censorship problem right so I think this this there's two things that we can do one is that we can have preventative measures basically make it extremely hard to even get in in such a position and then the other aspect is basically recovery if we are being attacked how do how do we recover now at a high level the the recovery um is the recovery of a 51 attack and it involves forking away it involves ironically censoring the sensorer um and um one of the things that we want to try and do here is automate the process as much as much as possible and you know this is something we we can discuss but like roughly speaking 80 of the process can be automated and then we kind of need the social layer to kick in to enshrine or confirm um the the the the the fork the recovery um but I guess before talking about this the recovery it might be worth talking about the preventative measures what what can we do to make it really really hard to get into this bad situation in the first place one thing we can do before we do that Justin can we actually just talk about how this concept of strong censorship and a 51 attack is actually the same thing because I think that might actually help listeners kind of wrap their heads around what we're actually talking about why if we're talking about strong censorship how is it basically the same thing as like a 51 attack on my blockchain how are those similar right so strong censorship is a special type of 51 attack it's when the economic majority has taken over the chain and is compromising the liveness of the chain so there's two aspects to security there's safety and there's liveness the good news with safety is that we have the so-called finality Gadget which means that if there's a 51 attack you know and the the history is is is Rewritten um then there's automatic slashing so that's something that we can deal with completely automatically without any involvement from the social layer but there's another type of 51 attack which is a liveness 51 attack and censorship is a special type of liveness of 51 attack and here it's a little bit more subtle it's a little bit more subjective um and we can't fully deal with it automatically instead kind of the best thing that we can hope for is trying to maximize the amount of things that we do automatically and minimize the involvement of the social layer and so that's and the reason we want to try and do that is is around credible neutrality we want to have recovery mechanisms which are incredibly neutral and minimize the involvement of humans all right so we got these two pieces here we've got number one the preventative measures we can take just making this a very um High bar to to attack ethereum uh and then secondly we have kind of the recovery piece of it and how can the community in a social uh from a social layer perspective censor the sensor um but let's start with the preventative measures then how do we make this a very high bar to do a strong censorship attack on ethereum so one of the things we can focus on is diversity and specifically jurisdictional diversity because realistically the only type of actor nowadays that can go perform these 51 attacks are nation states and so just like we've had this kind of battle at the social layer in terms of client diversity you know with prism originally having 70 of all the validators and now only having 35 percent of the validators we can go through a similar process to try and improve jurisdictional diversity and what that means is that we want validators to be operated from all sorts of of of of jurisdictions um and you know just like we have clientdiversity.org which has been tracking the diversity of of of the the clients uh we we kind of need a similar website for jurisdictional diversity um we can also focus on operator diversity so this is something you know quite related and we have already a website for this called rated.network which kind of gives you a breakdown of where the stake um is from an operator uh standpoint and you know we can also focus on on on similar things like um geographical diversity um so we we might want to spread the validators across you know five different continents just in the same way that we have five different consensus clients and we kind of spread out uh the the the stake and Justin you have to do all of that at the social layer right like we can't design that in the protocol in any way exactly so this is a a social battle and you know you can think of of it as being a social Shield which is kind of in invisible but there and playing a really crucial role and this is this should make intuitive sense when we say that we want a bunch of eth validators East takers to be geographically distributed when we also say that we believe ethereum to be this extra National entity it's this thing that doesn't is not owned or operated by any one specific nation-state and so you could imagine if every single ethereum validator happened to exist inside the United States well at that point then every single validator is beholden to the laws of the United States and so we need all these validators to be across every single continent in order to claim that we are have creating the system that exists beyond the nation state uh and so the and this is why it's so important that we have focused on in the ethereum ecosystem on reducing the barriers to becoming an East acre down to the absolute minimum where all you need is a consumer grade like laptop and access to the internet and you can take part in consensus um uh and like you can do that with 32 eth or even low lower than that with other Innovations like rocket pool or Opals like distributed validator technology so the idea here is that not only are we geographically distributed we're also culturally distributed too it's like doesn't matter what culture you're from or what part of the continent or what part of the world you're from is that you can actually represent ethereum and its values and there is no centralization into a certain like set of laws and that's what creates ethereum to have this globally relevant and and also centristip resistant nature in the fact that no country actually has a claim on ethereum because we're all so well distributed exactly and if you were to kind of zoom out and ask yourself how can an attacker acquire 51 of the stake there's kind of two ways that they can do so one is through coercion and the other one is just through buying stake and here this idea of focusing on diversity is to minimize the impact of coercion right it's trying to remove these Central choke points um so it could be for example like one staking pool which is especially large and this is in one specific jurisdiction that becomes a choke point for coercion and so if they have let's say 20 of the stake then in one Fell Swoop this twenty percent could go from from non-censoring to to to censoring so what about things like staking pools Justin where we have uh Lido which has a very large amount of each stake but we also have things like rocket pool is it okay to have staking pools grow large is there a way to both have staking pools which gives further access to being a part of network consensus while also maintaining censorship resistance right so one of the things that you want to try and do is first of all have you know a plurality and a diversity of staking pools but also make sure that these staking pools are themselves very difficult to to coerce and this is where you know the decentralization comes in so for example Lido is is a Dao and Rocket pool is is also a Dao and you know dials out in a way that owns jurisdictions uh just like ethereum is that their own network States and so we want to be uh you know trying to incorporate these taking pools Within These these micro jurisdictions uh that are that are created for the purpose of of of securing ethereum so it is if you if we are going to be forced to a future of staking pools which is debatable but let's assume it is then we want to be participating in staking pools which are incorporated in non-sovereign jurisdictions be basically we want to be incorporating in network States not nation states it's kind of cool because a lot of the the defenses uh or the preventative measures against these strong forms of censorship are actually at what David and I would call the layer zero this is actually like you know you called it the social shield and that's incredibly important right so like we're talking about diversity that happens at the social layer across jurisdictions also talking about an emphasis on on Solo versus pool staking uh wherever possible making that easier you know getting into the mindset not your keys not your attestations just in in the way we've gotten in the mindset of of not your uh not your keys not your coins uh and so I think deterrence social education is a huge part of this we also have like some legal groundwork that we can start to do right so we have lobbyists in in Washington there are other crypto Lobby groups all around the world the coin centers and such and creating a culture around activist type of of staking right so like it is your patriotic duty to the the ethereum nation state to stake you know I think bitcoiners in particular have done this very well with like uh running Bitcoin notes and I think we need to Foster that sort of culture in in ethereum but these are all of our uh defenses and preventative uh measures against um strong forms of of censorship attack here uh it's all at the social layer isn't it yes exactly um and activists staking is is is is interesting basically it's this idea that we can try and rebalance stake in order to make sure that we don't get in the bad position in the first place so you know you can try and restake for example once withdrawals are enabled you can take your stake from one place and and point it to to to another place you know this would be like redirecting hash rate from one pool or or another or you know you can just bring in fresh steak uh just like you could deploy fresh hash rate um to try and and balance things out or there's also the option of just unstaking let's say that there is a jurisdiction which is particularly dystopian whereby not only are they forcing the the the pools and the exchanges to be acting a certain way but they're also forcing the individuals to be you know censoring even if you're solo staking on your Raspberry Pi then here one of the best options that you have is simply unstaking and so there's this idea of you know activist on on staking and one of the good news here is that you can still earn yield even if you're on stake and the reason is is that we should expect the the yields the eth yields on D5 and the E fields on staking to you know more or less you know you know Arbitrage and and and track each other and you know one of the reasons is that you know if you can go borrow if and D5 you know for let's say three percent and you can make four percent staking then people won't go borrow and defy and just go stake and so the other transmit rate is this one percent uh uh difference so you can still be earning yield even if you're not staking because you know you're you're as part of a particular dystopian Network State now one of the things worth highlighting is that activists staking in the context of proof of stake does not help with recovery and this is one of the downsides of proof of stake versus proof of work generally speaking proof of stake has like strictly better sensitive resistance but this is the one place where proof of work is better because in the context of proof of work if an attacker has made a 51 attack it is possible to redirect your hash rate it is possible to Bringing new hash rates to try and heal the system but with proof of stake once an attacker has 51 percent of the stake they can censor the deposits and the exits themselves so that it becomes impossible to come in or impossible to to to restake we'll definitely touch on this in the the recovery section uh but I just want to highlight uh as we close in this preventative section all these various mechanisms right so we have uh we we would love people to solo stake their ether across all continents all over the world uh we would love for people to do this activists staking that allows for censorship to uh not be fully expressed in the protocol uh and then there's also just uh what we're focusing on in the layer zero where uh we can also fight this in the nation-state territory themselves where we have people like coin Center and other like legal entities going after nation states to make sure that they don't even bother and like accept ethereum as it is and this is all preventative this is all getting before there's an issue but Justin I'd like to turn this conversation to uh the recovery side so we can uh imagine that there is an entity an entity with perhaps a significant amount of stake say for example the nation state has talked to coinbase and to Lido and these two entities have agreed that they are going to censor transactions uh under threat of going to jail and so both coinbase Brian Armstrong and lydo are censoring transactions uh and what let's just again Define what does what would that look like if coinbase and Lido are censoring transactions and how do we as a community go from there how do we move forward from that point right so let's assume that an attacker has more than 50 percent uh of the attestations and they want to censor I mean I I question the the premise that that Lido you know uh could could could could could be censored you know partly because it's a Dao and also partly because they have you know many many different uh operators but let's just assume that's an attacker has more than 50 percent of the attestations then what what they can do is basically only a test to blocks that don't include a certain type of transactions and so you're in a position where you have strong censorship some type of transactions don't go in and here what you need to do is basically Fork off you need to really reboot the system or at least exit the system so that the uh the the minority can coordinate on a a fresh version of a firm so basically you you have a fork with two versions of a film you have the censored version and the non-sensitive version and you know here there's a whole design space right are we going to hot Fork are we going to soft fork or we're going to try and do this manually and we're going to try and do this or automatically but they all boil down to the same thing which is this idea of the minority opting out from the tyranny of the of the of the of the of the majority and uh in in the in the process kind of redeclaring sovereignty uh over the chain and the ability to to maintain and uphold uh credible neutrality now one of the things that is you know expensive about forking is that it involves a social layer and this is something that can be you know messy it can be slow as you know it can be very human intensive it can be contentious um and so we want to try and come up with protocols both encode and in the social layer that will you know just streamline everything to the maximum extent and so um one of the one of the high level ideas here is that we can have code that automatically creates a fork you can think of it as like a template or a Seedling it's like a a fork which has detected censorship and which has started the process of secession basically of uh and and and Independence um but there are like technical limitations as to what um what you can do with with full automations so the the the the first caveat is that in order to even be able to detect censorship you need to be online and so um if you if you go offline and then censorship happens and you know this forking process happens and you come back you know online after the fact then you won't know which chain is is legitimate and which chain has has been censoring because the process of detecting censorship requires you to be online another big caveat is um you know related to like clients so you know the like clients often won't won't be on online they will be uh wallets that will you know only come online when when they're being used um and so they they can't even observe the mempool right because the the detection of censorship happens by observing the mempool you have a transaction which is pending in the mempool is not being included therefore it's being censored but you need to be observing the mempool to to to to to to make this uh this this observation and it's even worse for small contracts like clients so these are like clients that are embedded within a blockchain in order to build Bridges between chains and these like clients fundamentally cannot observe the mempools the mempool and so this is where you know the social layer needs to come in and and and and and patch up or strengthen this Fork template into the real enshrined version of reality like there's a couple other um caveats to this automatic forking one is this idea that in order to come to consensus on censorship there shouldn't be abnormally High peer-to-peer networking latency if the internet is a is a massive mess and people are not receiving packets properly or you know things are being delayed or controlled by an attacker then the the there could be some noise there at the at the at the networking level which needs to be smoothened out and patched up at the at the social layer and then another kind of caveat is that around this this idea of automatic forking it that sometimes censorship could be you know accidental it could be it could be a kleinberg which is fixed a few hours or a few days later and this idea of automatic forking can't really discern intent is this real malicious intent or is this like a an innocuous client bug which is which is being which is being fixed and so just to recap the the the strategy that is available to us is for full nodes that are online and observing the mempool to do several things one detect censorship and then two Identify some sort of non-censoring minority chain and then three kind of automatically Fork off and and and and punish the the the the the senses and all of these things can be done fully in a fully automated way except that the full nodes are not sufficient we also want all the like clients and you know all the all this all the social layer to to to to be following through uh this this this automatic uh Fork so Justin I think it's probably news it's actually a news to me I never thought about uh the possibility of an automatic Fork actually being being triggered um but but I want to even you know go back to like automated or manual aside what what a what a recovery like this would look like what does social Fork would look like so essentially we would have in that world where we have some nasty um you know censorship going on uh there would be a new ethereum that would Fork from that and that would be maybe the community would brand that as ethereum like the original ethereum this is what ethereum is censorship resistance and the social contract and then there would be another Branch another Fork that would continue on as the censored version of ethereum and essentially all of the actors in the ethereum ecosystem whether you're an eth holder whether you're just a user of the network whether you have an asset like usdc that you're issuing whether you are a smart contract developer an app ecosystem provider metamask everyone would have to make a decision in terms of which of those two forks to support or both and ultimately what would happen is kind of the market would decide and the community would decide as we have in past forks with ethereum and with Bitcoin so Bitcoin of course went through a big fork of big block block size debate and what was left from that was Bitcoin and then Bitcoin cash and a whole bunch of the you know the the 12 dwarves there of other Bitcoins and of course we know that Bitcoin won because we can see it in terms of Market care cap and we had ethereum and ethereum classic and we could sort of uh see which which Fork sort of won at least the the Mind share and the market and so we would go through another episode of this and everyone would have to choose the censored version of ethereum or the original version of a ethereum that was uncensorable let me ask you what makes you to uh confident or hopeful that people will actually choose the uncensorable version of ethereum I've had people say to me well like Ryan that's like when when you just ethereum's describe like this is pretty naive because um you know providers like usdc they will obviously choose the the censored version of ethereum uh and you know ultimately a lot of state will collect there and uh like they are the true dictators over uh which ethereum a fork gets adopted and which doesn't uh can you talk a bit about some of this right so I really like the way that you describe this process where we start with an automatic fork and that trickles in to the social layer where it's being fought out and one of the things that you can Envision is the fork is automatic this automatically spins up you know a Futures Market where you have these two tokens competing out and then even before the fork happens you have kind of a a declared winner now to your to your question around you know could there be some impediments to to forking at the at the social layer you know infrastructure like like usdc might be compelled to go through uh and and choose the the sensoring fork and I guess there's there's two answers here like one is that um it's it's important to Pace ourselves right it's important to do these Forks slowly if not very slowly so we have two types of consensus right we have the machine consensus which operates on them on the time scale of seconds and then we have the human consensus which operates on the time scale of of of of weeks and so one of the things that's important to do is for the the automatic forking to happen with a a lot of of of of time in advance and my specific suggestion here is that a an automatic Fork should only happen at most you know let's say with at least 30 days of of lead time and it must happen on the first Wednesday of the month at 12 pm UTC I kind of just created the selling point out of nowhere um you know I'm I guess you could call that you know shelling Point design but you know trying to find something creditably neutral where we agree ahead of time that this is when we Fork so that at the at the very least the schedule has been uh set ahead of time and it allows for the the social layer to to do its work of you know debating and lobbying and all of these things the second aspect is around the ability of gracefully winding down right so if you look at a at a at a project like usdc they may well choose the sensored fork but what will happen is that if we allow the social layer to gracefully unwind then they'll just lose most of their business people will withdraw the usdc um you know for you know real US Dollars and and exit usdc or what they might do is they might dump usdt usdc for another stable coin like usdt and then arbitragers you know can go buy this usdc at a small discount and then do the withdrawal there and so you know we might see over a process of a few weeks usdc go from a mammoth let's say 100 billion dollar stablecoin project to like a a much smaller let's say 10 billion dollar uh stable coin um a project and so when you're designing these uh applications whether or not fully trustless and truly decentralized Finance or whether whether they are you know they have the centralized component what I think we're going to see is a desire from the social layer to have this graceful wind down process that takes you know that takes let's say the on the order of weeks if there isn't such a graceful wind down then the alternative would be like an instant collapse which is something that we don't want and I think the the market will be prioritizing products that provide this this graceful wind down in the case where they themselves kind of become compromised and this is a similar philosophy to what the the the the core developers and the researchers are trying to do we're trying to Design Systems where there is always um an exit hatch even if the creators of the projects are you know go go go go malicious yeah I feel like this is the the ultimate exit um hatch and kind of the The Last Exit hash and hatch and maybe the the most powerful is this kind of ability to fork and create an original ethereum that is uh completely uncensored and of course we haven't gone into the details there but my impression is there can be some Forks that um slash uh parts of the stake that uh are originally censoring and we can get into that but I want to get into the principle I know we're talking about like recovery here but the threat of a fork is also preventative in and of itself is it not because we are effectively sayings that you know as the social uh the community the the layers here of ethereum is saying hey powers that be if you decide to censor we plant a fork and by the way if we have automated forking we'll detect that automatically and it'll happen the second Wednesday of the month at 12 p.m UTC time right so they can see on chain and that in itself acts as a preventative mechanism for would-be sensors to say nope you know instead of censoring if it's illegal in my jurisdiction to uh to provide validation services and staking Services I'll just discontinue those Services because I don't want to actually get into a place where I'm on the the bad end of a fork and I'm losing depositors money can you talk about that Dimension a little bit yeah you said it very well where basically education and infrastructure that we can put forward out there acts as a as a deterrent because now you know participants in this crypto economic game can be more more rational and it turns out that the equilibrium is for the chain to not be censored anytime you have a chain which is censored that is that puts the attacker in a precarious position because they can be forked off and and and they can be penalized one of the things we haven't talked about is the the penalization but basically what we have as a at our disposal is the ability to completely wipe off the stake of of the attacker and so the the the mere fact that this infrastructure exists kind of from a rational standpoint should prevent the attack from ever happening this is very similar by the way to optimistic rollups right with optimistic roll ups Engineers have spent countless hours to design this this fraud proof game where if if there ever is fraud then someone can you know provably show to the optimistic roll up that there has been fraud and then revert and correct the the the states but if you do commit fraud on an optimistic roll up you get financially penalized and so the the equilibrium from a crypto economic game perspective is that the fraud never happens now one thing uh could could be said whereby you know it's all good and it's all good to be uh resistant in in theory you know and from a rational standpoint but an attacker you know might be kind of kind of stupid and kind of um very determined to make an attack and I'll go do it anyway and I think the the best that we can hope for here is actually go through the process of forking off and prove to the world that it is not just Theory but it's actual practice and ironically this would put ethereum in a stronger position from a censorship resistance standpoint because it will already have gone through the legwork of recovering from a 51 attack and so it would be really really stupid for the attacker to try that a second time because the first time round they failed and they got penalized is this a saying like we dare you yeah we dare you I Dare You nation states to censor us it's it's one thing if for example perhaps it was like the CIA that was censoring ethereum and the CIA had 51 of stake teeth I don't think there would be too much controversy or much less controversy at the very least if the ethereum community was like you know what let's just slash the entirety of the CIA we'll just delete all of their ether like that that would be one scenario I think a far more like reasonable and expected scenario is something a little bit along the lines of staking as a service protocols where they actually didn't have to buy The Ether themselves it was actually retail investors that bought the ether and then they just staked with coinbase and slashing coinbase if coinbase is the one doing the censoring but they're doing the censoring with their customers deposits all of a sudden that becomes a lot less untenable like I don't really think the crypto Community would shed a tear if we slashed the CIA but if we slashed you know millions of retail Investors Savings of ether uh because they were taking with coinbase that would become a lot more politically hairy Justin what would you say is a solution to this scenario where it's actually retail deposits into a centralized staking provider that's actually doing the censoring right so there's several answers here like the first one is is education and lead time if there is censorship that's discovered we want to give people the time to unstake from coinbase the other thing is that we want people to understand even before they stake on coinbase that there is a risk associated with with staking like there are real costs to delegation and this is one of the reasons why in the long term I think solo staking has a real shot as becoming dominant versus the vessel is dedicated as staking through pools and you know one cost which is obvious in in coinbase is that you have to pay a 25 fee on the rewards so you've been diligently staking on coinbase for two years let's say you've made full if in profits and one of the if it just goes away and is absorbed by by coinbase through fees but there's other costs to delegation one is this idea of Insider risk where not your keys not your attestations which means that an Insider within coinbase who has access to the staking Keys which by the way are hotkeys they're not they're not in Cold Storage they can basically have like perform a ransom attack where they can say hey coinbase customers um we are going to slash you um unless you pay up a ransom and the game theory is basically for the victim of the ransom to pay up the The Ransom and that that that's kind of uh a cost which is not visible uh but it's it's there and then another you know cost to delegation which which is not visible is this uh this Outsider risk where basically the community the social layer outside of consensus might declare consensus to be a bad actor and then penalize so when we penalize we actually have a certain amount of power at our disposal so one thing that we can do is and it's like the most straightforward is to do a a soft fork and the idea of a soft Fork is by whereby you the minority chain ignores the attestations of the attacker and leads to the attacker leaking leaking out basically accumulating so-called inactivity penalties and the the best move for the attacker is to basically exit from the from the staking duties uh go through the exit queue and then recover the and withdraw their Eve um but if we're going to force through 51 of the stake to go through the execute the execute is going to last quite a long time like several months and during these several months there's going to be some inactivity penalties that accumulated and that might make up let's say a fairly small penalty you know on the order of one or two percent so that's that I think is is something which is acceptable from the social layer for coin-based customers to be suffering one or two percent for you know putting their stake in the custodian which ended up uh censoring now they are like stronger options at a disposal namely the the the option to do um uh either hard fork or soft Fork which completely wipes out the the the the the the the stake of the attacker and I think you know going back to this idea of being maximally credibly neutral in our forking strategies I think there's there's two forking strategies which stand out as being credibly neutral the first one is you push attacking validators to the exit queue their if is kind of Frozen effectively in the execute for a small amount of time a few months and they also incur this the small penalty and then if the attack happens a second time by the same attacker then in that case the the next reasonable thing to do which is credibly neutral is to slash a hundred percent and then there you basically remove the ability to to do an attack a third time but in the process of the during this forced uh exit like the the the customers of coinbase are going to realize that something went really wrong and you know it would be foolish of them to go ahead and restake with coinbase knowing that the second you know most natural thing to do is to slash everything I want to make two points here I mean the first point is that this is only possible this kind of like inactivity leak and and complete slashing of the stake is only process possible in proof of stake was not an Avenue ethereum had available to it in proof of work it's not an Avenue that that Bitcoin has available to it unless it I guess changes its uh core hashing algorithm and resets everyone from scratch which is a lot different than this um and what we're seeing here is kind of a defined escalation path that uh the ethereum community can start to distribute and educate people on so that hopefully these risks start to get priced into the yield of a more centralized staking provider like yes it's good yield but you have to take into account these centralization risks the second point I want to make is we keep using coinbase as an example and I think that's uh maybe service to coinbase that they've done a good job they're the kind of the largest um uh staking provider in the U.S and one that's most at least in the US most connected to kind of retail but there's also evidence that sort of the the equilibrium that we talked about the game theoretic equilibrium is is playing out because coinbase is nowhere close to uh you know uh creating a a censorship only validation pool and staking pool indeed I think Brian Armstrong a publicly as in the last week or two came out and said if they were ever asked by authorities to not process to censor some transactions at the Block production validator level uh they would rather discontinue their entire business than proceed in that censorship so this is like the charitable explanation of that is Brian Armstrong's been in crypto he has strong crypto values and that's the reason why he's doing it because he he believes in the principles of decentralization you want to take the cynical explanation it's also that he realizes that censorship puts coinbase down a path closer to mutually assured destruction and he's trying to avoid that at all costs so I I just think all of these Dynamics are very interesting in this social slashing capability is incredibly powerful as a deterrence as well as kind of a recovery method maybe you two have comments on that and then David I think you had a question no I think you summarized it very well like there's some very interesting Dynamics at play but ultimately the heuristic is that the defender is in the position of power and anytime the attacker comes in and senses um that's an unstable equilibrium and they they stand to be penalized just to really drive this point home there's just conversations around uh the illegitimacy of penalizing any retail depositor in a centralized staking service and like we we take our property rights very very seriously in this crypto world it's one of these core pillars that I would say crypto stands on is that property rights are the thing the thing that you do not violate the most like don't break property rights that's what crypto stands on uh cryptography is meant to instantiate property rights but I will make and we we've alluded to this and I just want to make this super explicit when you decide to stake your ether on ethereum you are giving up some certain element of property rights and giving the ethereum protocol control over your ether that is what it means to stake your ether you are staking your ether that you will behave a certain way if you want to behave in any particular way that you want to and have the strongest property rights possible don't stake your ether because then that means that you if you're staking your ether you are committing to accepting slashing penalties or any sort of other penalties and so if you are retail depositor who's choosing to stake you are taking on some sort of responsibility or some sort of risk that is uh super more powerful than your property rights you are saying like I agree to the rules and laws of the ethereum protocol beyond my rights to my own ether and whatever outcome happens as a result of mistaking is what I agree to and that's why we stake and so this conflation of oh you can't slash coinbase because those are retail depositors well actually the responsibility was on retail to choose their staking service provider correctly and if they're staking service provider as malicious that is a responsibility that they are behooven to and that that was their choice and so I I'd like to just really drive that point home is that when you choose to stake you are actually giving up your property rights to the ethereum protocol and if you choose to stake with a centralized service provider you are trusting that they are aligned with the ethereum protocol or else they will also be slashed Justin how do you feel about this yeah no that that's exactly right and there there is this this meme circulating which I think is a valid one that you know when you're staking it's basically like the the risk minimized interest rates but there's a huge caveat here which is it's only if you you're solo staking with your own Keys like as as soon as you're delegating your forfeiting this risk minimization aspect um and so you know I I think we really need to do a a bigger focus on on Solo solo staking and one of the good news here is that there's many improvements that are coming to solo staking so and and there's like like about 10 of them I'll just list list a few things to be excited about one is propose a builder separation this basically removes the requirement for validators to be to be block building it's just one less task that they have to do mev's moving how does that improve solo staking it improves it because it removes the variance in Mev what will happen with block building is that every once in a while you get really lucky and you get to build a block and then you you you get an outside reward for this one single slot and so that leads to like very spiky returns and you want to smooth that out and maybe smoothing smoothers the Mev as the name suggests anti-slashing Hardware no more slashing accidental or not so right now as a solo sticker the best infrastructure that we have is for you to have your staking key be a hotkey on your on your computer but really what we want to be in the position of having the staking key be in a a piece of of Hardware that does slashing protection on your behalf basically this piece of Hardware will track what messages have been signed in the past and make sure that you don't sign a message which accidentally slashes you and maybe someone can you know write some some code that will uh turn for example a ledger Hardware wallet into anti-slashing hardware for validators another thing is single slot finality we're going to be in a position where making deposits and making withdrawals will be much much faster thanks to single slot finality and that will yet again improve the experience of being a solo validator there's also going to be statelessness and data availability sampling and ZK VMS where basically the the hardware cost of being a validator are going to go down to almost zero like even less than than the Raspberry Pi like the only thing like in the end game that you're gonna have to be verifying is this the zero knowledge proof and just making a few queries uh to to the network and not even have to download the data you just do data availability sampling these like very powerful technological things that bring us to a position where being a solo validator is almost no effort we're also going to have technology that is going to dramatically reduce the the the the size that you need to become a validator like one of the reasons that people are taking on coinbase is because they don't have 32 if well you know with technology like like DVT and and secret shared validators and also like improvements to the protocol where we have these like potentially Dynamic um the the the deposit sizes and variable deposit sizes that's going to improve the the user experience for stickers and we all might also like Envision things like private deposits and and private staking whereby in the process of participating in in staking you you have your privacy [Music] um preserved and like all of these things when you compare them to the cost of Delegation which we've gone through like operator fees inside a risk with Ransom attacks and outside the risk of social organization in my opinion like things tilt towards a solo staking but it's going to be a fairly long journey of incrementally improving solo staking yeah I think you're right about the the long journey of that and like I guess one thing I do think you're right that one of the biggest impediments to solo staking is having 32 eth right and if we're right and this is ultrasound money and we get to 10K and Beyond that's you know 320k so getting this down to like you know 16 eth or you know even four eth um you know I would think that would be a necessary precondition I guess the the other comment uh I would make is sometimes to your point about this being a slow process sometimes crypto doesn't realize uh the benefits of decentralization until that like quote-unquote tail risk event happens right and I don't think these are actual tail risk events because they happen pretty commonly but um you know everyone is talking about the virtues of uh centralized lending platforms versus D5 user experience is so much easier you know I just connects directly to my bank account all of these things and then we had Celsius right and like block five almost go insolvent as well and now we appreciate the benefits of being able to audit and see what's app actually backing the assets when we get a collateral loan or when we generate some interest on top of it but all of these things Justin so where does that leave us strategically positioned for a strong censorship attack how is ethereum position for that we talked about you know you summarize the weak censorship attack and you're like we have the tech we can actually defend against this uh do you feel the same about strong censorship yeah and I think the the strategy is kind of different if you're thinking in the short term the median term or or the or the long term like in in the short term I think one of the best things we can do is just education right education is you know something that we're doing right now right there's very little latency to reacting and and that's kind of addressing some of the thoughts you know that's been that's been circulating and kind of giving people uh you know the the knowledge that they need to to to believe in the in the long long term uh legitimacy of the of the roadmap I think what we want to be doing in the median term is you know showing some strength in terms of actually implementing in code um some some of these defenses um and and and kind of put putting forward you know some of the the the the the the the most low hanging um uh the defenses in place and this is this is something where we can take a a strategic approach in the sense that we can keep defenses in the back pocket and then bring them forward and prioritize them when when the need comes in like one of the dilemmas that we have within the the the the research team is do we prioritize features you know things like like sharding that kind of gives us all this this the scalability or do we prioritize security and I think where I've landed on uh personally is we want to prioritize features right because we want to remain competitive compared to other blockchains but we want to front load as much as possible the the security research right so we wanna be in a position where we really understand deeply these these uh crypto economic defenses and whenever we need to defend ourselves we have something ready in the back pocket we prioritize it and a few months later it's it's implemented uh on chain yeah I uh definitely agree with that and it you know it strikes me that we have definitely a lot of work to do on the on the social layer of how the the community would react if censorship started being implemented across the chain so like this is what I didn't understand the early days of my journey into crypto and Bitcoin was you know people would say to me it's like well what happens if if uh big there's some protocol kind of hack in Bitcoin and suddenly there's like a billion uh Bitcoin rather than 21 million uh in the early stages of my journey into crypto ads I legitimately worried about that well like you know code has errors and what happens if there's a hack that sort of thing now I know the mechanisms and how this works and of course with the Bitcoin Community would just do is uh create a fork where that maintains the social contract of 21 million it would not be an existential uh threat or risk to bitcoin there would be a blip there would be a mud on the face there would be uh definitely problems in the short run if suddenly Bitcoin was you know uh inflating at a billion a day a billion Bitcoin a day but the community would just Fork that out and adhere to the social contract of 21 million because that is written into the layer 0 of what Bitcoin is I think ethereum needs to also continue to write censorship resistance into its social contract and develop some of the plans that you were talking about as well um I guess as we kind of draw to a close with this episode Justin thank you so much for your time this has been a great positioning great getting us up to speed on the censorship resistance of ethereum now and in the future is how do you think this compares to other uh cryptocurrencies right so in our ultrasound money episode we talked about um you know Bitcoin is probably has more soundness than ethereum than ether the asset like pre-emerge you could still say Bitcoin is the the reigning Champion has the the soundness and is has the greatest monetary premium above and beyond uh ether right now now probably many of us don't think that will remain the case in the future um but what do you think about censorship resistance how is ethereum positioned relative to other chains say say Bitcoin or other uh alternative layer ones right now right so I guess there's there's two things to to consider here one is the the weak censorship and the other one is the the strong censorship so in terms of the weak censorship Bitcoin has an advantage over ethereum and the reason is that they have these very simple utxo transactions where there's no real Mev to be extracted and so the whole pipeline uh of Mev just collapses down to self-building so all the you know the the the concerns that we might have around Builders and relays and searches and whatever like that that like mostly collapses uh down on the other hand when we talk about strong censorship uh Bitcoin is in you know this the same position if not the worst position uh then that that than ethereum and the reason is that you know more than 51 of the uh you know economic majority basically the the holders of the scarce resource which is Hash rate could be compelled to to censor um and there's this kind of several reasons here like one is you know again around the lack of diversity so you know we've had uh you know miners for example leave China and go to to Texas for example well if we have you know just too much hash rate in the US then maybe uh uh miners in in the US could be compelled to to censor another thing that I that I haven't mentioned but is is very important as well is also the the concept of Economic Security which is how much how many dollars do you need to go just do a naive Brute Force 51 attack where you just buy the resource as opposed to caressing it and it turns out that in the case of Bitcoin it just it's it's dropping and I expect it to keep on dropping so right now there's around 200 million Terra hashes per second of of of hash rate and you can go on on bitmaine.com and you can buy miners uh you know for for 15 per Tera hash per second and so you know you you you you do the math and and buying the hardware will cost you roughly three billion dollars uh to go 51 uh attack Bitcoin of course you need to buy Transformers you need to buy racks you know you need to connect it to to to the to to to to to the grid and you know let's let's say very conservatively that you're doubling your costs you know that brings you to six billion dollars of Economic Security it's still peanuts in the grand scheme of things uh for for for for a nation states and so what I think we need to be doing is for ethereum not only focusing on jurisdictional diversity to reduce coercion but we also want to have trillions of dollars of Economic Security so that it's infeasible to buy your way in to to to a 51 uh percent attack and then the the other kind of final point which you you you you mentioned which is that from a recovery standpoint um Bitcoin and ethereum have very different um Solutions like one is is endogenous and the other one is uh exogenous so for for Bitcoin the way the only way that you can recover from a 51 percent attack is to basically repoint hash rate or or add in uh new hash rate and basically you're in a position where if you your context if you know the the real world is just too powerful then there's there's no way in which you can escape the the the censorship so if for example you believe that the US can go spend like a few billion dollars to to go buy Asics to to do censorship then they can go do that and permanently um 51 uh attack Bitcoin because there isn't this this ability to do like this in intrinsic recovery mechanism where a minority of the chain um basically penalizes and and slashes the the the the majority and so even if you have a bully which is extremely strong we can still uh survive that and basically create our own minority bubble and preserve the the the the the sovereignty of this independent Network state which is inferior Dustin thank you so much final question for you as we uh draw this to a close what's your confidence that ethereum will be censorship resistant then in in five years to an acceptable degree and then how about in 10. so if we're talking about weak censorship then I I think ethereum in you know five to ten years will be you know close to close to Perfection um you know it will be futile to try and censor transactions because you you just won't be successful um in terms of the strong censorship I actually believe that today ethereum is already extremely resistant to this to this strong censorship I think you know we we have inside us you know most implicitly and culturally we kind of feel this we're on the same wavelength that you know we do want to preserve censorship resistance I think the next step is just making making this making this more explicit um and kind of articulating this this intuition that that that that we all have um and going beyond that not just articulating that in words but also articulating that in code which is is something we could do but I think if ethereum were to be attacked before we have all these code defenses we would be more than happy uh as a community to to perform a a a a manual recovery of a 51 attack there you go bankless Nation that's where we're going to end it today uh Justin Drake Thank you so much for joining us and walking through the steps on what it's going to require to to make an uncensorable ethereum appreciate you thanks for having me action items for you bankless Nation you know we're going to include a few we're going to think hard about this and include a links a few links to you to get involved in the solo staking Community that's pretty important if we want to preserve censorship resistance at the base level and also uh some opportunities to donate to crypto logic Lobby groups who are fighting for our rights in various jurisdictions around the world rights to private Keys rights to privacy some of these basic rights that we were talking about in the episode we'll also include a link to some other episodes we've done with Justin Drake including ultrasound money episode there's one in particular if you haven't listened to it around cryptography and the moon math that is coming at us and uh you know the bullishness that we see from from cryptography uh Justin I'm about to close and I usually give the risks and disclaimers at this section but would you like to take them from me this time for sure yes it will be an honor crypto is risky you could lose what you put in including your stake if you put it with a centralized custodian but we're headed west this is the frontier
