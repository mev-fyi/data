what do we need to do in the next 18 months to have our next bull market i think if you look back historically like what are the metrics right like what are the things that people measure in the ico period it was capital raising and then we got a much better scoreboard still not a great one which was d5 pulse and it was who is putting money into these contracts that's the only like who's got skin in the game right what we've seen emerge now is crypto fees and i think in my mind crypto fees is the next scoreboard and the fact that there are multiple d5 protocols beating bitcoin is a very powerful meme right like if we get to a point where the top 10 protocols in terms of like revenue generation whether they're distributed to token holders or not but who is paying to use the thing if all of those things are d5 protocols and ethereum that's a very powerful representation of what is actually going on here right that is going to be the game that we play over the next six months and it's the closest thing to like fundamentals we've ever had
