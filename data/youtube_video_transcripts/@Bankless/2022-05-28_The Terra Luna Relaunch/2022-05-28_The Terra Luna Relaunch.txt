it looks like luna is rising from the ashes tara 2.0 i guess i should say so luna is a token tara is the chain of course there's going to be a new luna as well and basically what they're doing is relaunching this blockchain network as a layer one without the algo stablecoin this time so there seems to be some acknowledgement hey i think that was kind of a bad idea and they are distributing luna tokens to the luna classic so i guess the old luna network is now called luna classic old chain luna classic a new chain is currently called okay and they're giving it to a community pool first of all then they're giving an allotment to the pre-attack luna holders and then the post attack yeah oh my god i can't believe i'm reading that out and i didn't even notice that propaganda um but absolutely i refuse to call it an attack now that you said that
