foreign ation on the Pod today we have David Phelps who is one of the founding members of joked out Eco Dao and Cal fun in this episode we talk about building regen dowels we talk about the infinite Garden of projects on the fauna and the organisms that are all building all on top of each other and how together they create an ecosystem that's Gestalt is greater than the sum of its parts so quite a fun episode with David I really like to hang out with the OG Builders and hear what they're thinking how they're thinking about things and David is just one of those so a pretty fun episode without further Ado I give you David Phelps working in web3 is awesome but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus

think that we've been planning this episode for a while so let's get into it what are you working on uh so I'm I'm uh building building this thing called joked out uh which is onshine governance um so a way for any online community to be able to make execute and reward decisions you keep me going I'm just going to recite the the entire Spiel so cut me off yeah well no I think that we want to get the Spiel but I was hoping that you would tell it to me as a joke since it's called joke though absolutely not no no you're gonna have to stake tokens for that and like pay me for that like this is crypto I don't I don't do things for free that's right yeah I'll have to uh incentivize that behavior well take us take it yeah take us down the rabbit hole so so so how do I use joked out yeah so uh super simple uh you set up what we call a contest and a contest means that as a contest Creator you put a prompter community that prompt could be like hey what should we focus on are like hey here's a proposal can you submit another version of it or hey here's a project I want to build does anybody want to build this right or hey I'm a writer I'm writing on uh you know my newsletter what topics do you want me to cover um it could be any sort of prompt you want right in the submissions period uh Community can submit options uh we call them proposals right uh in response and then in the voting period they can vote on their favorites um and so what is special about this is um first of all that communities now are actually having active say and being able to submit and say what they want right they're not just voting uh that's as as their voice they're actually having voice to say the kind of things that they want right second um you design who gets to submit and who gets to vote so if you want just your core team to submit options in your community to vote on them which is how dow governance has always been done to date you can do that but you can also do the reverse right you can have your community ultimate options and then just to core team votes on them you could have like a hackathon where like everyone submits their project right and then like a jury of top people in the space vote on their favorites um you can have a totally separate Community to it right you could say I could go governance vampire attack the git coin Community by saying hey GTC holders I'm here dropping you the submission token I want your best ideas and I'm going to reward the best of you with my token and I'm going to steal you all from Gekko and and bring me over into my into my nefarious project uh that I'm working on as well and then the final thing right is that in the voting period because it's ranked Choice voting um it effectively means nobody is voting against something publicly you're just voting for um for the options that are most meaningful to you and so you actually get like a good measure of like people's passion so if you're doing a grants round right instead of having like every single Grant be individually approved um yes or no you can actually see which of those grants a community cares most about and you can allocate your resources to right so it feels like it's kind of a collective intelligence tool token gated or maybe like a modular approach to uh to building collective intelligence yeah I like I like that yeah you know I was I was I was chatting this this morning with a friend of mine about how you could use this for prediction markets and being like you know could you could you use this as an educational tool where people would be like here's what I think you know the economy is going to look like six months from now um and then we all predict what it's going to look like and the point of that is not actually you know to get useful data on what the economy will look like it's to have this kind of gamified structure if you're learning where whoever's right wins a reward everyone else has to explain why they're wrong right and so you can start using this in like educational settings yeah collective intelligence you could use it for you know maybe some more accurate prediction markets if you're really careful with who gets to vote and submit um but completely yeah it's about unlocking like the actual potential of like creative contribution for people to be able to participate which is you know I hope what the unlock of dows is but not something that we've seen a lot to date because you can use it to select better jokes or is it because the logo is a joker up here on the top left that is yeah it's because we started with a logo and then we were like [ __ ] what are we gonna call this I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but I'm going to uh you know I don't I don't know what we call this thing no so um there's a few reasons one is that we started with a proof of concept called the joke raise uh which still runs every week were you voting your favorite joke your goal is to get second place if you put too many votes you go to First you lose um and so that was really the proof of concept to kind of test out my Theses with like the easiest and most fun way to do it uh you know would this would having a mechanism like this build relationships where people are incentivized to collaborate with each other socially and then do this you know every week and um it worked and so that that's part of it I think the other the other pretentious answers that I really like to give uh for this one um one is that uh jokes are the original decentralized technology uh jokes are passed down P2P uh we have no idea who the original teller was we have don't care who the original teller was what we care about is how someone's inflection of that joke uh is unique right and so even if you've heard the joke a bunch of times it's about the telling of it right more than this about the content um I think that that's it's a really beautiful distributed system of like um yeah of this decentralized creation that has no single person who's created this it's retold every time in the process um I think the other thing is to think like you know kind of the ethos of joke is we're you know we kind of I think the words we use are like batshit Anarchist and like uh it's it's pretty important to us to think that like crypto is kind of a batshit Anarchist thing it's like the fact that you can take anybody else's work and Fork it build on top of it without asking their permission right and just like all kind of contribute to Innovation on top of each other uh permissionlessly like like that's that's something where it's like the fundamental ethos I think of crypto and why I get excited by it is it's not too serious you can't take anyone else's work too seriously you always have to take it it's a little bit of a joke uh and then think about how you can improve on it take it play with it uh Etc and so that's like that's why I love it the designer the the sort of like website designer in me likes this idea of starting with something that's as fun and easy and light-hearted as telling a joke and then if you get people using it going through the loop of actually using it for that then you can actually okay well now you've got enough data points that you can start adding complexity or seriousness to it um to that same infrastructure and they can actually use it for real things because a lot of these governance problems are like governance feels like work and if you can make it feel like fun to start and then get the the data emissions that are actually useful for economic means out of that then I think that it's just a better way to approach getting people to to use uh to use the system yeah I think like what are the issues of governance well one is it's not fun so if you actually want decentralized communities to participate like it needs to be fun and it's like look the move over the past 10 years in culture has been completely towards like interactive fan communities like you look at Tick Tock right you look at like successful YouTube creators like they create interactive fan communities where they're listening responding to their fans right in this way Dows are just a version of that those are like just the outcome of this like you know move over the past 10 years for communities to have more say but the reason they do that is not the financial incentives the reason they do those the social incentives that this is a fun thing to do um and that's the thing that we've just been missing in Dallas like if you have to vote and you're publicly saying no against a friend of yours you're not going to want to do that so it's not a fun process to engage in right um I think also governance is not paid I would add is a big issue like you know really difficult governance like making big financial decisions like that is work and that is work that requires a lot of effort a lot of time a lot of thought uh and deserves to be compensated I think accordingly as well and so that's why building on chain is really important for us it's also a way to be able to compensate people um for doing governance and then the question is like you know who should be making these decisions and that's a that's a larger longer tangent but I think like the way we built it was to be as module as possible so you have the design space to say who you want to submit who you want to vote and you as a community can decide how you design that governance process in terms of who you want to have say and how much they yeah it's kind of like a return for me of user-centric design in in crypto terms because I think in 2017 there was this feeling that like yes if you take a human and you put a token in them you'll get out in action it's just like people aren't that rational nor do they give a [ __ ] about your like token that you're doing and you know and I like you know starting from the other end I think so like like I think about that a lot right that like web two one you know like and became big purely through social incentives right there's no Financial incentives in like in web 2 and that's part of the the you know argument that web3 has against web to is like the fact that you are being monetized your data is being harvested you're making money for corporations but it's not like people don't know that they fundamentally are fine losing all that Financial upside um because the social incentives are so great right and so like 99 of people will happily give up you know Financial upside in order to have a good time with friends and like why wouldn't they um that's the logical thing you should do um and so yeah I think like and you know until web 3 is first of all it's easy to use this web too but also has the same social incentives like web threes you know opportunity is not replacing social incentives with financial incentives that's what we've seen to date and it hasn't worked like web3's potential is adding Financial incentives to social incentives for people to get fairly compensated um for the value kind of reminds me of this idea that like if you take something and if you reward someone with extrinsic motivation for doing action X and then you withdraw the extrinsic motivation they will stop doing that action but if you start where someone is already intrinsically doing it right not only do you like you have the intrinsic plus the extrinsic motivation but um you know it just feels like a more solid foundation for building these these uh these web3 tools and it's kind of like wide bear markets of these self-fulfilling prophecies right because as soon as things start to go bad then there's no opportunity to make money here then everyone else withdraws so it's not just like people with drunk because they're scared and because they're losing money and and it's also because like they were only here because they could make money and now that we're in an environment where we can't we lose all our users like you know if fundamentally we can only have users when prices are going up like that's yeah that's definitely that's definitely not a sustainable system yeah and one of the things I like about the region web 3 space is like people are kind of here a little bit intrinsically you have to want to build it for that reason and so uh you know the reason we have three space there's less Capital but there's not less action in in the bear Market this time around completely yeah I think that that's that's also what's great about the bear Market is it does you know wipe out a lot of people uh good and bad but it also means that the people who stick around or the people who are you know they're the builders and the ones who are committed for ideological reasons uh rather than just you know pure Financial speculation um which is nice but hopefully it means we can find a use case for others that doesn't just your financial speculation as well yeah well you know I'm curious um okay so we went we covered joked Al um you're also associated with Cal Fund in in ecodile so I'm wondering if we could if we could cover those real quick yep yeah so so Cal finder is a web Three Angels Collective that I started um where we're actually not a fund uh we're not a Dao uh and we're not a cow so um which was I would say the top three things that we tend to be mistaken for uh especially especially the cow um so yeah the the idea you know account fund is a work in progress I see it as kind of like a 20-year project in some ways um and it's really about being able to get a bunch of angels together um who can are all builders in the space and um being able to you know collectively work together to Source deals share deals uh and invest and like what gets exciting about this I think is like on the angel side where you have a bunch of angels who can benefit not only from sharing deals but from each other's Insight right where now you have top devs as well as top UI ux people top product people top Founders top business Minds um all very different backgrounds and very different parts of the space who can all share perspective and learn a lot from each other which is good for are investing but it's also just fun as a social activity and then for Founders they can just you know in one go meet a bunch of web3 you know Builders um who they can work with as well and like you know part of my excitement about Dao is like uh long-term imagining a future where Builders are the ones who are really owning um a lot of the let's not call it equity it's called Uh entities that they're associated with um and and so I think this is you know in in some roughly a very very like small first kind of step towards that is really thinking like how can builders work together in order to like really support each other and support each other's projects right okay got it so that's Cal swap um uh to fund have fun alas Cal swap I would be a good deal richer than I am excuse me um got it and then so Eco Dao oh yeah so does the the the the first I started and so you could have is is what um I'm calling a pop-up doll um this has become I don't think I came up with this term um the idea of a pop-up Tower is like something that that's really great with Dows which is that they can exist when they want to and they don't exist when they don't um if you are looking at buildings something that just needs sustainable Revenue in order to keep itself afloat and it doesn't need to become a multi-billion Dollar business uh it doesn't need to accrue massive Revenue it's just there for the sake of being able to sustain itself financially I think that's actually a huge unlock uh for a lot of projects and so you could always kind of like that it's almost like a high school club in a way where it's like a bunch of people who are passionate about a cause using crypto to make this thing financially sustainable without any sort of goal of this becoming you know a giant Enterprise or anything like that and so the you know the way it works is um we we typically will sell nfts from artists uh uh and um yeah and and then we split so 50 goes to the artist 25 goes to ecological causes 25 goes to the Dow and the Dow throws events and the events uh can be like parties listening experiences Etc um with that money and and what's really nice about this is the nft becomes an access pass um to go to these events it becomes an access pass to join this community of other people who are ideologically aligned and if you want it becomes a status symbol uh in a way of saying that you gave money to uh you know support these good causes I was inspired by moonshot pods quite a bit for this um for for what it's worth uh was it was a huge inspiration in in coming up with yika Dao and I think you know part of my thought was like right now donations the way the donations are done is like you give money to uh you know like the rainforest and it's tax deductible but like fundamentally that's money that's coming out of your wallet that you're not going to get back and like nfts for me were really exciting but the idea of like well what if you like bought an nft because you could always resell it later maybe then if your money is going towards the rainforest you're going to be willing to put in 10 20 times as much money as you would have otherwise because this is money you could actually get back right this is money that might in your mind constitute an investment of some kind um so like uh or at least just you know maybe it doesn't make any money but it breaks even um and or even if it loses money you lose 50 but you don't lose 100 um and so like all of that just you know makes nfts as a fundraising model like a lot more exciting um than I think traditional donations and so that was really the impetus for it um we've done three events over the past year um we're currently this is Alpha planning another one for East Denver uh as well that we're really excited by yeah well thanks for your kind kind words about moonshot Bots that was of course an nft that Austin and I launched that was designed to fund public goods uh so basically you bought the nft you got you got public goods and it's it's neat to see this sort of like genetic or I guess memetic uh cross-pollination between the two projects and uh David I really appreciate that you still have your moonshot Bot as your as your profile picture on Twitter well I think I'll always have my moonshot pod as my vfp I love it's my favorite uh piece of crypto is that a term uh that I own and so yeah I I I love that project so much and I love wrapping it um and uh having this association with this terribly really quite badly gone robot uh it's an 8-bit pixel robots it's good for an 8-bit uh pixel robot yeah yeah there we go for eight Bots is free yeah yeah APS is pretty fun little anecdote on tokenization um uh is that the moonshot Bots were live on the get coin Avatar builder for about a year and a half and people didn't care at all and then you make them into an nft and you put them on open C and then you raise three million dollars for Republicans so crypto is weird man well done yeah those same to you I mean I think David you're such a prolific Dow Creator I mean California uh it seems like you're really kind of breadth first launching things taking them from zero to one and then doubling down on them building communities that's that's the thread that I would draw through all three of the projects that you just told me about but I'm curious how you would draw the thread between everything that you've been involved in uh maybe those three projects are just to start yeah I I do think that like lowering the barriers to experimentation is like one of the greatest things we can do in this space like if you can allow a bunch of people to each put in like 0.1 each and then decide what they want to put cause they put you know what what cause they want to put that towards and maybe that's a donation right they're deciding we're all going to donate together we're going to maximize their impact by Poland's Capital but maybe it's like they want to start a company or they want to like you know launch something that's a fundamental use case projectile obviously right but it's also just like I think a fundamental thing that I'm excited by which is like letting anybody participate in these systems you know very low friction um and being able to pull capital in like ways that can be really meaningful and so I do think yeah experimentation um is kind of the best thing we can be doing right now like uh I do subscribe to that you know um School thought that like Dows are operate um almost as like this you know almost as like uh again a system of biodiversity right that each one can be forked can like build a new species many of those will be mutants and die other ones will Thrive uh the idea that evolution is like a better version is absolutely absolutely not true uh the way Evolution works is by creating an ecosystem of different creatures that all support and sustain each other right and so like real evolution is about creating maximizing diversity for you know and experimenting as much as possible to have different projects that can support each other that might not even survive on their own they might need each other to survive right as well and I think like that's where like you know forkability but um also composability gets really exciting with Daz being able to to work together and so yeah being able to experiment you know freely I think is important I definitely see like my my calling at this point is very much the joke the joke first uh and like very much focused on building out these contests as um I think you know these Primitives for communities to be formed um and to build relationships with each other and to build generate actual sustainable Revenue in a way that hasn't been done before but one thing I'll mention that I think is really exciting is like within the joke Universe um there's this thing called the joke race Council where every week people play the joke race they vote on their favorite jokes the winner is number two it's Minted as an nft the nft holders joined this thing called the joke uh raise Council and it it also this is another you know moonshot Bots inspiration like it's really devoted to public goods funding like it's built up a treasury of about 15 East um so far uh from sales and um uh Jihad and ldf are going to be taking this over now um and are going to start deploying that Capital towards just the craziest wildest experimentation possible and like that's really the point is to say like can we build out this universe by having a micro incubator for experimental projects that actually can give some utility to tokens as well and so my focus is not on that my focus is on contests I have you know this vision of what I want to build there and why I'm excited by it but within that broader Mandate of of the community there is this wonderful Community that's building income is going to be able to deploy it um to to all sorts of experiments and I think that that's it's a really exciting model um to to see because I do think experimentation is like absolutely at the core of what it is exciting about crypto it's the fact that you know if you want to start a new company in web 2 you had to start it from the ground up right you want to start something in web 3 you just Fork somebody else's code and you build on top of it lowering the barriers of experimentation is like fundamentally the great use case of of this yeah it's really interesting I mean I think that there's a lot of uh directions that we should go that we could go but um maybe maybe setting a frame and and just running on your evolutionary narrative there I've been really inspired by this this concept and and thought for Maya Maya Gucci the EF executive director that ethereum is like an infinite garden and that you have this ecosystem of fauna and organisms and plants that are all growing on top of each other and sort of developing in symbiosis with the each other uh get coin to joked out to Cal fun to eat Global to uniswap and because they're all modular components they all do one thing and do them well they each occupy an ecosystem Niche and then they interoperate with each other to create an ecosystem that's greater that's super modular that's that's greater than the sum of its parts would be individually if you just added them up one plus one equals three and so like setting the frame of this evolutionary narrative in this infinite Garden is kind of how I see these things sort of codepending on each other interrelating with each other and um in the interdependence of them becomes really interesting as they evolve over time like Joe Lubin said it doesn't take a killer app it it takes a killer ecosystem right so um you know I think I I think that uh it's with that frame that I would want to continue the episode and talk about how these things all all relate to each other and and how your projects are yeah I I love that and like I yeah I make no secret of the ways that these projects have taken inspiration now and now this has been an incredible inspiration um for everything I think we're doing with joke right now um so and you know get coin it's like we used get coin Grant rounds to be able to raise our funds for you could out right uh initially like um we wouldn't exist you know without these projects in terms of the inspiration that they've been ideologically but we also wouldn't exist with that a lot of them practically um just like the the tools there right to have Micro incubators Etc which is in some ways what I think Bitcoin is uh have just been immensely powerful for us yeah well um I I I I you know you know and likewise same to you I I don't know whether bitcoin's planning on doing it or not but I know that they were kicking around when I was there uh playing with joked out in order to do some uh collective intelligence things for Grant skating and fraud defense and stuff like that so it'd be neat to see the tools further interoperate I like the idea that like your protocol supports some someone early and then they come back and they support you as you're building out your ecosystem uh that's what it means to be in the infinite Garden together I think so I I think like one thing I'd like to see more of um with these kind of like incubators is like if if you're a brand if you're a decentralized brand I think this is a question that kind of plagues nft projects your decentralized brand how are you giving quote-unquote Equity to the people who build you out um and and this has been a massive problem for NFP projects right because like you know um their holders are rich people who like can afford a lot of money to like buy a digital collectible uh and a JPEG and then those are not the people are incentivized to actually build so then you need to go get people to actually build out the value of your brand right but who are those people like well you you know nouns found a really good model for this which is recurring contests with a collective financing right it's like board Apes it's like every you know individual owner just owns rights to their individual eight but there's no Collective financing from all the ape folders coming together and sharing financing towards the project as a whole nouns I think was was really kind of like a 10x for me 10x Improvement on this by like letting everybody collectively to play Capital but I think the question the question still is there which is like okay Builders maybe now are getting paid but are they getting quote unquote Equity like are they getting upside in the brand that they're creating and it's like if the nfts are only held by like the richest people and then how are the builders actually getting some sort of upside here as well and and yeah I think um that's it's just a question that that kind of still plagues the ecosystem and there hasn't been a really great answer for um but something I'm increasingly spending I would say a lot of time thinking about which is like you know how are we really giving Builders proper incentive to be part of these Brands and to help build them out and to be part of those communities and what does it mean to bring people in give them tokens and give them upside in that way as well because I think that's that really feels a connection generation of like what's what's going to be yeah well well two points I want to make there one is that I envisioned in my mind's eye this sort of Dao of dowels in which there's a mesh network of governance tokens and projects that all rise together and as opposed to the old world where they compete with each other for Mark because you're available in each other out yeah rising and falling together it seems really exciting like if each of these projects did token swaps with each other then they would rise and fall together um and then the SEC the second thing that I'll put out there before I evaluate back to you is this idea of um the guy I learned this from Gregory landwa who's the past guest of the podcast but this idea of uh keystone species which are basically species upon which entire ecosystems rely on so like on Earth then like humans are a keystone species because we have dogs and like corn and apples and all these in rodents in New York or depend on on humans right so like in crypto in the infinite Garden what are the keystone species and I want to say that like unispop is likely a keystone species because it's where everyone goes to get liquidity to trade token X for token y um you know I I do think that like you know right now there's a battle to see who's going to be the keystone species of l2s like who's gonna what's the DNA that's gonna go in all these different ltus and app chains that people we're going to launch but nouns because you were excited about nouns it made me or it just like feels like one consistent through fares like nouns it created this like punctuated equilibrium in this ecosystem that really is healthy and and and regenerative around them and so I just wanted to call out this idea of uh keystone species and also uh doll of Dallas before I before I volley it back to you yeah I I I I love that idea uh I would say every species of keystone species in some ways you look at parasite it's just incredible how they have to like imitate three different species behaviors a lot of times or understand that at some level to evolve um but but yeah like I don't know a creature I think a lot about is the tepier um tepier is one of my favorite favorite animals um and uh they're they're just they're gorgeous creatures they they March through the jungles uh in the rainforest and um fundamentally like their job in the ecosystem is to eat berries and [ __ ] out berries and because tapirs eat berries and [ __ ] out berries they are responsible for propagating all of the fruits plant life right of the Jungle and so if you ever got rid of the tap here the rainforest would be in pretty deadly State um because the tapir is effectively um Distributing is a distributor right of plants all around um because it shits out berries and it's like yeah who's who's [ __ ] out berries in like you know in in crypto I think is a great question to ask uh I would say get coin is a great berry [ __ ] from uh you know like right at the top of the list that no one will understand without the context making myself as I go um yeah like like you know um who's redistributing everyone else's work in this like you know meaningful way and to let it Thrive propagate and grow in New environments like that's that's so powerful the the point about yeah composibility I think about that so much because it's like a lot of I think the unlock for I I don't think I'm giving away anything here like a lot of the unlike for what we're really building with joke is like the the idea that you make decisions and they can be executed on chain right and so like um because it's on chain governance like effectively if you say hey who should join our multi-sig you can automatically then have that person added to your necess safe right are you safe now it's no longer gnosis um if you want to say like who should be secretary you can automatically mint them like a badge it could be like a pkp3 lit where it's like that gives you access rights to Dropbox that gives you access rights to Google drive to your email Etc right through an nft and that's automatically given to them and so it's like onboarding totally done if you want to like you know say what cause do we want to raise money for you know pull Capital send it to a juice box let everyone raise money for it right what in a few collection we want to buy let them like go there right um and like you know turns into a party bid like our ability to succeed I think is ultimately as a protocol in which people build on top of us and we can integrate those Services into internally so that like you any decision you make can automatically be executed across all these other services and like all that is is it's my co-founder Sean would say is like taking advantage of blockchains as open apis but it's just it means that you build a company in a totally different way than you would build a company in web 2 because in web 2 you would not want to prioritize Integrations right that would not be the first thing you would want to do you would want to probably compete or be able to build those in-house and internally and like anything that's sending people away from your site is considered deadly but in Webster is the opposite because like if we can support all those other projects in the ecosystem like through voting and we are now driving users to all those other services they're also probably going to be inside advice to send to us we might maybe we can share Revenue potentially and you can create this composable ecosystem where we are each other's mode like we are all supporting one another in this like open ecosystem because we all are sharing users and providing integrated services and it's just a totally different way of building a company than you would ever want to build a company in web 2 where everything is siled completely and and so it's like it's an interesting thing because like I think even when you talk to people in the space a lot of people come from web2 I mean you and I both come from web2 but like I think a lot of people who come from web 2 don't quite understand just how powerful Integrations are as a business development tool um because it's not true and web 2 like they're not great BT Tools in web 2. but in web 3 they're the most powerful mode that you can probably create yeah I mean I do think that a lot of these things are really powerful and really compelling um you know the the critic that I the critique I get from The Outsiders is okay but you guys y'all are supporting each other like crypto is just this insular thing that looks inwards and builds for crypto yeah yeah that's you know one way to put it and then you know I guess like the the thing that I my reaction to that is like okay there needs to be things that actually produce value for everyday people um and that yes that create value out of this infrastructure and there's going to be sort of a network effect between building infrastructure for crypto and crypto being able to provide value for the world so you know I don't know if you know what those like fundamental value drivers will be but traditional but for me it feels like Reinventing Financial infrastructure that people depend on uh loans insurance jobs public goods fun infrastructure funding uh art funding is one that we I didn't expect in the last cycle and those are all things that fundamentally help everyday humans regardless of whether or not they're in crypto or not I don't know if you have any reaction to that right yeah I I I think there's two ways to look at it like like one is what are people willing to pay for like you know people are willing to pay to you know yeah for financial opportunity and that fundamentally is at the heart of crypto like you know Financial opportunity called speculation called whatever you want it needs to be incorporated but I think social incentives right like the ability to drink meaningful communities and take part in meaningful action like is something people pay for and we see that like this is why you know creators will pay to be able to submit their film still film festival or submit you know like their remixed um to be considered by the DJ that they remixed like like Creator communities things that people are willing to pay for are still a massive unlock for this space um but we just haven't created like I would what I would call like two-way Revenue flows where people were paying in in order to get out um something that isn't just money but is also you know social and reputational as well um so I think that's one answer I I do think at a deeper level right like what are we doing here if there is an actual real world use cases something I've been thinking about a lot recently is like if you think about 2017 the really big use cases that everyone was talking about in 2017 for crypto in my in my memory um were uh like it was prediction markets right um this idea that yeah you like auger you'd be able to to predict like you know who would be president right and then there was um Supply chains like you'd be able to track exactly you know a piece of corn uh on the blockchain uh and throughout his entire journey to know that it was organic it was harvested by Farmers they were paid fairly um and then you could just intermediate all of these other like tracking devices and tools just to be able to like directly buy corn from Farmers you know um by and and be able to verify that this organic sustainable one that's good and I remember these being like really big use cases right Supply chains and like prediction markets um both totally flopped uh it was way too early for either one of those it didn't really work um and what's interesting is this didn't make a comeback right and like 2020 2021 the use cases were crypto that people are excited by were not those because like prediction market supply chains are like real world use cases it's about like applying crypto to the actual like real world we live in the use cases became really exciting in 2020 2021 where crypto applied to crypto it was like and even today this is still true right it's like you know yield farming right is a really big one or like Mev Mev is awesome I'm Pro Mev I love that there's like you know you can build revenue from MAV I'm really bullish on that whole space but like Mev matters because you are in some ways indexing on the transactions or going through a blockchain and why are people transacting in the first place they're not transacting for me uh they're transaction because there has to be some fundamental use case for them to be there right and so I think like in retrospect when you think about like how the narrative switch from 2017 to 2021 we went from like talking about all these real world use cases that were just way too early and was way too exotic to talking about all these much more kind of insular use cases for crypto being useful for crypto um it probably should have been assigned to us in retrospect that that really wasn't going to be sustainable like uh that was probably doomed to crash um and it didn't feel like it at the time it felt like we were getting all this adoption artists and nfts Etc but like in retrospect like yeah crypto does need to solve for something besides crypto for all those other things like Mev to be really useful yeah I think like a similar and similar to the criticism I've heard of Silicon Valley which is like Silicon Valley is only solving for civil Silicon Valley problems like what do you do when your rent is kind of high and you want to order groceries to have them delivered without taskrabbits and stuff like that it's just kind of like a bubble and I think that for crypto to truly have a positive effect on the world it's got to provide utility for the median citizen of humanity not just the people who are privileged enough to live in Silicon Valley or to have huge bags and stuff like that yeah like a worst case scenario is like axi but a game that people would play if there was no Financial speculation right and then you add on the financial the speculation on top of that but like like that's that's the worst case scenario is like like what is the game people actually want to play and the fact that we haven't come up with a single game in crypto yet than anyone actually wants to play never mind Supply chains and like transforming the environment uh it just shows you how how far we have to go and we really don't deserve a bull market until until I think we start answering those questions totally um well I we only have 10 minutes left in there's a conversation that you and I had on Twitter that I wanted to briefly cover in the podcast just because it's better to have nuanced conversations like this than it is on Twitter and that was around civil resistance which I know that I meme a lot about and I think that you disagreed with me about civil resistance so yeah just to set the stage a little bit civil resistance is basically sock puppet resistance how do we go from one token one vote systems which are inherently bureaucratic to when human one of those systems which are uh more democratic and I don't remember exactly what the disagreement that we had was about civil resistance but do you recall oh did I lose you Kevin [Music] okay let's start from the top uh about civil resistance we had a little connection issue right there so uh what was the disagreement that we had about civil resistance and and let's get into that yeah so so I think the the disagreement was like um over full civil resistance and what that would require um and so I think to have force of resistance you'd need a catalog uh probably every human on the planet and that already carries with it you know a kind of frightening historical way like the history of you know colonialism is cataloging humans um and you know being able to put them on a publicly verifiable Ledger that is like tied to their finances I think is is both impossible like to try to get everyone to do it I think it's impractical but I think it's also terrifying um and it's in its implications when that's mapped to biometric data and of course the response to this will be you know you're using ZK proofs and like um you know this can be effectively hidden unless there's a quantum computer at some level you are cataloging all humans in ways that like any government you know effectively can take advantage of this kind of technology to track everybody uh completely it's the next iteration of civilians culture in a way that you really have no privacy and you're being tracked at all times some people will like this because it means it's a deterrent against Crime uh I personally find it terrifying and I think it actually changes the way we psychologically interact with each other when we know are being watched all the time as well um and so I think like you know that that kind of that kind of [ __ ] scares me um a lot and I think it's also impractical uh as well and so like what I'm more interested in is something like civil disincentivization um which is to say like track you know let everybody incentivize everybody to build up a single record on chain right where the more that you've contribute to that single record uh as an identity the more power you're getting as well and so people really want to have one identity essentially that is giving them power within systems um and an accruing value to that to that identity that they have online um and then those can all be tracked and those you know those can all be verified we can see the history of everyone's transactions but just don't have it tied to someone's biometric body um well that's a that's a tautology don't have it tied to their body like fundamentally like I do think that like the possibility of having anons um people being able to operate without State surveillance being able to like you know do transactions where they're not going to be tracked down um within the real world is is important to have it's important to be able to create our own systems um free from like you know State control and surveillance as well and that's part of the reason I'm excited by this space and so like I I worry that yeah just the cost of civil civil full civil resistance is is so great when you have lots you could do a civil uh disincentization that would still lead people to maintain clear single identities online but not have those be Tethered to the real world ones either got it yeah I think that that's a fair critique I um in uh when we were first getting into studying civil resistance on the Greenfield podcast we had Professor Brian Ford who is a professor of computer science that's been studying civil resistance for uh almost 20 years now I think 18 is the exact number and he told us that the uh are there's there's there's um four different ways of creating civil resistance um biometric was one of them uh web of trust was another of them presence-based which is basically like you're in front of me David so I know that you're a person and then the last one was like nation state IDs um and so so basically like when I hear your critique and all of the way that it carries I I think that it applies especially to biometric but you know also the nation state ID thing could be used in a pretty nefarious way if there weren't properly privacy safeguards and stuff like that so um yeah what's your reaction to that piece of information can you run through the four again so government ID biometric web of trust in presence-based or a combination of those things so yeah so it says three out of the four depend on the centralized source that is cataloging everyone and maintaining that um and but one of them died so yeah biometric biometric government ID and nation state right like these all are like depending on like big entities um oh so what web of trust can be totally peer-to-peer like I vouch for David who vouches for Alice who vouches for Bob um okay yeah that's where my language is gonna go wait wait so which one is that it was government ID sorry oh government ID is the biometric one yeah government ID no government ID sorry I'm uh government ID slash like government light driver's license passport and then biometric and then a separate category is web of trust and then a fourth category is presence-based presence is just like hey I'm in the presence of David right now so I know that he's a real person I think web of trust and and presence maybe we could uh I'm sure Professor Brian Ford has a reason not to do this but like in you know just hearing this initially like those to me link together as P2P out of stations um and I think pdpf stations are great and it's like again for me that qualifies as you know Sybil um disincentivization rather than resistance because it's not foolproof like you could have a conspiracy of a bunch of people who all support each other and like you know all collude to try to give someone value we see us on Twitter all the time right like Bots who talk about their bots in order to make them you know look legitimate um but like fundamentally that seems like a really good way of doing things because like you know being able to have like you know reputation as this currency uh circulates among you know different people I think I think is in is important um for sure yeah yeah um well so you know and and I think that you know the reputation for me is like one of these great power great responsibility things because you can do it to you can with reputation our financial transactions we can now not treat everyone as totally fungible with each other and so we can start to have repeat interactions with positive some games on top of them but there's also a lot of like negative some surveillance implications of having reputation so it's like one of these great power great responsibility moments for me to be building any sort of reputation system much less something like civil resistance there's also the fact that people change um and you know this is almost feels controversial to say where it's like we we live in a culture that is you know very concerned with finding out who people really are and judging them you know by their worst actions which Fair uh there's a lot of good reason to do that like a lot of people should be judged by their worst actions um but you know people change over time and the possibility to reinvent yourself into you know maybe carve out new life it's both very dangerous because you can let criminals you know create multiple uh criminal identities and that might be the more likely thing that happens but I do think it's important for people also you have forgiveness atonement um grow out of the traumas that they were raised in you know like um and so yeah having having a single immutable source of identity for one person that it can be a mark of cane on them as well I think um and so it's it's a harder question to answer but like I do think the the optionality of people create a new identity is part of what's really promising and dangerous about the internet uh and it's in some ways it makes it great in some ways what makes it really really fraught and horrible at the same time yeah totally um well I know that we only have a few minutes left I'm wondering if there's anything that I didn't ask you David that you that you want to say no I think I think um I think you've exhausted my larynx um uh no I'm just I'm excited to jam like uh I think Kevin like you've yeah you've been uh your Project's been inspiration for me for for a long time so it's just exciting to get to talk thanks man yeah and same to you it's it's fun to be in the infinite Garden together um where can people find you online uh Twitter um at Divine underscore economy um sub stack which is actually the better writing hopefully uh David phelps.substock.com um those are those are good places to to reach me okay amazing all right well thanks so much David my pleasure [Music]
