a guy unfortunately bought an nft that was previously stolen so an nft was stolen from some other guy's wallet then that this dealer the hacker who managed to exploit i don't know with a seed phrase attack put the nft up for sale on open c and then some individual bought that stolen nft for 1.5 ether and then the nft was frozen by open c inside the new owner's wallet so the new owner had no idea that it was stolen and then open c freezes it because apparently it's open c's policy to freeze all stolen nfts no matter what the guy who had his nft stolen takes the l the guy that bought the nft takes the l the hacker exploiter takes the w by getting the 1.5 free ether this seems like a bad incentive set up because like rewarding thieves and thieves getting away with it and the third party buyers who purchase these things they're the ones taking the hit it seems like a bad precedent to set in general because what you might do is entice more more thieves
