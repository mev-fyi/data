[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david this is a special bonus episode why are we doing this man we are doing this because so much good stuff has happened in ethereum in the last couple weeks and also our interview with the winklevoss twins was absolutely fantastic so it was just too much good content to be put into one single episode so we're splitting it out and releasing this as a bonus episode uh the big picture stuff the the topics that we have today i think are are crucial and they definitely deserve their own episode so we're recording this extra episode for all you bankless fans speaking of bankless fans if you guys could please go to wherever you listen to podcasts and give us those five star reviews so we could show up higher on the charts there is a bunch of old crypto podcasts that haven't released episodes in months and years ever since 2017 and just because they came out in 2017 they still are there so if you could go to itunes spotify wherever you listen and give us those five star reviews so we can get bankless to the top of the crypto podcast charts we would really appreciate it let's spread the revolution guys let's do it before we begin want to talk about our fantastic sponsors today our first sponsor is monolith if you guys have your assets inside of ethereum but you also want to live your life monolith for our european customers might be the product for you they have their defy card which is a visa card connected to a smart contract wallet on ethereum so that when you go to the store you buy your coffee you buy your groceries you swipe your monolith card and then your die gets deducted out of your smart contract wallet sold for dollars and then you make a a both a transaction on ethereum and a transaction on the visa network really crucial infrastructure for people that want to live a bankless life but don't really want to compromise and be that weird friend that doesn't have any real money [Laughter] so you can download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card today and then you can get some of the world's economic activity placed onto the ethereum network all right guys i am super excited to introduce you to our next new sponsor ramp what is holding crypto back it's really getting fiat into the crypto system that's what's holding d5 back the problem is a new user has to create an account with an exchange to buy some crypto they have to wire funds they have to go through a whole bunch of steps what's holding defy apps back the exact same thing users drop off in the sign up process and it really limits the d5 market to hardcore crypto people but no longer ramp solves that ramp has a delightfully easy fiat on ramp service so it lets users get crypto eth die usdc in five minutes or less that's right five minutes or less no exchange needed and a new user can have crypto right into their account and start using the app so if you are a developer this takes about 10 minutes to implement they've got very easy to use apis apps like d5 apps like zarion ethereum taurus are using ramp you can visit ramp.network to see how easy this is this is really an opportunity for d5 developers to 100x their addressable market size this is like the ultimate growth hack and here's what's cool if you mention bank lists they will on-ramp the first 100k from your app of usd free so that's a 100k free when you mention bankless go to ramp.network and check it out ramp dot network mention bankless and check it out david first topic we're going to talk about four things today first topic does it feel to you like there is a massive mismatch between fundamentals and price going on right now and and specifically i'm talking about ethereum bitcoin's been covered a lot but ether the asset is there a mismatch going on what's going on yeah it's really hard to value ether because it's really hard to value these systems as a whole right like crypto systems are inherently impossible to value there's no price to price to earnings ratio there's there's no none of these fundamental metrics that we know about in the legacy world to price these assets but at the same time uh ether has been you know you know volatile but flat over the last two years and the fundamentals of ethereum have never been greater uh spencer noon has put out some fantastic charts on the tweet thread which we are definitely going to link in the show notes and if you guys are on twitter right now you should definitely just open that up and find his his charts because we're going to go through some of these uh it's it's pretty crazy the fundamental growth that we have seen in ethereum metrics if you guys have listened to episode 7 ether's value mechanisms a lot of the charts and graphs and data that spencer put out in this thread directly relate to some of the concepts that we talked about in that episode what this data and information show is just the increase in fundamentals according to the concepts that we put out in that episode so we're going to go through some of these today yeah let's take let's take seven from that thread i think it's a great thread so the the first is right now on the ethereum network we are charting the highest gas that ethereum has ever consumed so that's higher than 2017 at peak mania when you know everything was going crazy and everything was was bogged down it's higher than any time in 2019 in 2020 it's higher than it's ever been what does that mean david like gas usage what are we talking about here you know why does that matter the gas usage metric is is a really interesting one and it really talks about a couple of things the complexity of transactions being made so a normal ether transfer uses the minimum amount of gas at 21 000 uh and then more complex things like depositing money into a maker vault drawing dye doing anything on compound uh takes more gas because there's more complex transactions and so and so what this means is that people are using ethereum for more complex economic activity more often a larger amount of fees per block is being spent on ethereum block space so ethereum block space is being sold at a higher faster rate than than previous yeah so it means network usage is at all time highs so more smart smart contracts more token transfers more moving of eth it's all at all time highs and as you said that's another metric so maybe we'll talk about this as number two transaction fees on ethereum are about 200 k per day so all of the gas that's being used as you know every time you use an ethereum transaction or interact with a smart contract you're paying gas all that gas culminates in a total all those gas fees culminate in a total revenue amount right now that revenue amount per day is 200k on ethereum it's been higher in the past but this is still a very high number and really when you compare the transaction fee revenue to all other blockchains the only comparable blockchain here is actually bitcoin so bitcoin's doing about you know half a million a day 600 000 a day something in that range whereas ethereum is hanging out at the the 200k range everything else is like a hundred dollars a year like a thousand dollars a year basically nothing the only valuable uh block space on the market today is the block space of bitcoin and ethereum and i'm just saying that from a market perspective because no one else is paying for any of the other block space they're only paying for the block space on these two networks this is such an important metric this directly reflects how much people value these systems like how much are people willing to pay to have a transaction included into the respective blockchain so so bitcoin and ethereum have really high daily revenue of block space sales per day and this really relates to how well you can depend on these protocols being here into the future all blockchain protocols need some amount of sustainability through fees and so the higher fees being paid per day to the blockchain just kind of illustrates the longevity that these systems are going to have like all businesses need revenue to to survive and blockchains are the exact same thing so if you see your blockchain of choice bringing in a ton of fee revenue you know that your product is in demand and that's exactly what's going on with bitcoin and ethereum here and ethereum especially i don't know if you guys have been trying to make transactions over the last month but guy prices have been super high and that just means that everyone wants to use the network uh and so it just means it's just a fantastic indicator that the demand for ethereum is increasing and it's and the cool thing like we've we've had higher transaction fees on a daily basis that you've said ryan but i don't think we've ever seen it this high sustained for so long it's been a very high number for like two months now where previously it was maybe just a couple blips you know a couple days of really high transaction fees this is slow steady growth in daily revenue from transaction fees which i just think is is super bullish for the long term health of ethereum because that's what blockchains need but then also we need to talk about eip1559 when we eip1559 comes in the majority of these transaction fees are burned which means that the scarcity of ether uh is increasing because we are burning all of these transaction fees gotta plug episode seven again because that's great we go over that in episode seven every time a transaction on ethereum is used and consumes gas and consumes some fees in the future eath will actually be burnt so ether the asset will be burnt and the amount of ether in existence will actually decrease that is a scarcity mechanic that is going to be coming to ethereum possibly this year and certainly in eth 2.0 when it ships so that sort of links all of this usage to actual scarcity of ether the asset establishing it further as a store of value so super exciting to see that now some people are concerned that the gas fees are high and transaction fees are high and they can't get their transactions through you know the gas is too damn high right uh i am concerned about that a little bit in the short run but i think in the medium term what that's going to do is put more pressure on layer two scalability options on ethereum and get more of these transactions off-chains still secured by ethereum but push them off chain there's some roll-up technology coming down the pike for that uh even edamar our guest in the last uh the previous episode episode 13 i believe it was he talked about incorporating that in the argent wallet so i think this kind of pressure while painful a little bit in the short run these high gas fees will actually lead to a more scalable ethereum with more transactions per second in the medium to long term so i'm bullish there but let's talk about the third fundamental indicator here and that's users so daily active users is now 300 and k wallets so 300k possibly individuals groups we don't know exactly who they are but this is close to the highest it's ever been so in this number david hasn't been seen in over two years so we're at the highest amount of users we've been since the previous bull market what does that mean that just means that there are so there's a lot of life on ethereum right and so the ico mania was the last time that ether really experienced this bull market right so for a couple months ether was the ether price was between four hundred dollars and fourteen hundred dollars and that's the last time we had you know 380 000 daily active addresses addresses are never a perfect measure of users but daily active addresses is actually pretty it's actually much closer than just raw aggregate addresses because you know if you're using uh ethereum you're probably using the same address in in a single day period so it's more reflective of the actual raw number of people using the ethereum blockchain on a daily basis so like the interesting thing is is that the last time we've saw this amount of daily active users ether price was you know a thousand dollars 800 somewhere around that mark and and today it's 200 and so there's this just mitch mismatch not to say that the right price of ether was a thousand dollars back in 2017 but that's also to say that maybe the right price of ether today isn't 200 either um it's likely somewhere between those two numbers and and maybe a thousand dollars or 1400 was too high but uh if if we have the same amount of daily active users as we did when it was it was then maybe the 200 price range for ether is a little bit too low one other thing about daily actives is um it's important to think that each ethereum address is really it's like a bank account so um you know i own multiple ether dresses i'm sure you do to david so it doesn't necessarily map one to one to a user but the sec the second thing i'd say is you know some of these addresses can actually represent entire companies entire organizations in entire capital pools so in that way it's a it's sort of a one-to-many kind of mapping so we can't tell exactly how many users are using this but we know we've got 380k bank accounts that are active on a daily basis on the ethereum network some of these are individuals with multiple addresses but some of these are entire companies entire capital pools with just one single address so it definitely is a positive indicator and it's also worth noting that ethereum and blockchain systems care much more about capital being used more so than individuals using them like the fundamentals of blockchains depend on the total amount of capital being pushed through their system rather than the total individual number of users and so i really like that analogy there's 380 000 individual bank accounts never mind if that's 380 000 uh bank accounts owned by one person which would be ridiculous but just for the example that i'm about to talk about like that's still three thousand eight uh 380 000 different users of ethereum like that's still kind of the metric that we're really going for yeah one of these addresses is coinbase for example right and coinbase has billions in assets under its purview and under its care so yeah it's that's absolutely the right way to think about it and another really interesting metric here is the sheer amount of stable coins that have been issued on ethereum in the past few months really we're at seven billion in stable coins what's this about so this is definitely a function of the macro environment at large like everyone wants dollars and crypto dollars are especially uh especially sought after because of some of their advantages like you don't need a bank account to use them there's no there's they're very easy to get a hold of they're very easy to transport uh but what this really goes towards is the narrative of ethereum as an internet settlement layer a settlement layer for value so if you have an asset you might as well put it on ethereum and you know since the world wants dollars there's a global squeeze for dollars and especially a global squeeze for dollars that are not hosted in a bank account uh ethereum is just a great uh platform to use that for so for the for the dollar the international dollar market ethereum is being leveraged as a as a settlement layer to manage internet dollars crypto dollars and it's just a fantastic use case of ethereum so on that theme there's also an increasing amount of bitcoin getting sucked into the ethereum gravity well so that number has has drastically increased as well there's now 25 million in bitcoin now some of these are bitcoin ious basically secured by uh bitco a custody agent the example of that is wbtc but 25 million in bitcoin on ethereum many of this amount starting to use other d5 protocols like maker it just seems like ethereum is establishing this this use case of sucking all of these other assets assets like gold assets like us dollars now assets like bitcoin into its economy what's your take on that bitcoin tokenized on ethereum yeah we've had wbtc for a pretty long time and it's kind of just been quiet you know there's been some amount of btc issued it got integrated into compound but it really wasn't this like rocket of a product that that really launched and you know there's plenty of criticisms about wbtc because it's you know just a it's basically an erc20 token that the centralized company uh commits to redeeming for a real bitcoin if you ever use it so it's not really that crypto economic pure system that we really are looking for but it's kind of like the beta of bitcoin on ethereum in my opinion uh it's a it's a signal of what's to come and as soon as maker dao put wbtc into ethereum we saw the amount of wbtc on ethereum just skyrocket right one one day in one single transaction the amount of wbtc doubled from like 1500 to 3500 and then and then a couple days later we saw another minting of a thousand btc on ethereum so the the gravity well of ethereum is definitely pulling in all assets and bitcoin is definitely one of the lowest hanging fruits for assets to come to ethereum we've seen bitcoin uh have difficulties in finding utility other than just being held by uh by your people's ledgers by people's cold storage wallets and you know the lightning network really hasn't done what bitcoiners have wanted it to do and i think ethereum is offering a very compelling like alternative settlement network for bitcoin because you can do things in d5 with bitcoin uh and so the the the compromise of using wbtc apparently isn't that big of a deal for people who are interested in getting their bitcoin inside of maker dow inside a compound you know doing a non-taxable event by minting die so you don't have to sell your bitcoin all the things that we love d5 for ether for but now you can use it for bitcoin uh and that's just wbtc right so ren protocol btc has also just launched and uh it launched a couple days ago starting with two btc and now i believe there's 35 in there today i haven't checked this morning uh tbtc is having some uh struggles to get out the gate but when it does i suspect that people will also be minting tbtc so the race for tokenized bitcoin on ethereum is on is on yeah absolutely so so one of the big questions i think people are asking and you asked as we're going through those metrics david is all right so why the mismatch here why isn't the price of eth up right now now i think there's a really important distinction that people have to get in their minds and i think we've talked about this in at numerous times across our previous episodes david but but that's this the asset is not the network so there are two things here two commodities within ethereum the first commodity that we talk about a lot is ether the asset so this has limited scarcity there's 110 million eath uh you know producing at about four percent per year that's going to drop to close to one percent after eth2 is deployed that's an asset with some level of scarcity but there's also another scarce commodity within the ethereum economy and that's actual block space so block space is produced at a rate of about six six thousand per day each block has about 10 you know space for 10 million gas so those are the computational units that you can fit within block space but those are two separate commodities you've got the asset and then you've got the the network so ethereum block space and ethereum nasa and those are two separate markets as well so people can be bullish and excited about ether the the asset independent of being bullish and excited for ethereum block space so those two markets don't have to go up in tandem that said they often have in the past so when there has been increased demand on ethereum the network that is highly correlated with increased eath price so previously when we saw the highest gas ever consumed on the ethereum network that was back in late 2017 early 2018 we also saw the highest eth price as well so one question about eth prices well will that sort of revert to its mean and will all of this network activity start to translate into more direct short to medium term price increases of ether the asset what's your take on that so we need to remind ourselves that this is the early days of these systems right and so you know really you only find true price discovery after a strong period period of maturity and we are simply not there yet like ethereum the fundamentals change on a whim we don't have that much historical uh comparisons to make like price discovery for not just ether but also bitcoin still hasn't taken taken hold right like that's why these systems are so volatile and it's worth reminding ourselves that bitcoin is not a store of value it is a speculative store of value people are speculating on it becoming a store of value like gold into the future but it's not one today and the same goes true for ethereum right ethereum is a speculation on ether is a speculation that ethereum will be the internet economy platform for the whole entire world it is not that today and so i've heard people call like bitcoin is an option on a store of value and if ether is the same thing for the world economy like ether is an option for the the fundamental asset of an internet settlement layer for value uh and we're not there yet and so when when prices change these markets are so incredibly reflexive because the value of these things are really inside of people's heads they're not on pen and paper they're not they're the the fundamentals of these things are not yet discovered price is not yet discovered and so really what dictates price is people's opinions as to what other people will value these things not necessarily by the fundamentals so over time as these systems mature i expect fundamentals to really start to take over but i don't really expect that to happen anytime soon i'm talking like plus five ten years out before fundamentals really start to dictate the price we're going to be in this long speculative period where speculation dictates price um but at the end of the day speculation is determined by fundamentals right like i i would hate for my asset of choice to be something like eos or uh litecoin which doesn't have any meaningful like blocks based demand or utility right and so speculation does get driven by fundamentals but it's always speculation first yeah and so i i wrote a post i posted on banklist this week about ether being potentially double undervalued so it's undervalued in two ways like the first way we talked about ethereum network is going crazy in terms of usage and etherprice really isn't following right ether ethereum network usage is all-time high but ether price is like 85 down from all-time high right so there's a delta there and that's the first sort of undervalued potentially undervalued uh like like way the market's thinking about it right now but there's a second too and that's i don't think the market has fully priced in that ether the asset can become a a like a store a speculative store of value in the same way that that bitcoin does and everything you were saying about ether the asset being sort of the the underlying reserve asset of this whole decentralized economy i don't think that the market has fully appreciated that and priced that in and if you look at some of the charts back in 2015 they didn't really appreciate that about bitcoin either so back in the first five years of of bitcoin's existence uh the narratives were a little bit different um yeah a bitcoin as as a as a digital gold was part of it but it was a tiny part of it a lot of the narrative was around bitcoin being used as a peer-to-peer cash system so a a payment system if you will transactional system and the the value of bitcoin being used to pay for block space was a huge part of the value proposition but that started to split off in 2017 and for the past three years we've seen a massive delta between the the market of of bitcoin uh block space use and the market of bitcoin the asset bitcoin has been has sort of blasted away from that and the asset is valued far more than the network is valued because it's established itself as a store of value asset that happened in the second five years of bitcoin's life not the first and now we're approaching the second five years of ethereum's life and ether the assets life and it feels to me that that second narrative uh that you know second area where ether is undervalued might start to kick in people might start to see this more as a speculative non-sovereign you know store a value asset that's going to be important to the future of money i believe it was chris burniske who who said this a while ago but he talked about how ether is in its uh 2015 bear market for bitcoin uh where in bitcoin in 2015 uh it was not certain and in the state and it was not certain that bitcoin was going to be what it is today uh there there was a lot of uncertainty there's a lot of doubts uh people were not sure about the future of bitcoin uh but at the same time there were still some believers that saw this coming right saw that the fundamentals of bitcoin uh were destined to improve and that's exactly what happened uh in the following two to three years uh you know the the 2013 bubble popped and it was this little slow drawn out bear market uh where there were definitely some fundamentals building like companies were building on bitcoin but um it was just uncertain and ether is and he chris burniske said that ether is in that same bear market right there's this very long very slow drawn out uh brutal bear market where um people were really doubtful about the the long-term certainty of of ether and ethereum um fortunately uh things are like we've talked about in previous episodes these fractal patterns repeat but they're not always the same and because we saw bitcoin come out of it there's a lot more indication that we're going to see ethereum come out of it and people like like me and you ryan are really beating this drum talking about how the fundamentals of ethereum are really going to carry it forward and there's really not too much to be uncertain about and so we our ethereum is in its big bear market where it's just getting hammered by bitcoin maxies telling it telling all ethereum ethe heads that it's totally worthless but uh me and me and ryan are here to fight back and say like look at these amazing fundamentals uh and so i'm extremely optimistic about the future i wake up every single day saying like man the future of ethereum is going to be sick i can't wait for it to show up uh and i still feel that to this day yeah i agree i mean it's it's hard not to be bullish when you see data like this for sure of course this could take a long time to play out and you know it's a thesis so we could be wrong on it but take a look at the data for yourself and and come to your own conclusions on that another thesis that we've talked about in the past that we're seeing some more evidence for is the protocol sync thesis so we went over this in episode 12 and just last week a week and a half ago crypto.com which is a non-custodial crypto bank actually took a step to to proving this thesis at least you know in my mind they rolled out a non-custodial wallet so previously crypto.com primarily facilitates uh lending and borrowing in a in a custodial way so you have to deposit your assets whether it's ether or bitcoin or die with them you have to give up your private keys they essentially become your bank but they took their first first step in releasing a totally non-custodial non-banked app that you can deposit bitcoin and ether into so you own the private keys and it seems like they are starting the process of rolling out d5 protocols as well on top of that so david is this the the protocol sync thesis playing out this is absolutely the protocol sync thesis with a healthy dose of settlement assurances as well non-custodianship is settlement assurances it's you get the assurances that the centralized company that you're storing your assets with can't mess with your funds you get the assurances that your funds will be available to you and to you alone which makes the crypto.com offering much more compelling it's much less of a crypto bank and much more of a be your own bank and so crypto.com what they're doing is they're saying we are going to go with a settlement or we are going to follow along with these protocol sync thesis because we want to be dense and that makes our users and future customers able to depend on us as infrastructure into the future uh and so there's no even if crypto.com goes away you still have your assets uh and and they don't go away with crypto.com and so because of these assurances crypto.com's product is simply better uh and then like like you said ryan they're just rolling out defy apps on top of that and the reason why they can do that is because they can depend on defy apps being there especially the ones with strong settlement assurances and that are super dense that fall to the bottom of the protocol sync anything that you can depend and rely on gets customers because you can depend and rely on it and so this is just the protocol sync thesis playing out this i'm really glad that we we put out that episode because this this it's already been super useful so many times over ever since uh ever since we released it yeah i heard someone call it the new fat critical uh thesis just last week and i i think it's really a thesis for how this entire crypto space and everything in d5 plays out and the beauty of it is these crypto banks like crypto.com you know slick marketing uh really seamless onboarding experience but they become the recruiting mechanism and the onboarding experience to all of the other d5 protocols so that crypto.com app maybe it'll be a year maybe it'll be less but i bet they will add a deposit your die to the die savings rate button within their app and in a really seamless way somebody who's a crypto.com user and kind of new doesn't know defy um but they've connected their bank account to crypto.com they've got that fiat on ramp they can just click a button and start using d5 protocols and what have we done we just onboarded someone else to the bankless movement and the bankless system that's really what we were talking about too with the winklevoss twins right david like you know they see gemini as basically a bridge an interface layer for money protocols so they're the user experience they they provide the you know regulatory uh quarterbacking if you will to hold kind of the regulators at bay and appease appease them and provide a safe experience right um but what what are they doing they're on boarding the world into d5 protocols into bank list they're onboarding the world first into bitcoin and ether and assets like that but then they're eventually going to start to incorporate these more dense assets uh or these more dense money protocols like the dye savings right uh it feels like the future to me uh we'll see right but i mean it feels like the thesis is starting to play out in real time i really enjoy the fact that uh all these different centralized companies like gemiini crypto.com xerion is a good one like they are all interfaces for the same protocols and that's really what makes up a good protocol is that you can find it wherever you go on the internet you know one day you'll be able to access unit swap through coinbase gemini crypto.com xerion you know even uniswap.exchange where you would find it normally but protocols appear everywhere right like they're part of the substrate and they just appear you know poking through the earth and wherever you find it wherever you go and that's what makes a good protocol is it's dependably found no matter what uh so yeah i'm super bullish about this all right let's take a moment and pause and tell you about our bankless sponsors these are some fantastic tools for you ave is a defy lending and borrowing platform with some new cool features that you might not be used to compared to other borrowing and lending applications on ethereum first and foremost the feature that stands out to me the most is their fixed interest loans and so you know variable interest loans can get pretty hairy right so maker dow launched at 0.5 and then it slowly skyrock it slowly ramped up to 20 which is which is a very wide range of possible interest rates and it's not really sustainable for you know some of the more typical things and so that's where ave comes in with their stable non-variable interest rates where you can lock in a specific interest rate and borrow against uh borrow assets using that interest rate and being able to depend on that fixed interest rate really important a really important money lego that we need in the d5 space to really have defy grow and mature in a dependable way but that's not all you can do you can also do flash loans on ave which is also a brand new money lego where you can borrow you can borrow assets at without any collateral so long as you also repay it back in the same transaction so there's a lot of potential here in case you want you have collateral in one application that you want to pay back but then open up that same uh a similar vault or some if you want to pay back collateral but open up a different loan with different collateral you can do that all in one transaction without all the slippage costs so ave and their flash loans allow you to do that they are the number four biggest application in dfi coming in at 70 million locked in d5 right now uh the bankless community really loves ave and how do i how do i slip in that we've been pushing them up the uh and we've just been watching ave climb the ranks of the of the d5 market cap so check them out at ave dot com deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing any ethereum wallet will work so try it out i want to introduce you to a new sponsor on the bank list podcast uh multis multis is a way to run your business without a bank so we talk a lot about the bankless lifestyle from a personal perspective but what if you could run your entire business without a bank that's what multis provides it's the first ever bankless bank account for entrepreneurs who want to use crypto and traditional stable coin currencies to run their business so it has a multi-signature wallet that means you can give teams access controls one person can have the ability to withdraw from an account set limits so it has a multi-signature wallet that means teams can get involved here you can set access controls you can take your stable coins and some of your assets and you can earn interest with various money protocols well you have them parked inside of the multis account you can streamline payments they're also adding fiat on-ramps so they'll be a bridge to traditional finance with us dollars and euros you can open an account this is super easy to do we've actually featured it and written about it on bank list we will include an article in the show notes but what you need to do now is open an account and try it out at www.maltus.com so that's m u l t i s dot co and of course we've got something for bankless listeners multis is brand new their newest releases is is new they're on waiting list mode only now but listeners of the podcast can jump the queue when you enter bankless podcast in the form when you sign up so make sure you do that enter bankless podcast and you'll be able to skip the queue you'll get a one month free trial of multis if you are a business trying to go bank list this is the way to do it that's multis dot co check it out okay ryan here's a cool one that i'm really into uh mkr the token that governs the maker dow system just got added to coinbase uh today this morning as we are recording uh so that's that's super interesting to me uh the the things that i think about is that's a really bold move by coinbase because people have been hesitant around adding mkr especially to exchanges because of the nature of the mkr token people think that the buy back and burn model turns it into something like a security now i've never heard any official legal opinion as to what mkr is in regards to a security or not but we have seen different companies kind of be hesitant with adding mkr onto their platform because it's security-like quality so like that's why you don't find it in set protocol that's probably why you don't find it on any other exchange inside of the us but coinbase is is rolling with it and just integrating it right into the platform and the reason why this is so important is because you know maker dow is kind of like a a private bank in a sense like it's a bank governed by shareholders and the difference between shareholders of the traditional sense where you see like a big room with a bunch of dudes sitting at a table shareholders in this sense is whoever owns the mkr token and it's really important that the mkr token is accessible globally and easily and so getting it on to an exchange makes governance over the mkr system as free and accessible as buying bitcoin and buying ether and that's really the difference between you know uh equity over a company that you can't have access to no matter what especially the voting shares tokens versus something like mkr where it's a governance over the protocol is available on the open market and all you need to have is the capital to provide skin in the game and so having mkr accessible via more and more mechanisms is is really is really fundamentally important to how the protocol works because everyone deserves the right to be a governor over maker dao and that's exactly what coinbase is enabling by putting mkr onto their exchange yeah it really is the birth of a new asset class a capital asset that has all of its cash flows on chain and is settled completely on chain rather than off chain in the legal system so everything that happens with respect to fees earned revenue earned and essentially uh a portion of that revenue used to to burn maker tokens that all happens not in legal meet space but settled on the ethereum chain so that is a new type of capital assets one with on-chain cash flows and i really think this coinbase move is is a further move into the protocol sync thesis not to get back to that again but um not only are they listing maker and adding additional liquidity for maker which is good for the the maker uh decentralized central bank if you would uh if you will but they they are also starting to incorporate other features so the ability to actually vote with your maker tokens in the governance process so making that seamless within right now it's on the coinbase custody side so it requires being a credit investor in some of these other details but i bet they will open that up as they can in the future and essentially coinbase is providing a nice interface for us to do on-chain governance of some of these money protocol systems so they're becoming an interface to governance of d5 as well absolutely that's a really good point i like that you brought that up uh maker dao it's its shield is the value of mkr right and not only the value of mkr but the liquidity of mkr and so on on days like black thursday uh where mkr needed to have been minted as a result of black thursday events where uh maker dow lost some collateral and was a little bit underwater mkr needed to be minted and sold to the market and if mkr is on markets like coinbase this makes mkr more liquid and allows maker dow to have to mint less mkr to achieve the same result so this is you know a really strong defensive barrier for maker dow the system the more liquid mkr is the stronger the backstop is then and that ultimately protects dye and keeps dye at a dollar so this is just the maker dao system spreading its roots and integrating itself into the world via these exchanges and hopefully coinbase is just the first of many yeah and while we're talking about governance i i'm actually curious your thoughts here david because uh i i truly i don't know so we were talking about maker on-chain governance right the ability to essentially you take your maker stake in and you can vote that's what on-chain governance is you get to control aspects of the the protocol through a coin vote there are some new base layer blockchains that are incorporating on-chain governance as part of their system so polka dot is one rolled out last week it has on-chain governance baked in so the more dots you have the more you can change the direction of the of the protocol you can influence issuance for example you could decide to create a proposal and vote on it to issue more tokens for a specific um you know investment that that you want to make inside of the the polka dot economy what's your take on that is on chain governance a good thing or a bad thing well let's go back to the protocol sync thesis the the thesis that keeps on giving if there is on-chain governance there is a commitment to have a vehicle a pathway for changing the protocol that's the whole point of on-chain governance is that you want your protocol to be nimble and to be ready to change uh that's the same thing with the tezos blockchain as well like tezos is also on-chain voting which means that they can change the protocol as they see fit and you know there's there's benefits to that like it's there's always benefits to being nimble and being able to respond to the environment however if we are looking through the lens of the protocol sync thesis on-chain governance uh reduces people's ability to depend on the protocol uh maximum social scalability the ability for these systems like bit bitcoin and ethereum and all these other protocols on-chain or offshoring governance the ability for these systems to scale up to you to be used by the entire globe everyone is really a function of how dependable these systems are and if on-chain governance is a mechanism for changing the protocol that is going to reduce people's ability to depend on them staying the way that it is uh and bitcoin is the ultimate instantiation of this right so bitcoin doesn't fork and all updates to bitcoin nodes require what's called backwards compatibility which means that the first node ever running on bitcoin is still in alignment with all the other nodes that are also running on bitcoin even though there might be different software the nodes still work with each other and if you update the protocol that breaks that and that this is what bitcoin is really really harping on they always want the network to be able to talk to each other that's one of the fundamental values of bitcoin and i believe you and me ryan we also want that to be true for ethereum one day after we innovate and get all the technological uh innovations of these cryptosystems into ethereum that's also what we want with ethereum right we don't want to be forking every six months because that reduces the density of ethereum we want eventually ethereum to calcify and be dependable on-chain governance flies in the face of this thesis it says that we are going to change and we are going to have a commitment to changing by on-chain voting mechanisms which means that you know users of these of these applications won't know what the protocol is like in one year five years 10 years 20 years and so it really threatens the store value narrative because store values store value assets require long-term thinking and any any protocol changes uh threaten that yeah we're actually in closer alignment than than i thought on that david so so i think what you're saying is through the lens of the protocol sync thesis if you have on-chain governance on your base protocol you're a less dense protocol and you're maybe not even dense enough to sink to to to the bottom uh of the world economy and create a reserve asset that's a that's a store of value and i think like if people think about this for a minute they can sort of see why so if you are in a network with on-chain governance and the the folks with the most capital hold the most uh tezos or or hold the most dots in a given network if they can by vote through the social contract of the system and through the the formal governance of the system vote to issue more or less of an asset basically at a whim i mean what you have is a plutocracy it doesn't feel a whole lot better than the existing system of you know the fed and 12 guys from different areas of the country different banks setting rates i mean it feels maybe even worse because there's no democratic elected accountability it's like oligarchs and capitalists and plutocrats running the show like that doesn't feel like a base money system that you want to scale to to the world uh so what has to happen i think if we're looking at this through the lens of the protocol sync thesis is that networks go the way that bitcoin you know has gone which is no on-chain governance and you eventually ossify and ethereum is in the process of ossifying now now it's taking a longer time to ossify because it's essentially adding two things it's adding one this whole notion of programmability but second this this whole notion of uh scalability so that it can be a more scalable base layer and you know for for the world so it can be a more scalable base layer for the world but its path is eventually to ossify and not change and not be subject to the the whims of eth whales who hold their tokens they shouldn't be able to print more ether so that to me seems like a base qualification to compete as a reserve money store of value for the world and if you have on-chain governance uh it's it's hard for me to see how you're competing on that dimension i remember a few years ago there was the the issue of net neutrality going around the internet where institutions like comcast and you know at t and all these massive internet giants wanted to remove net neutrality and allow for the throttling of some websites in the benefit of others and you know the people of the world especially the people of the united states vehemently rejected that that concept and that is because of the protocol density of the internet like the protocol synthesis doesn't only work for crypto systems the internet is a is a internet is it the internet is a protocol and it's more importantly a protocol without governance and what the what comcast and these other big internet gargantuans wanted wanted to do is they wanted to govern over the internet and say like okay we want to be able to choose who to throttle and who not to and that was the whole issue of the of the internet neutrality issue and having a on-chain voting mechanism is commitment to non-neutrality and that is the opposite of the protocol thesis and maybe in an even less generous uh criticism of things like polka dot or things like on-chain governance the incentive system is totally up right because you you have these you know massive vc funds who are who are investing millions and millions and millions of dollars because of the incentive to buy something that can be governed like imagine if the internet had this governance token it would just be bought up by the large headphones of the world and then we would just have this internet protocol that is just managed by these people with a ton of capital and it wouldn't be the internet that we have today this free fair and open internet it would be something else and so you know shame on all the vc firms who thought that they could just buy their way into this protocol that they thought would just like turn into the the what ethereum really is is this settlement network for the internet uh and then they would just be able to be the gargantuans behind like this new internet like no that's not happening and the people reject it and that's why where you that's why ethereum is strictly a non-on-chain governance system yeah i totally agree i i think one way to say this is the future of the internet of money will not be owned by andreessen horowitz that cannot be the case that is not what the people want guys this has been a special edition of bank list this has been a bonus edition that we're providing you i hope you enjoyed it guys risks and disclaimers of course everything that we talked about with respect to eth is risky so price may not go up we have no idea what the short term direction will be crypto is risky d5 is risky the protocols we talked about are also risky but we are headed west we are on the frontier this isn't for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot what uh what non-custodian ship is non-custodian trip is that real i think that's what i think you made it up but you know real it like you're important we're rolling with it okay good good okay um i'm definitely putting that in the bloopers so you
