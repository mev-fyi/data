can we talk about the perils of centralization in our food production yeah so all the food industry is centralized i also think that factory farming from a meat perspective animal race perspective is also abhorrent and we shouldn't support that but when it comes down to it the ultra processed food is by far and away the worst thing for human health and this is the stuff that's been engineered by food scientists again these massive corporations to be as addictive as possible using the cheapest ingredients that way they can make the most money if you go in your backyard and raise an animal and you go to the grocery store and buy meat and vegetables or fruit or whatever it looks roughly the same so even if the distribution and manufacturing of all that stuff is centralized it's not leading to as many problems because you can still make that at home but when the food becomes such that only a multi-billion dollar company can make complex supply chains that run across the world these huge elaborate factories now you're making things that we call food this is not the case it's the super processed foods that again can only happen in an ultra centralized sort of dynamic that come out that poison the entire system
