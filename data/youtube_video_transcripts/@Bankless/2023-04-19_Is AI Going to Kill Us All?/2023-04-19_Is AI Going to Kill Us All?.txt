when Ellie easier utkelsi says we're all going to die what do you make of that do you think we're all going to die I want to describe the particular scenario Ellie Eiser has in mind as a very particular scenario where you have to pile on a whole bunch of assumptions together to get to a particular battle and I want to say those assumptions seem somewhat unlikely in piling them all together it makes the whole thing seem quite unlikely but nevertheless you just think about the long-term trajectory of civilization it may well go places that would scare you if you thought about that
