talking about a few things that are top of mind vitalik great to have you how are you doing thank you very much uh david and ryan that's um great it's uh great to be on banquo's again it is fun and i feel like this is a really good moment to be on bank list the first thing we want to talk about with you actually is this pretty momentous maybe monumental in the history of ethereum achievement which is we hit the number 524 288 eth now deposited in the staking contract how does that feel it definitely feels great um okay and i think like for a long time in the first few weeks and we were definitely a bit worried because i know that the deposits were coming in slowly at the beginning and it seemed like oh you know with only four days left when we had 20 percent and you know what the heck is going on here uh and i mean we even saw right that and there were a lot of people who were starting to get worried like and on our github thread and i saw eric opens up them that github issue basically suggesting you know hey just in case there is never enough deposit so let's set a maximum date and there is a bunch of arguments around that um but um you know no the ethereum community came in and the ethereum community delivered and just like within the last 24 hours we ended up having more deposits than we had in the entire period before that like it's it definitely feels a little bit surprising though in retrospect it it should not be too surprising i guess the one kind of events that happened in the past that this reminds me of is um if you were here during the original ether sale back in 2014 um if you remember that uh whole event uh it was it was this kind of six week long sale but then the first two weeks were this most important period because that was the period during which you could get the most favorable price for your if uh and there was like some amount of amount of deposits on the first day uh less on the second day and then it seemed like it was going really slowly and almost petering out at a couple of million dollars and then just suddenly in the last couple of days everyone just like whooshed in and pushed the whole thing up to close to 18 million dollars uh so and and like the curve feels kind of you're very similar to that um and like i guess to some extent you should expect that because well why would someone participate earlier if they can just wait until the end um and but you know just seeing that if spike you just come first slowly and then all at once is definitely amazing and it's definitely a great testament to the ethereum community as a level of confidence that that first time in in ethereum itself and then the second time in the proof of stake in charting uh stuff that we've spent so many years working on so vitalik what does this tell you about the ethereum community like as a result of this and because we like we hit the 524 thousand each but then we just blew past it by 200 000 more each like what does this if this is a litmus test for the community what is it telling you what like what are your big takeaways about the ethereum community as a result of this event i i mean i think like first of all there's a definitely wide community buy-in and confidence in eth2 in general and that's something that i think i definitely believe the whole time but it's definitely good to have just such a clear sign of it um no no 300 million dollars worth of uh people just logging up their ether potentially never to see it again unless the thing um you know either delivers or we find or or we find some kind of further thing to do um to do to make those their coins in the in in the deposits actually valuable again so you know in some sense it's the ultimate bet on progress and and i think like uh i bet on progress is to some extent what ethereum is about i feel like it happened in the perfect way like in a very um like climactic way and really like fired the ethereum community up when it actually happened in the way that it did like it's almost fitting i would say that it that we weren't sure we were going to cross the threshold until the last you know 48 to you know 24 hours but i i'm curious about this number itself why was the number selected what kind of drove that number to begin with was it fairly arbitrary that we have to have some amount of stake and so you know why not this particular number or was there some sort of rhyme or reason behind it i i guess uh like 524 000 was the end of the power of two that seemed like a relatively minimum acceptable threshold for an amount of deposits that we could have to ensure that the chain would actually be safe with that amount so like to give one example it's the smallest power of two that the ethereum foundation could not individually 51 percent attack uh so that was uh or no the ethereum foundation has like slightly above uh slightly above that but no it would have to put everything in and even then it would only be only be around fifty percent um so if we had less than just the number of actors that would have enough money to be able to um take over the thing individually it would just get higher and higher and so it actually would be like the chain would just not be that secure with a lower amount but on the other hand like at this level it's getting to the point where like there's a really very few individual actors that actually have the ability to and have put in um the funds to take over the chain and aside from the the foundation there's also obviously the major exchanges and maybe like consensus and a couple and and i don't know how much they have and a couple of whales but and then if you go if you go ahead of higher and we hope to go higher then it is going to get an out of reach of even those uh largest holders but like realistically we don't have to and get up uh get up to those much higher levels immediately like this is still you know just the phase zero beacon chain there's nothing kind of completely relying on it and so we start at a medium level of uh safety and then kind of go up to the higher level over time as people naturally become more confident in the system so this uh process this getting to that number and exceeding the threshold of eth that sort of initiates the the rocket launch sequence right but um the the chain is not yet launched that will happen december 1st 12 correct 12 12 o'clock utc time um so what what kind of happens next what's the next milestone in the beacon chain launch and in staking now that we've filled up the the deposit contract to its minimum threshold so the next milestone is obviously the thing that's happening in five and a half days after i'm saying this um december first uh the the launch itself um you know just it's you know we've done lots of test sets but this is still larger than any test that it's a different set of stakeholders than any test debt so just making sure that all goes smoothly uh then after that uh we would hope the proof of stake chain just run smoothly for some amount of time and at some point we want to just start getting on to the task of kind of upgrading it and bringing on all the full functionality that we want youtube to have so the big ticket items are one is sharding uh the second is and of the merge uh so bringing uh eth one into uh the e3 system removing the proof of work chain and kind of properly folding the uh the system back together and then there's also some smaller things that we want to do so like for example we want to add white client support uh fairly quickly so if you go into the uh these two specs at github there's already a pr that's uh we've been working on for about a a couple of weeks to add light client support uh and then there's some just efficiency improvements and some possible kind of economic tweaks um like one example of a a type of economic tweak we might want to make is just that making the chain more friendly to uh people who validators who stay online during in an activity week but don't stay online perfectly so like basically if you have ninety percent of performance during an activity a week where the people who are completely online who's forty percent like you should not lose four percent right really you should lose much less than four percent so you really were doing the best that you can so i have a proposal around fixing that uh just general efficiency improvements uh so basically the if2 chain is uh just going to kind of get into this um just you know progressing and upgrading uh mode and it's uh basically preparing for the the moments when the existing ethereum ecosystem can they have properly and fully fold into it are you feeling a little bit metallic because so this is like the the launch sequence initiated right but but at some level we're all kind of standing close to the launch pad watching the you know the spacex rocket and it hasn't quite launched yet and that of course is maybe the the most nerve-wracking part right so are you is there any element of like you being nervous about december 1st or i mean what could happen december 1st uh could could we have a a failed launch could there be some issue uh i mean issues are always possible right so this is i think why uh we should hold off the full cell operation until yes it gets off the ground um but like you know like we've seen know what we've had with different test nets um some of them launched perfectly some of them had issues even the ones that had issues they definitely all uh i have managed to fix themselves within uh either a couple of hours or a day or so um i expect uh that and this time there's definitely more participants and uh potentially less exp less experienced participants so also maybe more experienced participants because like the people who participated in the test sets are also going to be in the main net and it's not going to be a first time for the for them anymore um we're not we're i don't think we're going to see the thing that we saw in some of the tests that's where 40 percent of people just never showed up uh because um you know this time we actually have a a profit motive um i uh there's just always the possibility of random technical risk i suppose um but and you know we've done lots of testing at this point like the quality of the test debts has definitely just gone up and up over time um but you know figures crossed and uh you know we've it's it hasn't happened until what's happened uh so we're definitely hoping and eagerly awaiting everything going well so vitalik the eth2 research team recently did a uh a reddit ama that i thought was uh really fantastic and there's one question i recall in there i think somebody asked you the question about maybe um you know eat issuance or something um i created the context for the question you had this really i thought reflective reply where you talked about ethereum being you know while while eth2 is launching it's also a a technology and a network that is is somewhat in motion right there are going to be a large set of improvements over the the next two years right it's not necessarily going to be like instant scalability is here and both genes merge it's it's going to still be a process but at the end of that time um like the eth2 chain will be in a much better place i was wondering if you could i'm not presenting it the way the way you did the way you answered that question but i'm wondering if that jogs your memory and you could talk about um maybe that answer to to the question like what's the future for issuance what's the future for stability these two where are we going to be on the other side when all of this stuff is done and why should we hang with ethereum yeah no and i i definitely think i made that comment for a reason and and i think there's an important kind of insight to keep in mind there uh so like there's a lot of people who have been recently commenting about how oh you know i guess miss doesn't have a finalized issuance schedule or oh you know you can't calculate what the current total supply is or what is the max supply and or you're now you're now you're changing things and and there's definitely at some extents to which like those uh queries are coming more from the bitcoin community than the ethereum community itself and so you know we should definitely kind of not uh i guess overrate the extents to which we uh care like really feel the need to kind of respond and satisfy all of those requests um but you know like the thing that i think we need to just keep in mind is that just kind of being until actually honest about the state of ethereum like if you need a system which uh it um satisfies the property that it will stay the same as uh as it is today and it has existing properties that it's that it's going to preserve then ethereum as it exists in 2020 is just as a matter of fact not the system for you for at least the next one to one and a half years right there's just a reality that there has been this big massive east 2.0 transition that's been planned pretty much almost since the project's launch and now it's finally happening and then at the same time there are these massive transitions in economics so eip1559 is a big one and also just uh activity moving from layer one to the layer twos uh is another big one and these things are going to fundamentally change how a lot of economic and technical properties of ethereum work and so like any property of the ethereum blockchain today may well change in those one to one and a half years and so if you're interested in long-term economic properties of the ethereum ecosystem like it matters less what are the properties of the system today and it matters more you know what are the properties of the thing that's kind of slowly being built up over the next one and a half years right uh like and like what even is the point of uh being able to you know verify the current like the current proof of work issuance uh schedule like perfectly if uh the the thing that we really should be verifying is the economic properties of the proof of stake schedule that are going to be um you know guiding uh ethereum's economics for the 20 years after uh 2020 um two or like one uh whenever the merge ends up happening uh so i think like just explicitly understanding that yes ethereum at the moment is a system in flux and yes if you want something that's not a system in flux then you know bitcoin may be the thing for you ethereum classic may be the thing for you though in ethereum classic itself is uh kind of i think influx as a matter of necessity because it's immutability is being threatened by all these 51 attacks um but so that's one example where um you know in order to protect people's uh enough property rights you actually have to do something other than standing still um so so vitalik if this is successful if we cross the bridge if we make it for the other side to the other side for for those that kind of stick with the project stick like the builders who who kind of stick with it the community that that sticks with it what's left for us on the other side what do we get in terms of issuance in terms of improvements in terms of security enhancements what's the reward there i i think great things are on the other side so number one is obviously proof of stake so much more efficient much more secure much less re-killing uh form of like a much less issuance demanding a form of consensus um so uh you know issuance so is going to potentially go down by significant the efficiency of the network will go up by yeah a lot and ethereum is basically going to become what i think the 2020s will expect a modern blockchain to be so that's number one um number two is sharding um so short and at the same time the layer two ecosystem so those things together are going to give us scalability in the tens of thousands of transactions per second which is a hugely important because ultimately male we're looking to create a platform that can achieve mainstream adoption create a platform that actually can provide enough security and trust that guarantees to its users and actually scale that up to uh millions and potentially tens or hundred millions of users and not just like a very um a very small number like a couple hundred thousand per day and just proof of stake and sharding are the things that needs to be done to make that happen so that's number two number three is um that uh just a better protocol economics so eip 5059 is the really big thing um i think the more you use ethereum the more you realize that like just gas estimation is such a stupid and archaic concept i really think that uh if all goes well in five years time like blockchains that rely on this first price auction model is just going to be looked at like caveman economics uh so i can i i'm real and i'm really looking forward to it and it seems like the model is already working well and increasingly being validated in flowcoin um it's uh increasingly working well on the test net so really looking forward to that uh hitting the mainnet i think that could be one of the big stories of 2021 um also adjust general efficiencies within the ethereum system uh so replacing the hex tree with binary trees like uh allowing stateless clients which should make it much more efficient to process and to sync the chain um much more some of virtual machine improvements that would allow us to just not need any more pre-compiles and have to be able to have all the advanced cryptography that we want inside of uh ethereum so basically just everything that you could want if you're you know building some like privacy preserving application or uh some kind of more complicated smart contract system or something or some or roll up for scalability uh you know the tools actually are going to be there and you'll have and you're not going to have to use kind of clever tricks to anywhere that's anywhere close to the same extent as you do now um also like client support uh so if you were making taking a go at making it explicitly much more like client friendly uh and so um you know hopefully break the dependence on if you're uh and uh kind of actually uh have uh you know make it so that people's wallets actually can be light clients uh so and vitalik do we get to that place not fixed issuance obviously like the bitcoin model but do we get to ever get to a place where we have more predictable issuance on the other on the other side what does that look like yeah uh so i think uh realistically gold wants to wait around um you know one or two years after and probably even like the caucus starts ticking next week so just after phase zero and just verifying that the current economic structure of proof of stake is sustainable i'm verifying that that economic structure can survive the addition of sharding the addition of the eth1 chain uh verifying that eip of 1559 is working as expected and then once all of those pieces are in place um then i think people are going to just have a much more clear and visceral understanding of you know this is how high um proof of stake issue on sales this is how high the ap 59 bernie is the this is the kind of historical variance of those two parameters and so um like the uh issuance in general a kind of change of the total supply level is going to look i think much more predictable a couple of years from now and i think people are going to be very happy with the results if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stable coin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on d5 and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well last thing for you on this vitalik then we'll move on to something that is equally exciting in a way if somebody is just built on the eth1 chain right now has all of their ether on the eth1 chain um do they have to worry about any of the stuff that like we were just talking about or does this merge somehow in the future good question uh the answer is they absolutely do not uh so one of the big compromises that we made for and of practicality is that while ethereum's consensus layer and scalability and all of these things are getting massive kind of revamps from the ground up ethereum's execution layer is actually remaining remarkably constant throughout the transition so transactions that were valid before will be valid after smart contracts that executed in one way before will execute the same way after basically all applications contracts everything will just be kind of migrated from these one side to the ether side automatically right and so you ask user or as an application developer basically do not need to worry i mean there are a couple of corner cases like for example if you relied on block hashes for randomness before then in proof of stake block hashes stop being secure randomness and so instead you would have to use like the randall output as randomness but you know like these are block times are going to work slightly differently but no these are generally like issues that only affect a very tiny portion of users so for basically like the fast mass and fast majority of the of the user base i think they'll experience kind of close to no change from an application perspective so vitalik the conversation about proof of work first proof of stake was really really big from what i can remember in in 2017 in 2018 or it should probably even bigger before that but i came into the world of crypto in 2017. and i actually think it's really valuable that people understand this debate and why and and understand the merits of proof of work and also understand the merits of proof-of-stake in order to understand like why is ethereum so committed to proof-of-stake like why do we want this and so you wrote this article on your blog vitalik.ca everyone should check it out called why proof of stake and we kind of want to go through some of these points so we can help help the bankless nation like kind of come to understand the the terms that you use here and the the arguments of why proof of stake is inherently uh the right uh consensus mechanism for ethereum guys there's so much more left in this conversation we're releasing the proof of stake part of this conversation next week we wanted to focus on the eth2 launch part of this conversation just for this week so subscribe to the bankless youtube so stay tuned for the rest of the conversation and then after the proof-of-stake component we talk about concavity and convexity which is a blog post that vitalik recently put on his uh his blog and so that conversation is coming after the proof-of-stake conversation and once these all three of these things are released the full video will be put out on the youtube and on the bankless podcast as well so so subscribe so you can make sure to not miss any of those conversations you
