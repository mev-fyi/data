austin hit us with it tell the folks really how venice emerged and why it was created yeah so venice was founded in 2018 late 2018 by troy carter and susie roo people may have heard of troy in the past he was a manager for lady gaga john legend charlie booth has been an industry magnet for over 20 years and like really launched lady gaga right like like he was like the force that created the lady gaga like machine correct like he and that's that's kind of been his thing throughout everyone that he's managed like he starts at the very beginning he's not someone that's ever taken on a superstar like he really loves the grind of the underdog and it's something that just relates to his story growing up uh impoverished in philadelphia he actually got signed to a record deal by like will smith and jazzy jeff like early on and so he just like really identifies with that um but yes i didn't realize he'd done it for all the artists i thought it was just lady gaga but it was also john legend damn such a crazy track record john legend was an introduction from kanye and it was like i think his name was john stevens or something of that nature literally kanye gave him the name legend talk to troy and then troy was the one that like started to manage him from there so the ground floor at every step um and so yeah he had been a manager he started this company adam factory uh with and and was working in partnership with susie roo who is our other co-founder there and that was like a boutique management firm they also did a bunch of investments they were early seed investors and spotify uber a bunch of like we transfer a bunch of different technology companies um it was through that experience that troy got in touch with daniel eck at spotify when they were trying to come to the us and they would do like uh troy would do a lot of advising for him and then as they were getting ready to go public troy really leaned in and actually went into the company to be the global head of creator services help them establish relationships with artists globally um and and help them be in a position to go public and during that experience you know he had worked with these mega superstars within these major label systems and so he understood like what that looked like but not necessarily what it's like to go the independent route like even though that these artists were small at one point they were all in the major label system so he very quickly identified the discrepancies in terms of like resources and teams and support between independent artists and major label artists and when he left spotify after they went public he was really drawn to this idea of empowering independence and what would it look like for an artist and their team to be able to choose not to go the major label route to be able to actually have all those same resources but maintain you know full independence and and maintain rights to their their ownership and their masters and have that full team around them so they started the company with that idea end of 2018 built distribution software uh to get music out globally to all the streaming services built payment rails um and analytics and reporting and a full services suite and so yeah i came in about six months into that journey middle of 2019 uh served as our vp of music operations to really stand everything up um it's like a very amorphous title of just like we're a startup and we need a lot of things done so wear a bunch of hats uh and i had come from five years at amazon music i had a licensing background so i negotiated all the contracts with the with the record labels there and then the streaming services here um and from there yeah i moved over to product and help us build that out and got us to our mvp zero to one to actually build that distribution software um and then we can kind of talk about like what the next step was and and how we got there but i want to ask you i know you were pretty integral in as you just said the distribution software piece which i want to explain to folks you know because we think about music distribution and it's like well spotify upended that like what do you mean that's distribution but you're really talking about the step before that like distributing the music from i just made a record in my garage or whatever to getting it on spotify and getting it onto other platforms that must exist and you can tell that i don't i don't know the the deep music world that well and i'm very mainstream and just listen to spotify but um but that's what you mean by just distribution product is that right can you touch on those products a little bit more yeah and to that point i think most people would be surprised that you can't actually go nor quite frankly would you want to go direct to distribute to all these streaming services so whether it's spotify apple amazon tencent youtube is the one exception um on the video side but you actually need a partner who has built the technical infrastructure uh it's in this program called ddi or this metadata standard called ddx that you distribute out to and so you actually need to build a separate what we call pipe for each of these streaming services uh and then what we're building is for artists and their teams to actually be able to go on to an interface upload their music fill in the metadata and distribute it out and we will make the changes on the back end so that it fits every unique format for all these different streaming services because they all while they use the same standard they take different fields they're on different versions and so we're constantly in the back end making sure that it goes out seamlessly to at this point over 55 different streaming services globally wow you also mentioned payment rails as part of this like what is that software like what is the need on that side of things yeah so we it's it's twofold one we have to be able to receive all of the royalties on behalf of the artist all of the reporting be able to ingest that um and then overlay it into analytics so that is a process of setting up banking information with all these different streaming services who all have different requirements in terms of you know what they're paying out in uh in terms of different currencies and the type of banks that they're able to accept we then need to convert what that looks like so they pay typically in like one or two currencies but it's happening we pay out in usd and so like we need to then be able to spot convert that everything to usd what's the other currency other than usd that streaming platforms pay out in yeah so we we get payments in pounds um like spotify will do usd pounds uh yen and euro believe it the four that we see but everything that we pay out is in is in usd and so we we ingest all of those reports the reports are holistic across everyone that we distribute we break it up by the individual artist and repertoire that is being represented by all these different accounts we then pay those out to all the individual rights holders so if there are five people on a track they all get their pro rata share and so we set up individual accounts with them we use stripe they're fantastic partner to be able to input bank information and make sure that we're sending out payments on a monthly basis dude somebody get a smart contract in there like i'm like half hearing what you're saying and half just being like this is broken like this yeah this is wildly labor intensive and of course indie artists couldn't manage all of this like what the heck like that's the month then close process i mean it it's rough like when that when i was initially starting you know we're building this software in real time and so people would be surprised to know that oftentimes like a lot of companies are doing this on spreadsheets which is like very error prone terrifying you've got you make one you know mistake in your in your formula and you you could end up not paying people the right amount so obviously we've built our own software we don't have any of those concerns anymore but that is a concern for a lot of people that are trying to manage their own their own back office but still the month-end closed process for us is like a two-week thing like every month that's crazy and it also my understanding is it takes a long time for royalties like my streams are playing on spotify it's like six months as an artist before i'm even gonna see the royalties from that anyway not that it matters because it sounds like it's such a pittance relative to like you know uh the amount of streams you get that it almost doesn't matter yeah i mean it depends i think like at the top level if you're a superstar it's real money for sure but if you're a top level superstar you have so much money you know like relative to the wealth you're making from sharing then it almost becomes like yeah yeah and i actually well and we'll get into this later with cco and everything but i actually wrote an argument as to like why i think taking a step back on the recorded music side in terms of trying to maximize uh revenue there could be a net benefit for for everyone but um yeah in that sense like the payment terms are really long and they and they vary by all the different streaming services and so we're basically lining up every month what we have and sending it out but it's not complete because like spotify for example we'll send you reporting net 30 after the period so you're already 30 days out after the plays happened then you have to send an invoice which they then have to pay out net 30 from receipt of that so you're looking at anywhere between like 60 and 90 days after the actual usage happened and that's one of the better ones like their other their other streaming services that you're talking about buy annual payments um literally just dropping you a check every six months and so yeah it is very it's it's a poorly constructed uh service with a lot of middlemen in terms of of getting artists their money uh fortunately there are some solutions that we are seeing develop like paperchain which is using api data from spotify to effectively approximate what the payout should be and giving artists debit cards so that they can pay that money out it's effectively in advance and they're actually collateralized by maker dao which is super cool oh that's so cool so yeah i'm trying to i'm harping on this a little bit because i do think it's really critical for people to understand how the industry works right now like i always i feel like my job or you know for this podcast it's both how do i illuminate the web 3 world for maybe people who are new to web3 but also how do i illuminate these industries to people in web3 right so we can you know think about how do we solve these problems so like all of this it just feels like it's so obvious that there are ways to improve the system and ways that smart contracts could could probably play a huge role i think what a lot of people forget as well or just don't think about but music is literally the oldest form of media like it is it goes back the furthest in terms of audio the the laws and regulations around music are the oldest we literally have uh conversations around mechanical royalties which is effectively like a type of publishing that is paid out but it was based on the mechanical process of creating a record no one is mechanically creating any records anymore so that kind of gives you like a sense of we're playing in very strange constructs and it gives you also like a vision as to why web3 can be so powerful here is there's just a lot of legacy infrastructure that makes the the industry both like very slow very uh very opaque there's just like way too many middlemen uh to actually be able to process any of this information but is it also why it might take longer for web3 to fully permeate music because there is there are so many legacy systems in it yeah so i so i mentioned before prior to venice i was at uh amazon music and in 2017 that was like the first big wave of uh people like jack spallone and dot blockchain bc and ujo music and they were really trying to tackle the uh licensing like creating a decentralized licensing ledger uh on chain for the entire music industry was very clear to me i had written a white paper on at the time it was certainly ambitious but if you spend a little bit of time in the music industry you recognize or just look at the history of it the power players that be always are resistant to change and particularly like if they're not financially incentivized to make a change why would they like the current system benefits them um and that's why i was never going the first like foray into web3 for music was doomed to fail and i know jack has like come back since and said yeah i was a bit naive to think that like we would change the majors and that's why this wave is so much more powerful is because it is happening at the grassroots level at the independent level people that fully control their rights and can actually and have the most to gain um so that's where i think we're gonna we're gonna continue to see it permeate more and more the majors are like starting to play balls but in very very confined sandboxes and really the independent space is the one that's lashed on to web3 and we'll we'll see the sea change come from them i've heard troy your boss and who we mentioned earlier like talk about i guess all the headwinds that the legacy music industry is facing right now and it sounds like he's quite optimistic that these these master you know by master percent he's like record labels these like big you know record labels um majors that's what we're saying right major's not master yeah um these big record labels that they'll ultimately be forced to change because they're they're they're fighting up against too much competition right now can you speak a little bit to like what's forcing that change why i assume you but i know troy is like optimistic about about why this change is coming yeah absolutely and i definitely uh echo troy's sentiment there i think a little bit of like history of how music has developed to where we are where as a creator you have significantly more control uh over your audience and where your music is than you had before it really comes down to the fact that distribution has been commoditized and uh democratized to that sense to all all artists so if you think prior to the streaming area prior to the napster era like digital as a format just put it to the side you had to have a distributor the only way that people heard your music the only way it got on the radio um was to get in these like retail stores through someone that had a connection you couldn't go to like fye and i'm like dating myself saying this they're like you couldn't you could just go there and be like hey i would love for my album to be on your shelf it didn't work that way like you had to go through a distributor and that's how it worked and so these people held immense amount of power like that was they determined what music was played who was hot like that's it everything went through them and then streaming happened and all of a sudden you had a new business model emerge where uh distributors for like diy artists like a tune core or a distro kid or a cd baby would democratize uh distribution you could be everywhere and so all of a sudden that distributor doesn't have any of the power anymore to say who can listen to what we've actually seen that play out in terms of the amount of music that people are listening to now like the diversity and the number of artists has consistently gone up um and so that's one of i know a lot of people like to poo poo streaming but like one of the major benefits has been that more music has been commercialized people were making music before it just wasn't being commercialized it couldn't make a career off of it and so because of that and then you see the sea changes of where discovery is happening so it's not happening on the spotifys and apples and amazons of the world it's happening on tik tok it's happening on youtube it's happening on ig that is even more power to the creator in the sense of like they can drive the narrative they can build their own brand around that and and now music is becoming one part of the equation of what their entire brand and like what their revenue sources look like and so when they're coming to the labels like they have significantly more bargaining power simply because like there's so much more competition as well and so that is naturally going to lead to better terms for artists now it's still not like great particularly on the major label side they're still owning masters they're still signing like what i would define as fairly predatory deals where the artist is only taking like 15 uh that's after they recoup all the costs that were spent on them so i think we'll continue to see more opportunities for artists to own their audiences i think that's one of the promises of web3 we're not necessarily there yet but like you're if you're a major like you kind of have to change with the times because you no longer hold what was your key piece of leverage and distribution you also no longer really hold your other key piece of like financing because now artists don't necessarily need it as much or if they do they have other opportunities to to go and get it outside of the label so interesting it strikes me too that like it should change because also the economic risk calculation for these labels needs to be changing because you can have artists who are proving themselves on other platforms so before where a label is coming in and they're taking a chance on all these artists they don't know if they're going to succeed or not okay that they needed to be essentially compensated for that risk they were taking but if you're an artist who has now whatever 10 million followers on tick tock who like like the stuff you put out that is a much that is a significantly less risky bet for a label to be taking so there's just from logically speaking like you know the labels should be willing to come down on the percentages that they think they need to be taking and when you talk about additional financiers coming in i think that's interesting too and i think web 3 is playing a role in that i know there's like private equity firms starting to play in this space a little bit but you also have what's happening in nfts and and artists who are making money off of nft drops and i'll say it's still quite small and maybe you can speak to this but like you know it's making significantly more than they would make off of you know hundreds of thousands of streams or plays on spotify yeah it completely changes the equation to your point it is still fairly small but those that have seen a lot of success like the daniel allen's and latashas and verites of the world they have significantly more leverage as well because they don't need to come to the table with a label and say hey i need financing what they're looking for is like a creative partner they're still looking for access to opportunities they're looking for people to come and collaborate with uh you know being an independent artist is still like a pretty like lonely thing and so there are that's i think where we as venice have like really tried to step in is you maintain creative freedom you maintain ownership of your masters you have the financing already if you're on this web 3 front and you've been able to be successful in having these collectibles and these music nfts we're here to elevate and open and open other doors as well so it's still you know the one the one like caution to the wind i would say um is it's still very small and ultimately like what we try to preach is that there is a balance between web 2 and web 3. like it's very challenging if you're commercially successful in web 3 but you haven't built an audience on streaming platforms on social platforms to have anyone come to your show like it has like it definitely has a place it's gonna continue to grow but we're like i'm always very cautious with the rhetoric that i see sometimes on social media around you know we can just say so long streaming this model doesn't work for us we're going full in web3 and we're just doing music out of teas i i actually think that that can be fairly dangerous uh just for where we're at today particularly when you look at like what nft volume looks like right now i mean liquidity is is basically dried up and you're seeing that platforms are having to lower the amount of their mint prices right now uh in order to sell out and so there's definitely a balance there and it's about finding you know what do each of these verticals do to accelerate you and your career and how they all play together i want to talk about how you see music nfts or or nfts call it in general smart contracts whatever really playing in this space and i'm really excited to get into the cco conversation i know we are going to have um but just sticking on this this macro picture question for a moment more does the shift really come when and will this happen in your opinion when there's a psychological shift among artists in a really big way where they really understand that they hold more power or they hold more cards than maybe they think they do and sort of as a group push back harder against these major labels you know i'm sure there are more artists who have awareness around this because taylor swift has been very vocal about it and has a huge platform and has been saying i shouldn't assign the deals i did back then is that the key here yeah i think that's part of it the i think it's ultimately just a like it takes time to play out in the sense of you know i was at basel last year and we're sitting down with a fine artist who was describing how a lot of his contemporaries who are very commercially successful have not seen a need for nfts because they've already made it and so why would you justify putting in the effort why would you justify putting yourself up there to alienate yourself from your your collectors and your fans and i think that is analogous to music as well like we shouldn't be looking to the majors particularly for the sea change to occur it's my opinion that in the long run independence and we've seen it like if you look at the last few years of recorded music revenues like the biggest year-over-year growth is in the independent music space it continues to take away share from the majors i still i still think like long-term it will make up a majority of music it will take a long time to get there i think that's what we're gonna see is the independents who are like have the most to gain financially have the most to gain from building a really strong audience we'll be the ones to bring everyone else over we're just waiting for the balance to to change in terms of like who has the leverage right now you and i were talking before we started recording here about this recent change in the uk specifically you know i won't get this phrase perfectly but from my understanding basically like the governing body of the uk charts recently ruled that nft albums now counted towards towards the charts right so if you're an artist muse just dropped i think a thousand nfts that are associated with their album and if you uh so if they sold those thousand nfts that would be a thousand extra album sales from a chart perspective what do you think of this change and anything else you can any insights you have as to to what's happening here yeah i mean it's exciting ultimately like consumption is consumption and that's what the charts are measuring is where are people listening to it and how do we quantify what a listen is because a lot of people actually be surprised to know that not all listens are created equal in fact a listen from a streaming service is a significantly small like fraction compared to actually going and buying that album it's valued significantly more if you buy it in terms of total consumption and places like billboard track this and the uk charts uh and so i think ultimately yeah they should be included anywhere that people are listening i'd be very interested to know what the what the full equation looks like but it's a further validity of the space is growing it's not going away we should give if anything it like gives further justification for artists like muse who is uh did the first like music nft with serenade that was gonna be on the charts big big act to be doing something like that it gives them more reason to do it because if there's one thing i've learned from being in the music industry it is artists really care about their chart position like very very very much and so any i mean you've seen particularly in the us where uh artists like dj khaled have done like bundles where you like buy mountain dew and you get an album and things like that like people have always tried to like game the system in order to like be number one uh i think that this will be a positive in that it is another outlet for people to use and so it will give them more reason to invest in nfts do you think we are at the precipice of a wave where people like show off their music collections again in a way that they did when they had physical cds or or people would collect even vinyls and like show it off in their bedroom and now people will collect these digital albums so that they can show it off in the digital sphere and show their music fandom i think we're getting there i think over over time i can see i had met with with one company who was building like a literally like a vinyl crate so the idea was that you bought the crate itself and then that's effectively your mint pass for all the nfts in the season and so one by one you're actually like updating the metadata in the crate to add these vinyls and you if you're like create digging you can look at what people have you can use them create mixes i think that's i think that's like really novel um and that yeah we'll go to a place where people are like showing off their music nfts i don't think we have great galleries for that now nor do i think we have phenomenal virtual experiences where people are actually going to look at collections um and it's one thing to like if you're at a party and you're going to look at someone's vinyl collection you're like oh this is cool you usually go and play it after and so i think there's like some element of we need both like a good viewing experience but then a place that people actually want to hang out and play them um i think the bet that people are making people like cooper who's a dear friend is really that this provenance will be important that you'll be able to say you know i was first i was one of the first 100 collectors of daniel allen and like i was there from the jump and he's compared it to like pin collecting and things i i definitely see that for a subset of people but i i don't think that the infrastructure is there yet to actually support people viewing that as collectibles that they can actually show off because it's not like a pf like people innately understand pfps it's like okay i have a small amount of real estate on twitter i can show this off very quickly or i go and put it on a digital frame in my house and people can see it or i send it that way we don't have like something analogous to that in music yet we don't have like the virtual like record store that people are gathering around and doing listening sessions um or spending real time in metaverses yet but i think we get there it's just super early yeah we need i agree like that's definitely the missing piece is we need it to become normalized that people check your wallet the way they would check your social media to to get a sense of who you are and to learn about you and and i think there's a really good shot of that happening like i i joke about will people put their their wallet in their so in their dating profile the way right now you'd link out to your instagram it's like link out to your wallet and people can see your music taste and maybe like the receipts from the coffee shop you go to every morning and like that being a really interesting way to get to know a person is to see what they spend their money on you know like but probably a bigger indication of who the person is than whatever they're posting on on on instagram right um so i i suppose your your wallet would be highly curated as well so it's not really a reflection of reality yeah that like where we're at today would almost be like literally someone's looking at your bank account like your bank statement of every transaction that you've made instead of something that is curated that you would want to show to the world i definitely think that we can get there um and it probably requires a bit of separation between the place that we're transacting and and where we're displaying uh like our idea definitely yeah i don't think i don't think metamouse becomes like the ultimate or like open c or like right like these aren't the ultimate viewing experiences like we'll get much better like ux ui and interfaces that will actually like allow you to curate in a way that feels more like the social media apps we're used to today um you mentioned cooper so i want to mention i think it just dropped that uh he's launched his launch pad i don't have a ton of details you're on the board of that i believe or advising on that um do you want to say a few words about what that is and then how you're involved yeah absolutely so cooper approached me earlier this month uh he's obviously like been the music nfts guy yeah literally just his twitter bio music nfts uh but he's putting together a four-week program with the goal of getting 10 artists to mint their first music nft and so he'll walk them through how to set up a wallet and how to reach out to collectors and really like the entire release strategy around what religion music nft is because i think often people in this space just see it as oh i just throw up an nft and hopefully someone buys it but there's a lot of work that goes into the release strategy of trying to make that a viable uh successful release and so yeah i'm serving on the board with a few others to review all the submissions and then happy to announce as part of that that venice music will actually be gifting our genesis nft passes to all 10 uh applicants that make it through very cool coin

think that's gonna be juicy and uh and maybe some creator economy monetizing super fan stuff that i want to talk about why don't you tell us what you have cooking at venice music and the way you guys are leveraging nfts right now yeah yeah so where we where we left the conversation in the in the very beginning is so we had built our distribution product we came out of stealth mode this is around like late 2020 uh ended up working with about a hundred artists in a pure agency model so it's not open to anyone it's like referral base we're reaching out to teams that we really trust and and you know doing things that don't scale uh and thankfully like when we launched that we we did about a billion and a half streams over the past year uh and really built yeah it was it was great we had some phenomenal partners artists like eric the architect and amine and thuy um who have really like built lanes in the independent space and we've also worked with institutions like riot games on their arcane soundtrack uh which surprised soundtracks do really well so that was that was definitely really really great to work with them um and during this time like i'm product lead working across our engineering and design teams to build all of these features and working with our uh you know working with our partners to improve the distribution product and then it's like february 2021 i had been packed up basically on the road left la uh during the pandemic like packed up my hatchback civic and was driving around and ended up in colorado and so it was cold and i'm basically just like dejenning every night because i can't really go outside besides the ski uh and i'm watching top shot blow up like i'm trying to get my hands on a pack i can't uh then i watch the board eight minute which i sadly did not meant because i didn't really understand at the time that okay you didn't mint you didn't get there during mint but you could actually buy in secondary uh that was like a whole learning process um but yeah so i'm watching all this happen on like the on the sporting and pfp side but at the same time this is when like blau is doing big releases rac is dropping verite is dropping latasha is coming up with music nfts or with music video nfts and then spotty wi-fi is featured in a cover story for pigeon and planes and like i grew up in the blog boy era pigeons and planes definitely like holds like a very near and dear spot in my heart and so i've read that cover to cover sent it to troy and susie and said i think something is going on here like there's very clear that independent artists are able to really capitalize on chain in a way that they haven't been able to and so like i don't know what the strategy is for us because ultimately we don't want to be a middleman that's like antithetical to the entire space but i think we should investigate this more and so to their credit they we hired another product lead we moved me into another amorphous title of strategy svp and and just had me go and it was really me and susie it was kind of like a skunk works operation where you know i was jumping in every single nft uh space i was going to every single conference and i distinctly remember at nftnyc two years ago or i guess like two times ago last year uh sitting down with like david greenstein and looking at the early mock-ups of sound xyz like before it actually dropped and he was talking about season one and what that would look like and so we just got a lot of great uh advice and feedback and and thoughts from from artists and and collectors and creators in the community and another experience that really like sat with me during nft nyc 2021 which was like very formative for us we one sat down with trevor um mcfedris from fwb who is phenomenal and og in the space and he kind of like walked us through you know how how he thinks about community how he thinks about dao is like what it means to actually like build something and we walked away from that meeting really thinking like huh what would it look like if we really created like a community here that they felt invested in the outcome of what venice was doing and this wasn't like a transactional relationship so that was one and then the other was we sat down with verite and her manager vanessa um and verite was definitely a fan girl moment for me like i remember listening to her when i was at amazon in like 2014 and so she she was just like so thoughtful and giving with her time but the one thing that really stuck out was her saying you know even for me and she's like very commercially successful in both web 2 and web 3 it often feels like she's on an island like this is someone who you could say has like reached the mountain top or you know pinnacle of what it means to actually be able to make a career off of your art and she along with her manager still felt like very isolated and did not have that sense of community so i think between those two meetings susie and i left nftnyc that year like okay we know anything that we do has to be around our ability to bring people together it's something that we've always done and not really gotten credit for since the beginning of venice and even before that like troy and susie and their adam factory days were putting together dinners and making connections and so it felt like a natural progression of how do we get people in the room talking to one another and that led to the genesis of creating the venice music collective so for us it was how do we both solve a business problem to be completely honest like one is if you think about how artists and and how like distributors really like uh the business models today there's two you are doing a rep share deal which is to say like we're getting a percentage after on the royalties that come in that's incredibly limiting you're not going to do a rough share deal on a long tail artist unless you typically own masters right because you need to lower your risk as much as possible from a just forecasting perspective you're not going to expect to make any money back on that and its operating cost is very very challenging on the flip side is the sas model which is the distro kids the tune course cd babies it's you pay a flat fee you can distribute everywhere but good luck getting anyone on the phone you're not talking to anyone there's very much just like uc software and that's it and neither of those really like fit our mission of wanting to empower independents for as many people as possible whether you know that's artists managers collectors anyone in the independent music industry that is like trying to make this a career trying to be involved we want to be able to build a path for them and so a membership really created an umbrella for us to do that so from day one when we launched the venice music collective uh which meant it in june you could use your nft and actually sign in to our software which we had already built over the past couple of years we just added this web3 component to sign in with your wallet instead of a username and password and be able to distribute on day one it wasn't a promise of like oh we're gonna have some future utility and this and that it's like no we have a product for you right here and on top of that what we're doing is building a lot of things in professional development we're building a recording studio in la for people to use we've signed incredible partnerships uh with noya house and soho friends uh and also with with roland and so we're looking for opportunities of we know that being an independent artist is like trying to balance like a million different balls how do we kind of get them all in one place so that it's a lot easier and they're all speaking to one another and then how can the community grow and learn from one another and so we've done we've created a discord uh we've got like mixers and networking events we're consistently doing panels we're really focused on educational content because we know not everyone can get like white glove service but how can we still like productize a lot of those services for people in our community so cool and i i i knew what you were doing but i guess i hadn't really heard the story or it hadn't registered for me in the exact way of like really how much um i don't know i guess due diligence like you really went out like what what's the hole in the market and it's interesting that you found this place that's not it's not nft collectibles per se right like that's not like where it's not music nfts in the collectible sense that you hear cooper talk about for example um and it's not though i imagine maybe you're thinking about this it's not yet like um again how do smart contracts or nfts from the smart contract sense solve the systemic problems right now in music in terms of like just becoming the new rails upon which royalties get distributed for example um but it's like this in between space of of of community and access and uh and you know empowering artists as you said so i think that's so interesting and and like a third category in the world of music nfts that i really don't think has gotten as much attention um but is this a super strong and valid use case for it all that i think is exciting yeah we're we definitely did not think that that was where we were going to move at the start it was very open-ended of just we want to authentically add value we're not here to insert ourselves in a process in which you know artists can go and mint music nfts on their own like we're happy to be a creative partner to them and make sure that they have the right relationships and and can go and do that and help them with strategy but this wasn't just like hey let's insert us somewhere where we where we fit and it was more of we think we have an obligation to be a translation layer here and also a thing you know that i hadn't mentioned was in a lot of those conversations because we were onboarding a lot of our roster to web3 in that time like we were sitting down with artists we were explaining like what a metamask is and how to set that up and how you get your first you know ethereum and and purchase your first nfts and what it looks like to be in a discord and we're making a lot of relationships of we had uh artists like sophia alexa that we hooked up with like alpha girl club which is a pfp project to go and talk about like mental health with them and do performances and so we were constantly doing this like matchmaking on the side as well but one thing that like consistently came up was on either side it felt like they weren't talking to one another or they didn't understand one another so meaning like if i'm a commercially successful web 2 artist i don't understand web3 and conversely like if i am a commercially successful web 3 artist i don't really understand web 2 and we like cleanly fit in between those two so how can we get the two of them talking to one another that's why we do so much like community investment and getting people like troy is very intentional when we do like we do monthly dinners usually at his place in la and he will bring people from all across entertainment whether it is podcasters musicians managers um but he always makes sure uh that the uh there's like people on other like having opposing viewpoints to get them to speak to one another and not talk over one another i think we similarly have a guiding principle within venice to do the same thing for our community where do you think this evolves to i know you know i i almost like hate asking that question because it's like look man we're just trying to like you know we're figuring it out with everybody else and you've got this awesome thing going and you're expanding the benefits to the community and and all those wonderful things but when you do look ahead a year to maybe six months given how fast this space looks like where do you see the the intersection of nft's web 3 for venice yeah i see it as an integral part of our strategy and we'll continue to experiment that's the one thing we we don't want to do any like copy pastas right now in the web3 space it's easy enough to just go mint something on on sound and catalog and like i love those guys and i think what they're doing is great for the space but we want to work and i know our artists want to work on things that are pushing the space forward and are experimenting um and so i see like a drop like daniel allen doing this generative release that has like rarity associated with it for an album that hasn't even dropped yet like those are the type of things that like i get excited about and i think we'll do more of those with with our community um and yeah we're just gonna continue to experiment and see like what resonates personally like i am much more interested on the downstream impact of creating a tokenized relationship with fans and i am the collectible and so what does it actually look like to create a tokenized community and then once you have them like effectively a crm like how do you continually go and speak to them and how can you stratify them in a way of like identifying your super fans from your long tail and like moving them up the funnel and being able to reward them for things that they're already doing um a lot of conversation right now in the web3 space rightfully so has been around how can we create more revenue generating opportunities for artists and i think that's absolutely like a good narrative to be had for where a lot of independent artists are in their career but i think if we're going to see mainstream adoption a shift needs to happen of how are we adding more value for fans beyond this just being a collectible what does this mean for the relationship between the fan and the artist and what does this unlock that it wasn't capable before and so that's really where i'm focused on is how can we really double down there and build tighter relationships um because yeah you only you need a thousand true fans to like quote legion and and how that can like really work in that space to prop up your career in that regard so we're definitely focused there so maybe let's just talk for one minute about that and and what that does look like and i'll i'll kick it off by saying um the it's it's striking how these streaming services and a spotify and things like that right like flatten the price of music and and don't successfully monetize the people who'd be willing to pay a lot more for an artist catalog like i'm a you know big taylor swift fan yeah i would pay a a lot more to be able to listen to all of her music and that that value isn't captured um in the streaming model which i think is part of this monetizing super fans in this new era um talk about how you're approaching it yeah it's i i have like a few thoughts ultimately i think there are you wanna you wanna unlock varying levels of monetization and so what we have right now to your point is something that is completely flat it's an all you can eat buffet for 9.99 a month it doesn't give any optionality in terms of if i want to pay more or less for different experiences and so in the absence of that changing one of the beautiful things about web3 and nfts is that we can create our own pricing and you know we don't need to think about scale for everything like it can be okay to have just one buyer for your like one of one catalog drop or you know maybe 10 to 25 for an additions drop and really be able to capture it all the way up um so that that's how i see it going in terms of just like creating different levels of value for your fans depending on you know what the price point looks like um yeah that i don't i don't see like the the streaming model changing in that sense like no yeah i mean we're moving to like user-centric royalty payments which is great i think a lot of people don't realize you see like numbers thrown out of spotify pays 0.004 you know cents per play but they actually don't like they're not paying per play they're paying a pro rata that is based on total streams total revenue that's then divided and so what you see and why why that's actually concerning because that's not a flat rate i would actually feel a lot better if it was is spotify will continually negotiate better terms for themselves because they're not a profitable business still so you should expect that they're going to do things particularly in mature markets where they need to bring on free trial users to like prop up their subscriber counts they're going to heavily discount or make music free for those subscribers so if you're on like a three month trial or whatever like an artist isn't seeing a dime of that and that should be concerning when you just think about like yeah the total pie is growing in terms of total revenue coming in but the value of an individual stream in that respect is going down how are they not profitable in terms of like is this one of these like uh we're amazon and we're intentionally overspending to to pay for growth and eventually but we could be profitable or they literally just like this is not a profitable business and they are just raising money to sustain themselves and happen since their inception yeah it's it's the latter um unlike yeah it is i mean they were boxed in i think a lot of people also i feel like i'm the the streaming guy that like sticks up for them sometimes because there's so much misinformation and i've worked at a streaming service for five years but they were put in a very difficult position where they came from sweden they want to come to the united states they were spotify specifically spotify yeah sorry spotify specifically they were basically told these are the terms and it's a variable it's a percentage it's not it's not like other forms of content like netflix goes and they spend you know millions and millions of dollars on content but it's a flat fee like they can actually make it up if they increase their subscriber counts here the percentages stay the same when they get more subscribers and so they still have to they're still operating on the same net revenue which is negative um but yeah they had to they basically came to the states they had to pay massive minimum guarantees at really high percentages and they didn't have a choice in the matter because you can't you don't have any leverage when the three biggest uh distributors in universal sony and warner control 80 plus percent of the market like you just don't you do what they say and that is a very different model than again like other types of media where it's highly highly fragmented and so no one content owner can ever have that much leverage so in that sense like it's gonna be really tough and i think particularly spotify of all of them are gonna have the hardest time in finding a path where it makes sense to run a viable business it's why you've seen them get into podcasting and other forms of content because those type of streams actually carve out of the pro rata so they can pay less of the total revenue that they're getting there but amazon can justify it with prime and echoes and apple can justify it you know with everything that is in their ecosystem they don't have a product so it's gonna it's gonna be tough so i don't think we can look to that model to to change where we're going wow that's so interesting there's so many layers to this onion um okay let's let's let's go here let's go to cc0 i thought your your post about this you've written about this in a couple of different contexts you have a subtract we should say we'll link to it below so folks can go thank you you recently did a piece about cc0 and in the context of nouns but you also wrote a post or you had a tweet thread really talking about essentially like musicians releasing music as cc0 meaning it would be in the collective the creative commons they wouldn't have copyright they wouldn't be enforcing any copyright ownership over that music so anyone could come along and remix use leverage that music in any way they chose is that a fair way of describing it and then please make this case to us correct and i'm and i know like i preface the tweet with all of my music industry friends and artists are going to hate me for this but there's a very like clear use case that i see and i want to be clear off the jump like i'm not saying that all music should be cco like not in the slightest what i'm proposing is that in the same way that like music nfts and streaming represent different parts of a holistic release strategy that you consider entering some of your music into the public domain because when you do that in the same way that like the soundcloud era and the mixtape era proliferated music because effectively you were just giving you were giving it away for free and you're are you really gonna exercise your right of a copyright like on soundcloud no because you don't have any of the sync clearances to begin with like one of one of the interesting things with like chance the rapper people often think that like he made the active decision at first to drop uh acid rap as a mixtape he actually wanted to put it on on streaming services but he didn't have any of the clearances so you know every time that you create a sample or anything like that there are a bunch of different people that need to get paid um and so he put it he put it up for free what i was proposing is that when you are a small or a small artist the number one thing that you need to be focused on is growth more than anything else and so what is beautiful of cco is that it really allows for ideas to proliferate they're you're also like creating an incentivized audience that wants to lean in because they stand to profit now does that mean leaving revenue potentially on the table does it mean that your content could be used in ways that you're not comfortable with absolutely that is definitely the trade-off those live on the edge cases but they can they can absolutely happen and so what i was proposing is that like you you kind of carve off a subset whether it is like an ep or a single or what have you and almost like create a contest around it where you're empowering your audience to go and proliferate your music and get it everywhere possible so that's really interesting so i think people are obviously likely more familiar with cc0 in like the art context because we're seeing that all over the place we're recording this a day after moon birds announced it was going to be cece moving forward so it's a very sexy time very hot topic yeah very hot topic and but people are used to it you used nouns as the example in in the article you wrote people know from nouns or from other gremlin projects or from um like blit maps as a cc zero project and the bet that sort of being made in some cases is like okay if anybody can go build anything like with blitmaps here's some rough lore but then the world can go out and create stories with these characters and and create some lauren if it got really big and it was the next star wars like how cool is that and the nft buyers in that case are betting on on that and then their nft would go you know up in value because people would want to own this piece of history whatever like i understand what the the bet is there in this case with music is it just that people would sample bigger sections of your song in their own remix music like people would would go and use it in their film projects like spell us spell out for us like what the proliferation actually looks like yeah and i think this mostly makes sense where as an independent artist you own both sides of the recording what i mean by that is like you have a master recording and publishing and typically there are multiple constituents that need to be paid out for that it's very challenging to make something into the public domain and get everyone on board with that and so it's probably a use case of where you own 100 of your work what i'm thinking through is what is the potential opportunity particularly like you think of an example like sync like synchronization rights which for people are unfamiliar is when you create like put a musical track on top of like something that's audio visual biggest example of a sync that you can think of right now is kate bush's song in stranger things that sync has done wonders in terms of bringing attention back to kate bush back to that song then you have people like halsey going and performing it on stage and so similarly if you allow like i actually did a bit of sync licensing and negotiating for like amazon studios back in the day it's miserable because you go and there are like 10 writers on the track there's you know another like all the labels that could be on it that own different pieces and they all want most favored nations and it can be a real drag where music ends up not being heard simply because the negotiations are like they just drag to uh to stop a stand still and so if you unlock that and say no you can actually just go and use this because the bet that i'm making is that by having something in stranger things it's going to bring a lot more attention to me as an artist and i'll be able to use that to then go sell tickets go sell merch merchandise like be able to power all of these other parts of my business which by the way actually make up a majority of where artists are making their revenue today it's not on the recorded music side is it on on all these other ancillary things or things that support you know be being a musician in the space and so rather than fight what i just mentioned earlier with like a losing battle on the streaming side it's finding other opportunities to build that awareness because ultimately if you're playing the the game of like us trying to get your music heard on like a tick tock or a spotify it's just like more and more content is being added there every day and so you kind of need to give yourself another leg up uh and really have an incentivized audience to be able to pick up on that that is interesting like the idea the idea of doing it in in small strategic batches because i think the the uh like obviously you know it it's about more the reason taylor swift wants to own her her master recordings is about more than just the money she wants to make off of it she's very wealthy right it's it's about like i wrote these songs i put my blood sweat and tears into this work like i'm not ready like she wants to own it because there's something that feels really powerful about that i think it's the same reason why you don't see like one-of-one artists or you know like if you go to uh super rare right now or right like you're not going to see um artists giving away like their art in cc zero the way you'll see it for this copy just did it hex copy but that's a standout in part right because you don't see it as often like i did i hosted a panel of artists like art blocks doesn't do it right like hosted a panel of artists at um one of the conferences consensus i guess it was and it was four artists on the stage it was like thank you x all seeing seneca tyler hobbs and they were like yeah no yeah you know i don't want to do it so so that being more of the comp i think like it makes sense that artists aren't going to want to do this and i probably don't need to make the case about it but they're not going to do this like a wholesale like just like release their their work into the public domain but in like small strategic doses i think that's a really interesting concept do you think there's a world where it becomes like the early adopters have the advantages and if the first few folks who do this uh maybe have like there's a tension around it because they're doing it but that over time ultimately it doesn't help people because if you became oversaturated with cc0 in the public domain like artists wouldn't really see the benefit from it because they'd be competing against a lot of other like cc zero public domain works sure then you'd have to move on to the next thing i mean it's it's in the same respect of like if you were early to spotify there were a lot less people on there or in terms of like that you were competing with there was a lot less noise and so yeah there was an early mover advantage at every piece of distribution you go to itunes and by the way most people fought it every single time like it's not comfortable to try these new things particularly when like the old model works for a lot of people and like they're seeing revenue from it so i get totally that it's uncomfortable i can also see that like it gets oversaturated and i think people will just move to iterate on something else you mentioned chance who i just love and i'm curious how much he's a an interesting case study for this new era or or not yeah chance is definitely interesting i mean he captured all attention basically took all the air out of the room as an independent artist and was really held as you know the north star of what it could be to be an independent artist maybe you should say for anybody who doesn't have contacts like chance quite famously never signed has never signed with a label right or why not so this is where it like it gets complicated because his last album he actually distributed through warner so oh wow because he had he there's that like i just think i like if one more label try to stop me yeah like you know like and that and that was it and there's this like interesting dynamic where people aren't signed but they're using major label distribution because even if it's not helping you on the digital side it is still very helpful on the physical side it is how you still get into the record stores and things of that nature and so like yeah people would be surprised to know that like chance the rapper has used major label distribution uh macklemore who was like another like big standout was in a major label system um but yeah chance is like someone obviously like i love and was like a very like seminal figure in my life when my coloring book came out and i got to know pat really well as manager as like that was coming up i actually got to do that deal at amazon it was like a crown jewel as we were like going to to launch and so he holds like a special place in my heart but i also worry that that model of like what independent success looks like is not viable simply put like it's re if you look at like the top 100 songs on billboard right now you see very little independence it's still very much like a closed game with the majors that are running you know you can't use the word payola but they're they have like very strong relationships with radio promotion and things of that nature to like get people up in front they're still choosing the stars even if if we have a little bit more say um and so this was much more of the exception not the rule now i do think that we will see more independent artists like break into the top 100 and we will see global superstars that are independent i think we see that on a lesser scale with an artist like russ has done phenomenal um but it is it is a grind it is very much like you're taking everything into your own hands and the one thing that we kind of talk about at venice is you know when you're in a major label system it's like having an operating system where all the pieces talk to each other like they're all kind of built to talk to one another you have this machine behind you and as a result of that like that machine extracts a lot of value from you like that's why you get paid 15 and you have to recoup on outrageous advances which that's a whole nother conversation it's like why is the artist having to recoup all the expenses paid and that's not like a joint venture thing where like you're paying it evenly like that's kind of part of the investment you wouldn't do that in any other type of business um but you you make that trade off on the independent side where it's okay these are all disparate pieces that we need to get to work together and they're different systems and how do you get all those pieces talking so like one of our roles we feel like is to create that operating system for the independent space and so like if the majors are kind of like iphone and it's closed we're almost like android and open and we make sure that everything still complies with standard that it all still feels like value accrual and talking to one another um but yeah the the case of chance is always interesting to me because it is it is held up in such like high regard but like we haven't seen anything like that since and i think really what will be interesting and again something that cooper talks about a lot it's like i think we could see a breakout in web 3. i do think that because you do have super fans that are highly invested we could see a superstar come from from that direction because it is such a deeper relationship than you traditionally have um in in the streaming world i've i've called it before like if streaming is your megaphone then web 3 is kind of your campfire and i think if you build a really strong campfire you'll get people to to get the word out that's cool and and chance maybe to state the obvious is the exception because a he's so exceptional and b because he i'm sure some confluence of luck there the way soundcloud whatever it was like is that why he's such an exception there there is just such a confluence of things for sure like he obviously came at the perfect era in terms of the soundcloud era and the mixtape era and he was so closely tied to kanye at the time and had a lot of even if he wasn't a major label artist he had a lot of major label connections and and building that out and so it's just challenging to see that be replicated he was close to kanye from early days did he know him previously he so he was on uh was it life of pablo i'm gonna get yeah but that was after his mixtape like that was he was like ultra light beam or whatever ultra correct ultra light beam and so yeah yeah his mixtape's obviously like it was still a different level than when his album came out and he was grammy nominated and it was like the first artist to like do that and that that was like he took it to that level like after all of those relationships in my opinion um and it was very like i i'm not like cool you know what i mean i'm not like in the scene and i knew chance before ultra like you know what i mean before like kanye so he he had really hit out into the mainstream in a certain way it feels like even prior to that which is just so impressive yeah i agree i mean his his mixtape particularly acid rapid or held in lore is like some some of the best around but he definitely took it to another level with his with his album release and obviously like that led to multiple worldwide tours and everything but it was also fleeting and i think that's something that people need to be very very mindful of um you know he lit fast and he's still making music but it obviously is not the same awesome well austin thank you so much congratulations for everything you're doing i'm like this has opened my eyes to a whole a whole new world of like the independent artist scene and i think what you guys are doing at venice is so cool so i really appreciate you coming on walking us through this we'll have to have you back and uh thanks again thank you so much kylie appreciate it [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this
