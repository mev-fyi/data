coinbase insider trading two brothers profited by 1.5 million in illegal trades on 25 different crypto assets and at least 14 different coinbase public listings and so the idea here is that coinbase lists these tokens these people that know about it ahead of time buy the tokens and then they sell the tokens after the listing after the token pump but that's like the much smaller side of this story the much bigger side of the story is that the sec is charging these two brothers for trading illegal securities so what this does ryan is it implicates coinbase as an illegal securities exchange it implicates every other exchange that also trades these assets as an illegal securities exchange it implicates the issuers of these tokens as issuers of unregistered illegal securities and the worst part about this ryan is you know who the defendants in this case are these two brothers and this other guy say these people like plead guilty they're fighting whether they should go to jail not over wire fraud they don't care if they were securities or not who does care is coinbase and the token issuers who aren't defendants they can't stick up for themselves because they're not involved in the case
