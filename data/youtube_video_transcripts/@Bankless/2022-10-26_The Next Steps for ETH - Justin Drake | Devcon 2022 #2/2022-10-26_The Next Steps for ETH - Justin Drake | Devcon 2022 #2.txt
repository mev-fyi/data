foreign [Music] six the Devcon 6 experience in this interview we're talking with Justin Drake Justin Drake gave the only talk at eath Denver about ultrasound money about ethi asset there was one talk about ethiasa which is like you know technically an Infinity number percentage more talks than all previous defcons about ether the asset so we're trending in a good direction a lot has happened about ethi asset since the last Devcon and of course Justin Drake has been the pioneer of the eth ultrasound money narrative I talked to him about the ultrasound.money website an effort that he's involved with and overall what are the next steps for ether as an asset what does 4844 do to Ether how will ether change coming into the future and just a story of ether and what he wants to do moving into the future so I hope you enjoy this conversation with Justin Drake Mr ultrasound money himself right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible truefy is leading defy into the future of on-chain uncollateralized loans opening up D5 to the 8 trillion dollar Global Credit Market whether you want higher yields on your lending or you're a fund manager who just wants access to global liquidity and the cost Savings of Defy trufi is here for you but if you're going to use trufi use it through the brave browser the user first browser for the web3h the brave browser keeps your digital footprint small keeping you in the driver's seat while also being a powerful battle station for web 3 letting you access your crypto through its native wallet view your nfts and keep up to date with your web 3 communities another thing you can use through Brave is of course Arbitron and you all of course have heard about arbitrum but the arbitrum ecosystem is really heating up with a recent launch of arbitrim Nova arbitrim has entered the world of multi-chain layer twos and with a recent acquisition of Prismatic Labs Arboretum Firepower is bigger than ever arbitrum Nitro shipped to last month and has made arbitrum faster and cheaper than ever before make sure that you can experience what arbitrim has to offer before it's too late but maybe you're a developer who hates the constraints of the evm so check out the fuel VM from the fuel Network which has opened up the world of parallel transaction execution breaking fuel Network free from evm baggage with fuel you can leverage the rust tooling ecosystem to build stronger apps all while keeping ethereum level security also pushing the frontier of web 3 develop development is the sequence wallet from Horizon sequence is the all-in-one developer platform you need to build web 3 games and applications for users sequence is a smart wallet and perhaps the most intuitive wallet in all of web 3 but for developers it's a plug and play platform for all web 3 apps and games check out sequence which is already powering some of the best web3 games out there and lastly diesel is a decentralized social platform built from the ground up to disrupt the social media industry disrupting social media takes a lot of data and dieso's infinite State applications can finally store an index large amounts of content and data fully on chain with multiple crypto native monetization mechanisms for both developers and creators DSO wants to usher in a new relationship with our social applications check them out at diesel.com and now on to the show and we are back at Devcon 6 in Bogota this time with Justin Drake who I just learned gave a talk about ultrasound money in Spanish how'd that go Justin it went okay people said that it was very very concentrated and indeed I was like a whole 25 minutes in Spanish uh my Spanish is understandable but full of mistakes so yeah I hope they understood me but I think it was appreciated that I made the effort to speak in Spanish yeah I would try to speak in Spanish but it wouldn't go very far and so maybe maybe next Devcon next Devcon that's uh somewhere in uh South America uh Justin you had the only talk that was about ether the asset uh was it about ultrasound money it was yes so basically the talk in Spanish was the prep talk and then I did it in English two days later um yeah the only talk about IFA the asset despite in my opinion IFA the asset being critical towards like the ultimate success of ethereum but was there any talk about ether the asset last Devcon because I feel like maybe it was Zero last time and it's won this time oh yeah so it's like infinitely better yeah zero to one and then the next step is one to ten or something so walking around this Devcon talking to people how are people uh receiving the ultrasound money meme like how do people think about it how are people talking to you about it very well you know I I work for Defcon and like people say good talk good talk um so I think it's appreciated um another really cool thing is that um I've had um you know thinkers and researchers and analysts and economists come to me and say hey I've been thinking about this as well and I have some ideas and I have feedback on on the content you've delivered and so now I think we have this kind of this this small group of maybe 10 to 12 people who are like seriously interested in analyzing this this narrative and and understanding its fundamentals and why do you think uh this narrative is capturing the the brains of these people because everyone wants to see if him succeed um and um in order to get there we need to really you know make IFA succeed as well because it um it's kind of somewhat counter-intuitive but as the price of ether grows that reflexively kind of increases the utility of a firm itself and that's for two reasons reason number one is Economic Security the more the more valuable if is the more secure ethereum is and so therefore develop app developers who want to see the applications live decades and centuries are more incentivized to go build on this on this protocol that's basically the protocol sync thesis like as the price of IFA goes up ethereum becomes heavier and heavier and heavier um the the other aspect is that we want to be building decentralized finance and for that we need so-called economic bandwidth we need this asset that can be used as collateral now of course we can use real world assets that comes with all sorts of complications um in terms of counterparty risks in terms of you know contract risk Oracle risk whatever it is but there is this one pristine asset ether which if we had it in very large quantities would make if you're much much more useful and valuable and we are now officially in the era of ultrasound money while the meme started sometime in 2021 we actually haven't gotten to Ether becoming true ultrasound money until we merged uh six weeks ago or so uh and now now ether is ultrasound uh and we've seen this insane amount of Supply reduction I think if we were still in proof of work uh we would have had 350 000 ether issued but instead we just have 7 000 ether issue instead so we are now in the era of ultrasound money but I don't think that story ends here there are other things uh that might uh influence or change the trajectory of the ultrasound money meme there's 4844 which will impact the economics of ether what's left in the road map for ether the asset right I think a big one is going to be scalability um and you know we have this the search coming this big wave of scalability um in my opinion we're gonna over the next decade go from 10 transactions a second to 10 million transactions per second so that's going to do a couple things like one is that it's going to dramatically decrease the per transaction fee that's pretty obvious but there's this other maybe less obvious thing is that um it's just going to create much more value and there's this notion of you know induced demand as you improve things ethereum will be providing more and more utility and therefore in aggregate when you take all the transaction fees together um you know if the historical Trend continues uh we'll be in a position where where a firm is able to capture a lot of that value and therefore become more useful for that developers because that means more Economic Security and more connect bandwidth and so the the general idea is that we are going to scalability is a huge theme here and I think now that we're done with proof of stake in eip1559 it's scalability that is where we are focusing next uh and some people are saying like oh yeah p14844 is going to reduce a lot of the eth burn and perhaps that's probably true at least in the short term until that induced demand actually starts to manifest and we find new use cases that are sub one cent transaction fees and people start transacting 10 000 times a day is that kind of the idea yeah absolutely I mean one thing to mention is that when EIP 4844 comes in is not like the the fee Market will instantly crash and the the reason is that there needs to be adoption so just like Roll-Ups themselves needs to be adopted and you know if this is still like an ongoing story and it's you know relatively slow you know roll ups came into production let's say a year ago and still right now we don't have much adoption it will be an additional kind of uh friction to move away from so-called call data which is what the resources which is being consumed today to eip44 because of various technical reasons what will happen though is that once we move from proto-deng sharding to full length shouting that is basically just increasing the amount of so-called blob data and here it will it might it will actually lead to like an instant crash in the in the markets and then here we'll have to wait for kind of a ramp up after that but you know these are transitory things that will happen in the next few years I'm I like to think about the end games I guess and Justin there's there's two ways to to talk about ultrasound money there's one at the technical layer which is what we're doing uh eip1559 proof of stake 4844 that's like the technical ways that ether change changes as an asset but there's also ultrasound money the meme uh how is the meme going uh so technical I think we're doing pretty well uh we're shipping pretty hard how is the meme doing how would you rate the rate the strength of the proliferation of the ultrasound money meme right so there's different metrics that we can use to measure the proliferation of the meme um we can look at for example the number of Twitter accounts that have the bad signal propagating the meme and there's actually something like 8 000 accounts now wow that have the bad signal a bunch of them are spam something like um like two to three to three thousand but there's still like this core group of five thousand that are not spam um there's also kind of metrics from the website right so um I'm helping out with the website and so I get access to ultrasound.money website that's correct yes um and before the merge we were doing about 3 000 unique visitors a day after the merge we were doing something like 10 000 unique visitors per day and now we're doing something like 20 to 30 000 units because people want to see The Ether Supply go down and it is exciting and also there's going to be so much more content on this website coming up and by the way a small plug if you're a front-end developer there is a position available amazing yeah and that website is just becoming more and more and more useful uh it's a great service just to understand the metrics around ether the asset and that's always one of the things I've really enjoyed about ether and ethereum and especially the monetary policy of ether is that there's more numbers to look at like Bitcoin is 21 million that's the like the only number maybe we talk about like the difficulty adjustment that's that's like the only two numbers for Bitcoin for ether there is uh the the burn per block it's there's the burn rate the issuance rate uh there's so many more metrics to look at and ultrasound money is doing a great job of just like displaying all of this uh how much work do you think it's left to do on this ultrasound money website where is it now versus where you want it to be in the future right so let me tell you about the division for this website the idea is to be like the One-Stop shop for IFA the assets um and you know really try and digest everything for for for mainstream audience in terms of um what's next to be built there's a lot around like the whole search story right so there's for example looking at the burn perola but also diving into each roll up and understanding where the burn comes from but also looking at things like total value secured because IFA the asset is can be programmed to be like this very hot money you know in the context of uh transfers and transactions but it can also be used as cold money collateral and I think total value secured is something that's not really appreciated today because you know it's only five million another 120 million so it's pretty negligible but I think what will happen over the next 10 years the 80 of all Leaf will be used as collateral either and staking or in D5 and that's going to have a huge uh consequences in terms of velocity of money and and things like like you know monetary premium so how much how much more do you think there is to under Earth about ether the asset do we kind of know most that we will know about ether diasa or is there is still a lot of story to be told here um two years ago I knew almost nothing and I think this this is a typical for technical people like with technology technology technology and um I've learned so much over the last few years and I still keep on on learning um and also like as I mentioned there's people who approached me and there's some people who just disagree with me and so that's going to lead to debate and refinements and and new hypothesis put forward um but one of the the fun things is that you know this is this is low-hanging fruit we're doing something that's never been done in the history of money it's extremely exciting it has a lot of potential um and here we are at the frontier discovering it I was hoping we were going to say that word the front we're on the frontier um oh my gosh there's so much so much left in the story to be told one of the critiques about ether the ultrasound money narrative is it's deflationary and deflation is bad it's going to spiral out of control it's going to make ethereum too expensive to use blah blah blah uh is this a misconception is this critique valid how do you think about the deflation critique of ether right um so I think deflation is bad is a valid criticism for some types of monies but not for E30 assets specifically and the reason is that I distinguish two types of assets I distinguish debt money and collateral money now why is it good for debt money to be inflationary can we Define that money real quick yeah the idea of that money is that you put forward a collateral and you take out debt from this collateral so the the simplest example is maybe your house you have a house you take a mortgage you take out debt um and it's good that this debt is denominated in US dollars for example and the re one of the reasons is that it's inflationary and so over time it becomes easier and easier to pay the debt and so you're actually unlikely to to default on your debt um and you know the reason why the house is kind of a good collateral is because house prices are up only so that's the reason why banks are just so comfortable at giving you a a mortgage because houses are optimized as collateral and then US dollars are optimized as debt and it's the same thing with ether you have e further optimized as a collateral asset again to which you're going to take debt which is going to be a stable coin like die or Rye or LUSD um and in my opinion and here is because you're on the other side of the coin you actually want your debt your collateral asset to be deflationary you want it to grow in value over time because it means that you're less likely to get liquidated um and and therefore lead to these like large systemic risk where you know potentially like you have mass defaults and and things collapse okay so there's two types of money are there and that's the only two types of money there's collateral money and debt money is that is that a fair take yeah that's one way to classify the two sides of the coin right yeah and so you're saying that you want the collateral money to go up in price and you want the debt money to go down in price and that probably produces a more stable Financial system over the long term you probably don't want it to be too inflationary or too deflationary you want it to not be too volatile but where the collateral grows up in value and the debt goes down in value over the long term you're saying is is a good Financial system yeah for robustness for robustness yeah and I always thought it was another take about um the deflationary aspect of ether is that well there's so many other currencies on ethereum that you get to kind of pick and choose your monetary policy and I and I think what you are saying is actually a more evolved version of this narrative but my idea was that there's the Rye monetary policy the die monetary policy The Ether monetary policy and since all of these things have tons of liquidity with each other on ethereum it doesn't matter if ether is super deflationary because you can you have like Alternatives right and it's not like it well it is setting like the core Foundation of all of ethereum it's not like uh you know the dye economy is actually somewhat distinct from The Ether economy yeah exactly um like if you if your use case is like hot money meaning High Velocity money then you can move in and out really quickly of various or various currencies but in terms of um you know use cases of money as currency by the way currency comes from a current it means money that flows um I think if it's going to play a large role for a couple reasons like one is if you think of a D5 money blocks right they're going to compose through this money API and if these money blocks Wanna Live for decades and centuries they're going to want to choose like the most pristine apis and most robust ones and so I think IFA is going to play a large role and we're already seeing that for example on uniswap 95 of the non-like to like uh trading volume is if and also a very similar story on openc like a lot of the nft trading is is is an if but even for those use cases that don't want each because it's too volatile I think what we want as a community is to use stabilized Eve so we could use a stable coin like usdc or usdt um but you know that comes with all sorts of problems and my hope at least is that these you know custodial based centralized stable coins are you know a temporary thing and in 10 years time um there'll be a thing of the past so historically in the developer Circles of ethereum it's always been a focus on ethereum the network not ether the money and you've been you've been the developer leading the charge it's like hey no also ether2 how has that been resonating with the other developers in in the ethereum circles yeah um like there's been this gradual warming up um you know I I used to be the exception but now like uh more and more people you know appreciate it and I think it's it's a journey again that like technical people kind of go through um and I think you know as a researcher you know I spend a lot of time really deep in the technology but now that I have a bit more free time because the research problems have been solved I can kind of go at different layers of the stack and I think um this might happen with other people uh as well and I think there's also kind of this aspect of taboo associated with it which I think is like slowly like the the dissolving um you know partly because um you know maybe of Regulation as well like there was like uncertainty around whether you know IFA is a security I think at this point in time you know I don't want to put I'm not a lawyer but you know um I think we can we can move on and start talking about it more freely certainly so Justin you are the ultrasound money guy the guy that thinks a lot about ether and monetary policy but what else about ethereum outside of ether has captured your attention especially some of the conversations here at Defcon uh outside of ether uh what what is in your brain yeah so I'm like really fascinated by ZK VMS um like there's the a nerd dream because there's encompasses so much technology and like this one black box um and you know I've just been amazed at how much progress there's been there's still a lot of work to do and you know often like the ZK Roblox will kind of hype them ourselves a little bit too much you know one of the things I'm worried for example is bugs right we have these extremely complicated circuits and one critical bug is enough to break the ZK roll up and we're talking potentially a billion dollar plus hack um and now we've seen empirically that we can't even get Bridges correctly like every other week There's a hundred million dollar Bridge hack and so I'm I am worried about the the security of the cable Ops and you know this is an opportunity right for people who are Security Experts who are former Vacation Experts for the fuzzers whatever it is please join us we need you to to solve this problem how do we solve this problem or is that just a research task I think it's more of an engineering test like you want to build systems that are um modular so that we can kind of analyze like chunk by chunk and you know if if this bit is secure and this bit is secure then you know we want these composability guarantees that the whole thing is also secure um and one of the the good things about breaking it down in chunks is that um you know we can put out like the best tools that we have so you know we have um just audits using like using your eyes uh we have fuzzing which is this idea like throwing all sorts of random junk at it and seeing where it breaks and then we have like the extreme end of the spectrum where which is called formal verification where you basically write a mathematical proof written by a computer that this thing is exactly equivalent to the spec that it's meant to to match amazing yeah the the excitement around the ZK EVMS are definitely palpable especially when like at HCC the theme was the ZK EVMS are here now here at Devcon all the test Nets are coming online and DK Sync has their layer threes uh are you optimistic that we'll be able to smoothly solve the bridge issue and the bug issue perhaps faster than what we've seen in 2021 right so um one of the things that I think will happen is that these roll ups won't go like fully decentralized and permissionless from day one there will be this gradual ramp up and one of the things that I think is a good idea is uh basically this this maybe one hour like safety buffer so you know one of the big selling points of ZK Road apps is that you get this instant finality but I think it's actually okay that in the early days finality takes a whole hour and the idea of delaying by an hour is that if an attacker basically forges a proof for an invalid route which kind of empties the whole thing we have this one hour to kind of press the big red pause button and fix everything okay yeah that that yeah I I can definitely see that um and uh when with ZK Roll-Ups of course ever they're all super hyped uh but it's also some of the most new technology that we have in this space uh which is always a little bit scary uh Justin do you have any plans for Bogota for the rest of your time here um so there's like a couple um kind of off-sides uh one for the whole of the f one for the research team uh looking forward to kind of getting out I've been you know primarily like a hotel in here uh and they're five minutes from each other um spend so much time meeting people with the energy is like so high and you know it's been very productive do conferences drain you they energize me and they drain me at the same time like it's like adrenaline and then you know I'm happy to go back home so that I can kind of see my family and rest well Justin it's been fantastic hanging out with you here in Bogota and thank you for your time yeah thank you cheers cheers [Music]
