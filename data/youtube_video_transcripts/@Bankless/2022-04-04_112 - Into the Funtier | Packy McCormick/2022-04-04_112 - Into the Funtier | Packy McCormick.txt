i think there's just so much that you can do when you're able to give ownership in the thing that people are using and building that's what i think is so powerful about about web3 welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a fantastic episode for you today with packy mccormick into the frontier the combination of fun plus money wins that is the secret recipe for crypto a lot of themes we touch upon in this book a few takeaways for you number one we talk about the bull case for ethereum also solana and web3 i think has a great lens on this number two why humans are just status monkeys status seeking monkeys we talk about that and how it applies to nfts number three how making money on the internet with friends is the new normal that's what we're doing here in crypto and number four a bonus talk a little bit about why cardano is not gonna make it uh in the flaws in that community yeah david a fun episode with he's a talented writer great thinker on a number of uh subjects he also came into crypto in 2021 or re came into crypto in 2021 which gave him sort of a fresh lens to synthesize and look at everything that's going on uh and we talk a lot about his his journey in 2021 i'm really insightful what were some of your thoughts yeah is just such a such a fun guy it was such a treat just to chat with him for for 90 minutes it didn't really feel like a podcast it felt like just we're hanging out chatting about crypto chatting about what he's written and it's always it's always a treat when we bring on people who can write really really well who can make content really really well because they have already they have very well formulated thoughts this is the process of writing this is the process of podcasting is these thoughts are already well formulated and now we are just deliberating and discussing them uh and and is he's he's intuitive and intelligent enough to really create some really awesome concepts and ideas almost about everything that's related to to web3 but also how it relates to almost everything else in the world uh and so he's bringing a lot of just um prior knowledge outside knowledge to the world of web 3 to help guide his understanding i think i think losers are really going to like it we talk a lot about ethereum solana modular versus monolithic blockchains and the different niches that those play out of course we talked about nfts and how nfts and and are making the internet fun again and how that kind of change is changing the culture of people who pay attention to the internet and how engaging on the internet is fundamentally changing because of web3 we also touched on jack dorsey and and his whole anti-web 3 narrative and a few other just fantastic topics overall just a fun episode i think you guys are going to be smiling while you listen to this one yeah we talk about the bull the bull case but we also end on some of the critiques on the bear case for for web 3 which is always a good thing to add to a podcast of this type guys we're super excited to bring you this podcast with mccormick but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible

guest packy mccormick he's an investor at not boring capital he's also an advisor to a16 z's web 3 fund he's a writer of one of my favorite newsletters besides bankless of course i gotta say that list is number one called not boring this is business strategy meets technology and more recently he's had a big focus on web 3 which i've loved to see and one thing i think we can promise about this podcast is that it will not be boring because we have the writer of not boring welcome to bankless how are you doing hello bankless nation good to be here good to be here guys thanks so much for having me oh it's awesome to have you um i i think you know what uh we want to start with sort of your crypto journey if that's cool hear a little bit more about it because um i've been a follower of your newsletter for for a little bit like on and off uh and then i think i i really started tracking you when uh we got introduced i think somebody from the the solana team actually introduced us and said hey yo do you know packy mccormick he's got some questions for you ryan about ethereum i was like cool i love questions about ethereum uh and uh i think you know one of your first telegram messages to me after we got uh introduced you just like laid into some fantastic questions like just like bam you hit me with the hard ones like what's the counter argument to solana's uh or what's the counter to selana's argument that l2's break composability you hit me with that one and then you asked why the tvl the total locked value on ethereum has been declining recently and then you also asked of all the other l1s which if any do i think is the biggest threat to ethereum and i think at the time i want to get into your your mind space at the time but i think at the time you were kind of doing a deep dive on ethereum and you were doing a deep dive on all of these various uh web 3 platforms can you give us like a sense of of your journey at the time so where were you in the crypto journey had you been in crypto in the past were you taking another uh deep look uh tell us about that yeah so my crypto journey started in i think 2013. uh whenever union square ventures led uh the round in coinbase i read the fred wilson blog post i was currently i was i was out of bank at the time so as i was going bankless and quitting uh my job at bank of america merrill lynch uh one of the things that i realized is that they didn't realize that coinbase existed so if you work at a bank they track all the things that you trade you have a 30-day holding period it's kind of a pain to do anything bitcoin however they had no idea about and so i was able to kind of buy uh buy a bunch of bitcoin i think about 38 of them at about a hundred dollars and then a couple of months later i went to oktoberfest i'd quit my job went talk to professors with some friends they still worked in finance so uh we're going out and having a big night i pretended like i still worked in finance and woke up the next morning mad at myself for spending all of that money when i was unemployed and about to start working at a startup making a lot less money so i sold the 38 bitcoin for about 150 a coin uh so that was kind of beginning of my my journey and because of that i you know i dabbled a little bit in 2017 but really kind of avoided the space because i was so mad at myself for for selling too early and for paper hansing that trade uh so by the time you know i think kind of early in 2021 january 2021 is when i started kind of getting interested in in crypto and web 3 again nft's kind of brought me back in the space and just kind of thinking about what the value chain looks like when you cut out the middleman like you know there's obviously all of the the kind of like fervor and almost kind of like religious language around cutting out the middle man but i was like what does that actually mean it means that more value accrues to both sides to the creator and to the consumer and that's a really powerful thing and you can build new business models based off of that so by i think may is when i wrote about ethereum and and when we were introduced and so my journey at that point was you know ethereum is my biggest holding still my biggest crypto holding i think my biggest holding of anything at the point huge huge fan but you know like to kind of battle test all of these things because my brain is naturally not skeptical so i like to talk to people who are smarter than me i even asked the internet i got probably a thousand replies and why i shouldn't just put all of my money into ethereum um but that was kind of the context of us talking was you know from you know some of the some of the biggest ethereum bulls that i know and i think bennett salon introduced us that he knows you know what are the what are the drawbacks i always find it interesting for people who come into this space and then take a hiatus for a while and then come back because their perspectives as like okay how has this space developed is always interesting especially when you you were gone for a sounds like a decently long time the difference between 150 bitcoin and the rise of the alt layer ones is a very significant span of time i actually don't know of anyone who has like a longer gap in their crypto history than that so when you came back into the space what were your first impressions about like oh how has this space developed what were the things that really stood out to you as somebody that once paid attention left and then came back yeah so i think you know bitcoin is obviously the the og and is interesting for its own sake and and all of those sorts of things but as someone who likes technology businesses and kind of diving into how companies work and and business strategy like there's not much there on the bitcoin side you know price goes up store value nothing particularly exciting to to kind of break down when i was kind of introduced to or reintroduced to ethereum and kind of what was happening there seeing use cases being built on top seeing dapps being built on top seeing nfts exploding seeing defy exploding i just realized that there's this whole new kind of ecosystem this is like a whole different you know sort of internet uh and so that was just really exciting to me i think coming back was that you know i the new york times just i think blamed me a little bit for for you know the web three uh moniker in a post to kevin roosted this weekend but i do think that there's something to you know it's it being a lot more than cryptocurrency at this point and that was one of the things that drew me back in what it was that it wasn't just about the money at this point it was about so much more and kind of building this thing that uh the users and the builders get to own yeah it does seem from from your journey packy that um you've been sort of a big bowl of web3 and i think we want to get into those themes too so you know for david and i we're we're also like content producers and the way we learn about things is like by writing about them or like by hitting the record button on a podcast in order to do it so we've always introduced like the stuff that we do on bank is it's it's really part of our journey and like we're inviting a community around us to come you know um discover what we're discovering and co-discover with us this this strange new world of crypto and that's very much in in like reading what you've been writing over the past year or so that's very much what i've observed um you doing is you like you do a deep dive you ask a whole bunch of good questions uh and then you you you kind of um create a synthesis of the answers to those questions the best answers you you can find to those questions in some sort of a post that you publish so i i think that like maybe the best way to go through some of this podcast and to to sort of unpack your brain in what you've discovered since coming back to crypto in 2021 is to actually go through some of those posts because they're fantastically written and we want to get maybe the gist of the the post and so there's like five posts that i think uh would be really cool for us to go through but let's start with this first one which is the post you published i think shortly after your telegram message to me where you were doing a deep dive on this ethereum thing after a hiatus after you know bitcoin in 2013 and you know the the the sound money meme and all of that maybe didn't resonate with you but now you've discovered this new thing and so you wrote this post called ethereum own the internet a bull case for ethereum um i want to start maybe with this question where we dive into some of the the sub themes of this article but what did you really discover about ethereum during your your deep dive at that time yeah so a fun fun bit of trivia is that the opening quote in that article was the ryan john adams quote the most bullish thing for ether is to be understood and so i'm gonna have to take credit for that one actually that one was it that one was wow so mccormick quoting ryan sean adams quoting david hoffman the most bullish thing for ether is to be understood and michael scott's got style quote exactly so i i mean a year ago and it seems crazy but a year ago is kind of when i think ethereum started breaking into like the very popular uh consciousness like you know it was getting written up in bloomberg and patrick shaughnessy was talking about it on his podcast so for people who are kind of interested in kind of business and technology more broadly i think early 2021 is when people really started kind of re-learning about ethereum obviously you know you guys have been a great resource for that one of the things that i think uh you know there's a couple of things that that i discovered uh were kind of just different ways of thinking about ethereum that i thought were useful one was kind of comparing it just to you know thinking about it as a company as opposed to just an asset so there's obviously the kind of triple point uh argument that y'all made that i quoted in the piece as well but just the fact that like as usage goes up fees go up and you know it behaves kind of you can kind of analyze this like you would analyze a business i think is is one interesting thing uh a second one is that ethereum i realized kind of writing this i had just written about uh about excel that ethereum really seems an awful lot like excel in a lot of different ways one it's kind of lindy so the longer it's around but i think you know the less likely that anybody's going to come around and kill it two that kind of composability is just built into this thing where in ethereum or in in excel you can build formulas that build off of each other and you get really really good at it and so as you build more and more complex formulas and build bigger and bigger models you're kind of more and more locked into this thing gets more and more magical same thing with you know ethereum and composability and people kind of mixing and matching primitives uh and then just the fact that it is this kind of just distributed computer which now i think obviously anybody listened to this podcast but really most people in the world kind of uh understand but just was kind of radical to me thinking about at the time when my previous exposure had really just been bitcoin so uh you had this quote uh in your article as well owning eth is like owning shares in the internet uh demand for eth will go up with increased web 3 adoption while upcoming changes will decrease the supply of eth and let more value accrue to holders it's like a tech stock a bond a ticket to web three and money rolled into one that's just a fantastic summary of uh the bull case for eth so you're seeing it eat the asset both tied to web3 adoption but also it being sort of a unique asset that gives you exposure into like a lot of different upside it's it's like not limited to just a money or a tech stock it's kind of something new it's all of these things combined can you talk a bit more about that yeah it's it's kind of this index right on on the adoption of of web 3 almost where one of the most fascinating things about it is it you know and this analogy has been i think used uh many times but is if you had to say buy shares in amazon and use that to pay for aws right i think that idea of having to use web3 by kind of starting by purchasing eth and then going down the the rabbit hole from there and swapping it for other things and staking it and doing all this other stuff all starts with buying this thing that also you know with with uh the proof of stake switch and the run on the verge of the merge um you know we'll essentially will essentially uh you know as as people use it more and more you have to buy eth as you use if the value goes goes up uh and and so that that was one of those really interesting kind of mental shifts for me is that it really is like kind of buying uh buying equity almost uh except for the fact that you then go and use it we're about to keep on going down your journey into uh into other layer ones because again we're following paki's journey through the process of understanding uh web3 but before we talk about the other layer ones that is interested in what property or quality of ethereum has that really really excites you that that no other l1 has oh i mean i think the legitimacy is is there for sure and just the fact that that is where so much of the activity lives and so much of the culture lives uh and you know it just it has kind of that beautiful blend of security um but you know composability and flexibility and all those types of things that it just feels like a chain that is going to be around for a very very long time and will continue to get more and more used and more valuable and then what about the inverse of that question what what about ethereum do you think uh really holds you back i'm not gonna say anything novel here right like you know i think the the the gas and and you know speed all the gas has been a little bit more palatable recently but you know paying paying ten dollars even uh limits the the kind of use cases that that you can do uh but i think that'll get fixed i i'm like i said super bullish packy do you think that um like did anything about your re-entry into into crypto in 2021 re-excite you about bitcoin at all or is it possible now to come back in to crypto in 2021 and like completely ignore bitcoin i've i've probably actually to my detriment i think ignored bitcoin maybe even too much i mean you know so much is so much of i think the value in the space moves with uh with bitcoin still and i'm awaiting the flipping listening uh listening to bankless and and getting updates on how close we are to it but i think for now uh you know at least from a financial perspective um there's so much of the industry moves with bitcoin that it's i probably ignore it at my own peril i just don't find it particularly interesting i i find the idea interesting and i i own a little bit of it and it will sit there but there's not like a ton more to explore from that point and so i just haven't you know i watched the price and that's about it just uh but before we move on from uh ethereum two i'm wondering if you could kind of paint the the picture of the um the web3 value proposition for us a little bit more so what is it about web3 what does this term even mean to you and um how does that relate to what you first saw in ethereum sure so web3 the definition that i've used is that it's the internet owned by the users and the builders orchestrated with tokens and i think there's just so much that you can do when you're able to give ownership in the thing that people are using and building and when you're able to use tokens as incentives uh and use whether that's fungible tokens non-functional tokens use those things as incentives to guide behaviors and design richer systems than you could otherwise and you cut out the middleman not in any kind of zealot or zealous way but in a real impactful way where both sides of the equation who are adding value to the system are able to pull more value out of the system um that that's what i think is so powerful about about web3 to me okay well let's uh let's keep moving so this is sort of the first milestone that we we picked up in your in your crypto journey your newfound uh crypto journey in 2021 which is um ethereum the ability to own the internet right and this is where you know the web 3 kind of starts at some level although some might argue web 3 is also a bitcoin thing i'm not sure bitcoin maximalist would embrace that but um we tend to think bitcoin is just another piece of web 3. um but you said this in your uh ethereum article as well you also talked about some of the risks to ethereum being like kind of transaction fees and the cost to actually use uh the main chain network and you said the l1 that i'm most excited about besides ethereum is solana uh and of course that was actually a good time to be excited about solana at least i was a good time to be buying solana for sure the soul token uh at uh when did you publish the ethereum article was that like april is made that was may of 21. okay so it's may so it's right before this thing that um the solana community called solana summer where solana had a fantastic price run uh and uh also we're seeing some real traction on selena solana so let's talk about the the second article and the genesis for that article which is solana summer so clearly before this article you you had been looking at solana and been bullish about solana but can you tell us why you were excited about it was it was it really the transaction fees were there other elements in play that made you excited about the uh solana ecosystem sure so in the the smallest of small worlds uh ben sprango who works at that salon and introduced us was my neighbor growing up and so i know that he'd he he was and so you know i know that he'd been uh involved in the space for a little while and that kind of tracked him but as i was kind of out of the space wasn't tracking as closely then i came back in and and caught up with him and he told me kind of why he went to solana and what he was so excited about what he was working on introduced me to anatoly and just kind of got more and more bullish transaction fees and speed are obviously uh two of the things that that got me excited to start but i think the thing you know the way that i tried to frame the piece and the way that i tried to frame a lot of the things that i write about crypto is not as this completely other thing but as a thing that kind of follows you know some of the same rules that most businesses have to follow but just with some you know supercharged tokenomics built into the mix and so for solana it's really kind of a platform dynamic where solana does well if it's able to acquire developers who build products that acquire users and it's kind of you know that that simple and so what attracted me was i started talking to more and more and more people who were building on top of solana and there felt like there was a lot of developer interest moving over there how about the uh the the transaction fees in solana so in your article um you wrote this i think at the time it cost something like three dollars to do a transaction on bitcoin and at the time a massively high gas fees people probably remember this in may of last year eight to forty dollars on ethereum main net uh and at the time it only cost 0.001 cents like a fraction of a penny to do a transaction on solana do you think that is the big kind of value proposition that something like solana brings aside from like of course ethereum has a fantastic community um but aside from that is it is it mostly about transaction fees and decreasing the cost of those i think it's transaction fees and speed right it just feels performant there's uh i'm gonna blank on the name maybe we can put it in the show notes afterwards but there's a website that you can go to on solana that actually lets you kind of just execute transactions in real time as fast as you can kind of hit a button and it shows those those transactions uh settling like kind of within seconds and it's just a very different experience than uh operating on ethereum where you're used to you know signing a transaction with a meta mask and just kind of waiting for a little while until uh you know something something happens so i think there's that speed element that that attracts uh people in addition to the the low transaction costs which is which is really nice as well do you think that's what a lot of people are looking for like when they come i mean everyone's used to mainstream right it's like may stream is used to a web 2 experience where just like i click the button and the thing works right it's like very easy to use uh in crypto we're kind of used to like janky user interfaces and so like i mean people that use the original maker dao interface you know they they see the the abilities that the new generation have today and like the like the seamless things you can do in metamask they think oh man this is fantastic it's so easy to use but if you talk to like you know your mom and get her to do something in d5 she's going to be completely flustered like have no idea how things work because it's so clunky and difficult do you think that is part of the appeal of something like solana hey this thing just kind of works the same way the internet does and you click a button and things happen and that's it a hundred percent i think you know one of my maybe less popular uh takes is just that you know the people who care the ad the most about decentralization the people who are most willing to put up janky with janky experiences to interact with crypto are probably the people who are already in the space and so as you think about onboarding the next billion users which every product including solana claims to want to do i think making an experience that feels more and more and more like web 2 and from usability perspective like kind of the promise of the you know web 3 is that it combines the open uh kind of permissionless nature of web one with the usability of web two and so i think the closer and closer you move to usability experiences that people are used to the better it will be so you're almost like a ux maximalist then a little bit like not a maximus but you know things like that anything maybe but like as far as you think that you would prioritize user experience is one of the most important things about the crypto experience i think it really depends who you're who you're building for really so i wrote about uh flow recently as well and i think kind of similar similar argument there where there is a portion of people for whom i would much rather they own their nft and own their digital assets than not and if that means that you know short term you're not fully decentralized and you're using your credit card and uh it feels more like a web 2 experience but you own the thing that's great and you know there's a large portion of the population for whom that's really valuable there's a smaller but super valuable and passionate portion of the community for whom the jackie experience is kind of part of the fun and it makes you feel like you're a part of something and it's almost like a video game where you know part of the the beauty of a video game is that you're doing something that's hard but achievable and there's something about that in in crypto as well so i'm not necessarily like a clean smooth easy on-ramp maxi although i think they're super valuable to get the next billion people into the space but i do think that for uh you know for certain use cases speed low cost and just usability does matter one of the aspects about solana that i know has compelled you and many many others is the commitment to uh blockchain wide composability right like not sharding uh not having layer two so that every single defy app is on the same plane as every other defy app and that in combination with like the low transaction fees is is really compelling to a lot of people i'm i'm wondering that that's if uh i believe that's what caught your attention about solana in the first place and i'm wondering if you're um philosophically that has turned into a debate between people that kind of believe in the modular blockchain thesis versus people that are really committed to not trying to break composability and i'm wondering how your thoughts and mental models about this has developed over time and probably a bad podcast because i i my my answers are somewhere you know in the middle on a lot of things i think for certain use cases some you know certain defy use cases on salon i think having kind of full composibility is valuable i don't think full composibility is valuable for everything i think when you think about um you know when again going back to kind of the the flow piece like the fact that uh you know nfts are able to kind of own different things and just kind of compose a little bit more nicely and do a lot in one transaction uh without without sharding uh on on flow i think there's value to that for certain use cases and then there's some use cases for which i don't think it matters at all but you know i think ryan uh you when we first messaged had thoughts on uh on kind of composability and and sharding so i'd love to hear your thoughts oh i can't remember what i said but yeah i mean i i think that um i i think probably some of our thoughts right now are and like you know david and i probably skew a bit more uh decentralization not not maximum i wouldn't call myself a maximalist about anything but like as close to maybe maximalist as we are about any of the priorities in crypto and that and that we think that like strong property property rights is really the the basis of the system for like the long-term achievement of of its goals and so um we've we've done a lot of like work on uh exploring and talking about this this whole design philosophy the difference between a modular blockchain and a monolithic or something like uh solana is trying is going down the monolithic path where they're trying to kind of expand their base layer and put consensus and data and execution all inside of the same system and there are some probably user experience at least in the early phases you know there's a lot of value produced by that because you preserve composability and in the earliest phases of course you have um high transaction throughput and gas fees are cheap and all of these great things and i think some a network like solana is probably using these things to build this early network effect and create a fantastic ecosystem for itself and if i was kind of going up against a a bitcoin or ethereum i was looking at a spot in the scalability trilemma to go like park my niche that would probably be a a reasonable place to go try try to try to attack and carve out my space um i think for david and i we probably don't think it's as uh a durable competitive advantage over time um we think that ecosystems that are like it's basically like the question of is ux more important or is decentralization more important it's like why can't we have both and we think that the modular blockchain like design gets you both over time where you're kind of separating consensus and data availability and execution and you're doing more on these rollups but it's going to take more time to kind of get there and to smooth out the user experience because you have many various rollups you have like you know bridging where you have to bridge your assets in between and so it's going to be a longer term journey but we also think it's going to be the one that um is the most effective at preserving decentralization and also at sustaining a competitive moat in the future but it's also like who knows how this will shape up right so who knows what solana will do in the future ethereum has certainly taken many zigs and zags in its roadmap um ass has bitcoin as well so um at some level like the competition is fantastic as well uh but um it's it's also important that we as a crypto space preserve that decentralization at least you know that that's kind of our take i think david wants to chime in too yeah in addition to that like there is always a concern of just like uh do we really want uh do people want to be bridging all the time like are we asking every single user to be bridgers and at least there is like research out there uh with on the zk roll up side of things the when you have zk roll ups uh especially liquidity across ck roll ups like one uniswap style amm on one zk roll up with a liquidity on a different different roll up there actually is uh technology out there research out there that allows synchronous sinking of liquidity across zk rollups and so while you're on different roll-ups the liquidity is shared and so there's like little tricks and tools like this that allows for composability across roll-ups that we know exists we just have not yet applied and so there's a lot of these like ux problems that do have solutions and they're solved through cryptography which is like hard mode right cryptography is always hard mode but it's also the way that you preserve decentralization while also solving some of these ux issues and so the what i think ryan would agree is like the i think we both think the hardest problem in crypto is getting your monetary policy fixed uh and that is the thing that we have not seen any uh any alternative layer ones be able to be able to do and so you know what solana offers in uh like cheap transaction transaction fees and universal composability it loses in an insane amount of issuance of the soul token to provide that service uh and so we kind of think that if you're not playing to be money you're playing to be uh sub like uh you're not playing to win right like the the game is to be an empire and an empire kind of needs to have its own native currency and if your currency has a hole in this ship because it has to issue a ton in order to provide the services that it's providing then then you're you're planning to lose uh and and not to say that this is the end-all be-all state fair solana like do like like ethereum had issuance very very high issues at the beginning of its um of its trajectory but also the difference was that uh ethereum also was focused on that as a culture and as a community from very very very early on yeah i mean i i'm incredibly excited for the the zero knowledge future um and i think there's there's just so many so many benefits there uh that that uh you know i'm again super super super bullish on ethereum and that's that's one of the reasons that that's the case i also think that you know the current kind of bridging and l2 experience is harrowing for me let alone you know we're talking about my mom trading defy like there is no way that she is sending money over a bridge even to polygon uh and waiting and wondering where that money went and if it will ever hit the other side and all of those types of things and so i think to kind of keep that like beautiful internet tracking curve of crypto adoption that that we've seen having other l ones that that take different approaches now into your point may change over time but that take different approaches uh now i think it's a really really valuable thing for for the space generally uh can we talk i'm curious you have this great section in your solana article about how value accrues to solana where uh you also summarize how it accrues to bitcoin and eth and i think you do a really good job of that and then you try to put into words how value might accrue to the soul token and i'm curious to dig into that but i i guess you know the the summary here is um you know you're saying bitcoin acts as a store of value which is a mix of inter-subjective belief just like the mean value let's call it uh also supply and demand the fact that there will only be 21 million bitcoin there's also these other things like the mining cost floor and then maybe there's this um this market cap based on gold price could be one of the inter-subjective beliefs that we're measuring uh it again so it's basically a store of value um and then you also see eth as a triple point money in that a triple point asset in that it is a store of value is also a consumable so it's every time you know you spend ethon on uh block space and there's blocks face demand so that eath is burnt right and that goes back to holders in the form of negative issuance and it's also a capital asset when you stake we've certainly talked a lot about that on bankless um and then you said this soul believe uh behaves similarly to eth with a few key differences it's also a triple point money and so you also compared it to to ethan this way he said it's also kind of a store of value because within the sold native economy you can use it as collateral for d5 in the same way you can use eth in the ethereum economy it's also a consumable asset they a little bit of soul is burnt every time so they have a mechanism similar to eip-1559 and there's a staking mechanism as well so triple point and all of those things except you said one thing that's different i really want to get into this uh is how soul accrues value is a bit more complicated because the the two main ways soul occurs value right now in your opinion is staking and mev which stands for minimum extractable value or minor extractable maximum excuse me or minor extractable value in a proof of work uh mode i wonder if you could dig into that specifically the soul value proposition because this is where i think um some people have trouble like figuring out what the value of soul is we had anatoly on a couple months ago on a podcast and we were like hey anatoly is soul money he's like no we're not trying to be not trying to be money i don't think seoul is going for the the monetary premium aspect of it but maybe maybe it becomes the money as a result of its economy how do you think about soul the asset and its value yeah so the the interesting one here and the reason that uh that i said it gets a little more complicated and i'll try to try to explain it is the way that i think ben described it to me and as i dug in i think i kind of came to believe is that um you know essentially the projects that are building on top of solana are incentivized to have the value of soul high enough such that the value of the chain or the market cap of the chain the market cap of soul staked uh to to kind of secure the chain is higher than all of the the value of all of the things being built on top of solana uh or else there is incentive to go out and and attack the network and drain everything on top and so it's almost like the project's building on solana as they get more successful or more more incentivized to to buy and stake solana make the price go up make it more secure almost like they're paying security you know like like they'd be paying for security software except buying and staking the sole token which is uh you know creates creates more demand and and locks it up uh on the mev side i think this is a little more future state but this is uh this is one of the things that that anatoly has pointed to and i'll just quote him on it he said that mev means that validators have some information that they've computed that if they take your order they can make a profit if the info you're submitting is useful enough to someone they'll actually pay you to take your order it's payment for order flow at a micro level but in a fair and open market it makes the high frequency trading spread a commodity so i think that's a really interesting idea and back to kind of this idea of owning the internet and cutting out the middleman and value accruing to both sides is that there's this concept that particularly at the time when the robinhood scandal was happening payment for order flow was viewed as this really bad thing like one you know one party paying to get information to give them an advantage in the market here the really interesting thing about it is that the people who own and are staking soul accrue the value from from meb in this case and so uh you know if there's if somebody has information they can make money off of uh people who who own seoul as opposed to citadel are the ones kind of capturing that value so that i guess the the mev portion of things where uh stakers are receiving a portion of transaction fees basically getting getting paid by users who want their black their block to come in first right or be ordered in a certain way that's where it transforms soul into a cash flowing capital asset in your opinion it's from the primarily from the mev correct it's always it's always uh tricky you know in terms of like valuing the these crypto networks as well do you think this is more like like art than science or do you think this is more narrative than actual concrete you know valuation um yeah you know i guess discounted cash flow models that we can plug in a spreadsheet i think eth is certainly easier and will you know kind of continue to get uh to get easier with the merge um i think in seoul's case certainly the maybe i'm just not a good enough scientist and i'm more of an artist so i'm going to lean towards the artist side but just you know kind of the rough rule of thumb for me is if activity and value on top of solana goes up price of solana should go up now could i build you a model that tells you what that price should go up to absolutely not and i think that's kind of you know mix of my shortcoming on the modeling side my rustiness there uh mixed with the fact that it's a difficult thing to to value and you know all of my time talking to the team i don't think anybody have ever brought up price once yeah it's just not as important an aspect in the community as as it is for other other tokens i want to get your opinion on how do you think this plays out over the very long time frames not just five ten years but something like you know 25 plus years basically it's the question of like distribution of of market cap do you think that this is a winner take all environment um or do you think this is a pretty uh wide distribution of many many layer ones with many many valuable layer one assets gosh i think this is a and my crystal ball is broken on this one for sure i think that one of the interesting things to see happening will be to see you know as wormhole and layer zero and some of these uh other kind of you know cross chain uh bridging platforms emerge i think it'll be really interesting to see if if they all kind of behave as almost one big blockchain uh with everything kind of coming back and settling on ethereum including ethereum's own l2s but even non-evm compatible chains like uh like solana i think that's one way that it plays out i think probably there's certainly you know as there are with most things power laws and i think a lot of value accrues to ethereum over time um but i do think that we're we'll have a multi-chain probably not super wide distribution probably like you know a few chains that do particular things very well uh and then maybe all kind of settle back on on ethereum something that you said there i think is is worth uh pulling apart uh where you kind of alluded to like these comments the coming together of all these different chains including l1s and layer twos and the the i think the image to present to users is something like a superstructure where we have all these we can use the model of defy growth on ethereum to start with where first we had maker dow and it produced dye and then later we had compound and it was a money market but they were all very separate and over time all these things started to really come together and defy on ethereum is really starting to not just be individual applications but one significant structure of all these interoperable composed applications but what you just said was actually the first time i've heard that articulated across layer once where not only can the d5 ecosystem of one single chain be start to coalesce into one single superstructure but you think the entire crypto universe can become one single like composable financial superstructure is that is that is that a fair articulation i think it's a fair technique i i don't see how that doesn't happen over time right like that you know if you had to use a different credit card on a bunch of different websites uh you know that would be a real pain i do think that there are network effects to uh you know kind of building developer and user ecosystems on top of these chains and that i don't know if everybody moves all use case over to one chain or to one l2 or to multiple l2 is on top of on top of ethereum i would imagine that that ultimately kind of create the the l1 superstructure um but you know obviously very dvd and they're people a lot smarter than me on this that would be just my kind of best best guess here i mean like you even look at something like you know cello where they're starting to build a network of all the kind of regenerative finance and climate based projects and so you know part of that might be the technical capabilities of the chain but part of it is you just build kind of differentiation and an identity into the platform and you start attracting a certain type of project so do those all move off at some point and go to ethereum or does cello kind of bridge into ethereum i think you know open question but it'd be hard to see kind of just everything deciding to to shift off i um i kind of you know what helps me in sort of the superstructure lens is actually thinking of everything as a chain just think of every everything's a chain do you know what i mean like your wells fargo account is a chain it's just a it's just a side chain okay like coin base that's a chain it's a chain of blocks in a way it's just a like centralized chain binance that is also a chain these are all chains excel sheets yeah i mean it's everything's a ledger right everything's a chain and um and like what some of these more open more permissionless more decentralized chains are doing is kind of like uniting the chains like bringing them together being sort of the like the uh the base settlement infrastructure to kind of draw them all in uh to themselves and so i think we're already living in a world of chains it's just like this whole multi-chain narrative has been recently because there's like you know conflict between alternative layer ones and there's conflict between like bitcoin and ethereum there's like a lot of tribalism in the space but if you zoom all the way out you already see a world full of chains on some spectrum of centralization or decentralization we're just doing more of this moving forward yeah i mean ultimately i think probably if you zoom out 50 years cardano wins but in the in the interim i can be partial to many many arguments but not that one that's the one thing you know i've written before that i'm a you know maximalist minimalist which essentially kind of means like i'm not you know maxi on any chain or even on any aspect i think there's different use cases uh that that need different things at different times and even different people need different things at different times but i think that we can all agree that uh you know that being bearish on cardano is what unites a lot of us can i ask you because it does unite a lot of us but not everyone okay not everyone can i ask you let me ask you a question somebody who's you know uh came into the space and i think there's some advantage to like looking at the space from fresh eyes and like anew because um you're kind of like the kid walking in the cafeteria right and there's all of these little like you know uh clicks like different groups you get the jocks and you got the you know the skaters or whatever else right and and everyone's like hey you know packy come to our tribe like join us like we're we're the you know the real deal and you get to sort of just choose you get to kind of look and maybe not pick any one tribe but i guess my point is crypto has been so tribal and you've been able to look at it with fresh eyes but you've also been able to like see what the obvious non-starter chains are like the obvious communities and ecosystems that aren't going anywhere can you tell us about that like what were some of the ecosystem like how did you figure out what was clearly like not going to work when you did this uh deep dive analysis as you walked into the school cafeteria sure so i i know that i'm going to get dunked on by the the cardano community i did for the yeah i don't know if they listen it's a norm on the podcast here yeah i don't think there's many that are good if so they're used to the abuse so the way that i looked at it when i was writing about ethereum was kind of thinking about trains that felt like they were directly trying to compete with ethereum uh which i kind of i think i put cardano in the camp at the time and then chains that were trying to do something else which is why i wrote that i was bullish on you know solana and flow because they were very clearly building for a particular use case and building in a way that was very different from how ethereum had and then as i dug in like you i haven't been at the cardona website for a little while but just like the the language that they use on the web like it just feels like a scam project and you know like the kind of language that you'd use if you're trying to trick a bunch of people um they've done i mean obviously like a very good job i think of making it like an us versus them mentality i fast i made the mistake of asking on twitter you know what l1 people were most bearish on and i said don't say cardano because we're all bearish on cardano or something like that and a lot of people kind of came back and we're like yeah of course you're a vc there's no way for a vc to make money on cardano ignoring the fact that you know one of the reasons charles is no longer at ethereum is because he you greedy you know short-term kind of greedy there all of that it's just a very weird like you know using tribalism as like the only thing as opposed to kind of any real activity on top of the blockchain if you use the same heuristic that i use for solana where there's a bunch of developer activity happening on solana that's not there on cardano i've not used a project ever that's been built on on cardano and so those are some of the kind of things that i look at it one thing we've said for a while and i'm wondering if you think this experience is true too is like the way to like cut through all of the bs is like go start using some apps stop looking at like listening to what youtubers say and people on twitter and like go actually use the stuff go there was one time check out an app there's one time i asked on twitter hey can somebody point me to like where i can swap tokens on cardano like where's the uniswap of cardano and somebody some cardano show in my in my replies sent me to a link that was a website that advertised being the unit swap on cardano wasn't live yet but the link took me to go to when i wanted to hit the enter app button the link took me to go buy a token on ethereum's uniswap and so i'm like and so like which leads to a question you talked about how like um you you got your the cardinal bros replies in your in your on your twitter feed about like oh like you know anti-vc narrative like vcs don't invest in cardano and we've seen this narrative weaponized many many times before this was definitely a very significant part of the culture of the wonderland project from the following of danny's danny sesta and ryan and i were the brunt of that uh when uh i didn't know who danny cessa was and then we all of a sudden were like vc bros or something like that it was crazy and and so again going to what ryan was saying about coming into this industry with fresh eyes uh talking about with some of the more legitimate chains when you see when you come into the lunchroom and you see like the solana click and you see the avalanche click and you see the ethereum click how would you describe the differences in those cultures if are there any differences that stand out they stand out to you there's no huge the differences that really stand out among the legitimate chains i mean i think that you know maybe solana feels like a little bit like like the blockchain behaves like it feels a little bit kind of faster pace and maybe a little bit more degeneral there's obviously plenty and plenty plenty of d-gen on both avalanche and ethereum um but i think that they all have or you know i've spent a lot more time in the solana and ethereum ecosystems the two of them i think have you know very kind of like positive uh kind of internal community um and and i think there's a big emphasis on actually using the products i mean like for me when i came in and started playing around in the space one of the first big aha moments for me was when i was working with the team at mirror to make one of the pieces that i wrote both uh you know ownable as an nft but then kind of automatically also distribute the proceeds to all the people that i uh that i cited in the piece and like doing that i was just like this is really magical and that was because you know people in the space when i said that i was kind of getting interested were like oh you should try to do this you should try to do this you should try to do this as opposed to buyer token buyer token buyer token and so i think getting that first kind of real hands-on experience playing with something and having it do something that i couldn't have done otherwise i think is you know the kind of value of both those ecosystems is pointing people that way ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable

we're uh we're checking the box on pakis you know travel so we started with ethereum and like looking at this whole web3 thing and exploring that now we looked at some alternative layer ones in particular solana now let's talk about this uh this other article that you wrote which is like a big theme of 2021 that i think you dove into head first and indeed all of us dove into headfirst which is nfts and he wrote this fantastic article called status monkeys and there's a little bit of theory in this article at first that maybe we want to start with about the status monkeys because who are the status monkeys all of us human beings are status monkeys right and i think you cited a status as a service article um from eugene way and uh i wasn't actually familiar with who he was we could describe what that is but i just want to read out the the two bullet points for eugene eugene way's thesis that you articulated uh which is number one people all of us are status seeking monkeys and number two people seek out the most efficient path to maximizing social capital and i think eugene wrote this in 2019 before nfts were like quote unquote a thing like a cultural thing but you say he sort of laid the foundation and kind of almost like in this article predicted the rise of nfts can you tell us about this what's this idea behind status as a service yeah so this quote that we have up on screen i'm gonna read uh from eugene way from the article which said social capital is in many ways a leading indicator of financial capital and so its nature bears greater scrutiny not only is it good investment or business practice but analyzing social capital dynamics can help to explain all sorts of online behavior that would otherwise seem irrational and like you know i have been a eugene white fan for a while he's written a bunch of you know really great essays particularly on kind of social media platforms he's done some great work on tick tock he has this essay status as a service which might be his most popular ever which essentially describes how new platforms new social platforms are able to kind of take off and it really is like kind of by creating a new proof of work that uh is a kind of appeals and is doable by a younger generation of people so if you missed out building a huge twitter following or you know people who are older and have been on the platform a while have big twitter followings because they were funny and they were good at writing 140 characters and like they got really good at that proof of work the next generation comes in and they lip sync and make videos and do all the things that they did on musically which became tick tock because like that's kind of the new proof of work that can help you gain status and for any platform that comes out to to take off and to kind of reach the kind of scale that a twitter or a tick tock or a facebook has you need kind of a new proof of work that's not the same as other proofs of work do you mean like like is it proof of status is that really what you're talking about it's i guess proof of status but it really is like this idea that you know you're good at this thing that the platform values right and so you're like you know what gives you status that bestows you status that that that then bestows you stacks proof of performance or proof of like yeah appealing to the algorithm yeah whatever whatever it may it may be um but that any any platform that comes in and tries to kind of steal that same mechanism from an existing platform is going to fail and so i think one of the really uh interesting things to me in rereading that article was that you know there's a lot of attempts and will continue to be a lot of attempts and i hope some of them work of building kind of decentralized versions of the existing kind of social media platforms by using almost the same product and almost kind of the same proof of algorithm or proof of performance or whatever we want to call it and i think that actually might be trickier than people think and that something new like nfts actually behaves maybe more like a web3 social network that's native to this new thing that you know either says i have money and so that's one way of status and in web 2 you can still bring in exogenous capital if you know when obama signed up for twitter if he hadn't been on their first he would get a million followers instantly but any random person like us would sign up it would take a while i think it's very very similar to nfps where you can either buy your way in because you have exogenous capital or you can be early to projects you can be deeply involved in the space you can participate in communities you can turn your board ape into a mutiny you can do all the things that you need to do to prove that you're a part of this community and so it almost feels like kind of the first social network on top of all the other social networks is this nft layer that's fascinating and the ability to like um i guess convert some of your social capital right into like actual monetary capital liquidity is kind of is kind of new and that's kind of interesting there's also packing this this um this graph that you put in where i think um way uh talks about uh like three elements three important elements here ingredients um to all of this which is like social capital is one kind of dimension also utility but also this third thing which is entertainment uh can you describe what is this graph showing us here the graph is showing the types of things so you're essentially looking at a quadrant with another axis uh another line kind of through through the middle social capital entertainment utility from low to high and that any new social network that is going to emerge and kind of reach scale needs to be high on social capital uh which you know gives people the opportunity to build up their social capital it needs to have utility so you know remember facebook like facebook was valuable in the beginning because it let you connect with people that you went to high school with or uh you know let you find that person that you met at the party the night before so there's some utility that kind of kicks everything uh off come to the utility state for the network and then there's this entertainment value of oh this is really fun so going back to the facebook example again there has to be something like scrolling through the news feed seeing what your friends did last night that is actually really fun or scrolling through you know tick tock is really really fun uh so it has to have kind of at different stages in its life uh a mix of high social capital uh gaining ability high entertainment and high utility and then you could put like nfts on the same graph on the same axi as access as well i think that you know so what what it shows is that right now nft is already kind of high social capital within the space i have high utility that is debatable and every project has utilities somewhere on its roadmap uh and then entertainment is kind of becoming uh you know is going up and you guys talked about uh the the board yacht club round and trying to build the metaverse so for example if your board ape actually gets you into a game world uh and you can play around and it's fun uh just even being part of the community is fun like there's all these entertaining pieces to it um but you know being able to show a board ape on your profile picture there's a reason people do it it's to show that they have status it's to show their social capital and then utility again debatable but at least we'll give you access to a community might give you access to future drops you know and then hopefully over time more utility will be built in into things and so nfps kind of fit perfectly into the eugene way definition of status as a service yeah that's really one of the aspects about nft is that i think a lot of people when they get confused about why are we spending like millions of dollars on board apes or why are we spending so much money money on nfts it's it's a lot of what you were just talking about uh like you know access uh entertainment vibes but also it's the resale ability which is also the utility and that is the novel thing about nfts it's like no you're not purchasing uh a five thousand dollar like monkey figurine that's going to sit in your in your house right you are buying an investment it's an asset that you are purchasing and you are like my wife right like you have and i mean when you get this wrong you like this is where you get wrecked right you buy the nft that goes down to zero just because no one everyone else forgot to buy it but like the thesis of nfts is that you can buy this as an investment and then it gets you one it gets you an infinite access to the the social capital and that is utility in of itself but you also if it's a good nft you have the assurances that your capital is also preserved uh and so like a lot of like nft naysayers are like why are people wasting so much money you're not wasting it you're just transforming it into something that has social capital and utility and entertainment a hundred percent i mean i think one of the starkest ways to look at that is the the visa buying a crypto punk example where they paid what was it 150 000 which is cheaper than they would have paid for any marketing campaign you know regardless and they have an asset that is now worth more so they essentially got paid to get all of that marketing exposure by buying uh by buying a crypto punk i think that's a stark way of kind of putting that that value that you get all this stuff for free or even you know that will pay you over time you use this uh term investment uh as status so is is that just the idea that like you're also in a lot of the the social networks in web 2 we are kind of um i guess active contributors but but passive investors right so i build up my twitter profile but i can't take it with me i can't take my follower list with me outside of that network um but with with nfts and with web threes it's really you are an investor in the status and status networks that you're creating as well is that the idea behind investment as status that this just all of this is much more portable i think that's that's part of it um it's also i think even beyond web 3 one of the things that i think we kind of all noticed over 2020 and 2021 is that investing became you know particularly for retail more than just you know like the the the discounted value of future cash flows it became about you know if your tesla shareholder became about being somebody who cares about the environment who likes memes who supports elon and also the fact that maybe tess will produce a ton of cars over time and make a lot of money or you know gamestop and amc are obviously the canonical examples of this where you know there's uh part of an investment that is a financial thing and there's part of an investment which is a status thing saying like i believe in this thing and i'm putting my money where my mouth is on that there's another article that you wrote  that you uh labeled the pareto frontier and i think that's where we want to go to next and i think the quote that i think uh from from a different bankless podcast that i want to bring up is uh from chris dixon when we did our mental models for web 3. something that stuck with me is he he said that nfts has made the internet weird again and that's kind of what that was the signal for him that like oh we're on to something now like the internet's weird once again like people are buying monkeys for millions of dollars and and and so i think we want to dive into the pareto frontier thinking about that as context uh and you you this is another graph to to explain to the listeners where we have money on the vertical axis and then fun on the the horizontal axis and i think that the gist here is you want to maximize both right and there's another quote that comes to mind is the future of the internet is making money online with your friends uh can you kind of just explain the the pareto fun-tier model for us for for us and listeners yeah so this is a terrible pun on the pareto frontier which is you know with a certain set of resources you can uh if you if you have two axes in this case money on one and fun on the other uh you can't just push all the way out and have like the maximum amount of fun and the maximum amount of money there's some frontier where you have to make trade-offs this would be familiar to anybody who's spent time looking at layer one blockchains for example but there's a trade offset that you have to make where either you can have kind of more money and less fun like you know an investment banking job for example would fit into that category or you can have more fun but less money so you know negative money maybe even by like paying money to go to a concert for example the interesting thing about crypto in this context to me is that by baking money into a lot of different things and by baking fun into financial things like you know nfts are a super fun investment relative to a bond you can push out the pareto frontier and so you have this set of opportunities that is more kind of money or more you know financially good potentially if prices are going up more financially good than any other thing that is that much fun and you have things that are more fun than any other thing that can make you that much money and it's a really powerful thing to be able to kind of push that whole thing out for people i want to put this under the context of dowse because they're the a line that i've given out a lot is uh all daos are are really a vibe and if your dao doesn't have a vibe in it you're not going to incentivize people to come into the dow to to work for the dow so your dow has to have a vibe if it doesn't have the vibe is the campfire right the stronger the vibe the warmer the campfire the more people you can support around around uh around the vibe so can you put this into the context of dowse for us like how do daos kind of illustrate this this uh fun tier if you will assume that there is you know a doubt for almost anything that you'd want to do right you could go work for a dao to buy an nba team right so this is something that probably you'd want to do anyway if given the opportunity if you're a basketball fan to like work on a group of friends who can buy an nba franchise when you put it in the context of a doubt you can join this thing you can get the tokens and as you succeed by doing this fun thing which is buying an nba franchise with grouse house you also have the potential to make money for your work and you also have the potential to make money as the token appreciates and so you know crosstalk is maybe a extreme example because it is financial um but there's all sorts of dowels where you come in it's probably something that you do anyway people are in group chats with their friends all of the time but by having fun and by participating and by doing something as a group you also have the potential to to make money from that which is not what you normally have when you are just sticking around with your friends in a group chat yeah this is so cool this is such a this is one of my favorite models that um yeah that that i've seen i'm not boring actually like i just love this because it it describes my experience in crypto like perfectly and i think a lot of people's experience just just to make the the pareto frontier even more concrete right so you're saying you just optimize for for two things in a simple model the things that you do in life are like either money or fun right and then you give an example of let's say you're using a one to ten scale for for money and fun okay so let's say i wanted to read a sci-fi book and i do a lot of that so that might be a seven on fun but it might be like a two on money i'm not really making money doing that so it's very low on the money scale but it's very high on the fun scale right it's something i do as a hobby let's say whereas if you talk about reading a finance textbook okay well i need to understand how uh income statements work let's say like i need to brush up on my you know financial statement skills well that's probably a six on money you know it's probably a pretty useful tool to have in your like business mental model tool set but man that's dry okay that's gonna be like a two on fun um and we when we get into talking about like dows versus corporations right people working at soulless corporations spending all their time in a cubicle going into an office every day doing work they don't love for a mission they don't really care about um an investment banker type role where people you know spend their their lives competing against other ivy leaguers to like get the the small set of jobs that's gonna be a nine on money okay you're gonna do okay on the money scale as an investment banker but how fun is that that may be a one or two and this is the beautiful thing about crypto the beautiful thing about crypto and i think why all of us are here on this podcast probably why people are listening is it like moves the numbers up completely so like where my old stuff was maybe like my old corporate job was like a three on the fun but like a seven on the money i work in crypto because it's a nine on the fun scale and a nine on the money right like and that's what you can do as part of a doubt and it kind of makes you ask the question of like wow if if if crypto can move up the pareto frontier for everyone more fun more money making money online with your friends as david said earlier how are these traditional institutions going to compete i will never work for a company again i will never go into an office i don't want to go into again like never again why because it doesn't maximize my pareto frontier that's the model right the the fund here is i think permanently shifted and so anything that people are going to do in the future has to at least compete with that that doesn't mean that everybody's going to do web three things always and that ever all the jobs are going to be crypto jobs but it does mean that you know maybe you want to go work in deep tech or you want to go cure cancer because like that is a 10 on you know you can substitute kind of fun and fulfillment for the same thing and yeah it's like that that like really you know awesome like and if you don't make any money that's also totally fine because like it is so meaningful on one of those scales but are you gonna go build a product that is like a me too version of something that already exists that maybe has a slightly different pricing like probably not gonna do that one anymore and so hopefully what it does is that uh it pushes out you know just that opportunity set for everybody when this is something that's that's on the table now i think it also speaks to the fact that you know one of the critiques of crypto is that like you know money's baked in and there's speculation and it's one of the beautiful things about this is that the things that you would normally want to do and have fun doing whether that's playing a game or joining a down with your friends or all that can actually be your living and make you money like that is really cool and so i think speculation and and money being part of this is like a really great thing one of the uh things i wrote in an article a while ago and actually before i get to that part there was a friday open thread that we did forever ago and the question was how much of a pay cut would you take to get into crypto and so many people would answer like significant percentages of pay cuts like somewhere between like 10 and 30 like they are just dying to get into crypto and probably a lot of those properties are probably because the fund meter goes off the charts and so people are just dying to get into web 3. the thing is when you actually end up getting a job in web 3 people end up tending to make more money because web3 can pay for it more because it's an industry about wealth and money and so while people are saying like i'm willing to get like a 30 pay cut so i can have more fun in my job but they are simultaneously also getting a pay raise by coming into this industry and so something i wrote in an article titled the future of work is not only do the legacy institutions of the world have to compete with the permissionless labor monetization tools offered by ethereum but they also have to compete with a lifestyle that these tools offer the freedom to work for oneself and so this is why ryan and always ryan and i are always saying like go work for a dow go become bankless get on the frontier because the the freedom that is on the frontier is almost infinite could not agree agree more what are some uh other examples of this uh so like um we talked about dallas a little bit but like tokens in and of themselves are examples like so dows are way more fun and potentially more money making higher in the pareto frontier than corporations but i also feel the same about stock like uh tokens versus stocks like i kind of like why buy stocks when we have tokens i mean they're way more fun they're like you know community driven we have this whole narrative and the other piece of this is also gaming i know uh you've been exploring axia infiniti this year too this whole play to earn gaming movement it's kind of the same sort of idea well i can play a game and have fun and also earn equity in the network so can you talk about some of these examples you're seeing of of the uh pareto frontier actually being applied yeah so i think the promise of of player and gaming obviously acts the infinity but there's you know i think partially inspired by that and partially just inspired by the power of this model there's a ton of other player and games coming out where as you play you're earning native tokens in the game which gives you to your point the stake in the network itself and so you're playing a game and building wealth by doing it i do think that that does bring up an interesting point too though which is like it doesn't happen by default and so actually in the beginning you know like actually infinity you know said themselves when i talk to them for the piece that i wrote that you know they need to make the game more fun over time and so in the beginning you really optimize for the financial piece and so you go higher on the money scale because you know that it's lower on the fun scale and ideally over time you can make it so much fun that it's wow really cool that i'm making a little bit of money for also doing this thing that i like doing uh but that you need to kind of like play with those levers in in the short term so it is not that this automatically happens but you need to be aware that if you're not going to be fun there better be money involved and if there's not going to be money involved it better be really fun that's a good point i want to take this conversation actually outside of the crypto industry for a second because there's something to compare it to with the the the rest of the world the rest of the labor market something that we saw during covet is a lot of people got laid off from their jobs they they got their stemi checks they got their unemployment money uh and then getting these people back to work post covid was really really difficult and it still remains difficult to this day and all of a sudden uh labor has had an uh tailwind to it because people are just less willing to do the things that they were doing previously people are just fed up with their their trad job of just like going and working for for low wages and i'm wondering if you could kind of just like comment on like how crypto is doing the expanding the pareto frontier while the rest of society is more and more just fed up with their traditional trad job of just like grinding through for for low wages this can get i think super philosophical like there's this kurt vonnegut book yes yeah this kurt vonnegut book player piano um where it's this world in the future where things have been automated he wrote this in the 50s but this world of the future where everything's been kind of like automated by these big machines it can do all of the jobs and so the government hires people if you're not working on kind of building the machine or like being a manager at the place where the machine lives to hire people to like dig holes in the road and then fill those holes back in and then dig holes in the road and fill those holes back in and the point on it is that you know over time like fewer and fewer and fewer jobs will be mission critical so like human survival uh and so we're gonna need to figure out things that give people the things that work to do like a sense of meaning and like an income um so that people don't just go crazy and dig holes and fill them back in and dig holes and fill them back in over time and so i think one of the interesting things is like you know when people are saying people say that you're just kind of like trading tokens against other tokens or flipping jpegs or all these things like it gives people i think a sense of meaning and a sense of fun and i think over the next 100 years if you zoom out jobs generally are going to become more fun because we won't need as many people or as as big a percentage of the population doing things to keep humanity alive as more things get automated as technology gets better okay so we've talked about all of the the virtues of web three and um you know people listening to bank lists are probably pretty bullish on web3 uh as we are of course the three of us but not everyone is in love with web3 all right and there's some criticism and i think like there's some valid criticism of 3 in its its kind of current state today and then there's a lot of like irrational invalid criticism that um certain politicians are are putting forward or certain narrative drivers people with with large followings are putting forward for whatever reason maybe they're just like anti uh web 3 maybe maybe they didn't buy tokens who knows why they're upset about this thing but can we talk about this web 3 debate and you wrote a post on this entitled the web 3 debate and i think it was maybe kicked off in part by a tweet that went pretty viral from jack dorsey who is he's a bitcoiner a heavy bitcoiner but does not embrace web3 at all he said this you don't own web 3 this is in december of last year the web the vcs and their lps their limited partners do it will never escape their incentives it's ultimately a centralized entity with a different label know what you're getting into and of course this caused a flurry of discussions someone by the name of professor g who is kind of a writer in the space summarized a whole bunch of criticisms against web 3. i'm wondering if you could um talk about that for for for a minute with us so first what are the criticisms that you generally hear about web 3 that people like jack dorsey and people like professor g are uh putting forward right now yeah so i think the the big point that jack was trying to make is that web3 claims to be decentralized and that everybody owns you know the users own the projects and everybody wins in web3 when really what's happening is that a bunch of vcs invested in the projects they get tokens cheap and then the token gets issued they had warrants the token guest gets issued they make a lot of money and they exert a huge amount of control over these networks and so almost like the way that people got mad at kind of like all of the different female lead companies that get taken down by a business insider for like having this mission that people you know rally behind and then maybe like not everything lives up to the mission his point is like we're rallying behind decentralization and distributed ownership and all of these things but like you know the same couple of funds own big stakes in a bunch of the biggest projects i am you know it's a before not a full kind of decentralization maxi uh i mean there's there's certainly you know if projects are misleading uh their users and make it seem like you know there's not any vc money in that there's not any groups that own more than x percent but there actually are i think that's a bad thing but i don't the thing that that gets me i think about the bc ownership one and i wrote about this again when i wrote about flow a little bit is like dapper labs dies 50 times if if union square and andreessen and a couple of other funds don't keep kind of stepping up to the plate to kind of get them from cryptokitties to developing their blockchain to nba top shot and then finally they they took off and two years after the first token warrant was issued you know uh they they did a public sale at the same price that the investors two years earlier had gotten their token warrants and so even though union square and andreas and own you know percentages of flow it is so totally different than a twitter or a block you know jack dorsey's company's ownership structures would have been where it would have been just vcs for a very very long time and then a public offering which is sold to institutions and then sold to retail afterwards so i think one of the ways that uh jack and even you know kind of professor galloway this nyu marketing professor turned like just kind of bear on everything technology one of the things that they're using i think is just this trick of misdirection kind of making the debate about is web3 fully 100 you know fair launch decentralized versus is it better and more decentralized than the things that we have right now and it loses just so many shades of nuance in in the middle yeah i totally agree with that take and it's like one one thing is like i've been an uber user for for a long time right and uh i never got my uh uber airdrop right i did get my uniswap airdrop though and so and so did uh 120 000 other ethereum addresses right for you it's like it's better than the status quo obviously and i think one of the the points that you make in in the rebuttal section is you said this debate is not about whether web3 on internet owned by the users and builders orchestrated with tokens is net good or not bad for humanity uh not just as it stands today in its early its forms but in the promise it holds in the promise it holds for the future and we see glimmers of it i i feel like what you're saying is uh many of the critics the kind of the common thread a lot of the criticisms of web 3 is like this this impurity standard that these they seem to hold crypto to rather than just why not compare it to the status quo no one is saying crypto is perfect right now we're not saying it's maximally decentralized we're not saying we are actively saying man there's so much work we have to do to improve the user experience to onboard more people to make it more decentralized to scale this thing out while preserving strong property rights and like we're working on it but like they seem to many of the critics try to compare us to this like pure state as if we're saying yeah crypto's the best thing i was like totally perfect we have no more improvements to make now come hop in our system i think that's what you're saying here right that's exactly what i'm saying and the fact to your point that it's you know they're comparing this kind of like midway through kind of the the progress in the building to you know where it should be at some point in the future i think most of the people in the space would agree with what you just said and would agree that there's a ton more work and that we're not even close to the the end state of where this goes but like anything we're building and like in the beginning it's messy and it's actually harder to build this way and so it's going to be messier for longer i also love the time frames that people use are like well you know it's been 13 years since the white paper and so if this was ever gonna happen it's you know the first internet you know like if you're comparing bitcoin to the internet like that's that's like arpanet you know like it took 40 years before there were like kind of real use cases after after that and people really like you know using the internet at scale after that i think a more reasonable time frame is even just looking back to kind of you know the ethereum white paper and so it's been less than a decade that people have been building apps on on in a decentralized way it's it's also that that time frame is also hilarious to me because like literally we went from an industry worth zero dollars in terms of market assigned value which is the ultimate like long-term truth-teller of what's valuable as long as the market we went from zero dollars to over two trillion dollars in 13 years and you're saying that's nothing no big deal like where else where are the real use cases yeah it's crazy to me one thing that confuses me about jack dorsey's perspective is that he seems to judge ethereum and web 3 on its current state but he applies such a future premium to the current to the future state of bitcoin and that that discrepancy just confuses me so much it's like wait wait wait why do you have so much promise for the future of bitcoin but you don't see any promise for the like you're judging ethereum on its current state and this mentality is rampant around so many just crypto critics yeah i joked on i joked on twitter that the reason jack ended up leaving twitter is because his engineers wouldn't build blue sky their decentralized version of twitter on top of bitcoin and so you had to go to square where at least you could just buy a bunch of bitcoin and use that in the product it is funny that after he left they started rolling out like nft features and things like yeah and i i guarantee you i have no inside knowledge here i guarantee you there are meetings where he was trying to get pms and engineers to build nfps and whatever else on bitcoin and they're like you can't you can't do that that's not how this thing works so i yeah i don't i i think everybody the thing that gets me about that and about uh you know professor galloway kind of generally and just kind of the bearers in the cynics generally is that everybody has their incentives but by being the cynic you look like the kind of smart reasonable person although you're just pumping your own bags in whatever way scott galloway gets mad at things and gets eyeballs jack gets people to buy bitcoin which he's a huge believer in and holder of and and which you know square is a big believer and holder of and it has this part of its its product but you know you look smart for being cynical even though financially it's like way it would have been way way way worse over the past decade if the worst financial advice you could have given somebody over the past decade is to sit out of technology and to sit out of crypto but i i don't know that's my that's kind of my my soapbox is that what what got me and i i don't like doing ad hominem stuff but what got me to write a whole article on on one person's article that they wrote on their their bearish take on web3 is that there are hundreds of thousands of people out there who see this guy as an nyu marketing professor and somebody that they should trust who's out there using a soapbox using misdirection to convince them of his perspective and they just take it as gospel and so now you have hundreds of thousands of people who might have been interested in web 3 who aren't going to be now and are going to miss out on kind of all the great things that we've talked about throughout this this episode full disclosure bankless has a bias too we want you to go bankless pacquiao i want to actually uh once again zoom out and kind of view this conversation from a bird's eye a bird's-eye view there's a lot of other things to consider in this world as well so you know it's 2022 we've got a multi-chain multi-layer two world everyone is building their own corner of the metaverse society is definitely moving to be far more digital than we ever thought that we would be probably at this point in time uh meanwhile there's like war in eastern europe like countries entire nations are becoming more distrustful with each other uh and people are becoming kind of fed up with the current status quo there's distrust in institutions uh and and so we have these two things in the background we have crypto in the background we got war in the background uh there's got inflation going how do you think let's just i just want to zoom out and just like wrap this all up like how do you kind of expect the rest of the 2020s decade to more or less unfold as it relates to crypto as it relates to web3 but also as it relates to the demands that the physical world is is pushing upon society how do you kind of just like interpret all of these things yeah eth to 50 000 at least you know it would be what is like the end of decade price target but i mean the thing that i've been i've been playing around with and haven't really written about but it's just this idea of kind of like the things that are going to matter over the next decade are almost these barbells like the coolest possible things that you can do in the digital world and then the coolest possible things that you can do in the physical world like you know there's been a big emphasis you know by founders fund and lux and a few other funds over the past couple of years in defense tech and space tech and like all this really hard cool tech that is now kind of coming in vogue as there's you know been a war as spacex is bringing launch costs down so i think there's gonna be all this really interesting stuff happening on in in the world of atoms and then obviously all the things that we've talked about kind of happening uh in the world of bits and giving people ownership and then over time and it's probably starting to happen you know climate is probably the area where this is starting to happen the most where digital and physical are starting to merge and you're aligning incentives using crypto that will hopefully help save the planet i think over time these two worlds of kind of bits and atoms are going to come together like we could colonize the moon by the end of the decade right and you're gonna need to have new kind of economic and governance models each asteroid represents a possibility for someone to go set up their own government government so the fact that we're able to play with all of these economic and governance models in crypto and then apply them to you know space colonization and you know i i just think that that is so unbelievably cool and so when people in hard tech you know make fun of crypto or when people in crypto think that like that's the only thing in the world i get asked all the time why i'm not just a web three investor at this point like i think the really interesting stuff is going to happen at the intersection of those worlds i can't i for one cannot wait for the first uh initial asteroid offerings uh to come out as you know tokenized asteroids um that'll be a fun future um this has been uh such a cool conversation and it's really great to like i i feel like when uh i'm reading your post as i said in the outset this is like all about you part of your journey part of kind of your research journey i'm curious where do you think your journey is going to take you next and also like how how does writing itself sort of inform how you invest and how you how you process how you think about the world i think somebody when we said we were having  on the show said you should ask  how he became such a legendary writer can you just talk a little bit about your writing process sure i mean i i really do think that you identified you know to the extent that it resonates with people i think it is because i'm kind of very much learning at the same time i think i'm in this like goldilocks zone of intelligence where i'm like dumb enough to not understand things well enough just by like you know seeing them and and you know not having to like really think through and do a ton of research and like you know smart enough to actually be able to understand it if i put in a lot of work and so like just being in that middle spot and just like banging my head against the wall reading as much as i can asking people like you questions and like just trying to understand it myself and then just kind of like figuring out the way to translate what i've just learned into something that people might be able to understand uh has been i think hopefully the secret sauce of not boring it really helps my my kind of thinking and my investing process because they're you know most of the pieces that i write i go into it with a blank page without an outline and just kind of like work my way through the idea so by the time i hit the end i have theses that i then go you know one i'm putting out a bat signal that i'm interested in these types of areas whenever i write about something so i'll see more companies like that and i'm also a lot more prepared because i've talked to the smartest people that i possibly can and read the best things that i possibly can and so you know by the end of a piece i feel at least like reasonably competent in understanding like what might be at play in a particular space and what's important and what's not important uh and what resonates with people and what doesn't resonate with people so it's it's all kind of like mixed in together for me the writing and the investing and the conversations and so i feel very lucky that this is what i get to do that's really cool i do think one of the most valuable things you can do as an investor in the space is of course use these protocols for yourself but also just write about them create content about them this is how you learn this is how you educate out yourself by educating others think out loud exactly um thanks so much
