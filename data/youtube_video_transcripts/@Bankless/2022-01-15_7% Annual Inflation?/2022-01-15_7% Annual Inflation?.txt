stuff that you pay for in your everyday life has just gone up seven percent over the past year it's the highest inflation has been since 1982. i think the fed had a moment in the last few weeks where they realized that like yo it's not going to take like a marginal increase in interest rates like it's going to take an aggressive increase in interest rates to combat inflation and so that's i think why the markets are down this week people are freaking out because they see the fed freaking out about how high the inflation is and so they are projecting high interest rates in order to combat that inflation and they have to do this without breaking the economy which is the tight walk that the fed has to uh has to walk and it's pretty tricky but like for for the average person i mean you look at seven percent and this just looks broken i mean did you get a seven percent raise this year oh if not then you actually lost money
