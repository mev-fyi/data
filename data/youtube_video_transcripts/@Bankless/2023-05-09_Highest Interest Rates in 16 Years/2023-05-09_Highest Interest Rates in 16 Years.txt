fed just raised interest rates by 0.25 5.25 that's a 16-year all-time high the reason Powell is raising rates is because he's trying to fight inflation I kind of feel like Powell is choosing maybe the worst of Both Worlds like so we're gonna end up with high inflation anyway and also bank failures we gotta raise rates because inflation's still up right and then when the bank failures occur the FED is more Surgical and then they are catching distressed banks on the way down so it's not a impact they're just cradling the bank failure into the ground and it's working so far
