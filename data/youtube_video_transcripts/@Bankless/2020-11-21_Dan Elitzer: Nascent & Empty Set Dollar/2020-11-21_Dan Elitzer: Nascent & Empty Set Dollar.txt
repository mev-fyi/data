deals in the end run and so i have a lot of respect for him i pay i pay attention to what he pays attention to and so i'm super stoked to get him on the bankless show to meet the nation dan welcome to the nation thanks for having me david it's always fun it's always fun it's always a good time yeah so so dan uh we were going to do a recording so you could help me understand empty set dollar and that's absolutely what we're going to do today but today of all days is the day that you have debuted nascent uh maybe we should start there what is nascent yeah thanks david so uh nascent is a newly launched uh crypto investment entity we focus on early stage venture but also many other strategies within crypto and we focus largely on any crypto related businesses open finance defy however you want to define it um my my specialty my preference is working with teams at the very earliest stage but we have the advantage of using all uh internal kind of permanent capital and so we're able to take both a very long-term view on the industry and on the opportunities while also remaining incredibly nimble in terms of how we operate to be able to best capture those opportunities as they rise right so d5 summer 2020 was a crazy time and that seems to be a time where venture capital seemed to kind of be sitting forced to sit on their hands because with organizations there's bureaucracy there's rules there's there's things that have to happen and by the time that you know you schedule a meeting to discuss a strategy perhaps things have moved on uh it sounds like nascent is trying to uh be able to respond to an ever-changing rapidly changing environment in your guys structure is that is that kind of the ethos that you guys are trying to build that's right and and i would say that you know this is the second fund that i've been part of creating so ido co-lab ventures when we were getting that off the ground the conversation at the time when we were starting to think about this late 2017 early 2018 um was really around do we do a hedge fund structure or close-ended venture structure and the different advantages uh but people were really just thinking about like well are we just buying like kind of equity or shafts at the time or are we going to be able to touch more liquid assets essentially like you know buying and selling uh liquid assets and since then things have changed so much right the idea of participation in these networks as a liquidity provider as a yield farmer as a keeper you know playing all these different roles it just evolves constantly and so uh if you have to deal with raising money from lps who have certain expectations about having a very specific strategy they're signing up for and that they're going to be in for a number of years and all the different kind of regulatory requirements and uh the things that go with meeting terms of your agreement with your limited partners with your investors it's just really hard to be responsive and so i think you know ideal club ventures is is one of the best uh venture funds in the space really excited about what they've done so far what they're going to be continuing to do um and i know they're also making some plans to add more flexibility uh into future funds that they may do but nascent is really just built from the ground up to always have this flexibility uh always have the ability to be nimble but also take a long-term view um and really to align incentives right um so there's there's often these games that you know you're incentivized to play whether you want to or not when you have external capital right you're you're thinking about like how do i show these markups and show that the the portfolio value is you know going up into the right as quickly as possible um and and we don't really have to care about that right because they even let you raise the next month whenever for us we're not raising a next fund and so we're we don't care about marking up investments we care ultimately we want to you know be able to have exits but we're able to take a long-term view on that we know how we view these things internally and so it's not about what somebody externally might want to mark them to for different purposes um we're trying to grow our own capital um in in the best way possible over the long term so what about uh the market that has emerged in 2020 the market as we know um as we know it how has that guided the design choices behind the fund or like the the ethos behind the fund i'm assuming a lot of what came out of defy summer 2020 has really impacted how you want to operate in with nascent uh can can you illustrate that story for us yeah well i'll i'll say you know it certainly has affected how we've looked at kind of immediately some of the activities that we want to be participating in but when we started talking about this you know even kind of before a lot of the craziness happened um there was already this sense that we needed to have maximum flexibility and so we needed to structure with that in mind um that said doing recently um has been related to yield farming type activities um and i think there's there's different types of yield farming and i think we're starting to see how that's evolved where it goes from less very short term dump a whole bunch of tokens out there crank the liquidity early and then like what happens after that two teams being more thoughtful and maybe making stuff that doesn't seem as attractive to pure short-term profit motivated um farmers and really to try to get the right community around it the right long-term investors with kind of lock-ups or vesting as you would do with the traditional venture round but really applied to folks who are investing their capital directly into the protocol as well um so you know we've we've structured to be able to do both things very fluidly uh the venture i want to emphasize that really is at the core right you see some some firms that have done some very impressive you know trades and have started getting into investing as well you know three arrows uh cms some folks like that alameda um but you know they're they're primarily traders and they they kind of layer on venture we really want to emphasize um our our core right um you know sid remastered on our team also an operator early on with dharma and growth there work with dydx values some others we want to help build stuff early and so the trading is is more in service of what we're doing on the venture side rather than the other way around um and so you know i think that's one of the things that we hope will differentiate us is that we're going to get in there in the weeds help you build and our other activities help inform what we're able to bring to the table there plus you know we've got some folks like you know for example notional uh does fixed rate lending and we participate in some of their kind of beta liquidity mining program that that they're doing where they don't want to like blow this out to everybody and say hey look we're gonna we're gonna support you no matter what like this is part of our value add is that we're gonna do this we get additional tokens as reward great that'll ramp up the amount of capital we can justify putting into this but uh it's just you know kind of table stakes in terms of how we like to participate with our portfolio companies so when a project comes across your desk you know so you can review it what are the characteristics that you that specifically nascent is really looking for what are the projects that would resonate with the ethos at nascent that might not be uh fitting for other firms in the space or other venture funds in the space like what are you guys really looking for when you are sifting through the projects to deploy capital at yeah well i don't want to you know necessarily that that there's things that we're looking for that that other venture funds aren't because i think most of them tend to look for stuff um that's at least in the same ballpark right uh you know kind of getting to uh you know the other topic we initially set this up to talk about was empty set dollar you know that's a project with a pseudonymous founder um that didn't raise any capital and just kind of launched it out into the world um and we were able to go and participate and end up building a mistake relatively early on um but you know that's something that i think a lot of funds would say like oh well there's no investment opportunity here it's like how we're going to wait and see and like you know when it gets larger and more liquid we can invest in it as we would in in bitcoin or eth or something um but we saw now like this is this is a very promising project we like um how it's being built we like how it's designed uh we see the opportunity to get involved um early and to you know help influence the culture and the governance discussions very early on because it did launch uh really decentralized pure on-chain governance from day one and so that was very uh intriguing to us and you need to be comfortable getting in and really getting in the weeds with these projects and participating in governance uh it's part of diligence it's part of helping them succeed that kind of goes beyond what you can often do with a more traditional company structure uh where you know they've got very you know even hierarchies even exist in in startups but when you really do have an open thing that anybody globally can participate in from day one if you want to help uh nudge it towards success then you really have to pay a lot closer attention because it's not just going to be the founding team that is in there it's it's really anybody on the internet can hop in the discord server and start you know spouting their ideas and their opinions or or even you know pushing proposals live on jane right maybe that is kind of the answer that i was looking for with like because nascent and and projects that came out of d5 summer defy summer 2020 are very atypical right where like you have to become comfortable with like nebulous leadership in a nebulous organization and it seems to be nascent is uh looking to be included in that nebulous organization right a part of the community that builds these things out yeah and that's one of the things that we've talked a lot about and to be honest we haven't figured out exactly how to do it yet but we want the the boundaries of our organization to be a little bit more fluid right as they tend to be in crypto right that there's not just you're on the team or you're not right community members can have various degrees of involvement and and participation and we want to sort of mirror that with our own structure our own organization over time uh but you know we also don't want to start doing everything all at once we need to uh start walking first and and build up to a good run absolutely so so let's get into empty set dollar because i want to know what it is so what is it yeah great question so empty set dollar is i would say an algorithmic stable coin so folks who may have been around and kind of 2017-2018 era may have recalled a project called basis uh that was using a a senior shares model this idea of being able to mint dollars uh the digital dollars that will stay closely pegged to the dollar but like the dollar itself doesn't have anything really backing it right uh but it uses this kind of algorithmic um methodology to hopefully stabilize that price um over time and basis never launched uh they had a lot of i think regulatory concerns even though they raised over 100 million dollars they never actually made it into market um and they had to give like i think 72 percent back i think i think more than that i think they they just gave like basically all of it back but interestingly they were they were they they weren't using that and and you know kudos to that team from what i understand like they weren't going out and like having like lavish parties and things like that and paying themselves huge salaries like the intention for most of that capital was to provide a backstop so it wasn't like a fractional reserve thing where your your basis uh coins were gonna be backed by those dollars it was saying like hey you know if the price goes down below certain level we'll step in and help backstop it try to push it back up um and and i do think that that concept has a lot of value to it and so one of the topics in the empty set dollar discord and the community there has been is there a way that in a decentralized manner without raising money from investors can we somehow build that over time and i think that's that's a really cool discussion um i wasn't even the founder who who suggested that i was one of the community members um who who came up with that proposal and they've been a number of different ideas of ways to do that that have been getting kicked around um it's something that started uh was like like about three months ago i think that this project launched um and it was all you know open source from day one on github um you know front end hosts ipfs and honestly really wonky ui it's not not super accessible um and the the the founding team they never really tried to like hype this right they actually reached out to um builders and people in the community who they've seen engage in really constructive ways other projects and basically was like hey we're doing this cool thing you should check it out um and then a number of these people did and were able to um you know basically there's a there's an advanced function that kind of moves the protocol forward that you can call every eight hours and it just kind of whoever gets there first um but early folks came in with the right ethos and they said look i'll i'll advance it once um and get a piece that then compounds over time but that they they weren't trying to like grab all of it um and so you know there is a bit of a top heavy distribution it's it's flattened out um a bit over time it will continue to do so as more distribution happens you're talking about the actual stable coin the actual stable coin yeah so the interesting thing one of the big differences here for empty set dollar versus the kind of bases and senior insurance model is that was a two token system where there was like a stable coin and like a share token and when there were more of the stable coin needed to be printed to kind of push the price back down it was the shareholders who would receive it first um in empty set dollar there's just a single single coin that's meant to be the stable coin and if you want to receive a share of inflation in the case where more needs to be printed you bond it in the dow or you stake it in uh kind of you know swap lp shares esd usdc lp shares you stake that and there's currently kind of inflation is currently split 80 20 between the dow and the kind of staked lps okay so this sounds this starts to get to where we're pretty familiar with from from defy summer um uh when you said algorithmic stable coin my mind went to ample fourth where it would rebase according to a rule it sounds like that's not what's happening well it it inflates and and uh potentially sort of deflates according to a rule but it's not like you you had you know 10 esd in your wallet right and then something happens suddenly you've got 20 esd or you've got 5 esd it doesn't do that rebase thing if you if you bond when more gets issued you get more issued kind of to you in the doubt it's kind of like if you're holding a compound c token right right you know it's now worth more or you kind of have even pull out you end up having more when you pull out um but with uh with esd the nice thing is it's a standard erc20 and so unlike ample fourth and all these rebasing things like you know yeah and other things like that it plays nice with other d5 protocols right you don't have to worry about um doing some special considerations to allow it to be added into lending pools or you know lp pools where it breaks things because of the rebase this can be in there you're not gonna rewards uh if you're just you know in some random pool or lending protocol but you know at least it's not gonna break things okay so let's go let's go through the the mechanism of when uh a is it called an empty set dollar one yeah so one one esd is used okay so let's let's say that esd is trading at above a dollar a dollar and two cents how does this system equilibrate yeah and and to be very clear uh a lot of the parameters of the system are it's very early and so they're in flocks you know governance is looking to tweak them um so currently if uh it's it's looking at the price based on an eight hour t-wap time weighted average price drawn from this to swap liquidity pool and so it's pretty robust right it's not like these these flashlight attacks where they're looking at the curve price in the block right this is over an eight hour period so yeah manipulating it would be incredibly incredibly expensive trying to do that so if if the t-wop says it's a dollar and two cents like that's that's pretty reasonable um and at that point we would see there's currently i think a max of uh three percent um expansion or contraction for a given period and so this would be issu equal to a two percent expansion of the total supply um 80 of that would be split equally among all the esd that's bonded in the dow and 20 would be split equally among all the lp shares that are also um staked or bonded okay so the the the units is trading at a dollar and two cents on unit swappers which is where we get the price oracle from uh then people that are providing liquidity to that same unit swap market are rewarded with uh extra two percent of um average of the they're gonna get 20 20 percent of that two percent expansion so what's next two percent right what we've typically seen happen is um you know the on a a kind of total value locked basis i think lp shares typically received about half the reward of what the bonded ones have is kind of where people have tended to equilibrate okay that makes sense and so are those extra units that are minted it's injected into the uniswap pool directly no and no and that's what makes it safe is that i mean look it's all d5 nothing's safe safe right but like hey yes but it's but it's it's it's safer than a rebase in terms of the the problems that potentially create it's put into this kind of essentially reward pool for your accounts and to be able to claim that you need to then unbond your lp shares okay so first just being in the in the liquidity pool doesn't earn you rewards you need to take those lp shares and stake them as people have gotten kind of familiar with doing but then it goes into this kind of reward bucket okay and you need to unbond and you can immediately rebond your your shares but unbonding them kind of moves them to this claimable phase now there's currently essentially a five epic five period mock-up so five of these eight hour periods before um you know you can actually then withdraw from claimable and take it out um if you if you want to if you're not during that five hour window uh and you have rewarded esd you can actually provide that straight into more lp shares by pairing it with an equivalent amount of usdc based on the current price right and just pushing that in and so that's a mechanism to encourage people to take those rewards and add them back in as as additional liquidity it's going to take a little bit longer to kind of get them out and kind of restrict your movements a little bit more if you're trying to just straight pull them out sure so the the way that the unit stabilizes at a dollar results from people pressing the sell button right yes and yes we are just if the if the empty set dollar is constantly above one dollar people that are pressing that cell button just continually get more ammunition to hit that sell button until the mechanism until the unit falls back down to a dollar right right right okay so that's just the idea let's do it in reverse so let's say it's doing it's trading at 98 cents how do we encourage people to i'm assuming hit a buy button yes yes and and what i want to make clear is you know this is a very very early stage product and so while the hope is to be pretty tightly in that range i would say like a die like tight range around the dollar where it's not maybe exactly a dollar but it's pretty close um the project has spent significant periods of those three months not in that tight range it's gone meaningfully above it's gone meaningfully below and so before so yeah yeah but i mean like looking right now the the current uh spot price is uh 88 cents the the current t-wop is 84 cents okay um and and so you know we we do we do see that it's it's not super tight right now and it's right spiked up above i mean i think it was about like two or three dollars at some point very briefly and then and then crashed way below uh this on this cycle this looks like our we're now in our third contractionary period that esd has gone through um and uh you know it has been a little more gradual but we do have this this uh kind of lock up that didn't exist in previous cycles and so maybe uh further drop is gonna come you don't know i guess by the time people watch this they'll know um what how it played out but um yeah so when it goes below uh what happens if you start issuing debt the protocol starts kind of having debt and what you can do as a user is you can buy that debt in the form of coupons and there's a formula that basically says like the more debt there is the greater discount you get on the coupons and uh these these coupons there's been some debates you know should they really be called coupons should be called bonds they'd be called um these kind of uh you know exotic instruments um you can buy basically burn esd to get 1.1 1.2 1.3 esd worth of coupons right okay capping up to i think it's like a 50 um you know discount that you can you can eventually get um however uh that comes with significant risk and the risk is within a 30-day period uh if the price doesn't go back up over a dollar and stay over a dollar sufficiently long to create enough inflation to redeem all those coupons it's currently first come first served on the coupon redemption and so if you're at the back end of that or not enough happens or if it never gets gets over then that expires worthless and so the the nice thing there um in my perspective is it it has this kind of risk reward um piece to it where people can decide do i want to try to get more esd take a bonus by taking this risk and ideally if you're doing that they're also then buying esd off the market to do that if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earned system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wire will go and figure out which money market on defy in devi is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing buying esd off the market to do that because esd is trading you know currently it's trading at you know 88 cents and so you could buy esd for 88 cents and then get whatever the current um premium is by burning that to get coupons uh and therefore you're both pushing the price back closer to a dollar and making it more likely you'll be able to redeem right uh uh if existing if existing esd holders though don't buy net new esd off the market and they just all they want to do is capture that premium that's a very risky play because they're assuming somebody else is going to choose to actually buy esd and push the price back up if that doesn't happen it's just going to expire and so ultimately i you know there's talk about evolving towards a v2 scott lewis and will price put forth a proposal for what a v2 might look like and there's been a lot of discussion around it um and it involves actually kind of more or less doing away with the coupon system replacing with something that looks a lot more like zero coupon bonds uh and um yeah so you know maybe it will evolve that direction but uh if coupons expire that's the way to contract and contract the supply but with the bond system that won't really happen it'll it'll kind of push it out but i think it's it is interesting it's another another way to to handle this and what's nice is versus something like ample both the current methodology and the methodologist being suggested by scott and will uh if you just believe in esd and want to use it as a stable coin and don't want to like take on risk uh of of expiry then the number of units in your wallet isn't just going to change right you know the price may fluctuate the number of units is not going to change and so i think psychologically that's really helpful um and ultimately if this is going to succeed as an uncollateralized or potentially under collateralized if this kind of backstop gets in place stablecoin is going to work in the future uh that that's great right you need people to actually use this as money if they don't then we're all just playing stupid games um and i think it's fine for people will be playing games and um you know testing the boundaries of these mechanisms early on uh you know i think we're currently at around 131 million tokens is the supply um and so you know if it were perfectly pegged to a dollar would be a 131 million dollar market cap currently right and you know not insignificant that's pretty insignificant right that's that's pretty big it's grown fast i've been concerned about how fast it's grown because again you know the early folks who've been in there have not been focused on like shilling it um they've been really focused on the governance and trying to build this up and grow it slowly and so i'm really uh uh optimistic that the ethos of the community is is being built and continued in such a way where everyone's saying look we understand that there is massive potential for this if it can get to you know multi-billion dollar mark cap and be holding the peg right nobody wants to pump up to hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars just to watch it crash the whole point is can we have something that is uh exceptionally 10x or more more capital efficient than something like maker and still holds a very tight peg because if you do that just unlocks so much in define you don't have um also risk right i think there's a lot of hardcore people in the ethereum community uh who are were big fans of maker um and but vehemently disagreed with their decision to add some of these kind of centralized essentially issued assets right um and and also have such a large percentage of the deposits of the system be that as well exactly exactly and and so you know that's where the maker community has decided to go and that's fine but there are certainly people i think are looking for something else um and if you get to a much much more capital efficient something else then then great great and um uh haseeb from dragonfly capital wrote a piece a couple years ago that really helped me wrap my head around the different stablecoin models and he talked about how there's this kind of like fiat collateralized there's cryptocollaterals which needs to overcome over collateralized right and then there's this uncollateralized uh version the algorithmic stable which we haven't really seen a viable attempt at that um before right people just theorize that this is a design possibility yeah i mean there was like bit shares and stuff like way back in the day but it was like on some random chain nobody used like there wasn't like this defy ecosystem or anything around it wasn't big shares over collateralized uh precursor to the maker model they they they may have been yeah but yeah uh so i could be like but mine shows like there were some attempts you know at least theorized towards this direction we're now at a stage though where defy has reached this kind of ecosystem scale where i think we can actually attempt some things like this and it very well will fail right like like i don't want anyone to listen to this conversation be like oh my god this is the next make or something like and be like i need no no like this will probably not be the next maker this will probably never achieve the scale that maker does i think there is a possibility that it goes far beyond that but there's so much that's unknown at this point there are so many technical dependencies economic dependencies community it depends like we just don't know um but the the quality of the conversations happening and the way that the system has performed through the first two um cycles that it's gone through make me really intrigued and and spending more time with it and and um so you know it's it's you know we're excited to be invested in this um as a firm and and to be you know actively participating uh in the discussions that are happening and to hopefully uh you know see this become the success that it has the potential to be but it is far from certain let's hammer on the over collateralization versus first you know uh capital efficient dynamic because when i go and i buy one die off the dollar off the market versus an empty set dollar like that doesn't cost me any other capital other than the dollar to buy the the unit right um but so the the capital intensivity comes in the production of the unit uh right so maker dow requires if we're talking about ether it requires 50 over collateralization and that's just the bare minimum right so like the system at large i think is over collateralized by like 300 plus percent so it takes three dollars worth of value to produce a dollar worth of dye uh can you explain the the difference in dynamics between that and what is that empty set dollar and how that um is theorized to uh be be different at maturity yeah so so um if you think about um in a case where die is over the peg right as as we've seen you know on a relatively persistent basis it's been really hard to bring it back down to the peg all right because you need people to block up at least as much value if not more um and and be selling it and do it and there's not a great way to arbitrage it right like for usdc and usdt and things like that um while they are very centralized it's really easy for professional traders to arm them right if they have an account with somebody with one of these firms that can kind of mint and redeem the the arb is super fast and super efficient uh with maker it's really hard right we've seen uh even in the maker forums in in recent days um you know osiris unesco used to be on the the risk team um uh arguing with a bunch of the community members about uh what what the appropriate approach should be to bringing it down um and it's just it's really hard right the mechanism for maker makes it really hard to respond because it's hard to arb uh because the capital intensivity with empty set dollar uh if it's above the peg there is no net new capital that needs to come into the system uh in order to bring it down right more will be issued and the current holders can have the same number of units sell the additional units and uh you know assuming through the ammo wherever there's gonna be some buyers whatever but it's gonna push the price down but there's no uh really a large amount of new capital that needs to come into the system in order to cause it to fall back down to the to the peg um and you know to grow the supply right right even even usdc one new usdc in circulation is one us dollar that was deposited into a bank account somewhere with esd it doesn't right it doesn't necessarily mean that right you could there's more just issued by the protocol itself expanding uh to meet demand for more so that's always one of what i thought the elegant side of maker dow is versus something like compound or ave where like there's no limit to how much dye you can mint like yes there's the the ceiling the debt ceiling but we can also just raise that right so it's really there it's the maker dow system is able to produce unlimited amounts of dye for any person that wants to do that but somebody has to want to do that right like there needs to be that much capital to do that if you have if you have the desire you can have the ability but that's constrained by capital with empty set dollar this the protocol similarly has no constraints on how many units it can produce right right that producing a unit costs nothing it costs gas and so there is there is zero capital intensivity with pushing the price down but i'm guessing there is some amount of capital intensity with pushing the price up is that correct yeah yeah and i think that's one of the things is is you know right now because it's early it started from zero literally and and now to a supply of 131 million right there there has to be new people actually demanding to buy it right because if they don't then it's not going to keep the peg to the dollar at all or pegged to anything right um and and the idea is that hopefully it's able to grow without the new issuance being matched one to one for a dollar um but pushing it back up yeah it requires um more capital to come in i think it really depends on the float right how much um is actually um out there like on the market um looking to be sold versus looking to be bought um and so uh yeah you could potentially push it back up with with relatively little amount of capital um if the demand is is relatively close to where the market cap is if it's not then it goes down you need a lot more capital to to push it back up right um and so yeah and so i think you know that's that's really the the thing that i think is is the hard thing to figure out right as you as you stated it's pretty easy to understand the prices above you print more that helps bring the price down right right and it's it's on the contraction side where it's below the peg how do you get it back up that it's very challenging and in my view a lot of it comes down to faith and belief right the the one of the reasons the dollar works is because people believe in the dollar um right and that's that's money generally is based around belief and so uh people need to have mechanisms that that work and the thing is about these mechanisms the more people believe they work right the more likely they are to work and we can't just like be delusional and just be like yes we can mean we believe that we believe we're gonna be more we believe that these mechanisms will work and there's no basis in reality so i think this is one of those things that you know you know i think you know certainly in the bitcoin community and increasing the ethereum community people about like lindy effect right right um it's like the longer that's been around and longer survived the longer it's likely to i think this has some of those characteristics it's nowhere near the level of of bitcoin or ethereum right now but i think it is should it ever have that type of longevity in a functional uh mode then it should start to develop that and people will start to have the same way they do with maker right one of the things that is that helps die keep the peg is the belief that die will keep the pain the mechanisms will work um you know backed by the and the collateral gives a very good reason to believe that so the threshold for belief is much higher with something like empty set dollar because you don't see a pile of collateral sitting there that you reasonably believe is you know backing this right so it's harder to get there but if you can it's much more efficient yeah and we've seen this belief mechanism play out at the largest of scales i was reading a money by jacob goldstein who's the uh host of the npr planet money podcast and he's telling a story of how i can't remember what crisis it was it was the euro crisis and it was something there was something about the euro and the the person the who's behind the central bank went out and gave a speech and said like you know we're going to fix it was basically a speech about how we're going to fix the peg except it was in different terms and the essential the central banker is like we are going to do whatever it takes and that broadcasted across the europe and as a result of that broadcast the financial crisis at the time stopped because people believed his words that they were going to do whatever it took to print enough euros to satisfy the demand and so then that's what stopped the crisis right it's the belief the belief right front front run the front rand the market one thing i want to want to ask about is the the ease at printing the units is seems to be dangerous because yes it's easy to print units you can print yourself into a hole where like all of a sudden we've printed ourselves into a bit oh yeah really in units oh there's not going to be enough capital to backstop it if the faith crashes have you thought about 100 sounds like oh yeah i i've been very concerned about that some of the the other community members give me a hard time because they think i've been overly concerned about that um you know in the there they're actually is this what this is our yeah i guess this is our our the third cycle that esd will will be going through but um you know the first cycle was when the community was very very very small like you know probably less than 100 people involved um the the next cycle though um uh was timed initially the expansion was happening where it was capped at 10 per epic and the epics were every eight hours so you were you know a position where we were we were we were inflating yeah it was like it was like 30 30 a day right type of situation right like that's insane right right that's making big commitments right and writing checks you might not be cash exactly it's like it's growing well it's growing from a very very small base but still that's an insane rate of growth and people and then i was like you know what um some other people are also all there but i think i was playing the one time the table of hearts was like guys let's cap it like max three percent right that's still like nine percent a day potential and uh uh some people were convinced because that that like 98 of voters of votes like went went saying yes let's lower it to three percent but it was right as that like passed but then the price like went and crashed below a dollar and they were like oh you see i told you so is because um this this doesn't work because people needed higher returns and my my thinking is like no it it's because we were inflating way faster than the demand was growing right this may have been like uh it could be anyway interesting kind of like like point where everyone kind of um it was like a kind of keynesian beauty contest around this where people were looking at like oh i guess this is going to be the point we all agree is like where it's going to come back down but still it was just it was too fast i think even even one percent every eight hours would be way too fast half a percent is probably too much and so there needs to be some further discussion in the community to figure out local how do we do the right regulation so that it can grow and because you know i talked about this um with with some other members of of the community and um you know one of them i talked to a lot he's very worried i don't want to don't call him but but he's uh more worried about price deviating from a dollar i'm more worried about the supply massively over overextending um and and we both see each other's point right like if it's supposed to be a stable coin if if there's massive demand starts trading for like two dollars or three dollars like right that doesn't look good at the same time like i don't want us to like inflate up and see like that there's like you know a billion esd in circulation and there's like 20 million dollars of actual demand for it right that that would be equally unhealthy uh but you can't control both right because it's a it's a permissionless system people who want it will buy it people want to sell it will sell it right um and you can only control one of the two right um and and so and especially when g5 especially when d5 moves so fast like the demand that you are experiencing one day could be gone the next day and especially with a system that isn't collateralized that's really important because that means a lot of the security of the system is held in the social layer exactly right there's so much that's in the social layer here and and um but i think what part of the the i don't know if this is a formal design goal but it's certainly been talked about a lot in the community is basically how how governance heavy should this be and i think the the consensus that i see is that it should generally the attempt should be to be relatively minimal governance in the long term it's early there's a lot that we don't know doesn't work government seems to be pretty active but long term the goal should be to say like okay here's more or less the rules if if things are seem like they're breaking maybe they need to be a governor's action to tweak them but ideally it should be kind of a self-regulating system um very much inspired by uh you know reflex or labs with with rye and what they're doing i think is very cool um they've got essentially a little bit more freedom in their design space because they're not trying to stay pegged to a dollar specifically right it's kind of like a low volatility reflexer bond yeah so that's that's super cool a lot of love love what they're doing over there this is harder because it is trying to stay pegged to the dollar but the goal is to kind of figure out the right control theory and control mechanisms that it can try to stabilize around that level with minimum manual intervention because as we know and as you know i think people in the crypto community are very very familiar with like when you try to twiddle the with the knobs it's really easy to do a lot more damage um than than you know you tend to do good you end up doing damage and so i think the right now there's like no avoiding it like twiddling is needed if the system were allowed to run as is uh i without any governance action by anybody like it seems pretty low likelihood that this would succeed so you know stoke holders will vote and they will make changes uh but long term um in my view and what i've seen from many others is that hopefully that becomes minimized so one final question to tie this off is how do token holders vote is that one empty set dollar is one vote is that how this works uh more or less uh the way the way it works is you have to actually have that empty set dollar bonded in the down and right now also there there's essentially a 15 period uh lock up uh on on bonding and unbonding and so that that means like you're you're stuck in there for you know minimum five days um or longer uh so you know you kind of have to be relatively committed to the system really you might like run for this right away right that doesn't work well um and so i think that's healthy right you want uh people voting making decisions who are are going to be in it for it's hard to say five days is this long haul but but you want people who are are committed more than block by block right uh if they're going to be participating in the vote and they are they compensated for their votes uh no they're compensated in the form of um you know if you want this to work yeah then you better better participate uh so yeah i'm sure i'm sure there's some people like free writing there and not participating but um you know i think we we have seen a lot of governance action the the quorum i think someone just put up will price things put a proposal to lower the the quorum and proposal threshold because they've been very high relative to their protocols i think one percent pretty typical for making a proposal uh but there hasn't been like that delegation ability that we see in the the compound alpha governor that everyone's adopted uh but it was like a 33 percent voting quorum which is insanely high right like compound was like four percent right right and we're luckily able to clear that um i don't think anything's failed by not being able to clear that but i think especially as uh ownership continues to be dispersed among more and more hands it's me harder and harder to hit that and i think that poses a real risk to the protocol so i'm glad that that proposal has been made and and hopefully uh in my view that it will pass um but yeah you know right right now if you want this to work you gotta gotta put in the legwork and and uh help make sure that the community and the protocol are on the best standing possible well with people like you dan behind the project as well as will price and scott scott lewis that is a pretty rock star team so i am definitely going to be paying attention it should be to be clear this is not not like our community members right yeah um yeah and and not to not to i mean i meant to those folks because i know them they put together this this recent proposal uh but but i wouldn't even say they're necessarily the most active members of the community there's there's a lot of really strong contributors in there on both uh kind of technical and governance level um and and so you know the the the level of discourse has been incredibly high compared to any other uh forum i've been a part of well a vibrant community builds vibrant projects so i'm i'm optimistic about the future so dan do you know where people could go to if they wanted to learn more or maybe participate in governance and discussion yeah uh the if you go to i think the the website the ipfs is hosted at uh like empty set dot finance um i think at the bottom there's there's a link to the discord there's also um uh analytics site esd.tools um and that's also got links to twitter discord uh telegram there's also a governance forum which i think is uh empty set uh dot xyz something like that notes some people can find but you know there's this good conversation so i encourage people to to jump in and look like you know please please please please don't just like a band um like right or like if you think you're making just just don't like um like like like do the work because right because yeah right exactly right there but there's there is relatively high complexity to participating in the system um you know relative to even some like a lot of other d5 projects and so it is something where if people want to participate i encourage them to to really do their diligence yeah um and decide if they think this makes sense i said a lot of very new very unproven things um and and so um very very high risk environment and what about uh nascent uh where can people find out more about nascent or perhaps even reach out to you guys yeah so uh nascent.xyz is our website um you can follow us at nascentxyz on twitter i'm on twitter at dlitzer and you know you can find us there shoot us dm email at hello at nascent.xyz we'd love to to talk to teams and builders who are doing awesome stuff in the space awesome thanks dan for coming and showcasing both nascent and ready set dollar to the nation i appreciate it thanks david appreciate it
