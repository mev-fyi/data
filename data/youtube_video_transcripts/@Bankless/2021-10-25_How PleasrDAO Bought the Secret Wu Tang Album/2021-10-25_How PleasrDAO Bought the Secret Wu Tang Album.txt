a dao takes the mysterious unreleased famous wu-tang album from the cold hands of a hedge fund villain and is now making it accessible for the rest of the world the story here is there is a there's a famous mysterious wu-tang album of which there is only one of if there's one cd and it got sold i think for it got auctioned off for two million dollars as kind of like a middleman towards the the or excuse me a middle finger towards the middlemen of the music industry this was before blockchain this was before crypto so what are we talking about uh i can't remember like 96 something like that uh i don't know um so yeah they they auctioned off their only their one of one album that they produced the the wu-tang produced an album uh yeah that was it yeah and this guy martin shkreli who's this hedge fund manager who you got everyone might remember for going to jail in 2017 for securities fraud and he was just the guy he's the guy that jacked up the price of an epipen from like 16 cents to 750 likes he's literally this hedge fund insurance guy like villain super villain hated by the internet and he has all these douchebag videos of him uh listening to the wu-tang album and he's like i'm gonna destroy this just because i can and then he also says um uh some reporter asked him hey are you ever gonna let anyone else listen to the wu-tang album and the guy with like this anger in his face goes absolutely not no way yeah the guy's just really mean election he's just being a cartoon villain he's just being literally that's great he's a cartoon villain and he's also in jail now for securities fraud he'll be in jail for 2024 and because he had to pay off his debts uh for this fine that he got for securities fraud he had to auction off the wu-tang album and so pleaser dao bought it pleaser dao bought the wu-tang album and so there's there's james right there who's uh the chief pleasing officer over at pleaser dow taking a photo of the one of one famous wu-tang album that has never been released to the public and jameis i know and pleaser dao has a ton of plans as to what to do with this uh here here's a picture of them and a bunch of other pleaser dial members as well dude this story is such an amazing story uh so congratulations to to jameis congratulations to pleaser dao uh of which i'm a member um here's your take as well what's the juxtaposition here yeah so so this this story got onto the front page of the rolling stone uh and rich who uh used to work at maker dow an old friend of mine said this might be the first time i've ever read a trad media crypto story that wasn't dripping in sarcasm or ending with a smug and alarmist hot take this is a significant shift talking about the tone of the rolling stone article and so i followed i guess it's like because crypto are the heroes because the crypto people are watching that right this dude's hand so here's my take on this i said the juxtaposition of a dow of homies buying a rare cultural artifact from the hands of a scumbag hedge fund manager is exactly the kind of positive pr that crypto needs oh more of that energy please yeah that's cool this is how it started how it's going right so here's the story of pleaser dao where layton from pool together tweets out anyone want to create a quick dow to bid on this this being people pleasers una swap v3 x times y equals k uniswap uh animation uh and so leighton just tweeted this out a bunch of people said yes i do uh they all hopped into a dow they pooled their funds there's a great story we ran it on bank list forever ago about it uh and that started off pleaser dow which it was a doubt that was created to buy people pleasers art and then pleaser dao went from just a dao of people that wanted to buy that one thing into a dao with people that wanted to buy like all the cultural artifacts so edward snowden nfts are in there the doge nft is in there we had jameis on a state of the nation to talk about this now the physical asset the wu tang one of one mysterious album is now property of pleaser dao and i know that there are plans in the pleaser dao uh world to actually open this up so let me actually read out uh something that james said in the uh in the rolling stones uh article peaser p pleaser dao has grand but loosely articulated the ambitions to make the album more available to the public perhaps through listening parties or gallery style exhibit exhibitions or even to expand ownership of the album to fans although how that would work would remain up in the air we believe that we can do something incredible with this piece said jameis to enable it to be shared and ideally owned in part by fans and anyone in the world again think of the juxtaposition behind the hedford manor who's like i'm going to destroy this so no one can listen to it because i can because i my brand is being announced because i'm rich because i'm rich and then this dow buys it and we're like hey we're gonna allow everyone to listen to this thing like it's perfect it's such a perfect story i hope it's good after all we don't even know but uh i guess we get to find out that's really cool man very cool here's a five minute video about jameis going and discovering the wu-tang album and listening to it here we go [Music] right here [Music] touch the camera [Music] [Music] this is like the og nft right the original fight
