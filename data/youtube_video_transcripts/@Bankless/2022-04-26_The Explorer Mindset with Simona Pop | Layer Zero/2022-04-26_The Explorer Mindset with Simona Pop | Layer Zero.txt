i'm a little bit of a child of the revolution and i know what it's like to not have freedoms of expression travel all of that and i think it's very very important and very ingrained clearly in me to be able to enable that for other people welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and always has been today on layer zero i'm speaking with simona popp and we recorded this episode in the middle of devconnect uh and so there is a big conference room a co-working space where a lot of people are heads down building whatever it is that they're building so there's a little bit of background chatter but hopefully that adds to the vibe rather than detract from it we talk a lot about governance and simona is a child of the romanian freedom revolution from the the eastern bloc from from russia's dominance with with communism and so she was very very young when uh the revolution in romania happened and broke and broke romania free from communism and we use this as a metaphor to discuss thou governance of all things she talks about how yes you can cut off the head of top-down totalitarian communism but you have to also replace that with something else or else the same sort of structure just grows back in its place and so we we take this idea of if we are going to kill something we need to replace it with something new otherwise the same patterns will will unfold once again which is what happened in romania post uh post-communist russia and so we talk about the different structures of dow governance we use this metaphor for a flowing river of liquid governance of liquid representation and allowing this river to adapt as rivers do to its surrounding environment and if dow governance needs to change and adapt over time it also needs to act like a flowing river and so there's plenty of metaphors with with rivers and adaption in there and overall simona is just a beloved part of the ethereum community she's working extremely hard figuring out dow governance which is the problem of problems in this space right now so let's go ahead and get right into this conversation with simona pop right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible ave is

savannah what's up everything's damn fine why is it damn fine because we're in amsterdam we are in amsterdam for def connect yeah have you been to amsterdam before i have and it was raining and it was the city was beautiful but in the sunshine it's a totally different experience the consensus that i've gotten about amsterdam is that everyone loves it yes everyone just has the the best words to describe amsterdam it's beautiful it's all the flowers are in bloom it's tulip season and we are here as a connoisseur of plants i will have to say the plants of amsterdam are top-notch right on point yes and the street flowers what is the thing that's like a whole different level of street flower yeah i have walked hours yeah i've only been here for two days i don't know when you got here but i've been only here for two days and i have walked for like four or five hours total agreed yeah and it's like why would you take a means of transport like canals flowers trees in bloom do you know how amsterdam was chosen uh devconnect do you know who who made this i don't actually well they made a good choice they absolutely did and the weather they like arranged that to a tea so pleased i've asked you this question before but not in a long form podcast capacity so we're going to go into this a little bit more but why real life why is real life important we love this industry is on the internet like we don't need to meet in real life why can't we just go meet on discord or zoom why can't we meet in the metaverse because we're people and energy is important and being able to spend time with friends because at this stage a lot of us are friends let's face it we've known each other for what five years um it's a long time and it's actually a really really um nice kind of group of friends and if you think about it it's a really really good dynamic that we have together and the new people coming in and the ogs it's just really really important to just catch up now and again and obviously the hugging now the hugging is back on the menu it's like it's great i have been warning people that i am a hugger so they're not surprised but it's also like no one is surprised because like the last time i've seen most of these people with months ago yeah and so just the enthusiasm of seeing people here in real life is is just lovely plus like we get to lock all the youth developers in a room and force them into having a merge date so that's what's going on right now amazing very true um at an undisclosed location yes a very secret location of only the privileged parties can get to um yeah but yeah look and again everything does happen online and we can obviously reach a lot more people online but it is important to create all of these little moments that we can touch base we can interact with each other face to face and then go back to being online right and i think having those catch-up moments is important certainly yeah the uh dev connect it's called devconnect for a reason we are here to sync our nodes yes uh because even though i think obviously the crypto industry is probably the most adept at working online like we can get we can be the most productive versus any other industry online but like still in real life like there's always these these tailwind benefits of being in real life that will never be replaced yeah and think about the fact that most i mean i don't know about you but a lot a lot of the relationships that i have and a lot of the friendships and a lot of the collaborations that i've worked on started at certain events 2018 2019 and so on when we were first kind of doing these things and establishing the schedule of events so yeah it's important so what uh class are you a part of like what is your what's like cycle of of the crypto industry did you come in are you class of 2017 earlier end of 2017 2017. okay when i actually started genuinely working on a project because that's when i met mike well end of 2017 beginning of 2018 and that's where um i became the co-founder of the standard bounties protocol and bounties networks yes that works right so what what brought you in like bounty's network is very very uh bitcoin ethos aligned which is kind of where you found yourself right close to kevin milwaukee very much like uh finding ways to push development to the to the margins like what about crypto brought you in so i think for me was always this ability to level out the playing field and allow more people a seat at the table in fact rebuild the table with a lot more seats right and that's one of the main things that attracted me to bounties and actually because bitcoin was built on top of the standard bounties protocol and so we were very much value aligned but in terms of the core interest for me and that's what continues to be my core interest is how can we enable access to resource for everybody regardless of geography regardless of social status regardless of education regardless of language regardless of all of that and everything that i tend to do is to push that forward and to try to create more pathways in for a lot more people what were you doing before crypto did it kind of align with all that stuff or or what was your mode of operating before crypto it was very much in comms and experiential and always in tech but you know the web too sure yeah yeah so kind of getting out trying to get the the listeners grounded for who simona pop is um what what did you know before crypto that you brought to crypto like what what information have you blessed the crypto industry with um i think for me it's it's interesting because being originally from romanian having experienced albeit a very small part of i was very young when the revolution happened um in 89 but you still have that sense of what it is like to live in a country where censorship complete lack of privacy and restrictions is the norm and so i think i see this sometimes where i'm a little bit of a child of the revolution and i know what it's like to not have freedoms of expression travel all of that and i think it's very very important and very ingrained clearly in me to be able to enable that for other people and so with that knowledge and also the fact that knowing that i'm also aware of a lot of i guess the importance of white balance matters when you are trying to completely redesign the flow of things because you want to make sure that if you're going to redesign it you're going to not redesign it in the same image as what came before learn from what came before but try to redesign it in a mindful and balanced way so that we don't end up in the same place or even a worse place so this is going to reveal my little knowledge of that era of time in eastern europe but uh uh i i think this is what we should definitely dive into uh the revolution let's go let's go into that how old were you when when six six okay so you didn't know much else other than that like yeah but also when you're a kid you kind of don't really realize the magnitude of what's going on and we're talking about uh is this communism in russia is this relevant here yes so basically every history lesson they call it the eastern bloc because everything that was around russia and below was under russia's influence right you had the ussr at the time so anything eastern europe was like communist controlled by had the same mode as operandi as the ussr and the idea was that it would be made in its image and so what you had was the prague spring that kick-started revolutions in all of these countries in the eastern bloc and it almost went like a domino effect and so all of them then removed communism from their um governments and went on to hopefully rebuild and redesign so that it is uh you know in a democratic way now what that also kind of showed me and made me understand is that sometimes a revolution doesn't really do much right you cut off the head but the body stays the same so then you just replace the head but everything else particularly when you're talking about a bureaucracy will just be exactly the same which is why when i talk about crypto it's it shouldn't be a revolution it should be an evolution it takes longer but it changes the whole organism versus just the head yes i think there's a very common pattern throughout history is that like revolutions are really good at breaking things right but not necessarily putting them back that in a way that answers to the problems of why the revolution decided to happen in the first place right right all it does is says well this isn't working let's end it and kind of fails to follow through it just creates the vacuum of power it creates a vacuum of power and i think also let's remember that a lot of the revolutions that have happened in the world are really orchestrated by completely other interests outside of that country so you also have that okay so uh the revolution started when you were six so it it was all of a week oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah it went like this yeah okay um very fast yeah okay so it was more the process of recreation that probably because i don't know when people start remembering their first memories but about six is about right right so that's when it started building let's say towards a democracy again right democracy right right so your formative years were all about just looking at and being under the paradigm of how are we going to re-architect governance yes yeah kind of in hindsight yeah and so like uh again like history lesson how would you rate that re-architection if you had to rate it on a scale of one to ten minus one uh-oh why oh what what what should we learn from this again it's it's very very important to um understand that things that have been almost cemented in a certain way take a lot longer to break through like if you think of plants uh growing through the pavement right that's gonna have to push and like really work to get through it when it's so solid right and because like i mentioned earlier usually the body of the beast remains the same and so you have to work with a lot of things that were already in place and then try to slowly remove those and replace them with better with better with better and so what you get a lot is and i think that's still valid for the whole of the former eastern bloc you have a lot of corruption you have a lot of people who are in power who then you know decided that they could maintain power but this time it would be financial and so you have that switch um yeah using the plant metaphor if you have a like a tree for example like a in the middle of a storm it blows over but it doesn't die and then it'll start to regrow in a different direction but it'll always be scarred by the storm it'll never be the perfect emblematic vertical beautiful tree it will be the kinked tree and it will never get away it'll never get away from that kink right like it'll always have this in its base like dna right not the dna the epigenetics right how the dna is expressed and so if you're telling me that like the romanian government did uh or the romania did a good job of taking the head off but forgot to like replace the culture right the culture was the same which is why the layer zero is always so important indeed it is and also taking again from that tree metaphor of breaking i think what looking at what three and what we're doing now with governance we need to look more at a willow model where it bends and it like it's a lot more flexible versus again just um very rigid right right because as soon as you start potentially being very rigid about things you could miss or could be let's say a little bit more fragile when something happens and you can't adapt yeah that rigidity aspect is really really important um we'll go down to that in a second one one thing i learned while uh kind of going down the ukraine versus russia rabbit hole is that this same thing has already happened this happened in the 1800s it happened in the 1900s and now it's happening again and like the what my take away from that was that there's this like russian like putin is very uh like focused on like this like kind of this manifest destiny of russia right like this russian sort of just like ethnic imperialism or something like putin is like this embodiment of this weird like russian energy that wants to like dominate eastern europe right i mean yeah yeah and and this the the story of the russian empire in the 1800s whatever it was called back then coming in to dominate ukraine and then ukraine like um just not wanting that and revolting against that that this story has already played out once before and so that you when you know that that was like three generations ago there's something in the dna of eastern europe that like makes this story happen again and again and again and again how do but how do we get people to be aware of these things because it's isn't it education that is how we get through this it is education and it's also a you know a level of respect for what has come before not necessarily in a must be revered must be you know glorified in any way but it must be understood because if you like you're saying you notice patterns and what that enables you to do is when you notice those same patterns repeating again you can bend adjust flex away from it you don't end the pattern you redirect the pattern right or you work with it and you kind of go okay what is what is it that we could do to essentially go on a different path versus just repeating this one right and that's a big thing that i think sometimes in web 3 we kind of go yeah everything's trash let's just rebuild everything everything's new again new pair new paradigm which is great because that's you know we're enthusiastic and we want to do these things and it's wonderful but are there lessons for us to learn in that process so that we don't just again follow that same pattern go down the same stuff and then at the end of it go did it again right there's the uh the wheel is something that i think chris berniski talked about where like you know in the future we're going to be the boomers and like our kids are going to be like you know you guys got to you know you guys bought bitcoin before it had a market price right right you guys got ether at the ico what did you do you got ether before they were you remember when you got into ethereum before it was proof of stake like you boomer parents like work is hard now like things things are now like saturated and difficult and just like the same complaints that millennials are having about the current institution so um when you see these governance structures because governance is all of the rage in web 3d it is governance governance governance when airdrop when token when governance token how how do you see us falling into the same traps if we if you do see us doing that i think one of the main things and certainly this is very much something that i'm interested in from kind of a a multitude of different perspectives i'm obviously um uh one of the top delegates in bitcoin in ens and i also um work together with bitcoin on what i like to call governance engagement because right now governance and engagement are like this there's a lot of rubber stamping there is a lot of there's high high lack of context for different conversations happening and decisions being made that is because things are not transparent things aren't necessarily easy to grasp context for and also most people are so insanely busy that to dig through notions discords and all of this to gain context to inform a vote that may actually influence quite a few things is quite taxing right so like a snapchat vote comes into existence and like the many many voters of this snapchat vote like all right like yes or no right and there's like there is perhaps hours and hours of like debate and deliberation and arguments as to even what are the parameters of this vote to begin with or there should be or there should be or at least with the people that put this thing to a vote right right okay these four people are talking about this governance decision and they're they are the experts in like the yes and the no cases but they need to give it to the community because that's what decentralized governance is but then the community is like they spent 30 seconds reading the snapshot and they don't know the extent of the details and they don't know the impact and that's a problem because if i want to have context to be able to make an informed decision that's incredibly important and you would do that in you know in any other area of your life you would want to know what you are making a decision about and so with regards to and coming back to your original question how could we perhaps make those same mistakes is that again we go in this direction where voting remains binary there is no respect for nuance there is no respect for let's say the in in-between the maybe the ambiguity because a lot of things that we're dealing with right now it's okay for them to be ambiguous for a while until we figure out how they can be clearer and simpler and easier to make a yes no decision on and so with that in mind i think being comfortable with ambiguity and being comfortable with nuance and a spectrum of decision making and a spectrum of uh discussion versus just no it has to be this or the other is important to not only think about but also weave into the processes that we're putting in place like i love a standard obviously um but i think that's important especially when you navigate various different dials like for me even in these major two that i am one of the main delegate in it's hard because they're structured differently right and they have a different flow for the governance right not majorly different but different importantly right and so i think for for us to be able to really have the context and be able to make the right decisions it's important to have a flow that is uniform is not the right word something that enables that access again in a very right right um so there's the there's one way to tackle this problem which is like just making governance easier yes like being able to make the nuance more digestible the debate more digestible but the other solution is just like let's just centralize it let's just say like centralize the governance yeah but we don't want that but but why is that bad because like yeah we call these things dows but they're like most of them they're not autonomous they're definitely not autonomous and they're definitely not decentralized i really call them digital organizations now the cool unlock is the actual decentralized part yes but we don't have that yet so like why why can't we just like have the centralized governance while we figure this out because i think you want to and look we are in a very difficult situation right now just as an ecosystem because we're so embedded in the current world whilst trying to build a new one and so you're almost constantly enmeshed in the current way of doing things whilst trying to envisage what the new stuff will be so it's hard it's a continuous exercise and you almost have to do that daily practice that daily exercise to maintain whatever it is that you want to build right that muscle mass sure maybe or those habits to build those new pathways and those two habits i think the important piece is to have the right either groups or structures dealing with different stages of the flow and that's the thing that can unlock that decentralization where you put things you know imagine a river right because where in amsterdam imagine all of these bridges and all of those bugs at each one you have a different checkpoint almost and then the whole thing becomes clearer and it evolves and it involves conversations it involves dialogue it involves certain amounts of decisions but not a yes no right and you evolve it that way but to create that flow you have to look at okay who is going to be involved what is the end goal how long can this take what is the process will it be different for certain types of proposals when will it be different for others when you have something to do with a budget with a treasury does that go on a different path versus one that has to do with i don't know removal of stewards from right and you have to map all of that out and i always always use this analogy because i think it's so important when you go to an amusement park you see the map of everything that is there and you know where you're going and you know how to get there and you know if that is where you want to get to or you want to go here in fact or there or stop halfway through there right and we don't really have that right now and that should be something that is almost because we talk about doubt tooling oh my god dow tooling now tooling downtown downtown it's raining doubtfuls but i think it's important again to look at those and create those mindfully and from a place of experience like for me i see the pain on both sides i'm working on governance engagement but i'm also a steward and i know that for instance the other week like two weeks ago i was focusing so much on that and creating shelling point that i dropped the ball in my ns duties for a week right right because that's what happened right yeah dude which is fine right in a decentralized world knows they're going to drop right right right and so figuring out how to make sure that that isn't a tragedy or that isn't something that breaks something is right is something that we need to bake into the whole flow because we are humans the whole dow governance thing should be fluid because again using the river and the flow and all of that it has to be fluid it has to flow it has to enable people to kind of go oh okay i can't do this at the moment but i'm okay to come back in when i have more focus when i can dedicate more time okay so just i want to recap all of that i think both for the listeners and also for my own benefit the answer to like why not centralize is because of obvious reasons and the alternative is micro centralization in pockets which i think are like committees where like you you talked about these certain proposals such as if we're talking about a treasury like a treasury proposal as and we are going to do this with the treasury uh and perhaps like we can have two different versions it's like if this proposal is above ten thousand dollars or below ten thousand dollars it can go the river will split right right and it will go to this committee first and then this committee will right tinker with this part of the proposal maybe this is the clarity and definitions committee and the clarity and definitions committee do their work one of there maybe there's four nodes for council members of that particular cabinet of sorts and then once they're done they pass it off to another node which does the uh i don't know the the allocation of funds committee or something right and it goes it follows flows down this river and you always ensure that those little pockets have the right representation in them yes right okay so like micro centralization as in like all right four people have their role in responsibility four people have the block i wouldn't even call it centralization i would call it delegation specialized delegation specialized delegation i think we mean the same thing i think that i think that's a semantics difference but it sounds better but it definitely sounds better it definitely sounds better uh and so okay so we have like this like mesh network of like a river and the concept of a river is that it always flows downstream right like water will always go where it's easiest for it to go uh and like right now when i say like dows aren't autonomous rivers are autonomous right like they just go and so uh one of my bull cases for dalles not dallas's concept but the dows that are the most bullish are the ones that lower the threshold for participation down to the bare minimum right like how can you make a verifiable contribution yep in the easiest possible way yep uh and so if we're gonna extend this to governance it's like how can we make sure that the governance proposals always go downhill whether or not they're accepted like maybe downhill means it's rejected but like a rejection is a choice either way like successful governance can reject a choice absolutely so how do we make like a governance proposal hit all these subcommittees to refine and digest and uh do all these things with these governance and make sure the thing always flows downhill so that it comes to a conclusion because i think so many of dow governance right now is like we forget to come to a conclusion on a lot of things like it it gets lost in the river or we rush to a conclusion right and sometimes that's not necessarily a good conclusion or it's not necessarily thought of as much but keeping it as you say on that path i think that's where potentially those standards that you put in place come in because then it's almost like the banks of a river sure right right and you create that versus just like letting it spell all over the place in which case again with the river you lose control and it damages the rice yeah yeah it turns out right and so what you want is to have that and because you were saying with the flow of water obviously you have like the whole bruce lee thing be water my friends like all of that right and you take that shaping and you enable those the banks of the river to be that tooling that you put in place but you have to understand what the substance is right right because you could make the you know the banks of the river out of material that is not conducive to the flow right right it could be too porous it could be like breakable it could and then the river always automatically corrects for that because the river will erode of course the broken banks voila and this is beautiful this is so i mean i'm i'm impressed with us right now also just quick side quests rivers are inherently decentralized right and so like top-down government could become like i want to stop this river and build a dam but all dams break over time like we can just route around the river right there's that meme of just like governments banning bitcoin and it's like the fence that has no edges and people just like walk around the fence same thing with the river like you can you can dam up a river but like over the long time frame the river always breaks exactly where the dam always breaks exactly um let's take this back to romania and governance okay where we cut off the head but then the same similar shape reappears yes how does this model fix that i think and again another analogy that i i particularly like is this um idea of the puzzle if you lose you know you're making jigsaw puzzles and you lose one piece you have to replace it with a piece that is exactly the same shape exactly the same pattern exactly the same sure so what we are doing is we're scrapping that puzzle or at least the image that's in that puzzle and starting from scratch because if you just remove the piece one piece the head the rest keeps it right so you have to put the void still has the same shape same shape yeah and so my hope is that what we're all doing here is actually redesigning and re-planning a whole new puzzle learning from how puzzles work learning from how long it potentially takes what type of thing you need in there what type of material what type of whatever but it's a different image it's maybe a different structure maybe it's 3d one hopefully it's a 3d one that's a lot more right so you're kind of evolving it and again that evolution from your very basic one to something that can really really uh capture the richness and the not richness in the cash bags right the uh aspect of it what's the other word for this yeah vibrancy vibrancy um of what we can all do to ensure human thriving to ensure that we are

layers viewers i've done yeah starting with uh terune and then also the most recently tracheopterix yes we were talking about like okay cool dow governance eventually we're gonna get this thing perfected and refined right and the engine's really gonna start to turn right and all of them are like well eventually this will start to eat out the role of nation states right like eventually the united states governance the original dow by the way uh will start to start to incorporate some of the models and the efficiencies that we innovated and developed with dow governance yes uh tarun gave the example of how he thinks that it's really going to be the finance sector that comes first where like a lot of financial contracts use price prices of a certain thing at a certain time uh to be embedded into the contract right and this is like we just agreed that the price of this thing is at this time at this date by this by this oracle which is like the nasdaq but they could start instead of using the nasdaq which is a centralized company with with that kind of a gameable system yep instead you could use the oracle of uniswap yeah and you what we're doing is we're taking out the nasdaq puzzle piece and we're re-implanting the uniswap puzzle piece in this place and it's and his theory is that over time we're gonna find more and more ways to swap out old puzzle pieces yeah new puzzle pieces until you create a new puzzle until you create a new puzzle right from from the inside out do you have any thoughts on that so again i think it's it's really really interesting um thinking about because you mentioned the financial system and because we chat about money it's really interesting to to remember that we came up with that whole thing and we just perpetuated in the normal system now in the world it was decided at some point but we can always change our minds and decide something else and this is something that for a lot of people i guess even sometimes when they come into our space or into the web3 space it's very difficult to really get comfortable with the fact that that is just a decision some people made at this one time right it's not it's not canon you're not contractually bound to do anything people just agreed that the us dollar was gonna have some value people just agreed that this other thing was gonna have value that's all it is it's an agreement and we are making new agreements and we can make new agreements and we should make new agreements if the ones that have been in place are no longer serving us because that's what you would do if a car if you had a car that broke down as much as the current financial system yeah are you joking they would remove it from the market it would be a death trap we've had more systemic crises in the financial system since i don't know when they started measuring it right but it's 50 60 across the world and again think about the analogy of a car it broke down that much you'd be like i'm not getting into that death trap i need to buy a new one how do you think about um the rate of change right because the younger generations the millennials especially zoomers seem to be in their own world but they're going to get the brunt of this eventually probably once they graduate from college but like the rate of change of the world seems to be not not be satisfactory for a lot of the younger folk yeah i mean and so like they're just asking for change now now now now meanwhile the other half of the of the world like the older folk the boomers are like this is pretty gucci we kind of like we kind of like where things are right now we don't have the speed limit this is nice right let's cruise no shape no faster change like no more change like i haven't even figured out my iphone yet how do you think about this conflict i again i always say balance in all things um i think nature if you look at nature and again i love all of everything that comes with biomimicry i love everything that we can learn from nature in the way it behaves and in the way it does things because it's very clever and there's this thing in nature called the optimum window of viability where it's in between diversity and efficiency and it's always in the middle point what we tend to do is always go way too efficient anything happens restriction sanctions like every austerity you always go way too efficient and you disturb the balance too much diversity is also bad because then that doesn't work because there's too much right there's no coordination but in the middle that's where the sweet spot is now in terms of the piece of change i think if we again look at evolution if a fish swam up on the shore and suddenly grew a leg out of its gills that would not be very good because it it would die right it wouldn't evolve but slow evolution little by little ensures that it can become a successful new species a successful new thriving organism but it takes time because it needs to take into account all of the elements that it needs to build and build well you rush one you're like i don't know one side is lopsided and again it's not conducive to thriving so i think if we can get to that point where we balance out the speed because we do need to move right we can't just be like i'll be fine and learn because again things aren't rosy in the real world right so i think if we can reach that balance of doing things mindfully and doing things properly that we don't cut corners very important but we move because stagnation is also not good right do you think we have time like global warming is not being solved by nation states no and it's not i think that's generally a thing that most people across outside the crypto industry would agree with like no one's really taking nation states seriously granted it's not like the cryptos do industries doing anything for that but we kind of think that we can so but also do we have the time to actually be methodical about this and not rush this i think i think it's almost a conversation around having that urgency but not making mistakes because you're on under pressure which again is is not easy like we're not in an easy situation it's a big ass right go like okay so the world is gonna end so but you need to be like you know make sure you focus so look it's not easy but i think it's one of the main reasons why we're sort of more and more people are coming into the space because like okay okay but this is how we can right and this is what at the end of the day this is what the web 3 piece is about it's that choice it is that alternative because for so long we had none right and we were just stuck with that track right and that was it you can do uh you know turn things up and down over here and up and down over here but really it's the same road now we have a chance to a new one and all obviously with a new path you have to you know remove some thorns pave it do all of these things and we're doing it whilst we're carving carving it so hard and it takes a lot of people because you need everybody involved to be able to get to where you want to go right hence dev connect right yeah um why can't we cut corners why why can't we cut corners to get there because look at what cutting corners has got us into everybody has been cutting corners for like decades for generations the point that i'm making there is i think the technology that we're building is so so powerful that if we enable back doors cut corners to you know deliver for vcs a little bit faster don't quite focus ah privacy all of that right we need to ship again the balance it's important yes move yes ship but don't sacrifice the principles to go get your vcs some returns because that's what everybody has been doing okay my next question was going to be what's the corner that you see being cut the most but would that be your answer like optimizing for business i think privacy and security privacy and security what security mean just think about the amount of projects that have like one the first version of the contract audited and then they say they're audited but they've had like five cents right okay so we're talking about bug exploits just a plethora of risks that is just not exposed not addressed not even thought about and it's important right you're building these new things and we've seen so many recently oh this oh here's another one oh here's another exploit oh this broke and it's everyone's just exploited it doesn't matter oh is that the trend oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah damn i didn't get excellent oh right right is it a rite passage i i don't think it should be okay the other one was privacy yeah um how are we cutting coordinates on privacy i mean just i think the concept of privacy has been so diluted and so i don't even know what the word is but almost we've just become so detached from what privacy actually means that for a lot of people as we know you know why do you need privacy if you have nothing to hide that type of thing it's like well no that is not what privacy should be about privacy is a human right and you should not be tracked for things that you spend on and you shouldn't be tracked for everywhere you go and you shouldn't your face shouldn't be scanned by ever a supermarket checkout are you joking what but again is that an erosion of and people are so comfortable giving away so much of their stuff at all times that actually now there's this process of having to claw it back and for a lot of people it's like yeah but why bother there's like so much out there already it'll be fine but again getting back into a place where our identity isn't correlated with our money and everything else so that a simple switch through a back door of an application can just cut your access to everything it's bad i'm uh i'm reminded of i'm a clear member because there was one time i was not going to make my flight and so i had to sign up for clear the security line and all you have to do is go and get your irises scanned and boom your name comes up with your birthday and everything and every time i do that i'm like that's going to come back to bite me in the butt one day it really will and i love that you spend those seconds to think about that and then like and carry and then get on the flight right yeah oh well well at least i'm not gonna miss my flight silver lining everywhere right no but it's that right and we've been so pushed to think or like of course you realize that's like probably not okay but like what can you do but it's we've so been pushed to being comfortable with all of this stuff that the moment like status perfect example the moment you kind of go actually let's build the whole thing as a pseudo-anonymous thing that doesn't require a password a phone number of who you are people go oh this is hard right doesn't make sense oh when i can't pull all of my contacts from my address book on my phone well this is a bit right can you let's go into the full status shield mode can you get can you give the listeners and me the the pitch for status what is it and what does it do and why is it good status was obviously one of the first um players in the mobile wallet space back in 2017 and then they also started building a chat and the idea with it and a web3 browser the idea for me is that now it is perfectly poised that stack is perfectly poised to create spaces for the web 3 community to actually switch from the centralized tooling that they use to a web 3 native stack space app whatever it is that is going to become so one of the things that i came in back in 2020 again and we say it's important to have that balance between speed of shipping and doing it properly um i propose this feature of the communities feature that is now being worked on but there's obviously so many implications in that where if you are going to have let's say hundreds of thousands of people on it you want that messaging reliability to be on point which right now it is not okay you want the design to flow right now it does not it needs a refresh it needs like updating it needs a lot of things but even something as simple as pulling from the openc api to show your nfts in your wallet that's technically let's say an infringement on your privacy right because you're like i'm finding things out about you but the point is the user should make that decision give the option right and then for those who don't care that much right just paul right for those who do go and via the browser to access your opencv and it's those little things that actually make a big difference and it's important to make sure that when you do build it like that you do take your sweet time but again urgency is needed there sure so that's that and uh again that connecting us back to like real world uh stuff back in the uh the uh revolution uh what was it what was the revolution called drag my memory the of the so the whole kind of sequence of events in the uh in the eastern bloc was the proc it started with the prague spring right and then all of them kind of right and so the fact that it went off like fireworks right like it was like it was like ready to go right and it just needed this one thing to light them out yes uh what was missing probably was like a messaging network of people who were like to disseminate are you are you tired  because i'm tired of this  and if we had a messaging network that was private people would have been more uh comfortable communicating their descent communicating and congregating and being able to coordinate yes because innovation technology exactly and it's important and this is the thing and again we're drawing parallels here between you know uh late 80s early 90s and where we are now but if you think back then you had landlines and the phone was probably bugged 100 couldn't trust it right you couldn't say oh meet me there we're gonna like we're gonna throw some blow up the russians yeah no way and now you're in the situation where you have all of these like privacy messaging applications privacy used in the loosest of terms right that again if you think of most of them it has your phone number right you know what your phone number tells about you your address who you are everything so unless everybody has burner phones which i doubt that they do we're not that far off okay it's not as nefarious or as uh entrenched as it used to be but maybe it is that's all i'm saying and then if you start and again this isn't necessarily about and i think that's the other perception that you will always use these things to do bad things right no just you can have consciousness for the drugs right like all of the things that can be bought with us dollars and have been for generations right yeah all of the good stuff but it's that thing that perception and maybe that again has been the narrative that has been uh publicized of oh these guys that's why they're using it for like bad things come on i just want to have a conversation about things that i maybe not don't agree with or i want to have a conversation to be able to coordinate some sort of protest movement whatever something that does not agree with my values and my human rights there's so many countries in the world where you need people to also be protected journalists because we brought up russia because we bring up all of these different countries where journalists are genuinely at risk right all the time you want to be able to offer a space a safe space for them to be able to speak to their sources speak amongst each other be able to share information be able to share situations that would put them in a safer place than they are right now i mean all of these things it it that perception of it's always bad is simplistic and a lot of it is um dare i say just it potentially can be dangerous for all of those people who need that protection certainly certainly victims of abuse again there's endless um simona what about the current state of the crypto industry makes you optimistic i think everything that we and and this is this is a great segue because obviously um one of the main reasons why um i'm at devconnect not only to um support and speak at the different events but also i'm curating shelling point again yes so shellingpoint amsterdam um it's happening on thursday and for me and this is the way i've kind of designed the experience is for it to genuinely be that antidote to a lot of the events that we're seeing popping up now and that usually tend to happen in a bull market that are all flash no substance and kind of gross from what i've heard described as a pile of money searching for a soul with a hint of dumpster fire right right so i think a really really important thing to keep in mind is that we must protect and um elevate the conversations around what we are genuinely changing and where we're going and that's what i want shelling point to be that's kind of what we did in denver a little bit but this time around i'm doing we have almost three hours of workshops just on climate and what web 3 is doing on climate and bringing all of the projects working in that space to have these hands-on workshops chat about things have conversations involve the participants into whatever the solution may be right we also focus a lot a lot on again discussing this governance situation discussing public goods how are we moving the needle how are we progressing things discussing decentralized science discussing all of these things that we need to be focusing on because that's the stuff that actually matters that's the stuff that's going to evolve us from here to there not a sprinkle of cash and like a party parties are great don't get me wrong and the shelling point one is gonna be amazing but um it's important to have those conversations and delve deep into those conversations and i'm playing a little bit with the format as well because after so many conferences i am bored two tiers of the traditional format and so what i've asked all of the speakers to do is to do 50 50 in terms of their content 50 can be you talk about whatever you use you wanna talk about the other half you involve the audience i don't care if you do yoga with them i don't care if it's plain q a do something where it is a collaborative effort everything that we're doing it isn't the work of one person it's not the work of ten everybody has a contribution to make and everybody can and should feel comfortable making that contribution and figuring out what is on that uh what's a amusement park map everybody should see the whole map and decide where they want to go and how they want to get there what are you looking in addition to all of your work at shelling point which maybe is taking up a majority of your time here but what else are you looking to get done here here at devconnect so i think it's it's a lot um of again catching up with a lot of the stuart so because of the work that i do with with bitcoin around um governance there's a lot of the stewards uh particularly uh in bitcoin and in the new stuart council um that we created a lot of them are here in person and i think it's important again to have that connection because we do have a lot a lot of um let's say flows that we're putting together together right and we're figuring out hey does this work is this better did we achieve something here that is moving us closer to that flow of the river to that more structured uh pattern and i think uh in addition to that of course there's also so that's important to have those governance conversations also irl right and then be able to take them to the online realm and be okay here's where we've decided we're going to observe this for a while and then improve it but of course also east amsterdam i'm a perpetual judge of the if global circuit and i absolutely love seeing all the new projects i'm excited every single time especially after a week like this how inspired will those people be what will they take from everything that they've listened to that they participated in what would they take to genuinely create something that is better that is getting us that is a stage of evolution a new lego a new lego and you like that yes yes yeah yeah um so at bank list we often say like hey go go work for a dow and it sounds like you you work for at least two dolls if not more yeah uh for for the people that uh that here ryan and i say go work for a dao from our privileged position of having the centralized company uh what's it like to work for a doubt like and do you get compensation for the dolls that you work for like is this this is how you you buy groceries so right now actually this is a fortuitous uh event because i am actually now transitioning into uh the git coin down where i'm gonna get paid by the different work streams within the dow so for instance i because i do the content curation i did the content creation for a shelling point there is a certain amount that will be allocated to me for that work okay then the stuff that i do with governance engagement will come from another work stream then i also help out with funding public goods there's a lot of relationships that i have and we pull funds for the grants rounds that is going to come from another stream so it really is this very interesting and multifaceted again taking that whole thing of streams into a river type uh dynamic of what is it that you contribute to and what is the level of that contribution and that's how it flows and do you feel that the dows that you are are part of how would you rate their adeptness as to properly balancing contributions to we're just getting started okay okay a lot of that needs to be improved and a lot of that it's fine that we don't know when we haven't figured it out yet and and again coming back to that thing of like being comfortable in ambiguity and not feeling like we have to get it right from the beginning because every single time we kind of miss something or we don't do it right and so on it just enables us to improve on it to do it better to make it a little bit more transparent to make it a little bit more accessible to make it a little bit less taxing nice but like yeah nice um yeah contributions over taxes they're the same thing but one people like word that one word much better than the other um uh what was gonna be my last game yeah so for the newer newer comers to the crypto space people that came in 2020 or beyond or more recently welcome well yeah welcome thank you for being here but we're so glad you're here what advice do you have to help these people actually stay in the crypto space and why should they stay in the crypto space i think definitely make sure that um and again man this is going to be your most analogy laden episode oh i'm not so sure about that oh really oh yeah we're pretty hard on this okay okay so i'll keep going um so i think again with that whole idea of the path right we there's this one that just is established and everything and when you start off a different path it's gonna be a little bit trickier you're gonna have some obstacles in the way you're gonna have to be like a little bit more uncomfortable and like i say there's like some stinging nettles here and there and whatever a frog here but uh just casually laying out in the grass but now um for me it's don't feel or don't give in to feeling overwhelmed or being scared if you read some article about something or if you go into a discord and you feel uh this isn't really my vibe i would say look for those communities that are value aligned with you and what you want this is one of the reasons why particularly with bitcoin right there's so many people coming in because they are genuinely interested in regenerative stuff public goods solar punk stuff like all of this impact and it's it's that value alignment that really makes that ability to start contributing so much easier than if you go into into let's say a discord that you found somewhere and that's full of price talk and all of this that you just don't feel like where do i even start what do i do i even want to be here and so i think there's that kind of shock sometimes of oh i didn't think this was or you go to one of these events that i mentioned earlier not the good ones but the other ones and you go oh is this what crypto is all about it's not it's not um and so that exploration i think almost have that explorer mindset go and look behind this go and talk to some other people who are also on this path with you maybe share some maps okay i've got this bit you have that bit maybe let's do things together colonel also is a very very good example of where this can be done right uh colonel was started by one of the the bitcoin uh co-founders effect and it's a great great journey to take people from that very edge of the path a little bit further it won't take you all the way but it will take you and enable you to meet some people to have that journey to take that journey together so explore a mindset absolutely but like again the curious nice kind not the yes invader kind of yeah of course yeah yeah simona thank you for coming on layer zero thank you so much this has been fun cheers and i'll see
