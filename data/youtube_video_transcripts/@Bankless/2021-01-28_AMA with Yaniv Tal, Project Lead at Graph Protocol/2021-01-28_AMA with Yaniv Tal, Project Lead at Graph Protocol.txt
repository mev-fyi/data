[Music] hey bankless nation we are so excited to bring you another community ask me anything we've got yaniv from the graph he's the co-founder of the graph cryptical we're going to dive into the graph and what it does just some ground rules for you so you may be watching this live on youtube if you are you can ask questions uh david and i will get your questions on youtube we'll try to prioritize them the best way that we can if you are a bankless premium member we will also prioritize your questions in the bankless discord this doesn't ask me anything so david and i have a list of questions but we also want your participation this is a great opportunity for us to figure out what's going on with this important piece of defy ethereum crypto infrastructure known as the graph yaniv welcome to bank list welcome to the ama you ready for this i'm ready hey guys thanks for having me on the show uh it's awesome to have you we've been wanting to do this for quite some time you know i think we should start is is just sort of uh and explain it like i'm five on the graph so bankless listeners we're all familiar with d5 uh we're obviously familiar with kind of ethereum bitcoin crypto so we've got that base knowledge um but what is the graph it feels like it's this behind the scenes infrastructure what does it do and uh like have we used it without knowing uh yeah i bet that you have so um you know the graph is an indexing protocol and the explain it like i'm five is that you know we organize all of the data from blockchains and make it easily accessible to applications um so the the same way that um you know you wouldn't find a topic in a book by just kind of scanning page to page you know you need to have a typical context or an index that organizes that data sources so you can easily find what you're looking for you know computers work exactly the same way when you use applications you know they're querying data from some underlying um you know place and uh before the graph people had to build custom proprietary centralized servers to index that data to make apps load quickly um and now there's um you know we've launched the graph network which is a decentralized network where anyone can participate and run an indexer to help index the data for d5 and web 3. um and and people can now build fully decentralized applications that query that data from the graph and um it's a really just core uh piece of infrastructure for building decentralized applications synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world check out quenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your s snx or eth and earn fees from synthetics if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is both a one-two punch of an ethereum smart contract wallet as well as an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet wherever visa is accepted it's really a fantastic tool that lets you use ethereum for what it does best which is holding and managing your financial assets but also keeps you connected to the rest of the world's payment rails monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of device so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if ever you need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because your monolith wallet is native to ethereum monolith helps you transcend both the legacy and the crypto worlds because the money that you hold in your monolith wallet has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on unit swap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips but with monolith so are the groceries at your grocery store or the coffee at your coffee shop go to monolith.xyz to sign up and get your monolith visa card it's super cool so um you know google is is famously sort of an indexer for the web right there's all of these different like websites that are pushed out there and they built a lot of tech over the years to help us find things on this permissionless system known as the internet so they're kind of like like an information indexer if you will it is this kind of what the graph is doing for for blockchains and for crypto it's just like searching through it categorizing it and making it easy for applications to to retrieve the data that they're looking for yeah i love that analogy because um you know we do the same thing right indexing organizing all of this information um so you know there's some key similarities um like that and then the difference is that google exposes that as you know a search box right you go to google.com and that's the interface is this kind of search engine whereas the graph exposes all of that data through apis called subgraphs and apis are how developers build applications and how they interact with you know other computer systems so by having um you know all of these open apis built by developers for developers where all that data is indexed we can actually serve custom applications so instead of it just being a search box taking you to a website um you know you can have apps like uniswap.info or the synthetics exchange or the decentraland marketplace you know all of these are very custom applications but they all need to get their data from somewhere they need to allow users to search filter sort you know find relevant data and they can do that all with the graph so yaniv you said that we might be um [Music] using the graph without being totally aware what are some examples of of where the the graph is actually used for for the typical bankless listener the typical d5 user um do you have some examples for us um yeah so you know in the d5 world um you know some of uh the the projects i'm sure your listeners have used are you know unique swap.info synthetics exchange uh ave balancer just to name a few and uh you know i think at this point um you know talk to basically just reach straight for uh you know uh for the graph from day one and it helps them you know get their products to market just significantly faster so this is uniswap.info i don't know if you you can see that but i'm pulling that up on the screen for for everyone who's watching over youtube right and so i'm on the overview page i'm looking at all of kind of the liquidity on unit swap all of all of these various data points this is what you're talking about right so um you're you're doing the graph is doing the the indexing and the data retrieval portion for all of these graphics all of these dashboards is that correct that's right so you know it's loading the data for the charts for like those top tokens you know you can sort by liquidity or by volume right by clicking on the column headers so that's you know a query uh with uh you know sorting um you know if you click in on the tokens or on the pairs you know there's kind of you know historical transaction data and and volumes and all of that data is coming from the grass okay very cool and the reason this is important or one reason this is important is because of course open finance is um is better as we say than the traditional financial system because the data is accessible to anyone on chain basically right so if you want to see the uh who owns a specific token which ethereum addresses to that is or if you want to see how much how much value is collateralized in the die that you're holding that that underlies a collateralized debt position like this data is available on chain but it's not necessarily accessible in a in a user interface that you could see and the graph is essentially making open finance accessible in in user interfaces and places where people can see and they don't have to kind of go digging for it and run their own queries and find it right that's right and and you know we think it's important that all of the infrastructure for define web3 is decentralized you know we want to move away from you know these situations where you know a server goes down and you know an app stops working or um people take the dependencies on specific uh kind of centralized points of failure you know anytime you have like one group of people decides you know these are the top d5 protocols or these are you know the metrics that you should be looking at to evaluate you know a synthetics or an obvi um you know those are decisions that really should be transparent and that if people want to like you know fork them they can fork them and and that uh you know anyone can build applications easily on top of this data and um you know information works in these kinds of layers where you know it's constantly aggregated and repackaged and so the more that these layers are you know stable infrastructure that teams can build upon um you know the more amazing things we can build okay so now we get to kind of this question so people have pointed to application services like in fiora as being a centralization vector for ethereum and for of course um is the graph similar like how does the graph um prevent becoming a centralization vector in this open this decentralized open finance thing that we're building yeah so you know that's exactly why we built uh the graph network right initially we launched the graph as a hosted service and that was so that developers could start building on the graph and we wanted to make sure that you know we were building something that was useful for developers um but we were aware of this risk from the very beginning and it's why you know we from the from the beginning we set out to build the graph as a decentralized protocol and last december we actually launched the decentralized network so in this network it's an open permissionless network anybody can run an indexer to provide the indexing and query processing service to the network as a client you can choose who you want to connect to and so you know all of that choice is on the client side and uh and and that specifically makes it so that there is no single point of failure single kind of like you know choke point decision point on you know what is valid data how should the data be indexed and um uh and and ultimately when you bring this up to the api layer you know that's kind of the top of the stack that's where you're asking a question like you know um you know what what nfts are uh are for sale sorted by you know uh price and you don't want someone to be able to just you know change the results censor you know make these types of decisions on their own and so you want to have some guarantees that the data that you're getting back when you're running that type of a query is correct um and you just couldn't do that without something like the graph with this indexing layer initially when ethereum first launched there was kind of this vision of light clients really being the main way that you would interact with everything and light clients are really great because um you can basically um you know verify uh you know proofs on the client that some value that you requested is correct um but you can only do that with a very narrow subset of uh kind of operations so you know about an ethereum balance you can verify that but you can't do that for kind of like arbitrary views on data which all you know applications produce custom arbitrary views on data and so if we're going to have rich applications that do all of the kinds of things that we're used to traditional you know web or mobile apps doing we need to be able to actually transform and and consume you know much uh you know broader sets of data that have been transformed and organized and so you can do that and still have it be verifiable on the graph you need i think it would be helpful if we talked about what would what are the potential attack vectors if cert the services that are provided by the graph are remain services provided by centralized intermediaries um like what what are the attack vectors what are the risks if centralized services are become the dominant uh indexer for for defy like are there like uh attack vectors that could be exploited or where where what could go wrong if this service that is provided by the graph remains uh in the hands of centralized intermediaries um yeah you know it could be everything from you know raising prices and suddenly everything starts to get expensive you know make doing you know making censorship decisions around like you know either you know this dap just isn't allowed or you know even more granularly than that you know imagine you have an in an nft marketplace and then there's a certain set of nfts that basically you know the service provider just says like hey you can't have these nfts and they start making those types of decisions um you know kicking off developers um and then you know just uh you know so these are all types of like attack vectors um but but ultimately i think central is the the problem with centralization is that uh you know every you know the these things require a lot of development and a lot of effort you know we're kind of we're at the beginning of building out like an entire new financial and information you know infrastructure and you know developers don't want to contribute to something that is owned and controlled by a corporation that can make these types of decisions just like on their own like we've we've done that you know we've been there and and uh and now we're going to rebuild the stack so that it doesn't have the same pitfalls and problems and so by having a decentralized protocol what you have is a shelling point where people know it's worth investing my time you know to this thing because i know it's going to be around in 100 years you know it's not going to be co-opted and and that allows just a tremendous tremendous amount of development to get concentrated um for the public good you know something that anybody can then use uh because you know everybody can contribute to it maybe let's talk about the components that network participants contribute to the graph and how the graph uses these components to offer its product right so as an individual uh what uh what what can i offer to the graph that the graph needs in order to be able to create this product um yeah you know really depends on your skills i mean the main roles in the network are indexers curators and delegators the indexers are the ones that are running the nodes so if if you've like run an ethereum node for example and you know how to do that then you could look at becoming an indexer on the network we have curators those are the ones that understand the data that's being indexed and are organizing the data on the graph they could be subgraph developers for example so you know anyone can build a sub graph that indexes data and makes it available over graphql or the curators uh can also uh signal on sub graphs um to basically you know evaluate the subgraphs figure out which ones are highest quality and should be used by applications and then um they can signal on those sub graphs to uh make it easier for others to find it and it also impacts the economics for the indexers and then finally we've got the delegators who help secure the network but you know they may not be as technical themselves so they can just find indexers that they think are doing a good job and just delegate their tokens to those indexers um which allows uh the indexers to earn more fees and rewards um which they pass back to their delegators yeah let's talk about the token and the uh economics of the protocol how so every single protocol that has a token is using this token to incent to manage incentives how does the graph use its token to manage incentives and perpetuate the network um yeah so it's used for you know staking by indexers delegating by delegators and signaling by curators and also as query fees um by consumers that are querying the network so um you know first and foremost it's a staking token it creates economic security so the indexers that provide the service in the network have to stake tokens um so that if they misbehave they can be slashed um they then set their uh query fees also in uh grt and indexers can choose what subgraphs they want to index and they can set their price prices very granularly and those fees are uh paid using state channels and uh you know we're you know i believe the largest like large-scale deployment of state channels and production on ethereum um all right and uh wait i had no idea why state channels yeah that's pretty i guess that makes it more decentralized yeah tell us about that yeah so we did a partnership um with the state channels team uh in consensus r d and connects and um you know we evaluated the different options of doing payments uh you know in the graph you you have this very like many to many style relationships with payments or you can have like lots of different consumers and lots of different indexers and the actual payment amounts are quite small you know just a small fraction of a cent per query and we wanted to ensure that you know the queries themselves can differ significantly in expense you know most queries are a very small fraction of a set but you could have like a larger like analytic style query that you know could take a second to execute or something as a service provider you want to know that you're going to get paid you know if you do that work and so we have a construction uh called you know conditional uh micro payments um we also use this term like way blocks and it basically ensures that uh when you get a query response back from an indexer um it comes back with an attestation and if uh the query response that you got back is incorrect then you can submit a dispute on chain and the indexer is liable and can be slashed than if they gave you the incorrect response back so that whole kind of interaction happens inside of a state channel it's a state channel game and it allows you you know to you know an indexer can be collect you know doing millions or even billions of queries a day you know it's very fast and cheap and then they just settle those channels on chain um you know whatever frequency they want it could be daily or weekly and collect their funds this is amazing so i i had no idea that you guys were doing this with with state channels so this is this is really making it like scaling a decentralized like payment layer for you that's really necessary for your your work token your your entire token economics and you're keeping it decentralized using state channels so how many like how many transactions per second can the support that do you need additional you know scaling tech to support this payments use case or state channels give you what you need state channels gives us what we need so you know we could you know scale up to you know billions or you know more queries per day on this tech and uh and and uh and it works great i think we are evaluating you know layer two um scaling solutions for uh some of our core protocol smart contracts because interacting with the protocol itself you know you're subject to all the same kind of gas issues as other protocols so we like to bring those costs down for when you do have to make on-chain interactions but for the query processing and the query fees the state channels is actually working really great that's probably a combination of uh the both both the need for micro payments as well as the need for immediate payments is is the immediacy of payments a a nice feature that state state channels offer or is that something i'm generally unrelated um well you do want the property that you know once um a query has been served basically like the transaction is finished and right the parties know that like the value has been transferred right so waiting for an ethereum block is a is too slow right yeah yeah exactly i mean you know if you think about most applications you know if you're using like facebook or twitter you know you're just you're consuming you're reading so much more data than you're writing right like the number of tweets versus you know you scrolling a feed so you know the the querying is happening like constantly all of the time and so that just needs to be fast and instant so this token seems to be to in my mind it maps on to i think the chain link token model um and so correct me if i'm wrong but like there is people that are staking on the promise to provide accurate data to the network there's people that are consuming that data that are paying fees in the native token um and and then there is also the the uh the the protocol itself which is an economic a cryptoeconomic protocol that's meant to provide data to the world um is that a fair comparison would you say yeah i think it is you know i'm excited for the chain link staking to go live um because that's that's not in production yet but i believe it's a similar sort of model and um you know we could you know i love the chain link also comparison where you know they help bring you know uh real world data on chain and we help bring on-chain data to the real world so we're very much just kind of like dual middleware protocols yeah do you guys have a green frog army though do you have a green frog army or no no no we don't we're currently recruiting so we we need you so speaking of that right it's like david was getting to this uh earlier and i think you touched on it we actually did a bankless tactic on this about like how to um how to work essentially for the graph network so what you just described is basically the graph is paying for what the graph network needs using its its token economics right the things it needs are curation delegation but also indexing right and so like a number of folks that are active in these d5 protocols um they'll have done some work on curation right it's fairly simple not super technically complex and then also delegation is something we do in almost every protocol that's staking right can we talk about this indexer function though this is this is um more technical but this to me is the like the question of decentralization because if it's really hard to run an indexer if i have to be like a um a super sophisticated uh devops with my own data center in my backyard right like that's less decentralized than something like eth2 which is i can run a like validator on my laptop hardware right and i'm guessing it's not like we can run an index on our laptop hardware necessarily it's maybe it's maybe somewhere in between but can you talk about the the complexity of actually running an indexer do i have to be a sophisticated network uh operator with like my own data center all this provisioned or is it a bit more do-it-yourself and and how does that scale because that to me is a centralization vector in in the network um yeah so you know i think of decentralization for a network like ours differently from you know as i would for like a layer one blockchain you know i think ethereum made a great set of trade-offs to you know be maximally decentralized for validation and i think for a layer one chain you know that that is really important um for uh what we're doing it's kind of like a service protocol uh that's what we've coined it different from like a layer one where you know we're providing a service to the network it's it's indexing and it's very kind of heterogeneous so each indexer chooses which subgraphs they want to index they're not all doing the same work right and then the client chooses which service provider they want to do business with so they have complete control i can say you know i i really don't trust these indexers over here i just don't you know for whatever reason i want my money to go over here and you can choose which service providers you do business with and so because the the user's in control you know they you know it is kind of you know produces choice from that perspective and then you know for a network like the graph what's really important is kind of like marketplace dynamics you know you want it to be easy for new service providers to provide their service you want there to be lots of choice you know consumer choice so um so consumers can choose which indexers they want to uh do business with and um and you want to have competitive prices and a very high quality of service so you know for that you know it makes a big difference whether an indexer can like serve a query you know in like 0.1 seconds or you know versus you know two seconds so you actually do want this level of kind of competitiveness and and and you know serving data and processing data is something where you you want folks to have bp setups you want it to be you know so that they can provide that service really uh efficiently so um uh so so generally the people running indexers are ones that have access to faster servers you know we want it to be something that anybody can do so that like barrier to entry you know is is fairly low you know if you have a server set up reasonably fast computer in your home you could actually be an indexer but we also you know wants there to be um ways for people to compete on the higher end of the spectrum where they're you know providing a faster service and maybe it just costs a little bit more i think one of the most elegant things about ethereum and what good applications can do on ethereum is let the free market come into their protocol and leverage market-based incentives to produce a quality product and i'm getting vibes of like uh sharding here so ethereum scales by sharding out computational resources to 64 different shards and so we get 64 times the scale because each person doesn't have to process all of the data only a subset of the data and that seems to be a similar pattern that the graph is going here where um and and they're actually you guys are actually making this even more free where you can just say like you know process whatever data that you want but you'll only be compensated if the market actually wants that data and in addition i would imagine that there is certain amounts of data about ethereum that's just simply more in demand than others perhaps like data around uniswap might be more in demand than data around cryptokitties and it seems to be like the token would be the substrate that allows that free market to become expressed maybe maybe you can talk about how data in demand data will become better served over time and allow kind of the free market to come out and produce a quality product here maybe talk about a little bit of the free market relationship with uh data that's in demand yeah those are great insights so you know right now subgraphs are kind of the the unit of composition um so you know there are you know there's a unispot sub graph synthetic subgraph and um you know soon people will actually be able to like compose those subgraphs into like aggregated subgraphs so you have this this unit that which is the sub graph from there an indexer can choose which sub graphs they want to index based on you know like you said demand what the current prices are in the market you know if they think that they can do it you know more effectively than others so they choose the subgraphs and then they can set the prices granularly so they can see like these types of queries are really expensive for my database to run i'm going to run you know charge a little bit more or you know i've been able to cache this data i know like every time someone loads unison.info they make this type of query so i'm just going to like cache it and i'm going to serve it super fast super cheap so um the indexers can set their prices really granularly in this query market and um you know i think that kind of a flexibility is you know really exciting for this type of a thing because databases are you know notoriously difficult to optimize you know most like you know web companies they'll have dedicated you know dbas or database administrators whose job is to make sure that like you know an app developer doesn't accidentally like run a query that like takes the whole database down you know and it's actually really easy to do that um because you know for certain applications you know the types of queries that you run you know some can be really simple and take like no time at all and then some can take like a minute and like bring the entire database down so um to have actually this kind of you know open market for indexing data you know basically allows you to have like this distributed decentralized dba team sitting there optimizing database access figuring out how are people you know accessing data today what types of applications are they running they can go in make the necessary optimizations and make sure that basically all of the adapts on define web 3 are super fast performant and cheap and the developers just don't need to think about it how does this help solve the ethereum ecosystems dependency on infira is this related yeah well you know the the graph is kind of a you know it's a layer on top of you know the uh the blockchain node providers themselves so you know an indexer could choose to use infuria you know as its ethereum node or they could run their own um we have noticed that most of our indexers you know have chosen to run their own archive nodes which i think is is great for decentralization so they're actually validating the chain themselves and then um you know it's running this indexer on top so you know ultimately i think you know we can move to a world where you know there are you know hundreds or thousands many thousands of indexers each one is validating the underlying networks whose data they're processing they're serving it up over the graph and then the clients can in an automated fashion do the indexer selection and i think you end up with a much more robust and decentralized infrastructure layer so jenny you started the graph like co-founded it a couple years ago is that correct like 20 2018 yeah we we started on it kind of christmas break 2017. okay all right so um you obviously had an inkling that crypto blockchain would be important and that there would there would need to be a lot of data that required indexing um but did you see it playing out in this way like is all of this surprising to you or did you anticipate it going exactly the way it's gone yeah honestly it's kind of scary how little the visions changed and by by little i mean basically we you know the vision that we saw is uh nothing's changed about it i think um we didn't expect the big crash we didn't expect uh you know some elements of it to uh kind of take as long as it has to kind of progress and if you asked me in 2017 how long i thought it would take to like build the graph i probably would have told you like a year or something but uh you know it's it was a lot of work i think that's that's the thing that i've really appreciated is just uh you know how much work goes into building a protocol how much work goes into like getting developer adoption and building tools that uh that you know developers are excited and happy to use um but uh but but the vision is played out basically exactly as we initially you know set out for so how about the applications right so in a way the graph is kind of privileged because you don't really have to take a bet on what applications even like what areas on top of something like ethereum become successful right is it like in in the the end of 2017 everyone was talking about web 3 right a decentralized uh you know web 2 type companies right um you know it turned out that the the first major use case uh on ethereum was more money type use cases more like d5 type use cases at least that's first but you guys didn't really have to take a bet on which applications which use cases would be successful on top of this infrastructure because you're like the you know picks and shovels type of infrastructure type of um play but let me ask you were you personally surprised about defy and how it's gone or the use cases that have popped up in the crypto sphere or did that play out how you thought it would be yeah yeah that that that was surprising you know i think you know i remember when there was like a billion locked in d5 and that just seemed like enormous and already we see like you know how how quickly we've grown from there so um you know that that came by surprise like a storm and um uh you know really excited to see how how well d5 has progressed um i i do think we thought that web three would uh you know happen sooner and when we were getting started building it's like we're focused on our protocol and we just assumed that all of the other protocols were doing the same and that they would just come together you know relatively quickly and i think you know by the end of 2018 it was clear that like a lot of these other things outside of our control were just going to take longer to kind of get you know get to market but i think you know you know people kind of you know they overestimate what they're going to see in the short term and they underestimate what they're going to see in the long term and i think that actually a lot of the initial ideas that people had i mean even things like state channels like we were talking about like in 2017 people were talking about these things like they were going to happen immediately you know plasma is about to launch and all of these things are about to launch they've taken a little bit longer but you know uh it really feels to me like 2021 is the year you know for for web three and that there are all of these incredible protocols that have really been under development now for like three years and are just kind of getting to market and i think we'll be able to put these web through protocols together and actually build you know a comprehensive you know stack that allows you to build just incredible applications um but where all of the data is verifiable right where it's actually on this um you know more trustworthy foundation that you know we can all build on top of and you know i think that um you know the the timing is is right i mean you know you see all of the stuff happening uh with censorship and centralized control you know from governments to large corporations getting you know pressured um you know society i think has woken up to those risks um and at the same time you know the financial system you know it's it's it's so funny you know watching what's happening with like gamestop you know where you know you see you see these these hedge funds literally like just distorting the system and corrupting it and like using it to their advantage and you know i feel like ordinary people have just gotten like the the brunt end of the stick for so long basically just being told you know you got to play by the rules and uh and and and like you know this is the game and then and then you just see you know wall street just taking advantage um and uh and and so all of these uh you know headwinds are kind of you know colliding it's a perfect storm right now for d5 and web3 and you know we just need to put these you know last few pieces of the stack together so that people can really build great decentralized applications and that it's it's it's it's simple you know exactly like this is what it means to be a decentralized application this is how we do it this is how it plugs in and once that foundation is in place i think you know we're going to see just like an explosion in the number of daps because i think i think the world's ready for it ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap

previous writings it sounds like you are still bullish longer term on this this web 3 decentralized kind of internet decentralized social type movement is that the case absolutely i think it's going to come sooner than people realize and um you know i think this is the year that we basically put the web3 stack together and then uh and then i think uh you know we're gonna be ready it's it's it's it's gonna happen yaniv i got a question from youtube that i want to get to as well as a few others the first one is is the graph married to ethereum or are there other l1 blockchains that the graph is working with you know we we do think it's going to be a multi-chain future uh you know i think ethereum is going to be i would imagine you know the uh the most valuable kind of like primary chain um but i think there are different points in the trade-off space and just even for resilience and decentralization's sake itself it's good to kind of have backups and and uh you know different alternatives and so i think i think ultimately you know people can choose where they deploy what contracts based on you know their needs and that uh you know we can stitch all of these things together into like a larger decentralized platform how about um player two how does that kind of rock your world right so we've got synthetics and they're they're just testing out uh layer two on optimistic roll-up uh it looks like we've got things like loop ring as well it looks like uniswap may do that so in the future uh i would imagine an index network like the graph will have to pull from not just ethereum main chain but also all of these other layer twos uh does that really rock your world or do you have the infrastructure set up for that and are ready for that challenge yeah we're ready for it so you know that's it's definitely coming up and we're super excited about layer two i think it's gonna allow just so many more different types of dapps to get built with ethereum's security um and and we're super excited for that so yeah i mean the graph is gonna gonna have to index data from you know eth1 from e2 all the different charts all the different layer twos all the different you know side chains and other chains um uh storage networks you know like file coin are weave c uh um so it's just a you know tremendous amount of data that that's already exists in in the uh you know web3 ecosystem and uh and and there's gonna be a lot more on the way here's another question from youtube about the the token distribution can you tell us about how the token was distributed to the world yeah so um we did a a number of programs to help kind of uh uh you know bring out the the the grass community and and to recognize people for the work that they contributed to the network um so we did a test net to get the initial set of indexers on board we had 200 indexers from all around the world um they got about uh you know three percent of the network um we did a curator program um that was uh you know the uh either subgraph developers or people that wanted to like learn how to um you know curate and organize data on the graph and that was just an incredible experience um you know i think it was something that was really brand new and that i hope that other protocols uh key off of you know is basically this massively multiplayer online vocational training program by teaching people you know new skills you know to perform a new job you know how to work for a decentralized protocol and you know i think that is just the future right just you know hundreds and thousands of permissionless jobs doesn't matter where you are in the world you know here's the the educational materials you know here's how you know the skills that you can um learn to perform this job and then have at it um nothing's standing in your way you don't have to ask for permission um so we did that with curators and and we allocated an initial uh uh distribution of tokens to them uh we did a token how big was that distribution if i can ask how what was the percentage of the well you were just talking about the distribution for the vocation program was about three yeah the curator program was uh it was about three percent uh and then we did uh the uh um the token sale uh the the the public token sale portion was uh was four percent and that one we also did very differently we did a custom uh token cell design built our own smart contracts our own ui it ran on the graph which by the way it ran flawlessly and you know a lot of these token sales that are done on centralized platforms you know there have been a lot of hiccups where like you know the sites just crash and there's all of these questions about like who got in and why and and so actually really showing that like the d5 and web3 infrastructure is just already better than centralized you know platforms for a lot of things um so in that sale uh the way that we designed it was pretty different where we had these three phases and we you know we kyc everybody you know because we had to and uh there was a questionnaire you know what excites you about defying web3 you know how would you describe the value of the graph and based on the answers to those questions we prioritize folks that really understand you know what the graph is and we're aligned with the mission and wanted to contribute and and we prioritize them for the first phase where they had a guaranteed allocation it was small allocations of a thousand to five thousand dollars but that way we were able to get 45 000 individuals in it was kind of this anti-sybil and these are people that are all really like aligned with the mission of the graph um so i thought that that design works really well for for distribution how did you go through 45 000 people who had to do that job oh sorry four thousand five hundred oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah four thousand five hundred uh there were twenty thousand applications um so uh so so not not everybody was able to to get in the second phase sold out in 10 minutes um but yeah all the transactions were from the first few seconds um that sounds like that's a pretty cool yeah go ahead go ahead yeah just so you know it it was very hands-on and it was a lot of work from our business team to kind of help coordinate but really our our general approach which i think was kind of unique is um you know we want to uh we wanted to reward real contributions right people that understood you know what the protocol is trying to accomplish and or actually contributing in in some way and there's lots of different ways to contribute to a protocol but you know that kind of a system where we're basically the initial team is playing a pretty active role in the beginning you know using maybe some amounts of judgment even you know uh which which may be a subjective but i actually think that you know some amount of judgment in the early days is i think a lot better than kind of like bla blanket you know systematic lack of judgment um and and i think it it does allow the community members that are really active to be recognized and rewarded and i think has been a big part in allowing us to actually build like a really um you know kind of die-hard community i i totally agree i think the surgical use of token distribution especially at genesis if any other time specifically during genesis the surgical use of the token distribution i think just makes the most sense because it's that's the first impression of the protocol right like you need to incent the right people at the very beginning most of all and so i think top-down choice around around the token distribution at genesis i think makes a ton of sense to bootstrapping the right community what about what about the remaining supply of tokens are there are there like vcs uh vc investors or there are their team allocations like where are the bulk of the tokens laying yeah so um i believe it's somewhere around a third was for the initial kind of staff supporters so you know um we uh took in first capital uh in uh 2018 and it was you know two to three years of development to even you know bring the protocol to market so that was uh funded through pre-sales of the token um the uh initial team members have an allocation um edge and node has an allocation so that's now the initial team uh is uh has this new entity edge node um and we've got some some announcements we're going to be making about our participation in the ecosystem so uh stay tuned for that um the the graph foundation has the largest kind of uh you know remaining portion there it's about 20 is for the foundation to be distributed via grants and hopefully eventually a dow um so uh the grant applications i believe for the first wave just closed but we got just a ton of uh really great quality submissions for folks that want to contribute to the network you know either development or you know community building lots of different ways for people to contribute um so um the graph foundation which is uh uh led up by eva baylen is going through those submissions and uh and we're gonna start you know distributing grants and those those are uh the big buckets fantastic let's talk about the the future roadmap for the graph what you guys have on the horizon and by the way people watching on the youtube a thanks for being here b last chance to get your questions in for yanis before we sign off uh yaniv before those questions come in maybe you can talk to us about the future road map of the graph like where is the next you know six 12 18 months of development taking us and what are you guys trying to roll out in that time yeah so you know first thing on our mind is um you know the tr the full transition over the to the decentralized network um you know as of the end of last year we were processing 10 billion queries per month on our hosted service and um and now we're kind of transitioning uh you know over to the decentralized network so we're going to be launching a graph gateway which makes it really easy for developers to publish their subgraphs to the decentralized network and pay query fees in grt for those subgraphs and there's also going to be a new graph explorer for people to browse and discover you know the the the mainnet subgraphs um that's going to be what creates the full kind of self-service experience for developers to to really get running on the network and so there's going to be this kind of migration process from the hosted service to the decentralized network um we're also going to be expanding multi-chain that's going to be a community effort working with a lot of people um you know in in the community to actually bring that to fruition um so excited for that kind of expansion and then uh generally you know in 2021 we really want to be focused on you know building out that uh web 3 stack and really getting it to a point where there's a really cohesive platform that's super easy for developers to build on and that gives you all of the properties that we want from decentralization um so that's that's going to be the focus for the rest of the year can we talk about this because i think you've got a good take on this you need to is what about the road map for this whole thing that we're calling open finance or end or web 3 okay so it seems like we have some of the building blocks here so uh bitcoin started as sort of a store of value we've got that thing uh that primitive we've got ethereum we've got ether which we'd argue is also sort of a a store of value and all of these these money legos on top of ethereum so it feels like we have this d5 set of primitives we almost have like decentralized banking and money for the the space then we've got the graph which is a decentralized indexer then we have things like um ipfs and filecoin which are doing decentralized storage what other pieces do we need if you're looking at the high level road road map for this whole decentralized stack what else is missing yeah all of the pieces are being worked on and there's a few questions about kind of how they integrate together ones maybe that weren't in that list that i would add are identity and reputation i think are really key primitives [Music] you know obviously things like layer two scalability but there's i i think the web3 stack is gonna be about you know 20 protocols some that are doing the same kinds of things and you can choose you know do i want to use saya or filecoin or you know for storage or you know there's some duplication there but ultimately i think you know it's going to be around a dozen to 20 protocols you know some a few different like kind of components and then they kind of need to be stitched together and i think you know we're basically still at the phase right now where we're just kind of assembling these lego blocks um i think we also need like design patterns so like staking a delegation for example i think is a fairly mature as a design pattern you know um you know the way that we use it in the graph for example like it it works really well and there are enough protocols that do staking where we kind of like understand the design space you know governance you know is you know the like the compound governance contracts have emerged as a bit of a standard but there there's still you know different kind of templates and design patterns that we need to come up with that makes it real you know really easy to build new protocols and ultimately i think that uh we'll get to a point where you know to build a protocol you know you'll ask yourself you know a few sets of questions and you'll kind of pull from the the right kind of building blocks to kind of like assemble here's how the protocol is generally going to be orchestrated there might be things that you need to customize but um but the design patterns those lego blocks will be well established and uh and and once we get to that point i think we can go from having you know maybe like a dozen or two dozen like well thought out protocols to having like tens of thousands of protocols and ultimately i think that's going to be the next wave that we enter where we actually start to decentralize everything you know we start using these tools to build protocols for every part of the economy all of that is going to be organized on the graph people will be able to build decentralized applications on top of that but we go from you know basically being in the lab tinkering around with toys to actually just rewiring how society is organized and uh i think it's going to come out as fast that's pretty cool i got one final question from the youtube i want to ask are there any other graph competitors out there who else is trying to serve the same sort of purpose well the the main kind of thing that we compete against is teams building their own centralized indexing and you know i think because uh you kind of couldn't really build fully decentralized applications over the last several years it's kind of become acceptable that teams say like you know what we're going to have to run a server anyways let's have the server do more and more stuff and you know it it it's it's challenging because in the short term maybe nobody's calling them on it but but they're kind of building themselves into a corner because ultimately we are going to move to a world where like you just don't want teams to run servers and it's going to be kind of like a you know a red flag if some application that you're using requires like a team to run as a custom server and so the sooner we get to a point where uh teams are building their protocols and their dapps on purely on open protocols um you know the sooner we can you know get to the future yeah you need do they have do you have any metrics for us about like how used the graph is like queries per day or queries per minute or something is that a what's the right metric to uh evaluate how used to the graph is being yeah the latest metric that we had was 10 billion queries a month that was on our hosted service which we're in the process now of transitioning over to the decentralized network also number of subgraphs is a big one that we track i believe that the latest is 7 000 sub graphs deployed to the hosted service um we have hidden sub graphs that don't show up in the explorer and we count that in that figure so seven thousand uh sub graphs uh published and we also attract kind of number of developers which are you know in the the many thousands okay so with queries per month and number of subgraphs where are your end of 2021 goals oh yeah um i actually don't have a goal for this for 2021 because i think that the nature of the transition to the decentralized network is is going to be potentially a bit of a discontinuity so really what i'm kind of focused on whenever we do something new at the beginning we're focused on much more qualitative sorts of measures so like you know is the the query market developing in a healthy way are the indexers happy with the way they're able to set their prices are the consumers happy with how the prices are working out you know how how can we lower the friction of kind of migrating over and just like educating people on what it means to actually be running on this like decentralized infrastructure so you know for this year i think we're going to be focused on a lot more of those kind of like qualitative sorts of uh uh metrics 2021 is the year of decentralization for the graph uh yaniv thanks so much for joining us on this bankless ama it's been a pleasure i know the community benefited a tremendous amount from your insight and thanks for building what you have built in this protocol thanks guys really enjoyed the conversation guys if we were doing a regular podcast i think uh we might want to subtitle this your parent your kid your kids will be working for protocols because there are so many different work opportunities out there david and i we talk about all the time that we actually work for protocols ourselves um and there are opportunities to get plugged into the graph we will include a link to our tactic on how to become a curator delegator and indexer on the graph in the show notes of this video in this podcast guys this has been a bankless community ask me anything of course none of this has been financial advice there are risks out there you could lose what you put in d5 is the frontier but thanks for joining us this has been an episode of bankless and if you are still watching on the youtube thanks for being here make sure to like and subscribe the video and stay tuned to the bankless channel for future amas like this one and we're done boom we're off here awesome thanks guys that was killer uh yeah that's gonna be that's hot a lot of fun okay so that video i'm actually gonna pull down that video do a little bit of editing and re-upload it and then the podcast is gonna come out shortly there after that sounds good yeah i really appreciate uh where you guys took the conversation i think we were able to cover some background i learned yeah it's awesome for sure yeah so did i we we learned the most from these
