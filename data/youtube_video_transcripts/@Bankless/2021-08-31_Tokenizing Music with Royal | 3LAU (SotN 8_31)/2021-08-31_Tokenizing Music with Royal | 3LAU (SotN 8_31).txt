hey guys welcome to another episode of state of the nation this is our opportunity to go over something big that is happening in crypto david i'm super excited about the conversation today we have justin blau dj producer artist influencer we are talking about the concept of tokenizing music we had justin on in march uh he said he was going to do this he said he was going to find a way to tokenize music and add cash flows to um to music ownership now he has so that is going to be the conversation today uh david i'm excited about this one man there's so much to unearth in this conversation the concept of music as an asset class i think like blows people's brains so that's really something i want to get into with stress in here but also the conversation of like what happens when the community behind an artist becomes becomes an equal part of the value creation of artistic expression those are really the two things i see unlocking with uh with what justin has released with his royal platform which allows artists to tokenize music uh such a cool unlock for humanity uh and i'm really bullish on the concept at large david i gotta ask you the question man what's the state of the nation today just because we always ask that question state of the nation is vibing music revive uh there's this nft jpeg mania going on which everyone is kind of vibing on uh we got tokenized music coming so tokenized vibes uh overall state of the nation is vibing i'm feeling that vibe uh guys a couple quick shout outs before we get in go check out our friends at tracer dao they have just linked they've just released what they call a light paper this is a d5 perpetuals product gonna be super cool you can get involved in the tracer dao protocol as well link in the show notes also quick public service announcement right after this conversation with justin blau david and i and michael wong from our team we're gonna be hanging out in twitter spaces so this is the first time we've done this we've messed around with clubhouse in the past before but if you're watching this live come head to twitter spaces after the show there's a link in the show notes we'll also put it in the chat channel for you guys to join us we'll talk about tokenizing music maybe we'll talk about the nft craze talk about basically anything that you want in the bankless community anything that's going on in crypto and uh just have some fun a little bit after the show david i think that's all we got man should we get in the sponsors and then to justin blau absolutely and here we go when you shop for plane tickets you probably awesome this is cool man real like congrats on the round congrats on everything justin it's been a wild uh wild four months but it's been awesome like that yeah i don't want to ask you too many questions right now because i want to save that so just a pent-up energy fred pushed me to do it that's the answer i got i got a call with credit and he was like i'll i'll say it i mean i'll say it in the uh yeah don't ask any more questions david we gotta save it so this is like just where you directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets arbitrarum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrarily can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.org to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrome arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarium so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord hey guys we have artist dj justin blau on the podcast you probably remember justin from our episode with him in march uh coming out of that episode he just had the biggest nft sale ever it's like 12 million dollars for his ultraviolet album he said he told us at the time he was working on the next big thing in tokenized music and nfts and that is a way to tokenize music rights provide that to fans provide a cash flow to fans for those music rights uh he said he'd come back and tell us more about it i think he's been pretty busy for the last four months or so working on that and so he's back that means there's good news that means we have more stuff to talk about justin blau welcome back to bankless man how you how you been always good to be here i'm a little bit under the weather so forgive me if my energy level is a bit low but when it comes to nfts and music tokenization my uh my energy levels rise no matter what so here we are really stoked to tell you guys what i've been working on let's start there then what have you been working on the past few months where we left things off uh you were hyped on tokenized music but there wasn't quite a solution out there to give access to fans to the cash flows the the rights the royalty rights for that music what's what progress have you made since then what are you guys rolling out yeah so i guess the best way to start is you know the way that nfts introduce this new concept of digital ownership right there are all these media files on the internet now you can own them when it comes to something visual whether it's video or image it's pretty tangible right like you being the official authenticated owner of this specific image is something that most people understand in the regular art world but what does it mean to really own a song that was the question that i was kind of striving to really figure out over time and my conclusion was well if the fans actually owned a piece of the song then that nft would be a lot more meaningful than just owning a collectible song right just something that is scarce and an audiophile so in my mind everyone's always wanted to bet on their favorite artists early on especially in music right everyone loves sharing their music tastes talking about the artists they found before they blew up before they sold out whatever it might be and there's something really special in that and and that's kind of how all music was distributed for the past you know many centuries of time right back in the classical era with mozart to bands like led zeppelin reputation and word of mouth is how popularity spread there was no internet right fast forward to now where you have an algorithm that kind of determines what's popular and what isn't it's kind of hard to distinguish how much the app the fan is really you know benefiting from how much influence they have with the algorithm repeating a song sharing it with their friends all these activities are happening but ultimately the fan is responsible for the popularity of an artist not the distributor not the record label no one it's the fan the fan who shares the music right so all these fans are contributing all this value to an artist's success not participating in it whatsoever on the one hand on the other hand the artist can't even identify who any of their biggest fans are because platforms don't share the data so i kind of have always envisioned this world where if i can at least identify who my biggest supporters are i can engage them to spread the word about new music and to also hopefully win with me as those songs succeed so the concept behind royal my new project is why not give fans the ability to participate in the upside of an artist's success and how do you do that leveraging nft technology leveraging you know distributed ledger technology as a whole when it comes to distributing cash flows between lots of different people right so there have been a lot of people that have spoken about you know just bringing all of rights management to the blockchain which we all know it's really hard to bridge the legacy world and the in the distributed world it's just very very difficult to do do that in one fell swoop so what we're doing at royal is is really just starting small and giving fans the ability to co-own music with their favorite artists with a new type of nft that we're kind of pioneering so let's go into that a little bit more what does it mean to co-own music you've talked about like the historical association but like when an a fan just goes to royal and they you know look up their favorite artists and they purchase a token what does that unlock for them what do they get what's the product so when you buy a song on itunes or before spotify existed let's start let's like take a quick step back and then a step forward um you're really just buying a license to listen to something you don't own the song you don't own any rights really to the song just the ability to listen same is true with spotify when you pay for a membership right um but music has two types of rights associated with it they have you know publishing rights and master recording rights um publishing rights is the actual like writing of the song the notes in sequence the lyrics all that stuff and the master recording is the actual recording of the instruments the digital audio whatever that might be and what we're doing at royal is you know typically with the master recording that's what a label will a record label traditionally owns right so the record label will give an artist an offer and they'll say hey um we're gonna give you a hundred thousand dollars today but we're gonna own eighty percent of your master recordings your mass recording rights on this album forever and the artist will say okay because a hundred thousand dollars is a huge deal to them um in many ways labels have acted as predatory you know basically venture funds for artists that's kind of what labels are but they also promise other types of services like a r services you know finding finding vocalists helping artists complete songs with different services marketing etc what does it mean to own a piece of a song for a fan the master recording let's say the master recording represents 100 percent or sorry the artist owns at the start 100 of the rights in that song before they sign to a record label before they do a deal with a distributor and so on and so forth um what we're doing is we're just saying hey what happens if we treat fans as collaborators and give them you know you know they buy this autographed edition of the song an official edition of the song and in turn they're a collaborator in the song and they own 50 you know 50 basis points of the master recording right and as royalties accrue to that song from spotify apple music anything associated with the master recording and that's a separate you know it could be stream only it could be full master recording which would include syncs it's kind of totally up to the artist to decide you know what they want to give their fans but let's just assume it streams for a second you know every million streams on spotify represents anywhere between three and six thousand dollars um so if a song gets really really popular and you own 50 basis points in that song forever you'd accrue real cash flows to owning that song and in many ways the money that those fans might pay up front to the artist would probably be a way better deal than what record labels are offering so we're trying to create a product that makes the playing field a lot more even for artists and also gives fans an opportunity to be more incentivized to you know really augment the popularity of a song because previously they would just share a song you know fans and listeners would just share a something if they like it now if they actually own a piece of it how much harder are they going to go to support that artist and just like everything else in the crypto ecosystem aligning incentives is the key to a successful you know ecosystem in general right so this is just a new way of aligning incentives between artists and listeners so i i love the value proposition for like uh for fans and listeners right i could totally see this taking off in an absolutely massive way um but i you know i haven't worked through like putting myself in the in the shoes of an artist say so the traditional route is you go to a record label and you know think of that as kind of a vc firm the vis the record label gives the artist money provides a set of services takes a cut maybe a a larger cut from the process so that's like the the old world model what about raising funds and distributing via you know fans is better for the artist right do you lose anything that the record label would provide maybe the record label has distribution so you have connections that you know the fans don't have sure yeah absolutely so i've been an independent artist for most of my career so i've run my own record label um it depends on the type of artist that you are if you want to be a pop star and you're not a pop star yet probably need a record label right if you have had some songs that have gone viral on tik tok you probably don't need a record label um to succeed it just depends on the size of an artist you want to be um i will say that we can also work with record labels this is not an exclusive or mutually exclusive situation where you could be signed to a label but still give fans a portion of whatever you maintain after you sign that deal right and now you just have an army of fans that are supporting you so there's kind of an infinite number of combinations but we definitely don't seek to replace the entire ecosystem that we think that might be a natural progression um we think in the short term there's going to be a lot of hybrid hybrid situations for artists well what i'm curious about is does this even for record labels provide kind of some additional liquidity potentially that they couldn't get elsewhere you know through through the fact they're based on they're not like to be to be completely honest no um okay most record deals are like for a tick tock star who comes out with a song that's viral a lot of the time the record label will pledge 10k to take 80 of that song and that song will probably generate that 10k back in like four months the artist just gets really excited by the money because they've never seen it before they don't know that you know the song actually will generate income from streaming and they just sign the dotted line that's like a typical situation um so i wouldn't say that there is more liquidity necessarily although like record labels like overall there's a lot of liquidity from the record label ecosystem there are also a lot of you know let's forget listeners and fans i as an artist would invest in other artists i can't do sharing right so there's a [ __ ] ton of liquidity in regular worlds both crypto world and just you know lots of you know successful young people that want to earn income on their capital music is an asset class that only private equity and hedge funds and record labels have even had access to right so a big part of royal is democratizing access to music as an asset class when you step back and look at it and zoom out it's kind of weird that you can't invest in in an artist like you can't invest in and this has been kind of the pattern right like for everything it's kind of weird that it was really hard it's really hard to invest in crypto for a very long time it was hard a lot of barriers to entry it was really hard for a regular person to buy stocks robin hood made it a lot easier right like access to certain types of asset classes has has been a huge wave where you have all this new technology that's just making it easier for the public to get access to these things and music and not even just music but this of course extends to all creative content it's just something that people haven't been able to invest in yet has been producing enormous cash flows and by the way has only been doing so for a short period of time like streaming cash flows have only been around i mean five to ten years at best in terms of like real income my income in 2015 or my income in 2021 from streaming is 50 plus x what it was in 2015. right granted i came out with a lot of new songs in between then but even like the one so like a couple of the songs if we just excluded all the new stuff it would probably still be 3040x because of streaming and there's this misconception in the public narrative that like streaming services don't pay artists everyone's heard that before artists don't get paid artists don't get paid no no they do it's just there's someone in the middle taking a giant cut before they do that's that's what's really happening and um so we just need to kind of rebalance that and we that we see this pattern in crypto all the time that is the crypto pattern let's take a central intermediary and let's give that rights to the people to the community that care about the relevant you know asset that that is represented right and so uh the this is just fits into line with all the other patterns that we've seen in this industry before let's take a middleman let's automate that away let's integrate a sort of you know digital asset on ethereum and then let's democratize access to for to the people that want it the most which is the market right and so it's it's taki it's unleashing uh an entire marketplace that was previously cornered or captured by record labels uh is all of these characters uh characterizations correct yeah no 100 and that's not to say record labels will always be around they do add value in certain ways it's just there's no competitors right so record labels you know if royal is successful record labels will just be forced to be more competitive in their deal structures um there are a lot of artists that do need the marketing services of labels there are artists that do need you know the production and music specific services from record labels there are also a lot of artists that don't need them at all me being one of them right um you know i have worked with some great like record labels that i've done a lot for my music and i and i love those labels um but a lot of those deals are more fair than a typical label deal because i'm involved in the negotiation right um the problem is that a lot of artists just don't even know their own worth and what i think the nft movement has really produced is it's shown creatives that they are worth something that all the advertising revenue that platforms have been generating off their backs um means they're worth something and they're starting to see it and really take control the other the other common theme that i'm saying with this is that in crypto the ability to exit is such an important uh right that makes a lot of game theory about crypto things uh alive like the ability to exit out of a system if that system is punishing you and you you can just say well i'm gonna leave that's a a game theoretically uh sound property that we see in crypto all the time and so now what i'm seeing with royal is royal is offering this platform that allows artists to maybe after they get the name from a name for themselves you talked about how you don't really think that uh maybe up and coming artists that haven't really established a brand or community for themselves maybe this isn't the right product for them but as soon as they do they can move and migrate their community and their attention to royal and quote-unquote exit from a cornered market and allow a much more expression of value by the community directly to the the creator and so the the relationship is established between community and and creator and allows the community to rally behind something and also like i said allows the artist to opt into a different form of financialization for themselves exactly and it's worth mentioning in the short term with royal the products that are going to be available are finished products it's like a very important distinction um you as an artist won't be able to come on royal and raise money for your next album right um that's not something that we can do yet there's and that's what record labels can do correct sorry and that's what record labels can do right that's kind of a perk of a record label okay well and by the way we can do that it just requires a slightly different setup that's going to take us a little bit longer to build um from a compliance standpoint um but from a from from a pretty simple standpoint if a song is complete and either about to come out or out there's no reason why other people can't own a piece of it and we're going to be doing some really cool things with all my existing nfts as well where i'm definitely going to be doing some retro retroactive rewards for all my existing holders and you know for specific songs and whatnot and we'll hopefully be announcing that in the next couple weeks hey can i ask you wow like why has no one done this before or another way to access yeah so like what unique problems you guys have to solve like is it you mentioned compliance already is it all compliance is it technology so there's there's kind of yeah i mean a lot of the problems i don't want to dive too deep into on on a public podcast right but but i think that there's there's the actual scalability of the tech if mainnet is going to be really hard to scale this on each main net for lots of artists and lots of fans right like it's inevitable so l2 kind of feels like it's a necessity especially when it comes to distributing cash flows on a regular basis the cost of that right to lots of different addresses um some l2 or or evm compatible blockchain is probably a better choice as this scales like just impos [ __ ] you can only mint like what is it like 33 nfts per block it's something like that or otherwise you use up the block ass limit so it's like you know almost impossible to think about like royalty distribution at scale on main net anytime soon so that's like a big technological challenge that we're definitely overcoming but um there's a lot of like smart contract architecture that needed to be built um that also needs to be secure to make this all work on chain um and then of course there needs to be a bridge from the off chain world to get all this money that's being generated by streaming services and bringing that on chain that's a whole other that's another piece of it right um but the biggest challenge is definitely regulatory i mean we've seen what's happening in in in congress and and how much you know debate there is surrounding like the infrastructure bill and all this stuff right and so the uncertainty there um requires us to be extra diligent and work with true experts on on the on the legal side which we've been doing for the past four months and we wouldn't have set forth on this journey would we have thought we couldn't do this right we definitely know it's possible it just requires a lot of meticulous planning and and carefulness and you know i think that's our biggest challenge just like writing that line well is that a challenge in the u.s primarily wow or is it like are you guys looking at roles it's everywhere it's not it's not the same kind of challenges as a token sale challenge it's quite it's quite a bit different there's like there's a lot of variables there that we don't need to dive into but that i'd rather not i didn't do on this on the podcast but um we are working with like incredible experts on it and and i think that you know the reality is um songs today you can you can buy trade and own ownership in songs with a lot of services off-chain today anyone can go do that right so bringing it on chain shouldn't really trigger anything we just have to make sure we're doing all that perfectly so what what parts of like this this legal restriction has actually like limited the scope of what uh royal can do like if you guys were able to like take off the leash like what could you do if you could use your imagination um the number one thing that we want to do and we still think we can do in the future is have an artist you know a promising new artist raise money to complete a future album um which by definition is definitely you know has to require certain compliance mechanisms um and we want to we want to enable that but just like just like anything else um you know there are lots of things that are securities at one point that aren't later there are lots of things that aren't securities that become securities right it's just a matter of what the disclosures are what the marketing efforts are and stuff like that so we're keeping these really really simple at first and making sure we're doing everything crossing eyes dining or crossing t's dotting eyes and all that um but the reality is it's it's it's a gray area no one really has answers um we've spoken to everyone literally everyone and no one has answers so um you know it's it's gonna be fun it's gonna be challenging but to your question ryan it's you know why hasn't someone else done this before um it's just hard getting getting artist traction getting getting a lot of uh you know people to believe in this future is difficult um but now is the time this is definitely the best time can i ask about traction um wow so like i'm just wondering how the um the more gen it felt like in 2021 crypto has for the first time maybe started to enter more mainstream consciousness for something other than bitcoin right like nfts made saturday night live you know in q1 right um and now we're in in the thick of an nft mania where millions of dollars are being made artists are connecting directly with fans and i'm wondering if this makes the conversation with the artists you talk to easier or does it make it harder are they now able to see the vision of what you're talking about in a bigger way yeah so like what are the con tell us about some of the comments four years ago four years ago i would talk about this stuff there's there's still this video of me talking about nfts on fox business news from 2018. and i i will cherish that video clip forever when i start talking about nfts and the anchor the anchor is just like ah that sounds interesting and then moves on um but back then it was really hard to get people to understand now inevitably you know speculation and financial explosion excites people gets them to dive a little bit deeper in the technology and then they actually begin to understand the potential and that's where we are in the cycle where every major musician has been thinking about an nft strategy they want to do it the right there are a lot of people that we're talking to that don't want to just release collectibles they want to do it the right way they want to do it a special way right just releasing a collectible song isn't interesting enough the same way just releasing a collectible visual kind of works in that old world right you take you take some of these projects like you know board api club or or any of the larva labs projects where there's this strong emphasis on community it's really hard to do that with just audio right and that's one of the biggest goals for royal is how do we build a community around ownership of music which is one of the biggest cultural objects cultural force forces that has existed in like humanity right music is a cultural force so you know now all these artists are really starting to see that this is the future some are being hasty just going going through the front door and trying to sell stuff for a stupid amount of money and others are taking a lot more time to think about how how do we reward the people who have supported us and those are the artists that i think will succeed in the space do you think of when you're talking to artists about this and these types of conversations as royal in the whole concept of tokenizing their music is that sort of one tool in the tool belt of how they might approach building their digital community are there other things as well that accompany this right so like the idea of social tokens for example or the idea of art centered nfts i'm a little bit of a geriatric on on social tokens i think that there's there's a lot of power in a fundable social token a lot of that power hasn't been unlocked yet i think board apes have shown that being a part of a of a larger community of non-fungible holders operates in a lot of the same ways a social token might operate um you know it's just a technical distinction and a functional distinction um i do think that there are places for fungible tokens within non-fundable ecosystems like imagine owning an nft that has uh consumable fungible tokens associated with it so you know if you own this you can redeem an aspect of it up to five times a year or something like that right like there's there and then you could even trade those fungible tokens that maybe you get alongside an nft purchase kind of the way that hash masks did it with the name change tokens and the nfts right like there's there's inevitably going to be a a whole ecosystem built around this stuff and ultimately it's up to the like it's not up to me to say what works and what doesn't work it's up to the creator right it's up to the creator to figure out how they want to structure their own ecosystem and we just want royal to be one of those tools um you know it's not going to be like royal token royal is not going to be a social token platform right uh i can i can be very explicit in saying that um it's going to very specifically be a way for people to collect and own music and share ownership of that music with artists that being said you know we hope that artists that want to kind of take the next step with social tokens with that you know with dows like we would we would love to see a world where um an individual owns a lot of songs on royal and then creates a dow surrounding that ownership like why not we'd love to see something like that happen um we may even support some of that functionality in the future um but you know i i i've always loved the idea of like a dao for music taste right like you just have this dow collect a bunch of amazing ownership and different songs and that's probably really expensive for one person to own right and that's really powerful but we have to be very mindful of what we do as royal and what we want our users to do and to build off of post you know their first purchase on royal i do think a blab down could do quite well wow dao oh my god what a name justin i actually think that like we have a lot of like you know big imaginations in the space and we have all these different like classifications of tokens uh i actually think uh social tokens are kind of really any sort of token that helps uh bring a community together right and so to some to some degree like if there is a bunch of like blou music tokens and they're all distributing royalties to all the listeners and as a result of that all of these like uh like-minded people all show up in the same discord and talk about all their blou then it's a social token right totally it's more of just like an emergent property of what happens when communities arrive and so there's two points of conversation that i tease in the beginning and i want to get to uh and those are the the changing relationship between fans and artists as a result of the instantiation of a token as well as the concept of like trading musics music like trading music genres like going long rock and roll and going short on country i've always wanted to short country music um and so i want to get to those conversations and i cannot and i don't want to interrupt that conversation when we have it so i'm going to interrupt this conversation right now with our second round of sponsors so we can have a more seamless conversation in just a second so here we go living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control d5 never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dals have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the una swap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uni swap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless alright guys we are back with justin blau for the second half of this conversation which i think we're going to open up our imaginations and look into the future into a world where royal is maximally successful there's tons of tokens everywhere there's tons of artists who are tokenizing their songs and i want to start this conversation with how this changes the relationship between an artist's community and the artist themselves and i have this section titled it takes two to tango because previously we would have the artist you know make the value and then we would have the fan base consume that value and be like yay and then follow you on twitter and that would be the end of the relationship right now we actually have a vehicle which is the token for the fans to do their own thing with the token and actually return value back into the ecosystem so now it's no longer artists on the stage with fans in the crowd but it's artists on stage with the fans on their own stage because they have this empowerment of a token so they're gonna use that the fans on the stage fans have their own stage i'm using that it's good it's really good no that's why you come on a bank list so we can we can help spin memes uh and so like justin when you imagine this in the future like how does the actualization of a community around the fan or around the artist change music and music culture so the number one reason why i'm personally insanely excited about what we're doing at royal is the difference but in my life and my relationship with my community how just issuing regular nfts i shouldn't say regular audio visual entities since last year has completely changed my relationship with the group of people that have collected and purchased them right in a way that i've never had a relationship with my fans before i can post to social media but it's very much a one-way street of just like hey here's what i'm doing and fans being like oh that's cool now i have a discord community with thousands of people that i talked to on a daily basis and i wouldn't have even stumbled upon that had i not started issuing a you know nfts and building a community surrounding that ownership right so when you when you start to scale that every artist has time to talk to the people that listen to their music maybe not everyone but definitely the people who are their biggest supporters and artists definitely have time to reward those biggest supporters and those biggest supporters are the most powerful distributors more than anything else like the people that go around and tell you know share a new song with all their friends that has an insane domino ripple effect across all other potential listeners and fans of that artist but the incentives just haven't been there right they're not on a stage they're in the crowd they're one of the crowd now when you when you kind of gamify fandom and and that's like maybe an extreme way of saying it i i hate the word fan because um it's kind of demeaning i much prefer the word like supporter or listener right um if you give supporters and listeners the ability to achieve success by supporting you it just creates this symbiosis that hasn't existed in the creative content world ever right and so what what does this mean for the future i mean i think people will have portfolios of songs the way they have portfolios of stocks you know the way they have portfolios of sneakers and trading cards today right like the behavior is innate in in humans right we love to collect things but what does it mean to collect music well it used to mean collecting vinyls and cds now it's a playlist but it doesn't feel like you own it the same way you actually own the trading card or you own the sneaker or you own the cryptocurrency right so what royal seeks to do is it seeks to redefine the definition of music ownership where there is a certain percentage of a song that is owned typically just by an artist and record label we want to expand that ownership to everyone and it's as simple as that and then what happens all the different mechanics that we're talking about yeah and you talked about like with the changing role of the community as like you know the supporters and the distributors well that was previously the role of the record labels right and so like the same role exists like that still is a necessary part of the music creation and process but now that responsibility is in the hands of the community which those in that community is self-selected right like if you're an artist you have to go to a record label like hey please sign me or you also alternately have a community who's like hey we will distribute for you and so you are actually like finding the people that are most aligned with your music to do your labor for you and once again the fundamental pattern of all things crypto or just the world at large is like finding alignment and allowing and creating technologies to create that alignment yeah and these things can co-exist right like record labels are still necessary for a lot of different types of artists but there are also a lot of artists that do everything themselves myself included like you know i come up with our own marketing plans with music video treatments with all that stuff right and there are a lot of those out there um and so it's just it's just providing another tool in the tool kit for everyone i'm gonna turn the conversation to the changing role of a taste maker when it comes to music there's people out there perhaps people that are professional music consumers who and they're also like cultural people that just kind of dictate uh i mean people listen to to like you know what what is good music what is good food there are these taste makers of these of the worlds out there that actually like you know their kind of role in responsibility is to you know pick taste and tell society like hey like we like this thing now uh how does how does the the role of tastemaker change uh when we have a royal enabled world taste makers are now rewarded for actually having good taste that's that's that's what i think is so powerful music and even djing is all about taste it's about even making a song requires taste to combine all these different sounds into a final package that someone else might like at the end of the day maybe they don't like it maybe they do but being a taste maker is is a very big part of what's happening in the nft ecosystem right and there's no reason why that shouldn't happen in other creative fields outside of just visuals right like the nft space is is very visual oriented and gaming oriented those two sectors like art and gaming have taken off in in massive ways you've crazy success with axi you know crazy success with projects like board apes you know artists like people slime sundae um music has yet to kind of take off because because it hasn't really been defined as a part of the ecosystem so you know we hope to kind of create that standard that the community respects and likes and once that standard is kind of established the you know musicians can start to take advantage of the technology as well and there have been a lot of frustrated musicians who are like i want to get into nfts but i don't know how because all i can do is pair up with a visual artist and put a song behind this thing and i'm like just wait a little bit we'll have the right tools for you that you know highlight the music itself i think that's really important the instantiation of fundamentals as good music behind these tokens i think is really really important like in the nft world or the the you know the jpeg nft world people jokes like the fundamentals behind these things are like are they cute or not or like do they look good or not and now and now we actually get to instantiate like does this music sound good and if it does the token will go up in value right like unlocking that is i think the cool thing about it is going to direct humanity towards good music faster than we've ever been able to go to before because we've unleashed the power of markets behind these things ah exactly the same way prediction markets have have been really great predictors um people put their money behind their beliefs there hasn't really been a way to do that at all in in the creative space in music specifically i think it'll also be the case that we'll get all sorts of new music and all sorts of artists into the space who previously haven't been able to enter it and i'm curious blau if you think like let's let's let's uh fast forward let's say royal is successful and it's not just royal but like an entire um defy music tokenized music industry is birthed off the back of what what some of you guys are are doing as yeah standard bears so what does this world look like is there some kind of uh like web interface defy interface where we have like a nasdaq for music and as david was saying you could collateralize music ownership you could you could collateralize music ownership you can value that collateral way better than valuing like just a visual nft right because there is a cash flow and so establishing like because there is a cash flow and there's a way to estimate those cash flows i mean there's there's there's an entire market surrounding creative assets that like i said before hedge funds and pe shops have had access to and hedge funds and pe shops view these assets as like inflation protected cash flow producing assets the same way they used to be real estate like multi-family commercial you know these are just and these assets are new because they haven't been cash flow producing because we've only been paying for some streaming subscription memberships for less than a decade right like it hasn't been that long since since these kinds of cash flows have even existed so yes i mean outside of royal there's going to be inevitably in the next two decades an entire ecosystem like an entire financial on-chain ecosystem for creative assets and we just know that that's inevitable and part of the reason why i started royal knowing that it was going to be a huge challenge because it's definitely the time to start it right now but it is still a little bit early at the same time right there's mass attention towards nfts but the tech isn't 100 scalable in there yet right um the big reason why i wanted to start royal was because um i was i was speaking to one of our one of our lead investors at paradigm fred heirzem and he asked he was like if somebody else does this will you regret it yeah i would if i wasn't the one to do this and someone else did i would regret it for the rest of my life and that's when i knew that i had to take the deep dive and take on the challenge because it is a challenge we have a team of 10 people that have been working non-stop to build this thing and you know it started out with just jd and i in the first month and jd is one of my best friends from college he started a company called opendoor that's now a 10 billion dollar publicly traded company um and you know one of the founders on open door with keith who's one of our investors so all like within the family all friends and you know there's no way i could accomplish this without like without without gd um who has so much experience building companies and hiring and we've just been on a roll bringing on expert team members from we've got derek dan scott abby and a bunch of new team members coming on and we're just we're just cranking so um you know trying to make this thing happen as fast as possible here's a technical question that i forgot to ask in the first half of the show are these music royal tokens are they um white listed or do they are they permission lists you can like list them on any exchange and any ethereum address can purchase them initially they'll be locked okay um they will be withdrawable for a little bit and then eventually yes they'll be permissionless okay so that section and it's also up to the artist to actually like account to their fans and that's a whole it's a whole other conversation right yeah that doesn't sound very fun we'll leave that for the documentation yeah we're gonna guide that process initially but okay so the the ability for these things to be completely like non-white listed and open is it offers such a compelling like money lego and that's how like music actually comes in and be and as a service is its own like money lego to the rest of defy right because if you have like all of these rock artists then something like um uh the index co-op can make it a rock index right you gotta got a bunch of country artists we won't do that but we won't stop other people from doing that right yeah so that that's actually where i was leading to is like where do you guys see yourself as as like do you guys are you guys just the token issuance entity or are you guys thinking about like facilitating any sort of like financial certainly yeah we definitely don't want to facilitate any sort of financial services in the short term um that's where things get complicated but we know we don't want to stop other people from doing that right um and we we want to support it however we can as long as those activities are legal and reasonable um but yeah why not somebody creates a you know country etf that's backed by real ownership and country songs it's going to be a while before we get there right it's going to be probably years to be completely honest because we're just not going to have the supply of content for that to happen for that to be a really liquid thing um but we will have a lot of supply it's just like how do you really get exposure to the entire world of country music well you kind of need a bun you need a lot right the same way you know that's why it takes that's why it's taking so long for like a bitcoin etf to even get approved right right so you know um there's there's a lot there but but we would love for people to be able to you know bet on the success of genres beyond artists um and this is just step one we have one common theme that we've seen about ethereum is that it tries to suck up all capital that it can if it's if there's capital ethereum wants it uh and i would expect like as soon as there's any meaningful amount of like royal tokens on there like it's these things are going to find their ways into the corners of d5 right they will find their ways into the metaverse index that index will find its way to be collateral inside of applications and all of a sudden like there's going to be this insatiable hunger for more of these tokens and so like the bottleneck is going to come from like how fast um royal can actually like onboard artists and issue tokens do you guys have like a strat what's your guys strategy with that so the first couple months is really just a product roll out we have a bunch of beta tests just making sure it all works right um and then we have a pipeline of people that are interested since we made the announcement we've had a stupid amount of user signups a stupid amount of artist requests and eventually we want to open the platform completely but that's going to take some time it's definitely you know bringing in the cash flow component changes a lot of things right um if we were just tokenizing music itself as collectible music um that would be a totally different story way easier to scale quickly but we really do want to create meaning behind the ownership so do you know the reason i think this is so inevitable blau is because um i can't think of any fan supporter who doesn't want this and i can't think of any artist out there who doesn't want this as an option do you know it's just like that's been the feedback that's been the feedback that's what the market wants right so if you guys can find a way to thread the neil needle from a technology perspective from a compliance perspective then um this just seems so inevitable and yeah you're early but like we very much believe in the tokenization of everything the financialization of everything like we've seen it not just in our lifetimes with like since the time we entered crypto in the last few years how much how like how uh this industry has moved leaps and bounds yeah defy was birthed like i wasn't using ethereum every day now i am right like you're an addict you know like well that's that that's the thing is is yeah that's what's changed is the technology is actually becoming part of the fabric of people's everyday lives whereas before it was very much this is the future now it's it's now in the future right um and it's really exciting yeah this is huge and so we're super excited uh for you i gotta ask you as we as we um start to wrap up here blau i'm curious what you're doing in d5 these days so it's like you're on ethereum every day you messing around with nfts okay keeping it simple [Laughter] but you know just there's a lot of risk i i've dabbled in riskier you know riskier pools a lot in the past but because i'm so focused on royal i've honestly like i've lost a little bit of my pulse on what's happening in like regular nft world because i'm so focused on one thing um still like was around for the mutant nape drop thank you thank you friends tipping me off um but but i'm definitely like so focused on one thing that i've lost a little bit of like what you guys are studying on a daily basis so it's always fun to hear like what are you guys excited about right now what's what's happening in in the back end that that really gets you pumped i know i'm excited about fractional i think fractional is really a really cool project um what are the things you guys are thinking about i'm particularly excited exactly what you just said the intersection between defy and nfts um as we were talking uh paradigm just released a new paper i think which i'm about to go read about perpetuals that are based off of floor prices uh so like you can just basically get leverage against the floor of an nft project so that's pretty cool there's also the i haven't read that i don't know it happened while while we were live i just saw the name your investors are pretty smart yeah your investments are pretty smart they're okay have been uh absolutely insanely helpful and we actually we should probably be uh leveraging them more they're some of the smartest people that i've met in my life we're honored to have them hey if fred airsoft ever wants to come on the show you let him know we got a spot for him you're just texting me a second ago maybe i'll tell him to watch the podcast okay sounds good wow i'm curious about this like just to end this and wrap things up so david and i we are like looking at this uh every day but i feel like we are so immersed in crypto culture that at least for me i don't get a chance to see what mainstream's reaction to it is like what other culture's reaction to crypto is all right how do you think crypto culture is going to impact broader culture as a whole are you seeing it seep into other areas yet yeah this is this is the first time i i think that nfts are the are the instrument of that to be completely honest i have friends asking me how do i buy a squiggle and i'm like here we go like you like i have like i can't afford a punk or an eight but like school will sound cool and most of them are just speculating the same same thing that happened during the ico boom the the difference is here's what i would say is different about the nft explosion and the ico boom the ico boom was purely driven by speculative desire to make money and off the back of ideas that were really promising some of those ideas failed others succeeded with nfts the second you buy something even though your original intention might be speculative you become a part of this like digital identity movement that you just feel so you have this other variable with nfts as compared to the other you know money legos of crypto that is identity based and emotional based and i think that's what's making it stick so hard um if i could if i could explain it um why it's different this time that's not to say that there might not be a giant burst in prices like totally could could happen um but for people like myself you know my crypto punk is worth a lot more than i paid for it but i don't even care like i love my crypto punk paper gains up paper gains down doesn't matter if if that was another i'll be completely honest though like if i as someone who studied finance i don't i don't actively trade i trade over longer periods of time if i had made an investment in something like if i had invested in solana which is obviously performed extremely well i would definitely take gains on that investment right but with an nft you're selling all of it or none of it and that's like hard that's hard to do because it's a part of your identity right and so i think people are buying in and they're holding more than they might a regular cryptocurrency because they actually feel something towards the asset that they own and um i gifted my little brother a mutant ape yesterday and it's worth a lot you don't want to sell it right because it's so cool right and and like people are just starting to get across the bridge they're coming across the moat they're starting to feel and see that it's not right click save world it's social signaling the same way the instagram verification check mark is a social signal owning a crypto punk today i mean jay-z changed his profile picture to a crypto punk visa crypto punk a crypto punk is cooler than a ferrari just saying like it's cooler than a lambo it's cooler than a bugatti it's because your bugatti's in your garage and not everyone in the world is gonna see you driving it all the time but everyone's gonna see your [ __ ] million dollar profile picture so that's the world that we're going to live in an enhanced digital community it's it's inevitable i don't know if uh you know i don't know if we curse on bank list but it's absolutely inevitable um and and and the more you know mainstream culture dips in the more people from the from the outside tech community will come and build a better crypto universe i think that's like what i'm most excited about is there aren't that many engineers like there aren't that many rust engineers there aren't that many solidity devs like relative to all the developers in the world and you have all these people from all walks of life joining the crypto community because they see the potential in fact most of our employees are not crypto native but they're but they like figure it out real quick right now right and and so it's amazing to see to watch you know our our head pm scott who didn't know anything about crypto or maybe knew a little bit about crypto before you know joining royal is now an expert on the benefits of optimistic role of ck roll like he knows everything you know just because he's really smart and i think that i think that's what's so powerful about the movement is it's bringing in the brightest minds to build a better world within the decentralized world and that's that's what's happening now and that's accelerating at rapid speed well said blau we'll uh we'll end it there but so many people i would say are falling down the rabbit hole with nfts as we speak and they're not never coming out this is like a one-way bridge they're in crypto for life uh justin blau thanks for all your work thanks for uh carrying the torch into the tokenizing the music
