i am quite optimistic that we will live in a highly scalable highly decentralized ethereum of the future and it will be based on a lot of the ideas which are being pioneered today we are super excited to be a part of that to be a contributor to be in the conversation and to be you know operating infrastructure that enables us to happen and and we see a huge amount of opportunity moving forward and we certainly hope that others do as well welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless excellent episode for you today we're talking about ethereum's hidden power structures some of the power structures you didn't know existed but that do and how those power structures are going to change post merge this is coming down the pipe really soon and you need to know about it some things to look out for in this episode with matt cutler who guides us through and educates us through these new power structures number one what the power structures in ethereum are today number two how they're going to change post merge number three what this future world will look like is there a future world as matt says where users might actually be paid to use ethereum no gas fees instead ethereum pays you and number four why the value of this new power structure this new economy flows back to eth the asset yep that's right back to eth the asset we talk about all of those things with one of the people who is most educated and most articulate in expressing it david what were your thoughts in this episode going into it in post-merge ethereum eth pays you for gas i thought that was like one of my favorite parts of the show and we really go through how the supply chain of block creation is what that looks like in post-merge ethereum you might think it's simple people add blocks to the blockchain it's not that simple it's not there's way more moving parts and as we go further into ethereum's roadmap they become even more moving parts and matt does a really good job illustrating the supply chain illustrating this how this works but also just talking about this at first principles uh in a first principle's perspective where modularity creates flexibility and as soon as we have flexibility in how ethereum is designed we can start to tinker with how we think that it should be designed and ultimately it's in the ethereum ethos to make sure that the user has the most amount of power and sovereignty and optionality and matt walks us through how this concept of proposer builder separation and mev boost and mev searchers and block proposers and validators how all this modularity ultimately flows back into enabling the individual eats taker and eath the asset and so matt is just a a giga brain of what we call the pre-chain layer aka the mempool and the mempool is this very dark and disorderly and chaotic place where it's not very friendly to individuals but it's really good it's really a scary place this is where the monsters lie that's where the mev lies but what matt is building at block native is helping illuminate the mempool and helping us reason about it and turning the mempool in a place of chaos into a place of order that we can reason about and have a dependable ecosystem and so he just walks us through all of these details and i think it's going to be a really fascinating episode for people that care deeply about the protocol layer or just want to understand how everything flows back to eth at the end of the day either one yeah i do think that the best way that look these are blockchains are economic computers and ethereum is an economic computer and the best way to understand an economic computer is by going through and understanding the motivations of all of the economic agents and there's this new economic agent brand new agent being born post merge called the builder the builder and i absolutely had to understand more about the builder class of economic agent going into this and so matt certainly scratched my itch there i feel like i have a far deeper understanding of all of the economic players in this economic computer and the builder class specifically so stay tuned if you want to listen to all of that we're going to get right into our conversation with matt cutler but first we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish e-staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life across is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution you can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitrarum or boba networks ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode which allows for many more

it and we are bringing to you matt cutler for this episode we're going to talk about power structures in ethereum matt is the ceo and co-founder of block native block native is a team looking at the pre-chain layer of ethereum this thing called the mempool i don't know if you've ever heard about it but what he does with block native is listens to every single transaction that's ever broadcasted for chains like ethereum uses that data to predict the future so it's right down deep into ethereum's uh computer at the firmware layer but what we're going to talk about in this podcast is something that i think affects all of us this is a post-merge topic an ethereum 2.0 topic if uh if if you if i can say that if that's still allowed and we're going to predict the future of ethereum based on the new power structures that will arise in the post merge post proof of stake world this is going to be super important for you to tune in to you so we can predict the future of ethereum and the future of the crypto economy matt cutler how are you doing man i'm doing great it's wonderful to be here thanks for having me can you help us with this topic because there's a lot of pieces here there's a lot of like terminology some of it sounds a little geeky can you break it down for us and layman's speak is is that what you can help with yeah i would love to there are definitely a lot of moving parts there are a lot of abstract concepts but they all come together in some pretty compelling ways and it's a super fun topic to explore okay can we start with this because uh we are merging for a reason we're getting rid of proof of work and going to proof of stake for a reason um but let's kind of start from the beginning because there are some reasons we're doing this there are some flaws in the existing ethereum system that we're trying to correct and by transitioning to proof of stake i feel like maybe some new flaws that we introduce i'm not sure take us take us through this mat sure so i like to frame this up as hey look i've been building internet i've been building companies for a long time and in the 90s the whole world went from being offline to being online the world that we live in today and that required a huge amount of infrastructure build up because the internet in 1995 was no way ready for the type of things we enjoyed today like streaming video and social media and all that sort of jazz right um similarly right now in 2022 we're in the beginnings of this transition from going from an off chain world to an on-chain world and as we look into the future there's just massive demand for scalability throughput data storage and blockchain systems and the existing proof-of-work chain you just can't get there from here while preserving decentralization and so this the the merge and the transition of proof-of-stake is the necessary foundation for ethereum to really start to to stretch its legs and and scale to the off the on-chain future that we're all anticipating and so it's very much sort of foundational and core frameworks it has a bunch of really interesting consequences and and non-obvious sort of elements to it uh but it does set us up for for the next generation of web3 growth and matt just to really double down on this let's talk about why proof of stake why the merge preserves some of the values that we want it to preserve before we get into the conversation of uh how blocks come to be because that's ultimately where this conversation will lead i just want to really get into when we live on chain lives and eventually the metaverse will come if if we're using the metaverse as a way to describe this on-chain future when we live our on-chain lives why is proof-of-stake and why is the merge an important component in preserving the values that we want to preserve uh in the crypto ecosystem so you know fundamentally you know the the basis of ethereum is uh decentral decentralized smart contract platform and so this this core theme of decentralization where basically anyone can participate in securing the network is really quite critical however as you as you embrace smart contracts all sorts of additional overhead comes into play it's uh harder to reach consensus it's harder to do execution there's a lot of computation requirements there's a lot of data storage requirements and sort of the shortcut here is just say well you need a larger and larger computers to be part of the network this has a fundamentally centralizing force because it pretty quickly gets out of the domain of your your average consumer with an average laptop and so what the transition of proof-of-stake does and in particular the the very aggressive move towards modularity in this uh transition is its preservation of decentralization through modularity and and what this does is uh get a lot of the the benefits of hey we can break the pieces apart you can decentralize them individually folks can participate in in many of these layers with different capabilities and the net result is a much more capable network with much fewer externalities or external dependencies that still has a very low threshold for participation where basically any consumer with any consumer grade laptop can participate um you know equally and and that's really core if we're going to have a a truly equitable web 3 and metaverse future so i think this is critical stuff and it's super exciting to be a part of it right and uh just to remind people the we have this thing called the ethereum virtual machine and what that means is there is a virtual computer in the cloud that is created out of the shared resources of all of the computers of the ethereum network but in order to keep this thing decentralized those shared resources have to be balanced and have to be inclusive and but we also want this super high powered decentralized finance metaverse future that requires all of this infrastructure and people that have been listening to the bankless podcast they know they probably haven't heard this modular design structure before ryan and i have done a few podcasts on it and our first modular podcast was really all about the separation of the execution layer from the consensus layer this is putting all of people's transactions and their speed and their all their defy activities uh to have very fast transactions with low transaction fees by putting that on the l2 thinking of l2 that's modules where you have the consensus layer as the the beacon chain the proof of stake layer but i think people that might have just listened to that podcast might not be aware of how much how further the modularity of ethereum goes because there's so many other components of modularity that are about specific parts of ethereum and this is again what this podcast is ultimately going to be about uh but matt can you walk us through the parts of the ethereum ecosystem that block native really has expertise in and where it is now and that is in the process of block building uh because it ultimately wants to go to how block building becomes modular but let's talk about the current state of block building uh unless uh if we can also as well define block building talk about the current state of how a block is built and added to the blockchain could you just walk us through that process for us sure so the existing model is proof of work and uh it's a fairly monolithic model meaning everything is sort of all tied together in a fairly small and compact set of software and a fairly small and concentrated set of of actors who are uh what are called miners but are actually more likely mining pools okay so basic proof-of-work um consensus algorithm is you uh build what's called a block template which is basically a candidate block with the transactions and then you try to solve for the gold and nonce where you try to do a bunch of computation to do the computation you have to pour energy into computers and so you have this externality of you need energy that you pay for in fiat you need computers that you pay for in fiat and you solve these problems and the first one to solve the problem basically uh says hey i have a block and they broadcast it to the network and uh the other miners in the pool or the other uh nodes basically inspect that validate and say it's okay that's the top level underneath the covers it's a little bit more nuanced which is you typically have what are known as mining pools and so you have folks who contribute computing resources to a sort of a collective set called the mining pool and the mining pool operator the one who's sort of in charge of that pool has a very critical function which is they specify the block template so the mining pool operators of which they're not that many there's just a handful really are the ones who are basically responsible for block construction they pick block templates which they think are sort of the most valuable block possible based on the current contents of the mempool and other external factors sometimes and they say this is the block i want to mine and confirm and then they send that out to their pool and all the various computers in the pool churn on that to try to solve for the golden nodes now what that means is block building and consensus are kind of can combined in this world and that this idea that you have a fairly small number of people who determine what goes in a block and what the sequence of those transactions in a block is um perhaps a bit more centralized than we would like over the long term and so that's some of the design objectives and sort of design consequences of what's happening around the merge and some of the other external factors there to to address and to create additional layers of decentralization at all levels of this process hey matt can you uh just walk us through i think a lot of people listening are probably fairly distant from the actual process of of mining and like don't even know when you say mining pools i don't know that they have a vision for what that is in their head what are these mining pools who operates them like what what kind of entity are we actually talking about here if these are the the folks doing the block building and also like part of the consensus and you're saying they're all one what kind of entity are we looking at this isn't an exchange are these the mining operators that that are out there that are kind of underneath the protocol yeah so these are the mining operators so one of the major ones is called ethermine and you could read about them and what these do rather than ethermine itself buying and controlling all of the gpus necessary to do the mining they basically operate software that lets anybody with a gpu participate in their pool and so imagine i have a bunch of gpus which i don't but they're under my desk and i can say well on my own i could mine but but i don't have a lot of hash power and so i don't i don't win very much so i don't get a lot of income it's not great what i can do is i can take my gpus and i can um uh join them to a mining pool and then i participate in that in all of the victories of that mining pool all the blocks that they win as a share of sort of how much hash power i devote to that so what it does is it makes my life a lot easier in terms of my income because i i spread it across everything that's that's happening in the pool and what it also does is it i have less things to think about because i don't have to do the hard work of figuring out how to build a block i just get a block from ethermine they tell me what to do and then i spin my gpus up behind that so this is the the mining operators underneath the network who are aggregating uh compute power who are aggregating you know hash and um have this sort of interesting role there's there's a bunch of these but they're really less than you might expect i'm not sure how many mining pools there are in operation today but there's not thousands that's for sure yeah five takes up the vast majority of all hash rate yes and so the five you have five block builders five entities which specify these transactions are going to go in a block and critically this is the order of those transactions and so hey one of the things that's critical about any public blockchain network is transaction sequencing matters a lot and modifications to that sequencing can have pretty significant economic effects and so you're you're in a situation where we would like to see more decentralization of block building and we'd like to see perhaps more diversity of block building strategies than just the few that a couple of private actors can uh deploy today okay so we got these mining pools these are doing the block building and by the way um bitcoin works the same way right they have mining pools they have block building works the same way um in ethereum we have these these five entities plus one one is you know of which is uh ethermine i bring my gpus uh to a mining pool and it kind of smooths out my revenue and you know so i'm happier than than doing it on my own there are benefits from economies of scale and the block building function just refresh us really quickly on like the incentives here the reasons for doing this how am i getting paid matt so i guess as a mining pool or a i guess a operator a contributing gpus a minor in that mining pool i think i have three sources of trans of of of revenue um so i got the block fees the block rewards right and then i have transaction fees what remains anything that's not burnt by eip 1559 and then i think i have this other thing from all the block ordering you're talking about and we call that mev minor extractable value or maximum extractable value and that is basically some sort of fee that i get because i am uh ordering the blocks in a specific way and someone has kind of paid me incented me to order it in a specific way there's some kind of arbitrage there can you explain those three categories in a bit more detail for us sure so um the the core of proof of work is when you mine a block with each block comes a reward which is called network issuance where basically new ether gets created and whoever wins the block receives that ether okay and uh the same is true of bitcoin and many others now notably post merge that issuance rate goes way way down and we can talk about that later right um two the block is consisting of a series of transactions those transactions have network fees associated with them and under eip 1559 the regime that we're in today the fee is split into two parts there's the base fee which is set by the network and then there's what's called the priority fee which is up to the person creating or entity creating the transaction it's also referred to as the minor tip so you take all the fees that are in the block and the base fee gets burnt it literally goes away and so that basically is has a deflationary effect on the circulating supply of ether but those priority fees all of them go to whoever won the block so the mining pool operator who won the block receives those as well now typically these are pretty small i mean it's it's enough to sort of incent them but it's not a big thing but under specific circumstances these priority fees can get quite lucrative and there can be a lot of competition to make sure these um transactions are included in your block and that you win those blocks because there's some juicy blocks that are out there now during uh you know as a result of the nature of the financial systems and that and games that are played on these web 3 systems sequencing matters a lot and so for instance uh there's arbitrage opportunities where um a user conducts a trade and on a decentralized exchange like uniswap and and that puts a pool out of balance right that there's you know there's slightly more and slightly less of a certain asset and that hey if i could get transactions surrounding that or just behind that i could capture that little imbalance or hey this transaction over here is going to move the price of of of this asset on this exchange but it's not going to move on the other exchange so if i get right behind that i can basically buy over here and sell over here and take a little bit of arbitrage there's many of these types of strategies now the challenge is only one or two people might participate in that and they need to be in exactly the right spot in the slot okay so exactly the right sequencing in order to capture that opportunity well in the past what this resulted in was like spam behavior uh folks would sort of just hammer the network with transactions to try to sort of crowd in and get there and crowd other people out which was really bad for the network and really bad for for like bloat and and bad for fees okay and so what started to happen was the miners would themselves say hey if you really care about being in a specific order in a block you tell me separately offline don't broadcast your transaction just whisper in my ear and i'll process the rest yeah whisper it to me but tell me specifically where you want it and then tell me what it's worth to you okay now this is this notion of mev or my minor extractable value is by by expressing your preference for ordering you can get beneficial outcomes for you versus somebody else now uh this was starting to happen privately and darkly there wasn't any transparency or visibility into it and there's all sorts of negative problems here like the miner themselves could theoretically say you know what that's a great idea i'm just going to do it myself and censor your transaction and sort of steal the opportunity and so a research collective and company emerged called flashbots which is very well known in the ecosystem and they basically built an open marketplace for uh this mev and so where you have actors called searchers who identify these opportunities searchers submit what are called bundles and they provide a fee and say hey if you include my bundle with certain conditions i'll pay you hey the miner this fee for doing so and it turns out those fees can be quite significant and so this becomes the third source of revenue for miners under proof of work you have the issuance for winning the block you have the priority fees of the transactions included in the block and then you have this sort of sidecar mev for external app for actors who specify specific ordering and when you can deliver that ordering they pay you an additional amount and real quick just to be clear when you were saying the miners just just then uh are you talking about the mining pools themselves are they the primary beneficiaries of the mev right now are they like in the secret whisper chats yeah well so yes so what's interesting is most of the value associated with the sequencing winds up aggregating to the minor and so or the mining pool um and this is because they're the ones ultimately who have control over sequencing and it turns out that the privileged actor in the network he who can control or she can control the the sequencing of the block stands in this really powerful position and so therefore if you if you want to take advantage of that you got to give them almost all of the opportunity that's there and so this value and this power accrues by the way this meb is specific to block building itself not to mining and so we said before there's a small number of actors who actually build blocks there's five of them who control the vast majority of hash power so those are the five that receive are the the beneficiaries of the semi-v and and and in a pretty significant percentage there are certain estimates that some classes of mev 97 percent of the value of what's there winds up going back to the minor so the minor or the minor pool the mining pool operator who then probably distributes that to the pool itself but yes i just want to say this because this is kind of a like kind of a a breakthrough in my understanding of things as part of the the big theme of this episode is that there is this hidden force we've talked about called mev but there's also this hidden actor you just called it the the one with the power to sequence the blocks you've also used the term block builder and i think we're going to use those terms synonymously but right now the block builder is the mining pool and so often like we don't really talk about the mining pools or the block builders in ethereum right everyone knows that there's miners everyone knows you know that we're gonna have stakers uh in a post post merge everyone knows the other parties and the other actors people that run nodes and this sort of thing but we don't talk about this economic agent that is very much at play and these are the block builders the sequencers the mining pools for now but in a post merge economy they're not going to be the mining pools anymore and we'll get to that later but i think david you wanted to follow up on this yeah just uh uh just a fun quick story is uh i got into ethereum uh via gpu mining so this actually this part of the story uh i actually have very close to my heart and the way that you described this earlier matt is like i had like something like 24 gpus and so if i mine solo for the about you know 12 to 18 months that i was mining with my 24 gpus i might not probability wise it was like 50 50 where there where i was going to like mine a block in like a three month time span and so there was it was a total gambles like i might have mined a block and if i did mind a block i'd win two ether it's actually three ether at the time but in order to smooth out my re my returns i would just donate my hash power to a mining pool like all the small fishes in the big big c would all come together and we'd pool our hash rate into the mining pool so that we could share our our dividends amongst all of each other and it would smooth out this very bumpy inconsistent rewards of the hash power and so we would all it's like if all of your friends all bought a hundred lottery tickets rather than a hundred friends buying one lottery ticket you're more likely to win and then you just spread out the returns and over time this like smooths out the their roi but what we are accidentally doing and this was really before mev was really a thing but what we do know now is mev is huge and so when we give up the right of our own ability to validate to be our own miners we're giving that power up to a mining pool and so mining pools maybe we don't really talk about them a lot on bank lists because we're more focused on the future of ethereum but mining pools and staking pools are largely the same thing they're the same type of players same kind of flavors and so and one part i was giving up my hash power to join a larger pool but that was also giving up my ability to construct the transactions inside of the block i was giving up that power to somebody that had more power than i have and the same thing you could say is also true of something like lido where you're putting your ether into the lido staking as a service app but you're giving lido the power to order those transactions the lido validator so this conversation is the same whether or not we're talking about uh proof-of-work hash power or proof-of-stake ether supply and so this just wanted to go through this story and so the as a result of me giving up my hash power or me giving up my ether i'm delegating this power to somebody else who is able to sub uh extract mev from the defy ecosystem and perhaps not pass it along to me uh and so i just wanted to compare and contrast the proof of stake and proof of work side of things and and so matt like can you kind of just like give us the bad scenario as to what what happens if we don't solve this problem of decentralization of power with technology like what happens if we were to let the mining pools just go rampant with meb or the future staking pools or large stakers just go ramp it with mev if we gave them too much power why do we need to decentralize this power well you know again uh determining which transactions go on a block and the sequencing is a privileged position and it has huge economic value associated with it and so uh the issue here is the the level of reward the level of value grows over time uh with these blockchain networks with the uh opportunity to determine which transactions go in and go out and those sequencing and so there's ever greater incentives to have corruption at that layer and corruption can be i favor one party over another party i favor my own transactions versus the markets transactions and you wind up with a system which is supposed to be you know fair and balanced and equal and is is actually not that that you have halves and have nots and and this is something we think a lot about at block native is sort of information asymmetries that exist in this ecosystem and sort of how um everybody having access to the same set of capabilities is actually really beneficial um and so what what the the focus is as part of a certain dimension of the merge is to uh move to modular decentralization of block building and to create new actors in the core of the network and therefore there's probably going to be some pretty interesting power dynamics that emerge from there we've often on bank list called if you are the person who gets to construct the next block and right now in proof of work it's random you don't know when the next block comes but you still are constructing every single block as if it is going to be your block and in proof of sake you actually will get to know when it is your turn to construct the block and so in that moment where you as a validator you as the miner who's proposing the block you will have what we call god mode you have god mode over that one block you know blocks get added to the blockchain in a serial order and if it's your turn to produce a block you get to get to determine the future state of aetherium you for that one instance of time you have god mode uh and that's powerful god mode is powerful you get to actually determine the state of ethereum you get to bend the the transactions you could accept those transactions but not those transactions you get to embed your friends transactions ahead of your enemy's transactions and so it's it's nice that we get to distribute god mode across like a an array of proof-of-stake validators from all across the world and those can get to be individuals who are staking their ether at home but if we accidentally have a part of our system that creates higher returns on capital faster than the individuals then that god mode will accrue to one single entity faster than we would otherwise like and so this is the conversation that we're having today is like the technology don't worry bankless nation we have the technology to fix it and that's what this podcast is about and that's what the second half of the show is and so matt can we get into the future state of aetherium in the post-merge world how do we solve this problem of preventing one central entity from having god mode too much where does that conversation start sure so the transition from proof of work to proof-of-stake is rather than proving that you've done some work i.e burn energy through computers to solve a block you stake your ether so you need 32 eth to be an independent staker and uh what you basically do is you you commit to tell the truth and if you tell the truth you get a little bit back and if you don't tell the truth in fact if you promote alternate truths then you get slashed and the economic properties of this are such that it's highly secure and it requires vastly less energy and it creates sort of room for a whole bunch more scalability of the at other levels of it now the this proof of stake is the consensus mechanism it's how the the network agrees on on what reality is um but what's happening is we're beginning to split apart the the block building aspects the execution layer and so by default today a validator will run a valid validation client there's a bunch of them out there there's like six major ones and they'll also run an execution client like geth but what they'll do is they'll say hey gath give me a block and geth will give them the block and it's pretty straightforward they can manipulate that block if they want they'll validate that pass it along and that's kind of the end of it it's a fairly easy thing to do but as you mentioned when you combine execution and and consensus into the same actor at the same time it creates room for corruption it creates room for weird things to start to happen and so what's occurring at the merge is this idea of block building where a new set of actors will be enabled in the ecosystem who all they do is build blocks and propose them to validators and those blocks i'm sorry matt when you say build blocks i just want to double down on this definition building blocks means i'm i'm a block builder i'd listen to the mempool i listen to all the available transactions i order them up to the size of all the transactions that can fit into a block and i have with that order i have built that block and then i pass that block on to the validator who's going to validate this block is this correct uh yes so the block builder's job is to assemble the block and what they do which is quite interesting is they bid to win the block they say hey i have this block hey validator if use my block template i.e the you know the block that you've created i'll pay you 0.2 eth okay and then david you're running a block builder as well and you build something and you say i'll pay you 0.3 eth right and ryan built because i've built a better block well there's very various theories here right one could be there's more value in your block and so you can bid higher the other is you're less willing you know you'll take smaller margins there's all sorts of interesting mechanics but from the perspective of the validator they just get a bunch of people who are saying hey pick my block that i've created for you and here's the bid that i will give to you and and that value accrues you know pretty cleanly for them and so uh it simplifies the job of being a validator the validator now can run on very low end hardware there's no sort of advanced sort of capabilities that they need or access to special compute power that the network sort of serves to them what the optimum block template should be and they accept it and they get rewarded for doing so and so what it does is it splits out the act of validation and the act of block building between two separate parties which is a form of modular decentralization for the network but it requires this new class of actors called block builders to do this job because as we said before there's only a handful of people who do block building today and so the cool thing about this is that it is creating a process of block building that creates a competitive market and i don't expect there to be a few block builders or maybe a medium amount of block builders i kind of think in the future there's going to be a very very large array of block builders that are all highly competitive and for the listener who has listened to bankless and has got really really excited about if staking ether and participating in the network validation uh and you should be i'll have to ask you listener do you also know how to extract mev because i'm gonna go ahead and guess the answer is no but the cool thing is all of a sudden you don't have to worry about that because through the process of separating block building and forcing block builders to pay bribe you to accept their block all of a sudden you do know how to accept mev because it's built into the protocol am i tracking on this map yes it democratizes access to um to mev and um again what's interesting about all of this is the value still accrues to the the validator just like today value accrues to the to the miner but it can do so in a decentralized fashion and it creates all sorts of new possibilities for that to move in new and different ways for uh members of the ecosystem who don't participate in this value potentially to participate in this value and and also there's some pretty interesting sort of um ethical decisions to make as well as a validator and so we're about to see you know something brand new the network's never seen new actors new new behaviors new possibilities and it will you know and with new outcomes and so that's pretty exciting consequence of the merge so i want to go back to just kind of establish this like in a post-merge world what the rules will be right and so i think we have we've talked about validators a little bit and we've talked about um block builders i do want to get back and and just hammer hone home what those uh economic entities are actually like right uh and then i also want to talk about this third group which we really haven't talked about too much so far which is kind of the mev searchers right these are the market makers these are the people that um actually you know are um want the blocks to be built in a certain way are exposing the arbitrage top type of opportunities from one uniswap pool to another for instance can we go through each of these uh roles on the the kind of the new ethereum post merge world and explain each of them maybe starting with the mev searchers and then working our way towards a block being built and a validator approving it and saying yes this is the one thank you for the bribe i selected this one let's walk through those uh from an entity perspective so tell us first about the mev searchers who are these people uh searchers are a class of actors who evaluate pending transactions and determine are there mechanisms to extract additional value from them right so this can be front running this can be back running this could be sandwich attacks this can be liquidations this can be arbitrage and and others there's sort of many many forms of mev but it turns out this is not the sort of thing that you just sort of write a script and it does for you it's a fairly specialized skill set that requires fairly deep expertise and so you have searchers there used to be individual searches but it's so competitive now that generally there's not a lot of individual structures they're more small teams all the way up to quite sophisticated organizations and they do things like look at the transactions in the public mempool where block native specializes and say every single transaction is there a way to extract value out of this and if there is they say yep this one is amenable there's some mev so by the way not all transactions have mev associated with it so if if i have a simple eth transfer i'm going to send 0.1 eth to david there's no mev associated with that and so that transaction in fact the majority of transactions don't have this this effect but if i'm doing certain things in d5 if i'm you know trading on a decentralized exchange if i am you know if i hold a collateralized debt position that falls below a certain threshold if i'm even trying to participate in a major nft drop that there's games that can be played with the sequencing of transactions and with constructing specific transactions in specific ways to extract value from them and what the searcher does is is a few things they first evaluate as maybe there they then create uh a companion um transactions that that have to either go before or after or before and after that's called the sandwich and then what they do is they bundle these together and they say hey they pass it along to a third party if you include this bundle with which includes the original transaction which they didn't create at all some user and maybe in their metamask or ledger sets a transaction the bundle includes that and the searcher transactions in a specific sequence they wrap that together and they say if you include this in a block i'll pay you this price okay and what happens is there are many searchers who compete for many of these opportunities so sort of a classic you know typical arb opportunity which is pretty obvious you'll have many searchers compete for that and they'll bid up the price until almost all of the value of that arb is in the bribe to the miner and that's why it becomes minor extractable value and the miner gets paid what the arb is is basically worth with a small amount left over for the circuit who are these people are they like high frequency traders is there a like a traditional finance analog to who these people are do they have capital are they like funds are they just you know super geeky people at home just like typing stuff in on their computers all of the above right they're shadowy super coders they are um you know they are you know large existing actors you know the hft funds that are um moving into the space they are um you know independent develop developers too folks who really know how the infrastructure works you know at a pretty low level um mainly they're building bots so i always think about searcher as bot builder and these bots are quite sophisticated they require a lot of compute to sort of calculate various outcomes and what happens is searchers tend to specialize in specific strategies so you'll have a searcher and all they do is arbitrage right that's all they focus on all day long and they're looking at all sorts of unique and unusual things in arbitrage you have a different searcher that focuses on sandwich tax right and and there's something that's worth saying here about searching an mev is a lot of the mev is is benign meaning there's value that gets created and they extract that value and sort of no one is no transactions are harmed as a result but there are plenty of forms of mev which are which are not benign which as a result of the mev a user might have more slippage or might have to pay a higher fee or or might get a different exchange rate and so um there are certainly consequences to this that many people who participate in these networks may not be aware of or exposed to and realize that their transactions being sandwiched and therefore they have less favorable settlement for what they're trying to do right mev can certainly span the spectrum between just an actor that is making d5 more and more efficient on the good side of things to perhaps so what some people have called actual theft on the other side of things and the full range of everything in between good or bad um matt there's something you said that i want to clear that i want to clarify on you said uh searchers will create these transactions they're specialized and then they will bid up to the value of the mev that they will create and they will send that over to the mineral validator but that also sounds like the block builder that we talked about earlier can you differentiate between an mev searcher and a block builder and overall how a block is constructed sure so before i do that it's worth noting mav is a function of all transaction systems not just blockchain systems so meb exists in the stock market today so it's just it's a it's a unavoidable consequence of an ordered transaction system and all transaction system not to be ordered and the ordering counts okay so any ledger has mev exactly mmv is a fact of life okay so it's it's not do you avoid it it's more like what can you do about it okay um to your question david so the searcher basically specifies uh a sequence of transactions for inclusion right they basically communicate that preference to a block builder i.e a mining pool operator and proof of work and they do so via a variety of mechanisms one of them is the flashbots has a as a marketplace for this there's a group called eden network there's a uh blocks route has some of this stuff i think ethermine one of them has their own private you know mechanisms for these things and so you have multiple marketplaces for searchers to submit their bundles to specify what they would um pay for inclusion in that way and and there are certain trust assumptions that are built into that because each actor in that value chain can sort of see what's going on and so you got to make sure your everybody is is doing what they say they're going to do and not playing you know further games um but but the searcher is submitting transactions the block builder the mining pool operator and proof of work is is ordering transactions into a block and basically what this allows is the searcher to say put these set of transactions in the sequence maybe in this in this specific slot specific order for this price and then what the block builder or mining pool operator chooses whether or not to accept that and and again there's many factors that go into that how many bundles go into a given block because remember there's only so much block space and all of this mev requires unique transactions to do it so the mev begins to crowd out regular transactions that can have some negative externalities and um you may have multiple bids for the same thing so it's a dynamic real-time marketplace people need to make decisions very quickly and it's a pretty complicated domain today and so okay we have three parties here we have mev searchers we have block builders and we have stakers and validators and this happens in a serial order but also it really i think the best way to view this is kind of like as a funnel or or as a pyramid depending on what what your orientation is uh there's only one validator for every single block so there's only one of those entities per block and so that is the conclusion of all of these efforts of these other two parties so they're at the top they're out there at the very end state they're the last thing that happens before a block is added to the blockchain searchers are on the other end of the spectrum where there are so many searchers and imagine for a second let's fast forward into uh 10 20 years in the future where the ethereum defy economy has taken over the world at least that's where i expect the world to go uh and we know we don't have just like amms and like you know money markets we have the full entire world economy being built on a blockchain technology and so all of the world's financial ecosystem all the world's finances built on blockchain and in this world imagine there is not going to be one type of entity that is an expert in ordering the world's transactions and so what searchers are doing what i'm hearing matt is that searchers are specializing in one specific domain of the economy to make that economy hyper efficient let's make sure all the amms are perfectly balanced and searchers will arbitrage between sushi swap uniswap balancer all the other amms and they will balance those things out and they will extract that mev and they will be hyper specialized at doing that and then there's going to be different searchers who are good at liquidating money markets to make sure those are super efficient so we got ave compound where i refuse pools euler i mean so we have searchers that are optimizing for liquidations on those and they're highly competitive to optimize to make that happen and so pick your flavor pick your part of the economy and searchers will find a way to hyper efficient uh make that part of the econo economy hyper efficient and so if searchers will bundle up those micro parts of the economy and then those bundles i'm sure we've all seen a transaction on the ether scan that has like 15 different ins and outs and this is kind of like what a searcher would look like at least if i'm imagining it correctly and then the searchers bundle up all these transactions and there's a ton of searchers but then they send them to the block builders and so the builders take all of the bundles from the searchers and then they are the ones that construct it into a block and there's fewer block builders i'm guessing than there would be block searchers or mev searchers and so we're starting to consolidate and like funnel down all of the transactions in the mempool down to a few or fewer parties so the searchers bid to block builders to accept all of their bundles and then the block builders compete with other block builders to bundle up all the searchers transactions and then to finally submit it to the person that is their turn to have god mode which is the validator matt did i get all that correct yes largely yes so so first off mev uh bundles are multiple transactions so you have transaction a submitted from the user you'll put transaction b right behind it from the searcher so instead of one transaction you have two that's your bundle okay um and so you can actually look in ether scan you'll see uh there's a little flag i think it says uh non-traditional ordering i think it's something like that and those are examples of mev transactions where they appear in an unexpected sequence in the block and that's the clearest indicator that there's some mev there so yes searchers look at sources of transactions they extra create responses group those up into bundles they submit them to various locations for inclusion in block building now this is this new thing under proof of stake and in particular some new sort of side car capabilities through what's called mbb boost which is also from flashbots enabling sort of a new class of actor to be a stand-alone and specialized block builder and this new role which doesn't exist in the network today is that anyone can build blocks anyone can can look at the mempool can look at other sources of transactions can look at can receive bundles from searchers and can try to build an optimum block and an optimum block is a block which occupies you know the maximum amount of gas that that's available and that has the maximum value associated with all the various transactions and then can say well this juicy block i want to propose up to the validator whose turn it is is to have god mode by the way significantly when the validator is in that position they're known as what's called the proposer okay so this will matter in a second so the block builder creates a template based on all these transactions including bundles from searchers they then push that through mev boost to the uh proposer who's a validator and the validator says this block looks great to me and i'm going to suggest that to the network there are some interesting nuances in how the various pieces work but but sort of the punch line to all of this is standalone block builders have not been a thing in ethereum to date and immediately post merge it's going to become a thing and that's going to be a pretty interesting set of activities and actors and now that you have independent block builders they can start to do things that haven't been possible before they can start to move value around in ways that have been possible before and they can start to express sort of uh values in ways that haven't been possible before either and i think there's going to be a lot of interesting possibilities that emerge from that the era of proof of stake is upon us and lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone lido is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using lido's distributed network of nodes don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in defy with lido you can have both using lido you can stick any amount of your eth to the lido validating network and receive st eth in return sce can be traded used as collateral for lending and borrowing or leverage on your favorite d5 protocols all this without giving up your eath to centralized taking services or exchanges lydo now supports solana kusama and polygon staking whatever your preferred proof-of-stake asset is lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your steak if you want to stake your east soul or matic and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started that's l-i-d-o-f-i to get started there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets arbitrary is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use device and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrary and the d5 and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly some of the coolest and newest nft collections have chosen arbitrarily as their home all the while d-fire protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity using arbitrary has never been easier especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrary through all the exchanges including binance ftx hobie and crypto.com once inside you'll notice arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas feed if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit arbitrum dot io slash developer to start building your dap on arbitral if you're a d-gen many of your favorite dapps on ethereum are already on arbitrary with many moving over every day go to bridge.arbitrum.io now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defy nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free so we want to talk about the block builder new character class that's like sort of entered the uh the list of economic agents right and i guess before in in the existing ethereum today uh block builders and kind of validators have been one in the same been these kind of these mining pools you know like as david was talking about the kind of the efficiency and the specialization of these setups particularly around the mev uh search it's so interesting to me because this is um it's almost it's starting to resemble a very organic system do you know like uh like in the ocean like cleaner fish we have these like fish that uh go clean other larger animals like clean their gills or they'll pick out the bacteria of a whale's teeth you know they're just chomping away for all of the energy right and they they go take the energy well this is how we sort of extract all of the economic energy from the ethereum ecosystem right so it's it's it's kind of a symbiosis it's like a mutualism between different organisms and that's what these mev like bots to me are you describe them as bots it's like these little nanobots these little cleaner fish going and finding all of the economic energy and just like like biting and cleaning things up but this new this new character class the block builder okay can you talk about what this entity might be and i wasn't entirely clear matt on why this new entity has entered the picture you mentioned something called mev boost from flashbots but i don't think that's part of the core ethereum protocol that is something else that is something third party and yet it establishes this new uh block builder economic agent so how and then who are these block builders going to be like we haven't had them in the past who's going to step up and say i'm going to be a block builder and what is the benefit for them sure so as we said there's a lot of moving parts here so um uh the general if you're interested to learn more about this the term to search on is called pbs proposer builder separation okay that's that's the broad umbrella where you're going to separate out proposer the validator who's proposing the block to the network from building right now in the ethereum roadmap p there's a notion of what's called in protocol pbs so that uh in the protocol itself proposer builder separation will be enshrined but that's at least the year and maybe further uh out from the merch so this is in the we need to hard fork that in yeah there's a lot of there's a ways to go before we get to in protocol pbs um however uh there is this addition of a sidecar which is known as mev boost which significantly all of the consensus clients support the mev boost apis and so if you're a validator and you're running your your prism or or lighthouse uh or other um consensus client the consensus client needs to get a block okay now you could do that yourself you could run your own local copy of geth and say geth give me a block and it says hey here's your block template go propose that or you could say hey mev boost give me the block okay and then that outsources that creates the avenue for an external party to to suggest a block to you and so this is opt-in so validators are going to need to enable these apis and choose to participate in the system but the economic incentives are such that it would it would seem that most validators and potentially all validators would do so because they make more money if they do and is the only game in town for this uh mev boost is the primary game in town there there certainly is some interesting possibilities for someone forking or creating alternates to it but at the end of the day the apis are now enshrined in the um the consensus clients and so there is this mechanism of an outside you know element communicating into the consensus clients what's nice about this by the way is it's completely client agnostic so it's not like one consensus client can do it and the other one can't and so therefore you have this sort of central you know this reduction of consensus client diversity so it's it's pretty cool that it's something completely independent um uh and and flashbots themselves have been working quite closely with the ethereum foundation to ensure that this is not something you know proprietary or that gives any one actor including themselves some sort of unique advantage because they were the ones who helped construct that so the the the interesting thing is this relatively small piece of software called mev boost is a side card to these consensus clients and it enables third-party block builders to exist there's some multiple pieces to the to the infrastructure that's required underneath there which has some very interesting consequences like these things called relayers that have certain functions to do there's block building itself there's there's searchers there's other forms of simulation so underneath the covers there's even more complexity happening or even more sort of moving parts um but at the end of the day mev boost is the the secret here that allows block building to emerge uh at the merge so that block building as a as a capability as this class of actors um you know will be enabled by this piece of so mev boost comes post-merge but then basically something like mev boost becomes enshrined in the protocol in a year two years some future hard fork and it becomes this thing that you just call pbs proposer builder separation right and then it becomes enshrined in the protocol and we don't need mev boost anymore and exactly okay and these these block builders themselves all right this is a new economic agent right we we've had the mev searchers before we know what what validators are of course in state and stakers and miners who are these block builders going to be so it's an interesting question so the the honest answer is nobody knows who's going to be a blockbuster but it would it would seem that those entities so so block building will be resource intensive you'll require a lot of compute you'll require a lot of network bandwidth you'll require a lot of data to be an effective and competitive block builder and so this is pro you know block building will probably emerge from groups that already have those capabilities so this would be existing infrastructure providers inside the web 3 ecosystem like block native as an enabler to all of this like flashbots certainly um like maybe some of the big hft shops that have a lot of resources um like maybe some of the node operators whether you're an alchemy infuria quick node some of those may enable these sorts of capabilities as well um and and so this is one of the things that's super interesting about it is uh it's a it's a brand new uh market it's a brand new game and it's not at all clear what different actors will bring to the table and sort of what sort of unique advantages they'll have the the desire of the ecosystem is that it be highly decentralized that there be many block builders who are participating in the network and and are winning blocks it's actually a negative situation if you have one master block builder who builds all the blocks and then they're the force of centralization so the the the the setup is such that you'll have many different actors who participate in block building so you want many different actors to participate in block building not sure who they're going to be but there are some possible candidates and how are they economically rewarded and how much is the economic opportunity for these block builders again we'll have to figure that out but the way that the economic rewards go is the block builder receives all of the value of the transactions in their block uh the the fees of the transaction the block so all of the priority fees will go to the block builder okay um the mev uh um bundle bids right the bribes go to the block builder okay and so the block builder what they're trying to do is build a maximally valuable block that is valuable in the form of the priority fees that are included in the transactions and in the form of the various types of mev that are in that then what the block builder does is say how much of that profit that margin in the block do i choose to share with the validator okay and so one might imagine if matt david and ryan are all block builders and we're all looking at the exact same data source the public mempool and we all have basically equivalent capabilities we will build pretty close to identical blocks with identical value and then the only way that one of us wins and is as you know gives the wins the block is whoever takes the lowest margin okay and so what winds up happening is most of the value of those commodity blocks will probably go to the block proposer right which is much how it is today but maybe there's other modes here maybe there's other ways to create block differentiation maybe there's other ways to express preferences in the blocks that get created that validators could say you know maybe i don't want just the the most money the the most value maybe i want the best block in in the form of how it relates to my personal values and what i think is in the health of the web3 ecosystem so there are many ways to construct blocks you can construct a block that's that's naively ordered what they say today which is highest gas price at the top lowest gas price at the bottom that's it okay the nice part about that is it's totally transparent and fair and you could run a validator who says i'm only going to accept blocks that are ordered this way okay and and this is where relays come in you could say i know these relayers only have this form of ordering so i'm only going to accept blocks from them and i'm going to do so because i think that's better for the network than all these other things going on right or you might have a block builder who says i'm going to include mev in my blocks but only benign mav i'm not going to include blocks that have any you know sort of negative consequences for the transaction so yeah i'm going to produce maybe less valuable blocks but there's going to be no harm done right they're going to be ethically sourced blocks if you will and as a validator you can say oh i'm going to subscribe to relayers that have those sorts of or you could say you know maybe i'm going to decide you know maybe most of the time i'm going to take an ethically sourced block um or a fair order block but you know what if there's a really juicy opportunity that i just can't say no to every now and again i'll take one of those too um there's all sorts of interesting possibilities for how blocks get constructed and this is one of the things that's really exciting about the emergence of block building is that there's now a marketplace and there's ways to express things in new creative fashions and and it doesn't necessarily have to be the sort of you know linear whoever bids the most gets the block and you know hell with the consequences if you will and and so you do want this differentiation and you you definitely want this this competition right and ideally you want some sort of commoditization of this layer so that the block builders don't become a rent collector on the system and so that they pass the maximum profit to the validators which is what we want or block proposers but you have a question mark face is that is that what we want or maybe because today the value flows up but like if you think about it like most of the value is originated with whoever started the transaction that has the mev right so guess what regular everyday users are doing transactions on ethereum just like we want them to do and on l2 just like we want them to do and as sort of exhaust from what they're doing there's other value that gets created that they don't participate it at all today because the users themselves are not aware of the mev and don't know how to capture it if they did okay oh okay so you're talking about this fourth party that we haven't even considered which i forgot about but there's a user of this uh ethereum transaction at the end of the chain we talk about searchers and builders and and validators and stickers but there's actually a user now you're introducing that uh person user there's a wallet there's a dap there's a protocol all of which you could sort of look at and say these are the sources of transactions of which mev results and gosh wouldn't it be a more level playing field if they were to participate in this as well okay wow and so now you can have block builders that provide rebates right so i always like to say imagine instead of you having a wallet that you add money to to pay for your gas fees your wallet pays you to use it why because okay where do i where do i sign up for that these are coming and we think that this is why this is such an interesting opportunity for someone like us because we build enabling infrastructure that could make this a reality right where the the wallet itself is aware of mev or is it or is connected to searchers who can evaluate and that the wallet itself could then participate in this economic flow okay and then the wallet could return value back to the user and one might imagine different wallets with different techniques and how much they capture versus how much they share and then users now have all sorts of new possibilities to select which wallet provides the greatest rate of rebate right so one there's this sort of new there's a possibility of value flowing in new directions of of big economic opportunities being created in areas of of the ecosystem which have been less you know have had less of that that will then create all sorts of new innovation and so uh if you're a dap developer you could participate in this if you are a wallet developer you can participate in this if you're a protocol you could potentially participate in this as well and so now as a block builder you have the opportunity to take that reward in the block and instead of just giving it all to the validator you could say oh i want to share some of it with the user i want to share some of the wallet i want to share some of it with the dap and so these sorts of eddies and currents and recirculation of value we think is highly constructive and quite interesting and we're quite excited to be a part of enabling that and the block builder is only sharing the mev portion it's not sharing the block rewards not sharing that yeah it could be priorities whatever it is you know it's it's completely up to them it can share block rewards right of course so each block has a certain amount of value with it that value gets apportioned right so i i win the block right i'm the block builder i got to give some of that value to the to the proposer to the validator because they're going to pick mine right and that other value left over i'm going to give some of the mav searchers who found the value i'm going to give some to the wallets who originated it and maybe directly to the user maybe enable the wallet to give it to the user and i might even give it to the dap and so one could imagine this pie and it gets sliced up in all these different fashions and the block builder themselves might take a relatively small percentage of the overall reward um that's in line with where the value is is um you know who's responsible for which aspects of the value but if i if i'm a validator who with rational self-interest and i'm like greedy i want to maximize my profits i don't want you as a block builder to give that to other stakeholders so i'm going to not pick your block i'm going to pick the block that maximizes the value to me maybe hypothetically won't validators lean in this direction potentially i mean again there'll certainly be a class of validators you just say i'll just pick the one that's most valuable to me and move on right there'll be others who say hey i want blocks that reflect my values and what i think is the best thing for the ecosystem and i'm going to select those um but you know it's quite possible that this dynamic could emerge and still be the most competitive block that that because of you know you basically go pretty far up the value chain and sort of what is the source of those transactions that you're going to have you know blocks that certain people can build that certain other people can't build okay so for instance you're going to have like hft shops that have their own order flow okay are they going to capture the mev associated with their own order flow are they going to build their own blocks in order to maximize that are they going to share that with others there's there's these weird um you know not weird but but there are centralizing forces where you have a vertically oriented stack which starts to look like a big hft shop like we have today that's probably uh what's known as mbb dystopia you're going to have decentralized layers and so um i think the reality is is there's a lot of moving parts there's a lot of very interesting possibilities that um i don't think it just is going to my anticipation is it's not just going to pin to the simplest case that it's going to be a pretty complex and varied environment for block builders and for how these rewards circulate through the ecosystem i don't think it's that crazy to think that people that will be entities in the future of ethereum that have some sort of like wild garden or like monopoly upon their users and and the transactions that they want to embed into ethereum and if they have control over users transactions they don't have to broadcast those transactions to the mempool they can go straight to the source right and so they kind of have deal order flow which is a phrase that we all learned with robin hood and citadel in a negative light but there's no reason why this has to be negative this can just be a result of this particular vertically integrated construction where somebody has an app and they just receive transactions from their users and then they go through this process and so there's totally reasonable to think that one entity has there's like a bunch of transactions that they are their users transactions and it's their duty to get their users transactions into a block and so matt i am very much reminded of the number of credit cards that i have in my wallet a few of them give me two percent cash back a few of them give me airline points uh and they are all they all have uh well i guess it's visa that has like my order flow but i'm i'm reminded or not i'm just wondering if i'm on to something here like this cash back this rebate because i am in a transaction originator from uh my apple credit card and my united airlines miles credit card am i onto something here is this the right comparison it's a very apt comparison um my senses in web 3 those rebates could be dramatically better than what you get from a credit card company for all the reasons you might expect and this is one of the big benefits of decentralization and of modularity and of competitive marketplaces is that the value can begin to move in a much more efficient fashion and so yeah we think this is super exciting and we started out this conversation in terms of you know power structures right and so i i look at the the post-merge landscape and my sense is transaction originators wind up in a fairly powerful position okay and if we think today about sort of what is the true point of origination their wallets and and there's a handful of wallets that are pretty well positioned that that that have you know certain market share advantages in the in the marketplace and they're probably going to exert significant um i don't know influence over the trajectory of these sorts of things and and you know proprietary order flow is is a little bit problematic but that's going to start to emerge there's probably going to be standards for these um uh uh candidate transactions to be shared among parties so you can have maximum searcher awareness because quite frankly the more searchers that are looking at a transaction the more likely it is to be most efficiently um understood and then things like that you're going to have actors like block native who are really good at real-time simulation who are able to understand the consequences of these things and make decisions really quickly sort of help all the various actors sort of navigate through this and oh by the way all of this complexity under proof of stake there's a new block every 12 seconds okay that's five blocks a minute 300 blocks an hour 7 200 blocks a day 2.6 million blocks per year every one of these is a real-time auction every one of these all of this mechanic is happening all at once and and there's a lot of things to worry about which is why we as an infrastructure operator we as block native who sort of specialists in the mempool and sort of the easy button for dealing with us real-time data we see a lot of opportunity to simplify this whole ecosystem as well so that various participants can can play in the ways that they choose to so again there's going to be some interesting new [Music] actors and interesting new economic opportunities that create get created for infrastructure providers like us so the ethereum protocol has just so much development left and especially in the era of 2021 ethereum gas fees were super high and i really like people just felt very excluded from the ethereum ecosystem because we had just an inefficient block space auctions uh it wasn't really the most efficient marketplace uh flashbots came in and part of this story started to develop with flashbots that's a part of the story and when they did gas fees came down a pretty decent amount but still made it made ethereum generally unusable in 2021 and just because i have to pay to use ethereum i have to pay gas use ethereum uh and as a result of that like money leaves my wallet and so you matt you're telling me as after the ethereum protocol matures we go through some of we actually get pbs into the chain ethereum i'm still gonna have to pay gas fees but ethereum as an ecosystem is also going to pay me to use it over time is that ultimately what the long-term conclusion is i will say that is one potential future is a the much more efficient extraction of mev uh at the at the core of the network by this new class of operators and that value then recirculating back through the various actors in that you know who is responsible for the origination well you need adapt to use right you need a user who wants to do something you need a wallet to compose that and that those actors could all participate in this flow we think that's quite constructive and quite in line with the ethos of a level playing field and of decentralization and you're literally decentralizing the power instead of all this power accruing to mining pool operators which exists today and therefore all the sort of structures that sort of uh um blend out of that you break apart the blockchain you break apart the infrastructure you make it more modular and in doing so you break apart the value and that then value can now move in this much more modular fashion which we think is is really exciting now again there is a lot to figure out there's a lot of unknowns and and this is all happening literally in real time and these standards are being developed but um it's a it's a time for optimism uh i believe for for the potential of the network and and how it can incent the right sort of behaviors and participation in the network there's a nice dissent like um balance of power i guess in in what you're describing if this comes to fruition i really like the idea of transaction originators being a recipient of some of this mev because if you're a transaction originator you are kind of closest to the customer aren't you and like if you're a wallet or you're trying to get a customer's order in some way you have to fight to provide the best user experience for those sets of users and that is a good thing ultimately for the user right because uh you have to compete for their love and their business and maybe you have to provide them rebates in order to earn that maybe you have to provide a better user experience so that is a nice decentralization lever too and i really like that idea i'm very hopeful this comes to fruition i gotta say coming into this conversation um i i knew about the block builders not in the depth that you've just described it matt but i was a little bit worried that that would like become a centralization vector for ethereum and what you've just said gives me some hope and i want to like bring this up to the protocol level as well because the reason the protocol itself is creating this new economic agent class of block builders is so that we don't centralize all of the stake if we didn't do that then we would keep validation and block building combined and then no individual would actually be able to run their own validator because it would not be economically competitive to build blocks and run a validator at the same time but what we've done here in this new design of ethereum mev boost and again as matt said that comes out post merge so a post merge will be in this environment even if it's not enshrined the protocol layer then validators can still run an ethereum validation give the final sign off on a block from a consumer grade laptop okay not in a data center and that is the check on power that is the balance of power to keep this protocol decentralized at the validator level so i really like that design can i ask you like structurally how hopeful are you that ethereum remains decentralized because to me decentralization the thing that it does the technology that provides is it's an anti-corruption tool right and centralization means potentially more room for corruption so we got to keep this thing decentralized in this new design how confident are you that we're going to be able to do that um my sense is the the path that we're on is a technologically progressive approach to enable orders of magnitude scalability while preserving and even extending the decentralization characteristics that exist today okay though it is no foregone conclusion i think it is really a function of the various actors in the ecosystem and the decisions that they make both economic decisions and also ethical decisions along the way my sense is you know for instance with the realization that if you had validators building blocks it creates a centralization force the team at flashbacks was really pretty proactive about saying this is a big risk and then creating a spec and standards and working with the ecosystem to create a solution for this okay and so i think that behavior is probably what's going to be most important to preserve decentralization over the long haul not like oh that this little trick or this little piece or that it's more like smart people at the center saying hey these are ways that we are we see risk for centralization and these are mitigations against it um the forces of centralization are economic forces so they're very real and so the the the combat against that is um is what you're seeing here and it's playing out in real time um i am quite optimistic on that we will live in a highly scalable highly decentralized ethereum of the future and it will be based on a lot of the ideas which are being pioneered today we are super excited to be a part of that to be a contributor to be in the conversation and to be you know operating infrastructure that enables us to happen and and we see a huge amount of opportunity moving forward and we certainly hope that others do as well you know what's super cool about this it's striking is like hey thank god for flashbots you know it's it's been like sometimes i i think my old uh view of the world is the ethereum foundation and some of the client teams are the only ones actually focusing on the protocol like these are the core researchers but now here's another entity called flashbots and they are building a off protocol kind of system that is uh so important the future the protocol that the protocol is going to actually embed it and they've done this almost as a public good and the stuff that that you're doing at block native is kind of providing some public good infrastructure as well and so i'm back to like just a repeating theme on bankless of course is how do we ultimately preserve decentralization it's actually at the layer zero because it's people who have to care about this and build the systems that keep this entire ecosystem decentralized we can't just say oh it's vitalik's you know protocol designs he's got to be the one that saves this or the ethereum foundation like all of us inside of this ecosystem if we actually care about this future we need to take steps to preserve it and that's sort of what i see happening and so as long as the layer zero stays true to the mission i feel very optimistic about our success chances as well matt yeah and not i i agree layer zero matters a ton and the values and ethos of the ecosystem being expressed in working code and in working infrastructure and in choice right that that every actor on the this this value chain has ability to make discriminating choices towards decentralization or towards centralization um so so yeah completely and and there are a number of teams that are out there that are doing really important work often below the radar um often mischaracterized they're often misunderstood that really are advancing the state of the art and and also i think you have people who are not overly you know that that view the risks as real and and debate the risks and debate alternatives and again it's it's the most interesting part of the world to be involved in and some of the smartest people in the world who are working on this stuff as well and you know that's what it's going to take to live in in the on-chain future which is you know truly decentralized and truly open in the ways that it needs to be matt i think there's actually one component of this conversation that we have left out that we have not yet touched on and i want you to check my reasoning on this because i think that one last component is ether the asset itself we're talking about the ways that the post uh post merge ethereum and post pbs post proposal builder separation how this changes the power structures around the ethereum landscape uh and so it's going away from central entities like mining pools or staking pools or whoever can like run the best mev bots and it's going somewhere else and if my conclusion is correct i think it actually ultimately the pinnacle of where all the value flows actually is ether the asset and here i want you to check my reasoning on this so we have the mev searchers they're highly optimized for specific parts of the d5 economy they're arbitraging between all the amms the money markets all the various parts what they can arbitrage and then they submit their bundles up to the block builders and they bid up to the basically the value of the transactions that they get the value that they can extract out of their transactions so well basically what that means is that the value of the mev from mev searchers gets passed to the block builders and the block builders do the same thing it's a it's the same process twice the block builders take the bundles from the searchers and they organize them so that they can extract as much mev as possible and that tells them how much they can afford to bid to the stakers to the validators and so ultimately through the searcher collapsing down to the block builders collapsing down to the validator it's the validator that gets the value of all the mev through that flow of value but if the validator only gets to become a validator if they are staking eth and so the value of mev turns into an increased heat stake rate which you actually can only get if you are staking eath and so if we are bullish on the proposer builder separation and the bullish on the total amount of mev surface area there are there is going to be on ethereum i think the answer of where does that bullishness ultimately come to settle on is ether the asset mat can you check my thinking on this is this correct it would see it seems to me that the move to proof-of-stake further puts uh eath at the center of the security model of the economic model and of the ins of the uh the sort of value flows and so as the value of the network accrues i.e increased scalability increased throughput increased applications in increased egalitarian characteristics a more level playing field the value will accrue to the core asset which is ether so ultimately yes i think that this is all highly constructive for ether as an asset for ethereum as an ecosystem and for the participants in that network so uh yeah i think that that the net vector here over a long time horizon short term time horizons being what they are um is for value accrual to ether the asset and i think that just even more illustrates why the ethereum community the ethereum ecosystem the ethereum ethos has always been self the ability for individuals to self validate on laptops in their own homes and you know and and to obfuscate the need to have mining hardware loud expensive mining hardware with connections to supply chains or like obviously all of that away with proof of work but now we're doing that we're obfuscating the work of proof of state or proof of work physical supply chains because we don't need physical asics anymore but with proposer builder separation we're also obfuscating the intangible supply chain of block proposing as well both of these things are abstracted making the the process of being a part of the ethereum consensus still exactly where it's always been which is you the individual with your laptop and some ether stake at home uh again i feel like i'm on the right track here is that right yeah absolutely it's uh it's it's enabling individual sovereignty and participation on on a level playing field and you know sort of equal action and um you know the the these forces of of composability you you break things apart you make them more modular and making them more modular you make them more programmable as they become programmable they become flexible they become expressive they become competitive and it enables innovation to occur in again a decentralized fashion we as an independent software developer can build our own strategy build their own infrastructure build their own economic model and we can go out there and we can suggest hey you should use our infrastructure versus somebody else's and that creates competition that creates alternatives that creates choice and ultimately we all seek you know a more perfect solution a more uh a more optimal outcome and and i view all of these changes all of these individual elements as just deeper and deeper optimization at the functional level at the incentive level and at the sort of conceptual level and um you know again it just creates a a universe of opportunity for those who are participating in the network one last thing matt i used to think kind of this mev problem was um sort of ethereum's problem to solve but then i noticed a whole bunch of the other alternative blockchains weren't even talking about mev uh weren't focused on solving it at all and yet they still at scale will have these same problems i'm curious about mev is is it just you mentioned this earlier but is it just an ethereum problem or do other chains have it like why don't we talk about mev on bitcoin is that because like bitcoins mev happens almost at the uh the crypto bank layer inside of a inside of a block fire inside of a celsius and inside of a nexo and it doesn't happen on chain can you talk a little bit about this is it your impression that it's ethereum's problem to solve or does this exist everywhere again mev exists in all ordered transaction systems which is there for all transaction systems because you can't have a transaction system without ordering so so mev is is a fact of life and again in the stock market you have you know hfts who pay for order flow and what they basically are trying to do is aggregate orders before others have it and make micro manipulations and extract value out of that that's an example of any mev in a completely non um crypto related context yes every um blockchain has mev as long as there's two characteristics value and and generally some form of smart contract right if you're just doing transfers like is the core of bitcoin there's not a lot of mev to be extracted other than you know in certain opportunities someone getting in front of somebody else but as all these other blockchains add additional smart contract capabilities whether it's at their core or as an add-on mev emerges almost immediately as soon as value starts to flow through it and so by the way there's a whole uh emerging category of cross-chain mev so you know mev involving transactions on multiple chains simultaneously and and that this is a it's just a fact of life um and what is the opportunity here is to explore this in the open to discuss it and to expose people to it this is something i think is super important um we believe an informed user is a is an empowered user and so do you just tell the user like press this button and a bunch of things are going to happen and don't worry your pretty little head about it or you say hey user you know how do you want to set your transaction fee because hey this will happen faster but it'll be more expensive this will happen slower but it'll be cheaper right we block native offer things like transaction preview or simulation if you press the submit button right now here's what's likely going to happen so the user can see the likely outcome before they get it where we want to go with that is like shouldn't the user be alerted to hey there might be some mev here do you want to evaluate that do you want to participate in that and so the the this idea that exposing all of this stuff completely and and to the entire ecosystem providing tooling with equal access is by far the best solution here because you know you want to unl light up the dark forest as we say and and you want all this stuff to be um out in the open and not you know behind closed doors some smoke filled room some back room deal where value is accruing sort of under the covers and people can't really see it and before you know it you have the root of centralization happening so yeah we think this is uh this is a fact of life regardless of where you are on chain or off chain uh ethereum or otherwise and um the tooling that we're building today and the infrastructure they're building today allows us to mitigate it matt you just touched on it uh how block native fits into this whole structure but i'd like you to double down and keep going with that because we have so many different chains and i think we're gonna have a hundred times more than what we have now which means we're gonna have a hundred times more mempools and i dare say i think we're gonna have thousands and thousands of times more transactions how does block native fit into this whole proposer builder separation transaction routing transaction origination how does block native as infrastructure fit into this whole thing so we as block native specialize in the pre-chain layer so all the things that happen to transactions before they go on chain and often that means um capturing normalizing and enriching mempools across various chains today we support seven or eight and we're adding them constantly um one of the big reasons why we do that well we we capture this mempool data and we provide programmatic access to it is to level the playing field so that everybody in those ecosystems that we support have access to the same information so that they can be informed in their in their behaviors right um i i often say like if you don't have access to the memphis would be like playing soccer against a team that could see 10 seconds into the future it'd be a pretty frustrating soccer game because you'd never get to the ball and in fact in many ways that's sort of what the state of the art is on some of these web 3 systems is you have you have sophisticated actors who have access to this data you have everybody else who doesn't and you create you know an unbalanced situation so this is what we do today and and we have a whole bunch of advanced capabilities as it relates to transaction simulation and preview gas pricing and things like that and fundamentally we think these capabilities are quite relevant to post-merge and so we're really focused on helping our customers get ready for the merge to implement infrastructure in into what they're building right now so that they can become part of this ecosystem that we're just talking about and we're looking at adding new capabilities that we don't have today or that are going to be necessary moving forward so that um we can participate here now i would say we're obviously thinking quite deeply about these matters we're we're pretty open-minded about exactly which elements we choose to take on and when but you know again we we think that what we do today is quite valuable and quite necessary for the ecosystems that we support and it will be more so post-merge matt thank you so much this has been immensely helpful i feel like i understand the power dynamics and the new ethereum economy so much better and yet um we all have to see how it'll all play out and uh you've given us a lot of optimism and and certainly some explanation and it's coming soon right i mean we're talking about uh the merge right in a couple of months i'm not going to hazard to put a date on this but this is all going to start happening soon so now is the time to get prepared and to start understanding this we appreciate your time matt my pleasure and and really a pleasure to be here and and for your listeners if you'd like to learn more our blog is a great uh resource there's plenty of other great resources out there you can find us at blocknative on twitter we're blocknative.com uh my name again is matt cutler you can find me at m cutler on twitter and we i regularly publish stuff i just posted some stuff this week about sort of new and interesting things you can do and my dms are open i look forward to hearing from folks matt is a wealth of information so i encourage you guys if you have follow-up questions take them up on that offer certainly we'll include links to uh the block native resources he just mentioned in the show notes a few other action items for you bankless nation of course this is the build market all right not the bear market so you got to level up one of the things you should be leveling up on i think is the ethereum roadmap so much is changing and there's so much to get educated on i've had to get educated on this over the past probably year or two and and feel like i'm still getting educated as well a few episode resources for you to go do that one is end game with vitalik where he goes through the three to five year ethereum roadmap absolutely essential listening if you're interested in that also our episode on ultra scalable ethereum where we talk about the new modular design for ethereum into the future dave and i did that episode and david did a recent episode i thought was fantastic called the guide to the ethereum roadmap with john from delphi digital uh absolutely essential listening too goes a bit more into the different different roles and categories and proposer builder separation so good pairing episode with this one as well as always guys risks and disclaimers crypto is risky so is ethereum so is bitcoin you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is
