[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how you doing feeling a little bit more educated about block space and fee markets after this podcast with nick carter nicardo recently put out this article called public blockchain fee cyclicality and negative feedback loops and we kind of go into what the significance of what nick discovered when he was researching for this piece uh i thought it was a very interesting piece and to the point where i actually read it on the bankless youtube and so if you are the type of listener that likes to hear things as you would be since you are hearing this podcast i've read this article on the bankless youtube and there's a lot of implications in there about what this means for d5 because d5 specifically has a lot of implications for what nick is talking about in this feedback loop so in addition to all that we get him on the bankless podcast to go through some of these concepts with him together yeah i feel like we've never actually done a deep dive episode david on ethereum block space and particularly gas fees like gas prices like why do they rise and why do they fall i think a lot of folks who are going bank lifts experienced that this summer and have over the past few months like you wake up and sometimes gas prices you know 20 way or 80 way and other times it's 500 and you're wondering why and you actually feel the downstream implications of that like you know what transactions are you willing to do at a fee of 20 might be completely different than the transactions you're you're unwilling to do i suppose at a guy fee of 500 and nick provides some analysis i would say of the the the cycles of this gas fee supply demand primarily and the implications of that demand so if you've never really understood um gas fee markets why price goes up price goes down uh and how that's even related to the price of eth this is the perfect episode to level up on and i think we just had a very strong example of what nick is talking about in this article in d5 where you know yield farming started with comp things started to get a little bit crazy and then urine came around and it got even crazier and then yams came around and got super crazy and then it kind of spiraled out of control to one day we woke up and gas prices on ethereum were three to four hundred gray and the ether price was pushing up into five hundred dollars and at that same time uh p the with the gas fees so high people stopped transacting and the thing kind of all fell apart to where we are now with ether you know trying to hold its head above water above 300. and nick nick contends that all these things that the gas markets the gas fees the blockchain congestion and the ether price along with defy and how some of these protocols like unit swap and and iron depend on transactions in order to generate apy and so that's that's kind of why we brought him on to the episode today to have some holistic conversation between the link between defy economic activity block space demand and block space fees so if you're ever wondering why gas price goes up if it will ever fall again what these cycles mean for the innovation of ethereum will we have a only a whale layer level one or will normal folks be able to transact in a trustless way this is a fantastic episode for all of that and we can't wait to bring it to you but before we do we want to tell you about our fantastic bankless sponsors one of the tools i've started to use recently is zapper for those of you that were part of the 2017 bull market it was characterized by just opening up block folio and refreshing it over and over and over again and also anytime you ever made a trade you would have to go into blockfolio and manually input that trade information to make sure that your portfolio that you think that you have matches what you actually have with zapper you don't have to do any of that anymore because all you have to do is zapper is input your ethereum addresses and then zapper will give you a really elegant report as to where all your money is so there will never ever be any disconnect between the money that you think that you have and the money that zapper reports to you zapper looks directly on chain and gives you a nice portfolio summary of all your assets and how many assets and all of your debt and all of your lending positions all of your positions all at once so there's no more editing your portfolio because zapper just does it for you one thing that i thought was really useful about zappers was when i plugged my wallets in i found that i had submitted liquidity to uniswap forever ago and without zapper i would have probably lost that forever because zapper knows where your money is better than you do it's also the gateway to investing your money into this ever expanding list of available d5 platforms like curve balancer uniswap yearn in the bankless nation there is this growing number of money legos and keeping track of them all is just super overwhelming which is why you could just go to zapper and zapper will will solve the problem of there just being too many money legos to choose from so check them out at zapper.phi enter your ethereum addresses and check out your portfolio and see if there's anything that you missed bankless nation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to a die which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith card tweet about it when you do i love seeing people on packaging they're beautiful bankless visa cards it makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store alright let's get to the episode with nick carter bankless nation i want to welcome back nick carter who is a frequent bankless guest now he is a crypto writer of course a venture capitalist at castle islands ventures his current twitter bio states that he is that proof of reserves guy we're going to talk a little bit about proof of reserves hopefully near the end but nick how are you doing sir welcome to bankless i'm doing great thanks for having me back on thank you for making me your your most frequent bitcoiner guest i don't know if that's actually true but i'm just gonna assume that well last time we started with that power question of like are you an etherean and i think you kind of said yes ish right so so you belong in both can't you made us define our terms first i i pre-barricaded heavily on that question as long as you haven't gone back on it all right so um on on that podcast speaking of that podcast in june that we did uh you talked a little bit about this and this was a title of a recent article but you predicted that ethereums or ethereum writ large would have to choose whether ethereum is going to be a world computer or a financial network were you right about that do you think not to get all technical but technically i didn't write that headline so you know that's like the classic thing that happens uh when you have an editor um what would the headline have been had nick carter wrote it um you know i can dig it up i had like a great great headline somewhere i i it might take me a second to find it i don't know if we want to do it uh but yeah i actually thought the the like my draft headline was great um coindesk had it that was a good click bait headline i mean yeah we clicked but that was like the source of some like discontent among you know a few ethereums that read it it's like you know like with the implication that you like have to choose obviously like you know ethereum doesn't have to choose anything it kind of just is um my draft headline which i liked was resurgent fees are a stark reminder of the monetary primacy of blockchains which i can understand that they didn't think that would like have like popular appeal much more tempered though well exactly and it's like it's like you know it's kind of neutral and that's like my objective like you know these are like the first couple articles i've probably ever written about ethereum and my objective is to be fair you know like that's i want to be seen as a neutral operator i don't really have a strong agenda here i just want to describe things well i for one like both of us uh have really enjoyed that you're writing more about ethereum it's like it's really great stuff like thanks for adding to the uh to the to the writing pool here but like what if we take that straw man that uh that was the title world computer or financial network do you think ethereum really has to choose one or the other are there elements of truth in that straw man headline i would say so yeah i never really knew what world computer meant to be honest so to me it's like a kind of incoherent term but like 100 i think blockchains optimize by their very nature to be um you know financial networks and really to be like settlement style financial networks as opposed to payment networks so like a narrow breed of financial networks but yeah i i am very strongly of the opinion that the financial use cases just by sheer force of gravity tend to win out with time so i i seem to remember this from reading the article it was basically like kind of written um partially to aetherians saying hey guys there are trade-offs here and you can't have it both ways is is that sort of the premise of of the article that you can't have scarce block space and also have like non-financial low economic density uh you know transactions at the same time or what would you say the premise of that that article was yeah so that's exactly right um and i mean it might be possible i mean it is possible to kind of like mercalize data and and you know can use a time stamp method to compress lots of data and then commit to it and publish a small digest of that data so you can still kind of commit to arbitrary amounts of data but if you want the really nice qualities you know the nice settlement and atomicity and kind of base layer qualities that you get with base layer transactions um you know i think that's going to be challenging so i'm i generally tend to believe that to the extent that fee pressure exists and to the extent that block space is capped which i think is prudent of course to cap block space then you're going to just get this relentless optimization for the largest transactions which are happiest to be fee bearing and are willing to outbid other transaction types me and ryan before we started recording we were also talking about how the the world computer metaphor or analogy it's just somewhat like nonsensical maybe maybe it fit the times in 2015 when we didn't really know what ethereum was was going to be but comparing a world computer versus a financial network doesn't really seem like a viable comparison in the first place uh and and i i i think you would agree with this statement nick that like any and every blockchain that is successful must become a monetary or financial based blockchain there's no such thing as a blockchain for like social media or something like that because because of the inherent scarcity of block space because you can't have infinite block space because then you just turn into a database because there's block because there's block space scarcity it therefore con forces the convergence of all economic activity on that blockchain to be financial in nature would you agree with that take or would you amend it somehow and i mean entirely i mean you're bidding against every other global user that wants access to the to the ledger and uh whomever is willing to pay the highest price maybe they're super irrational and they really want to insert some arbitrary data but most likely it's if they're willing to pay a high fee for inclusion that's because they're making a large transaction so the fee is proportionally very small part of the transaction like i sent a wire today wire cost me 35 to send which is preposterous of course i hate legacy finance uh let's go bank list guys um but uh you know i was happy to pay 30 i was happy to pay 35 bucks for the wire because it was like a fair amount of money you know and i needed you know instant settlement and all those guarantees so in that same um vein you know someone who's making a 100 million dollar tether transaction is willing to pay you know probably 500 bucks plus for inclusion in the next block in final settlement and so on they're gonna outbid someone deploying you know an aragon dao on chain right that's just financial gravity when we were in 2015 2016 talking about like the world computer or you know ethers gas before we understood these things as we understood them today uh what you're saying is that ethereum was destined to be a financial network from from day one simply by nature of what it is it was something that you probably could have predicted um although in fairness you know back in 2015 we didn't even really understand the nature of bitcoin that well you know a lot of bitcoiners thought we would get these trustless side chains and then we kind of figured out later on that you had to make all these additional assumptions about proof-of-work and you know sidechain operators not misbehaving and you know we didn't really understand how lightning would would play out and so on so i guess to a certain degree this whole thing is a process of experimentation but you know i think a lot of bitcoiner's early objection to ethereum was hey like some of these promises are overcooked um especially in light of uh of you know of the effects of the emergent effects of of scarce block space would you say the evolution from bitcoin as like a a payments rails or a payment vehicle to bitcoin as a store of value reflects the same dynamic as well oh yeah i mean that's a big issue with bitcoin historically is that a lot of bitcoiners kind of had misperceptions about about what bitcoin was suited for and there were all these startups that got built with the assumption that p2p base layer transactions could scale up to a global audience and that's why we had the block size war so we're really all talking about the same thing here this is a kind of recurring theme uh you know just conflicting visions of what these networks can be and it's afflicted bitcoin and now ethereum's having a reckoning with it although it doesn't seem to be you know dividing the community as starkly like we saw with bitcoin but it's all the same concept it's hey what are the constraints here where realistically should we draw the line what are we trying to optimize for and what's our kind of time preference you know do we want to unlock you know a marginal extra of 50 of block space or do we just kind of bite the bullet and keep black space capped and then try and build a layered layered approach which seems to me ethereum's going for the ladder now instead of you know incrementally adding block space which i think is probably a good call so there was this reckoning for the bitcoin community in uh 2017 as it realized bitcoin would not be a payment network and like there were forks that that thought maybe maybe it would be yet what's interesting about ethereum is that i i feel like there are still uh large numbers of the ethereum community that will still tell you no ethereum is also meant for non-financial transactions like what what would someone like vitalik say about about your post yeah but i was interesting i'd vitalik answered my my post uh a series of tweets um i don't think i i interact with vitalik much so i was kind of taken aback by that but yeah i mean he he told me that uh my interpretation of his words was kind of wrong and that uh he really did earnestly want to you know get the internet of money or whatever down back to cents for transactions as opposed to dollars and fees for transactions and he still wanted to create super abundant quantities of block space and uh that it was just a matter of waiting for eth2 and then maybe with rollups being kind of intermediate solution uh but vitalik seems to be uh defending uh his his kind of original position on this which is that um that you know there's like a teleology to blockchains like transactions should be cheap in absolute terms uh and so it yeah in contradiction to what i wrote in the post i don't think he's actually evolved his stance that much seems like he still really does want to produce uh you know really cheap transactions and lots and lots of block space uh through these kind of different like r d initiatives why do you think he wants that well it's a good question because i mean maybe it's like the unconstrained versus constrained vision uh kind of thing that uh yeah arjun wrote about in a blog post a while back you know he uh has this uh progressive streak to him not in a politic not a political sense but you know he has a vision about what blockchain should be for and their the amount of inclusion that they can offer to people um and i guess i'm probably just i would say more pragmatic maybe or more realistic um not to not to you know express a pejorative or anything but i tend to to believe in uh in trying to optimize uh what we have and what we understand what we kind of know as opposed to you know uh putting all of our our eggs in in one basket of you know sharding maybe um or relying on you know significant computer science breakthroughs to kind of take us to the promised land kind of thing so i i do think it's just like fundamentally a conflict of visions i would say that i think if you and vitalik got in a room and fleshed out some some terms and some parameters and some some bounds as to what you guys are talking about that you might come to more of an agreement than than what we've uh you know what you know 280 characters on twitter can can express uh i i would say that vitalik you know couldn't couldn't disagree with and i think i remember him talking about his agreement with a thesis that you know heavy valuable transactions push out lighter less valuable ones but what vitalik sees is optionality with scaling and optionality with packeting of data into smaller and smaller packets where like even though you're still transacting on the main chain you are doing that in kind of like you you're on a highway but you're on a bus with like seven seventy other people on in instead of you're on a car with just just you right and so you get bundled up or and and because of that you know you come off with some trade-offs where instead of being dropped off at your home you get dropped off at the bus stop and you have to walk the rest of the way or something something trade-offs like that where vitalik kind of counts it as an l1 transaction but there are still some other other trade-offs that as a result of the lack of density of said transaction that this transaction has to then therefore go through yeah and i i think that is that's a view that i share i mean my view of scaling blockchains it involves removing data that's registered to the main chain as opposed to producing more data that the block that the main chain can offer um and you know so to that end it i think that we're pretty firmly in agreement there um you know i like that's why i advocated for uh for batching which is a very simple thing uh but it has kind of the same effect um you know putting lots of payments together in a single transaction bitcoin saves you a lot of that overhead um and uh that's why i'm still optimistic about side chains i mean tbd if i look at roll ups roll ups kind of resemble side chains in some respects but yeah i think that's fundamentally how blockchains scale they don't really scale arbitrarily by um you know forcing more data through the network that obviously has really significant externalities what's kind of interesting to me is i feel like at some level the ethereum 2 roadmap has sort of evolved a bit more with like that notion in mind nick and you might call it a bitcoin or notion that there is kind of one main chain for settlement even a um an eth research post that vitalik put out um two weeks ago a week and a half ago maybe it depends when listeners are are listening to this about the eth2 roadmap like almost an alternative kind of a an eth 1.5 one and done and basically if for folks that aren't familiar with the eath roadmap what that kind of means is less urgency on a full sharded eth2 with like evm capabilities and state execution and maybe you just get basically um proof of work a data a proof of stake a data availability layer and you kind of scale in these roll-ups instead and you keep almost like something similar to the eth1 dot chain as a as a settlement chain um which which has been an interesting evolution and feels a lot more like the kind of the bitcoiner feel on this have you have you read that post or like are you familiar with kind of the the evolution of the eth2 roadmap i have yeah and i can't say i'm as familiar with it as you guys are i kind of dip my toes into the eth2 roadmap every six months or so to see what's going on um this time i finally wrote about ethereum so i figured that i had to actually learn about it a little bit better so people wouldn't you know just immediately dismiss what i wrote by saying that i was an uneducated bitcoiner which like totally pisses me off so much uh so i i did my homework you know um and uh i honestly learning about rollups was very challenging um it was it was uh there's a lot in there there's kind of a lot to it um but uh it is very interesting to see this and i often say this i think kind of ethereum ideology is sort of bitcoin ideology with a 24-month delay um not to be right or kind of uncharitable but you do notice these um you notice certain ideas which are popular in the bitcoin community which then are manifested with ethereum so i would say you know acknowledging that governance is extremely challenging maybe on-chain governance isn't the best idea that's something uh which ethereans in the last couple years have adopted um you know believing in in the quality of fees as a really important stabilizer and a way to retain scarcity in kind of the units of the network uh you know believing this layered model um uh you know avoiding um protocol funded uh slush funds to pay you know finance developers stuff like that um all these things are features which i've sort of we you know bitcoiners were sort of preaching for a while and then you know later on you see them manifest in ethereum which is either encouraging or perturbing i don't know what the interpretation is but i i see ethereum culture as like slightly downstream of bitcoin culture not to to be like unfair about it it's just like an observation i feel like there's maybe two points of pushback on that which is i i largely agree with what you're you're saying with many of the points that that that you raised on sort of the convergence there but one area of of non-convergence has been ethereum has always been steadfast on having some programmability and smart contracts on the base layer which um you know does not seem to be a a a bitcoiner kind of uh notion like that's that's always been rejected on on from bitcoiners and another thing i think uh aetherians would say is they they they might say like it feels like bitcoin has kind of given up on the vision of a peer-to-peer money at all they're kind of scaling with with crypto banks that would be almost like the the bankless editorial criticism of bitcoin even though at bankless we love bitcoin as well um but it's basically like ethereum has not given up on that scalability vision hence pursuing technology like like rollups uh and you know plasma and all of the various ways it has evolved whereas whereas bitcoin just kind of has feels like anyway only one uh bullet in the chamber which is lightning um and that hasn't quite taken off yet any any reaction to that yeah i think that's fair i mean ethereum has always been less encumbered when it comes to vision and uh bitcoiners are very adamant about uh you know not including tokens on the network you know that's definitely bitcoin i say bitcoins interested in cultivating its own utxo set and very little else um you know so it's kind of discouraged um the insertion of third-party tokens on the network and then of course uh discouraged um excessive uh complexity or expressivity at the base layer for kind of safety reasons so yeah bitcoin optimizes for one thing and ethereum is uh is much more aggressive in pursuing different value propositions i think that's very fair and that's the chief distinction between the two um on the lightning front i think this isn't acknowledged that much among bitcoiners lightning was like a very convenient kind of um sorry this traffic outside it was a very convenient sort of rhetorical stick to bash big blockers with as you know the token layered scaling system i was never convinced that lightning would be a panacea or salvation for bitcoin or that even it would be the predominant popular scaling method employed in the future for bitcoin and uh there's going to be some disillusionment i would predict you know that if lightning continues to not really take off uh in the coming years people will say well you know as a red herring um you know you guys falsely advertise lightning is the panacea here and uh to a certain degree i think it was it was wrong to over index on lightning rhetorically as a way to ward off the big blockers the correct approach should have just been to say look we don't know exactly what you know layered scaling solution is but we do know that constraints are the mother of all creativity and eventually we'll develop some some you know good layered light systems and lightning will be one of them but it's probably not suited for all second layer uh you know models um unfortunately i think there's gonna be some you know like a slight realization that you know clearly lightning is not gonna take bitcoin of the promised land again i mean i could be wrong on that but it's always the issue of managing expectations when it comes to blockchains you never want to oversaw a feature all right guys we're going to get into the details of nick's article as well as how it creates a cyclical market cycle in the dfi ecosystem but first we're going to talk about some of the sponsors that make this show possible wiring is defy's first self-building project on ethereum focused on producing products for those who are interested in earning yield in d5 why earn's various products are all built to suit each individual investor's preferred level of risk from various vault strategies that leverage defy tokens to the safer earn system which relies on stable coins vaults are aggressive yield farming robots each with a unique strategy that is designed to maximize the yield of the deposited asset wire employs some of the most informed developers in d5 to keep the vault strategies updated with the various yield farming opportunities on ethereum for customers who are more risk adverse the iron's earned product may be for you earn is a yield aware dynamic money market that automatically seeks the best interest rates across the various d5 protocols and regularly migrates your deposited stable coins between the d5 protocols that are returning the best yield at the present moment iron is a system that is just a little over four months old so things are still very much an experiment however this hasn't stopped people from depositing over 700 million dollars worth of assets into the wire system in order to find yield on ethereum perhaps the people that deposited all this money were tired of constantly making daily transactions to follow the best defy interest rates and maybe the gas fees that they were paying ended up eating too much into their profits with wiring it doesn't remove the risk of these various protocols that it leverages but it does remove the overhead of constantly trying to make sure you're finding the best yield and also so that you don't have to pay for gas to switch up your assets check out the products that yarn has to offer at yrn.finance that's y e a r n dot finance which they also have a nice statistics page to see what other people are doing your ethereum address is a bankless bank account but here's the problem it doesn't have a human readable name it's represented by this long hexadecimal string that no one can read unstoppable domains has the solution to that problem it provides a domain name for your ethereum address so instead of telling someone to send you funds to 0x e3ba blah blah blah you can tell them to send funds to yourname.crypt a domain name for your ethereum address at unstoppabledomains.com you can search for blockchain domains like this and find tools to easily launch websites on decentralized web technology like ipfs you can even have unstoppable domains help you manage your dot crypto or dot eth or even zill domain name addresses at their unstoppable domains manager websites have domain names.com.org your bankless bank account on ethereum should have a domain name too so go to unstoppabledomains.com register a domain name for your ethereum address now unstoppabledomains.com we talked a bit about the uh the coindesk article world computer or financial network and i felt like the article that you more recently released on fee cyclicality was almost a follow-up to that in a way at least it was certainly a continuation or related to that original article because you got into explaining actual data and what we're seeing in the fee markets today and you started with this really cool metaphor like a governor and throttle metaphor can you talk about that metaphor and get into the article a bit yeah so basically i wanted to explain visually what a negative feedback loop was people talk about positive feedback loops all the time and talk about reflexivity and i wanted to instill the visual of a negative feedback loop so basically this was a widget attached to steam engines that basically made them work it made them it gave them moderation made them more stable and effectively um it was uh a um a spinning valve um that would take rotation from a steam engine like a rotational input and as it rotated these ball bearings um through centrifugal force or force were pushed upwards which itself was connected to a valve which would choke off the flow of steam to the engine so basically the faster they spawn the more they would regulate the flow so it's a negative feedback loop and this basically allowed steam engines not to overheat and explode and and it made things like the textile industry you know basically function um so that was the baseline metaphor and the point i make in the article is that fees are similar to that fees regulate the usage of blockchains but maybe unlike the governor on a steam engine they do it in kind of a less predictable way maybe slightly more chaotic way so the through line that i'm seeing in this article your first article in coindesk and what we've been talking about so far in this podcast is you are on this quest to find evidence of economic density or transaction density where we we started talking about how all blockchains that would work would ultimately become financial blockchains because of the inherent scarcity of block space and in in this in this particular article you you go on a little bit of a quest to actually find evidence for the thesis behind economic density of a transaction so when you were looking for that evidence what did you find more generally i was looking for evidence that uh capped block space causes interesting emergent phenomena to to result uh and and one of those is economic density but the other ones is the other features are um you know strange oscillations and transaction count but yeah i mean i found a number of things i mean my most startling discovery probably was the fact that as fees rose dramatically in kind of late august and early september the number of smaller transactions on both tether on erc20 tether and ether itself dropped off a cliff so smaller transactors just stopped transacting and then the other thing that was really interesting that i found was a really tight correlation between fees and ethereum terms and then the median transaction size of ethereum and other tokens like tether as well so clearly there's some interesting threshold in people's minds where they're willing to pay x percent of the value of a transaction in fees and as fees climb the transactions they're willing to pay necessarily get larger and maybe they defer those smaller transactions or they just choose to only make larger transactions and i don't know what the percentage is and i'm sure it differs for lots of people but i don't know if it were up to me i would probably mentally peg it at two percent or something but the point is as fees rise as the stakes rise of transacting on chain people become less willing to make small transactions than they opt for bigger ones or alternatively again i need to collect more data on this it could just be the com the composition of transactors changes you know that certain people that are uh predisposed to making smaller transactions just cease their activity altogether and it's only the larger transactors that are left and this isn't the only time that you had seen this behavior this is that's the first time that you had seen this behavior on ethereum talk about what you saw back when you looked at the data back in 2017 for bitcoin well i didn't look at it with this much specificity on bitcoin uh those are things that i specifically sought out those data points in the ethereum context what i did see in 2017 was this relationship between uh transaction account fees and bitcoin we saw this cycle repeat six times in 2017 you're probably going to want to look at the article to visualize it here but basically as transactions rise they drag up fees once you hit that capped blocks-based ceiling and then the fees themselves actually moderate the transactional intensity so the fees are then a disincentive to transact and so then you have this kind of attenuation or you have to decline in the transactional intensity and then as the blocks empty out again people realize hey there's lots of interesting opportunities to transact cheaply on chain they start transacting again and then the fees rise again and so you have this cycle that you know from peak to peak the cycle lasts about 60 days on average or at least it did for bitcoin um and there's always a latency between the peak for transactions and the peak for fees the fees always follow the transactional peak so it's just a fascinating relationship which i didn't see pointed out much in 2017 i pointed out at the time it's just a curiosity and then when fees started to really take off on ethereum i thought to myself hey maybe this is going to happen again and maybe there'll be some interesting effects on ethereum because ethereum's liquidity is much more kind of on-chain than bitcoin's liquidity was in 2017. yeah that's kind of why we wanted to get you onto the podcast because you know the integration of smart contracts and native financial activity changes up this cycle and so just to reiterate the cycle um super clearly the the cycle begins at one part in the loop you know what we'll just start with there's there's some amount of blocks based demand and as demand increases the overall transaction count uh increases or transactions increase therefore there's more demand and when this happens the fees go up right and when the fees go up the smaller players are incentivized to transact less and in your article you call this you know it turns out that transactors on ethereum are very sensitive to fees and so people that are sending some amount of value don't want to pay a above a certain ratio of that value in fees and and transactors are very sensitive to that therefore when fees go up these people who are sensitive to this stop transacting and then the transactions decline and then the block space starts to empty out and the fees decline and then once the fees decline there's incentive to purchase that block space again because the block space is therefore cheap but what you're what you alluded to in your article is that in d5 there is so much native economic activity that is possible that it changes the game and you specifically talked about how ethereum has so much ether liquidity on chain whereas in bitcoin in 2017 you know bitcoin price discovery is uh found in uh on centralized exchanges where there isn't actual transactions on the main blockchain so in your view how does the the fact that liquidity for ether the the native token and other tokens on ethereum because it exists on chain in d5 how does that change up this cycle yeah so this is really the key i don't know if i want to say finding but this is probably the most important takeaway i think is that in a network like ethereum which itself is like an enormous dex you know you could probably describe ethereum as a big clearinghouse for value between various tokens and ether itself you know with ether acting as that liability free kind of reserve collateral you know it's the base pair for everything else and since so much liquidity is on chain i mean we have uniswap flipping in coinbase in terms of volumes so much liquidity is on chain all of these transactions require on-chain settlements um you know that effectively means that the fee break is more is more of an effect it has a more pronounced effect on liquidity and volume uh than than the fee break did for bitcoin at exchanges in 2017. the reason for that is to buy bitcoin on an exchange you have to send them a wire or an ach deposit you can buy bitcoin you can sell bitcoin on the exchange you know none of that actually requires cashing out to the chain itself you could just perform that whole process with kind of traditional banking infrastructure uh and that was just the nature of the liquidity environment in bitcoin in 2017. now to participate in d5 which was you know really the big attraction this year um you know a lot of that was you know defined native you couldn't really you know yield farm through an exchange you'd have to actually instrumentalize that on chain and uh my hypothesis or kind of presumption here is that as fees rise you're massively raising the bearer to entry for these putative defy users and they're willing to tolerate some amount of fees because the opportunities were good of course and you know there was literally free money floating around at some points with some of these airdrops and it's kind of similar opportunities but at a certain threshold in fees those smaller kind of d5 transactors got priced out and their bankroll just didn't justify paying you know a 10 fifty dollar fee to you know make a trade on uniswap or something and uh it priced out everyone with a bankroll maybe you know below ten or fifty thousand dollars so i don't have exact numbers you know obviously depends on where the fees are but certainly there are some smaller users that got priced out and the point isn't to say you know this is unfair or anything i'm not taking like the roger ver perspective where fees are like this hideous evil thing i think fees are great yeah no i'm 100 in favor of uh you know fee intensity i think it gives you tons of discretion and choice as a protocol architect right the fees are an asset you know that's the chain's own revenue and you can sort of instrumentalize that in a variety of ways and that's exactly what ethereums are planning on doing so the fees are great but they also have some potentially adverse consequences in terms of pricing out some of those users um of those kind of native on-chain defy platforms and uh when you know the conclusions you draw from that are up to you you could say well this is why we need uh you know these super scalable eath killers uh or you could say well that's just going to be the nature of ethereum for now i mean the conclusions are kind of up to you to draw but i really just wanted to point out this phenomenon and also encourage people to do more research on it i think that the phenomenon that that you mentioned like bankless listeners and people who are using d5 systems and going on the bankless journey as we call it like we feel that right dave and i probably have you know 100 or more examples of this yeah just just a few that come to mind had a had a someone in the bankless community going bankless with a small amount of money so depositing some funds into an argent wallet not a lot you know maybe 300 something in that range but then when gas fees go up it makes absolutely no sense to withdraw those funds right because maybe you're paying a 50 fee or to do anything in d5 like take out a loan starts to require a lot of money for a you know a small transaction a small capital transaction you know david i remember you have an example of doing some uh d5 farming at one point and just realizing oh my god that my farming proceeds aren't actually paying for my gas fees so this whole thing doesn't make sense i should just stop farming curve man way too expensive right so it's like the d5 equivalent of the minsky moment yeah exactly and so like we have we have tons of examples of of this and it's particularly interesting and i think um uh it uh it's unexpected for some d5 users who haven't seen one of these cycles play out when they have some small amount of funds and on chain and in liquidity pools that sort of thing and they're not expecting a sudden rise in fees right so they almost get a little bit trapped on chain i might say because then it it doesn't make sense to pull those pull those fees out i'm this happens to a lesser extent on on bitcoin because on on bitcoin you might have like wallets let's say with with trace amounts of of bitcoin that you know the the fees to move the bitcoin from one wallet to another it's not worth it costs more than the value that's inside the wallet so you get this trace this trace bitcoin and all of these wallets but on ethereum because it's a a much more i guess robust and interactive financial system a mini dex a mini financial system a mini you know stock market in a way it uh it does have some downstream effects that that users see and uh aren't necessarily ready for it also has effects on applications so applications that that plan to develop on ethereum with a certain um you know gas fee i guess parameter assumption uh they have to re-architect to um to plan for a higher gas fee world so that's kind of what you're talking about right nick yeah and i'm not you know trying to inject much normativity or kind of prescriptive findings into the discussion i just wanted to point out that you know this thing that you feel intuitively is heavy users of the d5 system first of all i wanted to kind of quantify that and try and find evidence for it and then second of all say yeah there might have to be a rethinking around which applications and kind of usage modes are possible at least in the near term you know barring any dramatic changes in terms of sharding or you know new super abundant forms of black space there might have to be a bit of a reckoning in terms of what is considered economically viable in terms of a transaction type on ethereum now of course fees have declined since then um and uh you know a lot more things are possible once again but my guess is that we do have another cycle like this and so people will be better prepared for it now you know they've been through it once uh but you know what does the theorem look like if it is characterized by these cycles you know does that challenge your assumptions about the system nick in your in your article you talk about the link between the breaks on the system because fees are too high and the price of ether and i actually didn't totally understand that connection so i'm hoping you can reiterate it here yeah so this is like maybe the most speculative part of the article um but if you look at the fees on a theorem and then the actual local top for both ether and a bunch of kind of d5 assets obviously the value of a of a d5 pseudoequity token is a function of the kind of summed discounted cash flows that end users expect to accrue to you know the the decks or the marketplace um and so effectively there the value of that token is a function of the volume and the liquidity that it you know end users expect to flow through the exchange or the you know interest rate swap product and so on but with ether the the value of ether is to a significant extent a function of the usage of ether as this collateral asset for d5 and the reservation demand for ether and kind of the induced scarcity that d5 brings to ether itself that's all pretty long-winded but my mental model has ether's value being at least partially indexed to d5 that's why we saw it eventually being dragged upwards by d5 this year and so basically the hypothesis here is that the fees act as a break on uh usage of some of these dexes um it kind of collapses volumes not you know not by you know catastrophic amount i mean volumes are still pretty high across the board they've definitely declined since kind of early september but they're still higher than they were in you know early august for instance if you look at the dex volumes and nick when you were talking about volumes were you talking uh you know nominal dollar value of volumes or are we talking transaction volumes oh yeah uh volumes in dollar terms um they've come down uh since that fee peak uh that was also the peak for early september was the peak in the ether unit price and for a lot of those defy assets which is less surprising but i do think that in this case there might be a connection between the fee intensity and the price of of ether i know that's maybe a bit more tenuous but i see i'd have to kind of do a little bit more work on this but my intuition is that some of the ether backstopping these systems in the same way that it was kind of scooped up when uh d5 you know really exploded uh to a certain extent it was disgorged when uh interests in these systems waned a little bit as the fees kind of took away some of the enthusiasm so it's kind of like if you guys remember the ico kind of induced scarcity effect in 2017 where you needed eth to participate in icos and that was really accretive to the price of eth on the way up and then catastrophic on the way down as a lot of these icos paid salaries and divested that youth subsequently you see a similar kind of related version of that same phenomenon where eath is you know a lot of eats supplies taken off the market to be employed as collateral or to be the base pair in d5 and then maybe as some of the interest in d5 wayne's a little bit the eth appears back on the market you have this fresh supply and that puts pressure on the price of each so that's basically the the hypothesis but again it's you know it's always very hard to kind of evaluate uh you know the drivers of price i definitely agree that that hypothesis is there however if uh i if i were to add something to your article that i think you missed is that a lot of these d5 protocols and these d5 tokens that have valuations themselves are valuable because a transaction in their their respective system is uh revenue for that respective systems protocol and therefore the token right and this is specifically true for unit swap but also for for iron and you know a few other other farms and yams and themselves even though a transaction with a yam doesn't add much to the market cap of yams economic activity around yams adds money into the yam treasury right and so what we kind of saw with this defy yield farming mania is that a lot of these protocols learned to produce a treasury which is what the excitement uh came about from and especially with the unit swap and wiring a transaction through these systems added a fee or ac took fees and added it to the protocols treasury right and so you you slap on this cyclicality nature due to the the this kind of like two market two month long business cycle in ethereum and defy and you slap on these protocols that are also generating revenue from transactions themselves in addition to the fees being paid to the l1 blockchain and you have this secondary secondary system that is kind of uh replicative of the the primary system and so we've seen apy from yearn or apy from providing liquidity to uniswap track the returns or those returns track economic activity on ethereum and so when fees get too high and the smaller transactors get washed out the apys for these protocols reduce and that's kind of the apys for these protocols are why we saw so much capital and new people and new excitement flood into d5 in the last few months was because like urine was offering 50 apy because everyone was using urine and same thing with uniswap like if you you wanted to add liquidity into uniswap because you know the banana farm was incentivizing liquidity to go there and therefore more people would trade bananas and and then the fees would get added to the unit swap pool and the apy for the uniswap would go up uh but then but then fees and then we hit like 400 gray and everyone like you are you are saying with this this article everyone stopped transacting and kind of like how you were just talking about with the 2017 ico mania it's a little bit of a game of musical chairs right like the only reason why the apy is there is because everyone else is trying to access the apy and in order to access the apy you have to make the transactions and so it all kind of ended up falling apart and i think that's one of the most interesting things about this article and what's recent in in the defy ecosystem is that uh so much of d5 right now depends on economic activity and what your article is showing is there's going to be this natural break that happens every so often that's going to dampen uh economic activity on defy yeah i think that's very astute and uh you're pointing out the pro-cyclical features that uh you know a lot of us noticed i i didn't really have the time to to kind of write a full analysis of that there's a few other kind of sources of reflexivity that i noticed in d5 um but i think people are attuned to that now um i guess you know there's some potential good news though right i mean maybe we'll get to this but if you believe that um your you know the efficiency the economic density of transactions is going to vastly increase with some of these uh technical innovations around the corner then maybe ethereum isn't doomed to suffer these pretty vicious business cycles maybe the that that cycle can be attenuated so that that that's going to be the really interesting thing that i'm going to be looking out for i definitely see rollups has a reservoir of economic activity that you know as the l1 gets congested like people can can flock to uh roll-ups and i think we'll talk about that later but but nick in your article you uh used this analogy uh this poker analogy that kind of uh put different characters of different poker skills around the table and i'm hoping you could uh go through that analogy here because i think it relates pretty strongly to what i was just talking about with the the returns on defy yeah very much so and uh the analogy is basically um a layperson version of andrew lowe's adaptive market hypothesis which if you haven't read that paper and there's actually a whole book about it i strongly recommend it very much informs the way that i think about markets which is to say that market participants are heterogeneous you know they're very different and uh in d5 i think this is very much the case you have um you know you have really elite players and then you have some less sophisticated kind of retail punters that are involved and it's kind of the same where the poker player in a casino you might have you know amateurs that just want to hit the felt and grinders or semi-pros or professionals and uh if you're a professional you want to select the loosest table with the most fish essentially you know with with the most amateur players and if those amateur players lose all their money then uh it's kind of less lucrative to sit there as a sophisticated player and uh the point here is that if you think about fees as the rake the rake being the kind of the fee that the casino operator charges um although this isn't exactly how rakes work so just bear with me with the tortured analogy if you massively hike the rake then players with smaller bankrolls it's not worth it for them to participate in the game and then the pros and semi-pros and grinders are left playing against each other and it's kind of less lucrative overall and that's actually what happened in online poker um as as it got kind of banned in the us and people had to move offshore and it became more challenging and a lot of those retail users uh had lost their bankrolls and i guess their wife or girlfriend told them they couldn't play online poker anymore uh the game got more competitive and there was basically less alpha to be found so kind of the same thing in d5 you know you've got these these funds that are quite sophisticated they're active in market if if the retail users leave or defer transactions because fees get pretty high all of a sudden now it's kind of the semi-pros and the pros playing against each other and that's kind of more challenging and there's less easy sources of return and again this is a little bit more speculative i don't have a ton of data to back this up i just wanted to build intuition as to why uh why the loss of of retail or call uninformed flow or unsophisticated flow uh might actually be pretty destructive to the kind of liquidity environment and make it less attractive to participate in general so yeah in the d5 space we saw you know a ton of new people come in you know install metamask make their first purchase on uniswap but they weren't doing it with you know they they didn't come in with fifty thousand dollars probably they probably came in with a few hundred maybe a thousand maybe a couple thousand so something relatively smallish uh and you know because they heard about some defy token that was going to moon and they wanted to go to uni swap to purchase it uh and but then we have like these you know very very um we have these very experienced you know firms these very experienced whales that have been in defy have been in ethereum for years now who are you know crypto native and have all their wealth in in crypto and they just have the advantage right and so as soon as gas goes up to you know 300 way the the people that just came in for to make a quick buck with a couple hundred dollars on unit swap just get priced out and the only people remaining are just the d5 whales nick you made another i guess a fallout from the article or uh some some speculation and this relates to something something that kyle uh somani talked about called defy's invisible asymptote so is there some kind of an invisible asymptote here kind of a um a ceiling that defy can't get through due to scalability on the base layer yeah and i wish i'd um and a couple people pointed this out to me and i feel like maybe i should have referenced this in the article but the truth is i hadn't seen that one before i wrote this um but i guess i'm so kyle's view is you know to the extent i understand is that well this is why this is evidence for uh creating a new base layer block chain with a lot more capacity and then building d5 there so the reaction to this so-called asymptote is probably where me and kyle differ i'm probably of the opinion that that constraint is the mother of creativity and if it weren't for the constraint we would never learn or we wouldn't be incentivized to build efficient systems that that try and increase density and increasing transactional density is the whole game here in my opinion as far as i'm concerned uh that's the challenge that's what roll-ups seek to address that's what side chains would address that's what any deferred settlement system or sub-ledgers you know and if you look how the the traditional payments infrastructure works it kind of works like that you know you have ledgers uh nested within each other and layered on top of each other you don't have everything settling to the same exact ledger or database you've got layers and layers and layers and that's how i expected to go with public blockchains that the base layer probably does resemble a settlement layer and then you have these um you have deferred settlements or batch settlements um and to me that's the kind of roll-up idea now the question is can you reconcile that layered model with the really nice qualities of d5 that's really the big critical question in my opinion or do you need final settlement for each transaction kind of immediate final settlement base layer style final settlement for d5 to work and i don't know that's that's the question i would pose to the ethereans can you rollupify a d5 contract and have it feel the same from a ux perspective as the default way that they work today and if that's not possible i don't think that's the end for d5 though i just me i just think what it entails or implies is that the average transaction size will just be structurally pretty high and it just won't be as suited for retail usage um but you know ethereum can always produce more block space for instance um but uh yeah i think let's say there is an invisible asymptote i don't think that doom's d5 defy just think it means that uh you're you're you know it's more suited for kind of larger style transactions it seems like and i'm going to grossly oversimplify i think but like there are almost three schools of thought on this right as to where where the transactions ultimately go so everyone who's been priced out of settlement on a main chain like bitcoin or ethereum well where do their transactions go and if i'm understanding something like kyle's uh take is that of course they go to a new blockchain that maybe i own a portion of but a new blockchain with that has solved the scalability issues and is much faster than ethereum and has uh very high transactions per second right so that's one school of thought that the transactions move to a better layer one with higher transactions per second the bitcoin school of thought in the absence of something like a lightning or some way to scale with base chain security uh is those transactions might move to a side chain or uh to crypto banks essentially to exchanges that then uh settle use bitcoin as a settlement layer on chain i think ethereum's hope is sort of this third school of thought that again um you know constraints are sort of the mother of invention here that roll-ups will be that that scalability layer so that essentially uh technology like roll ups and stay channels and and and plasma but but mostly roll-ups seem to be coming to the forefront will be a um a way to use these transactions and scale these transactions with the settlement guarantees of the base layer and there thereby still preserve this idea of a decentralized bankless um you know transaction layer i think that's kind of italic's hope right that that that will happen what's your take on those three schools of thought do you agree with with the way i laid that out there yeah i think that's a very fair characterization uh obviously bitcoiners are heterogeneous as are ethereans um but uh so yeah i'm still holding up hope that um bitcoin is able to uh scale in in a more trustless way obviously i'm trying to persuade exchanges to reduce the amount of trust that we have put in them kind of variety of methods we can talk about but also would be great if we could continue with this kind of increasing economic density on bitcoin as well uh so i'm i haven't you know fully given up hope that we that we uh that we can scale trustlessly with bitcoin too but yeah i think your characterization is pretty complete in effort of keeping l1 security but having scale you started your article off with the metaphor of the governor right where there are these weighted balls and the energy from the steam engine spin the balls around and as the balls spin slower the the valve closes and as it spins faster the valve opens and this uh finds natural equilibrium with how to govern the steam engine right and you're connecting this to the cyclicality of fees on a blockchain where fees go up people stop transacting then when people stop transacting fees go down and then people start transacting again but there's a number of l2 solutions which i think can act as reservoirs of this energy right and so like the balls on the governor they're weighted but they're still relatively small and so an alternative model of a governor exists called a flywheel where a flywheel picks up the energy of the system persistently when the energy is created and then when the energy dissipates you can tap into the energy supplied to the flywheel in order to keep the energy in the system moving forward and this is how hybrid vehicles work right so when you're driving your prius and you hit on the brakes the energy gets captured from that braking and gets put into the battery and then when you later when the red light turns green you put your foot back on the gas and the energy in the battery goes into the engine to move the car forward and so as ethereum is generating this economic activity it also generates its own breaks but with roll-ups roll-ups can act as this l2 reservoir reservoir of more transactions right and so as as the block space in the l1 becomes more and more in demand and pushes out smaller transactors well they can go and run to optimism and optimistic roll-ups where there is basically infinite block space because uh because of how roll-ups work and how optimism works and they can get on to the optimism chain and and transact on the l2 and kind of wait for the tide to go back out right and and i think a an optimistic centric view of ethereum has this natural flywheel effect where the energy boils on the ethereum main chain and that pushes energy into the optimistic roll-ups and as the main chain releases its energy the activity back from the roll-ups goes back into the ethereum main chain is that is that kind of how you see roll-ups as a system or do you kind of just see it as a scaling solution no i think that's that's very well put and uh from my my uh kind of investigation into roll-ups i had a similar conclusion i think that um i don't know if it's going to be zika roll-ups or optimistic roll-ups that are more popular but i do see them as a reservoir for those on-chain transactions to the extent the chain is congested i think the really salient question is what is the nature of a transaction on a roll-up specifically what are the settlement assurances of a roll-up-eyes to transaction as opposed to base layer transaction and how easy is it to you know make those transactions kind of interoperate with with other related systems do they have the same composability guarantees that's kind of the number one question i have um you know what what are the prospects for roller coasing you know whole wholesale defy contracts and making them communicate uh you know clearly and efficiently um but yeah i mean certainly the vision of rollups uh seems pretty compelling to me i guess the question is how it interacts with defy and practice i do know that the eth online event that is currently going on right now that there are a number of teams trying to figure out how to find workarounds for the withdraw period making rollups you know a step in the right direction when it comes to having you know similar capabilities and assurances and guarantees as the l1 blockchain but you're totally right it is uncharted waters that is currently in research phase right now yeah that was kind of my conclusion from looking at optimistic roll-ups specifically zk roll ups are a little more black boxy to me and i haven't really understood them completely but with or it seemed to me like i wouldn't consider an or transaction final until that you know unhappy case period had elapsed uh even though most transactions won't have to you know you'll have the happy case where there's no conflict or anything um so to me that like seems slightly different from you know your standard ethereum transaction which maybe settles you know in a few blocks i agree it's kind of like it's pseudo it's pseudo settled until then um can we can we talk about something else so some people listening to this to this podcast are like hey like what's the deal with expanding um block space to just handle this right some chains have done that how are other chains handling this problem so it seems like bitcoin and ethereum are similar in that they've said look there are constraints on the amount of block space that we have in a given time period but other chains talk about you know free free gas like no gas transactions or super high transactions per second where the gas is cheap and you know many of these are labeled ethereum killers and that sort of thing but do you have any thoughts on or a critique of other chains that are advertising low or zero gas fees yeah i mean frankly no other chains have meaningful levels of usage so such that we can evaluate their claims uh empirically you know so plenty of other chains made you know gas or block space effectively free and so they kind of subsidized block space and made trade-offs on validation and then they had a lot of transactions but it wasn't really economically relevant if you actually look at the composition of these transactions it's kind of like junk data being inserted uh so we haven't really seen any of these other alternatives tested in the wild um but yeah my my stance on this is is pretty consistent i i think metering resources using fees as that uh that kind of gating function and keeping block space scarce really is the way to go here um and i think in the long term you're going to have great returns from maximizing economic density of transactions as opposed to just naively trying to increase block space and making validation really costly which to me you get back at the same same traditional financial system where you have a handful of super nodes that control everything and that doesn't really seem uh very new or interesting to me yeah so why is it important for anyone to be able to run a node well we're getting to like you know the you know the the the philosophical fundament of blockchains here and i guess it probably depends on your perspective but i think the whole point of these systems is that you can participate in them without too much trust required and you can audit the supply of these assets and you can verify that an inbound payment is genuine you know you can reduce the cost of counterfeiting very low or the cost of detecting counterfeiting so to me the blockchains are all about first of all they're monetary in nature and then they're all about verification uh verification that a transaction is valid and if you can't do this as an individual then you're probably going to get taken advantage of at some point and if we want to render the hierarchy flat i think we have to make nodes cheap or at least reasonably cheap to operate so that's kind of my stance always has been you know like people give ethereum for the cost of running a node but i've certainly seen much pricier nodes out there which are virtually impossible to run even on you know really high-end enterprise infrastructure so nick this has been awesome to understand your thoughts on kind of economic density and and how those articles came together well we've got you we want to do some you get some some your quick takes in like a lightning round or as david and i sometimes call it the roll-up round so um the first is this there are now almost over actually over a billion tokenized bitcoin on ethereum right now so it's like one percent of bitcoin's supply what does that mean is that bullish for bitcoin ethereum both what's your take uh mutually beneficial i think it's good for both chains uh it's good for bitcoin gives uh people a different way to engage with bitcoin uh you know i might question you know the trust guarantees of that peg and and you know the trustlessness and so on but leaving that aside um i think it's it you know is a interesting way to potentially transact with bitcoin in context that you couldn't before so i think it's good from that perspective from ethereum's perspective you know one problem i noticed with d5 is kind of a lack of high quality collateral to use in the system it seems like people are trying to insert bitcoin now because it's got you know fairly nice volatility characteristics may be compared with some of the newer more incipient tokens that exist there so it makes for fairly good collateral too so i think it's it's good for both systems recently bitco instituted proof of reserves but then on twitter nick you said that this isn't that big of a deal uh a why should we care about proof of reserves and why does b bitco's implementation of it matter less to me proof reserves means something fairly specific which is if you are a depositor and you have a custodial relationship with a deposit-taking institution you want to be able to verify that they a have assets corresponding to your liabilities that the iou that they owe you and b that your um your liabilities included in that kind of attestation um so you want them to prove your assets and then you want them to prove that they specifically have a claim or that you specifically have a claim on those assets so that's just like a pedantic point that's what proof reserve means to me maybe it's going to get this more general uh you know definition to me the bitco situation is like you're comparing an on-chain um you're just comparing one blockchain to another you're comparing the supply of some utxos on bitcoin to uh supply of tokens on ethereum that are a claim on those utxos i wouldn't necessarily call that a proof of reserve that doesn't mean it's not important it just means that it's kind of a different process maybe you do need an intermediary there to obscure the specific utxos where bitcoin is custody in the coins i don't know the specifics there i haven't really looked into it um i think it's elegant and good that all you have to do to ensure the trustlessness of that system is just compare some bitcoin balances to a token balance on ethereum it just seems like a different process than like the classic proof of reserve that i have in mind which is more applicable to deposit-taking institutions are proof of reserves and smart contracts with transparency on chain um basically converging are they kind of the same thing they accomplishing the same purpose well your classic uh proof reserves unfortunately tend to require a third party attestation like an auditor basically and there's almost no way around that because you have to account for the full liabilities of the exchange and uh you have to kind of make sure they're not cheating so a proof reserve in like the classic sense is not a fully trustless or kind of cryptoeconomic operation whereas if you know you're comparing balances on chain or you're auditing the uh collateral quality for maker for instance and all of that is on chain um that's kind of innate like anything that's crypto native is gonna be easier to audit because that's the whole point of blockchains now that said there's always going to be these dependencies on outside systems which is where these kind of attestations or proofs of reserve come in like for instance for maker if you wanted to audit the clutter quality you'd actually want to drill down and audit the dollars and the bank accounts back in usdc for instance and that's when now you have a dependency on an accounting firm or you know this outside attestation so it's kind of hard to get away from that fully you know like i think that's that's maybe like one critique some people would have if like defy is that it has reinserted dependencies on these like not fully trustless systems um like in the case of maker for instance um whereas you know you get these really nice like risk management and auditability qualities if you are dealing solely with like crypto native collateral will ethereum 2.0 be delivered as advertised uh will something named ethereum 2.0 be delivered almost certainly i don't know it's currently advertised in its current specification i mean just based on history my guess is that the the specification changes again but granted i don't really know too much about it so i'm not very well placed to opine on that last one for you nick so the current i guess dip that we've seen so far bitcoin eath kind of a price stall uh what's your prediction does that continue or is this kind of a dip moment in 2020 yeah 2021's gonna be great the weird thing is that the you know crypt investors seem to be looking to macro factors and they seem to be looking what the dollar index is doing and and the likelihood of congress you know passing additional stimulus which is funny that we have these like dependencies on these outside things so we're kind of like a very small ship floating on a very large and chaotic macroeconomic sea so like the endogenous crypto factors maybe don't matter as much um so to a certain extent it's like catalyst driven it's like who wins the election how aggressive you know is the senate in terms of like injecting new dollars into the u.s economy uh which is weird to think about but you know generally speaking i think um you know the large cops are in a good position um i would say eath is probably more exposed to you know the the little crypto native economy it's cultivated on its own chain although that's already experienced significant deleveraging so maybe it's it's going through that process right now um but yeah i i it is weird that it's like we're looking at crypto as a bet on negative real rates and like to what extent how deeply negative are they gonna be um but yeah obviously have a positive view on it so recently square just announced that they put 50 million dollars of bitcoin into its reserve making it the second publicly traded company to own bitcoin uh is but also square is run by jack dorsey who you know might we might as well just call him a bitcoin maximalist is this a big deal or is this not a big deal it's not a big deal in terms of price impact like one marginal 50 million dollar buy doesn't move the needle that much these days which is pretty astonishing when you think about it but uh it's a big deal in terms of signaling uh kind of normalizes bitcoin as this balance sheet asset i mean it's not what i would do if i was running a publicly traded company to be frank with you but clearly he wants to send a message to his peers basically and uh send a message about his commitment to bitcoin so from a signaling perspective i would say it's it's pretty interesting nick thank you so much it's been an absolute pleasure to have you on to talk about these concepts related to economic density explaining your work explaining your your articles everything else so glad that you are writing about both bitcoin and ethereum these days dave and i've got to come up with a episode title but uh you know something that uh that that captures some attention how about this one nick carter says ethereum's only for whales how will that do i see i i i don't know if i said that we won't do that [Laughter] we will be very measured in the way you know i mean obviously i have like my opinions about stuff but uh of course you do you do a good job with it yeah yeah just kidding you do a great job and it's always fun to have you on nick carter thank you for coming in front of the bankless nation once again today we really appreciate it thanks guys my pleasure once again all right guys uh actions and resources two follow-up articles that we will include in the show notes one is a nick's coindesk article about the world computer and the financial network that he did not name but is great reading material the second is the article that we talked about for the majority of our time with nick about fee cyclicality in ethereum and also with bitcoin we'll also include a link in the show notes to the adaptive markets hypothesis paper that nick mentioned from robert lowe so make sure you dig into that as well finally we need some more five star reviews from you on apple itunes david we're doing well but we need a few more right we are going to get the bankless podcast to the top of the itunes charts as d5 grows but the in order for us to get that done is we need those five star reviews so if you could go to wherever you listen to podcasts and give us those five star reviews so we can grow the bankless nation we would really appreciate it all right guys risks and disclaimers of course bitcoin is risky eth is risky crypto in general is risky you could lose what you put in none of this was financial advice but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music] you
