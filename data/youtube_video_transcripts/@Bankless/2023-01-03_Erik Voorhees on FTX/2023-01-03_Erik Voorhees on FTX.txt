what was that like for you watching all of this Fallout happen just so recently after you had this debate with SPF this was the biggest Calamity that has ever befallen crypto the speed with which this unfolded was really profound I had no suspicion that anything untoward was going on with that exchange during that debate I was going to try to tear Sam apart on the principles and then to learn just like a week later that he's actually the one causing the biggest fraud ever was surreal and during the debate I was like man I'm really getting him and I was taking a little bit of pleasure in that but I guess a lot of it might have been because he was sitting on a 10 billion fraud he had the microphone like 90 of the time of that debate and you were only saying one or two or three very sharp sentences it felt like watching a soccer game where one team had the possession of the ball for like 90 of the time but the team that had the possession of the ball for 10 minutes scored like eight goals yeah well that's like how you get a good message across has to do with the message and in how few words you can do it he was struggling because he didn't have like any foundation of principle on which he was arguing for these things yes
