so that's pretty cool so I guess flat on the week my numbers are already I put the seats 30 minutes ago Dude by the time people hear this it'll be inaccurate anyway Guys these numbers are all it's always inaccurate 12 hour lags bankless Nation it is the fourth week of April it's Friday morning so what time is it David let's see Friday banquist weekly roll up time Ryan where we roll up the entire news in crypto that happened in the last week which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persist nonetheless you ready to get into it Ryan what happened this week I'm ready man it's good look first of all though it's good to see you uh back in your place we've been doing a lot of uh these road tour roll ups and look you've been doing from a hotel rooms airbnbs like everywhere and now you're back you're back in San Diego at least for now yeah we have two more Roll-Ups here before this place goes away forever wow and uh wow brand new uh apartment in Williamsburg will be the background it's great David's background is constantly changing mine is always staying the same the immutability of my background David I'm not going anywhere yeah I need to do rendering for your background for whenever I move all right man so uh topics of the week first we gotta discuss Elon Musk he just bought Twitter okay in an effort maybe to preserve free speech I don't know that's what he's saying but also the same day something else happened what happened it's Donnie kuchov of Ave and also lens protocol gets banned from Twitter because it's so ironic because Elon Musk buys Twitter to preserves free speech in the same day stani gets banned from Twitter for tweeting out a joke about how he is the interim CEO to Twitter I mean you can see why Twitter would ban him it's like that's well that's false news so like banhammer But the irony of that happening the same day uh is interesting and so we actually interviewed stani and we'll get some cuts of that interview here in the weekly roll-up when we talk about Elon Musk buying Twitter also there was an optimism airdrop this week this is the the starting pistol for layer 222 we're going to discuss the details the metrics the governance system again at all and finally what's the last one here David Edward Snowden has been a secret founder of a crypto project that we had no idea about until now so we're gonna get all of those details what has he been up to what project is it that is coming later the show guys before we do that got to tell you about graph day because it is conference season that's why David's backgrounds are always shifting because he's going to all these different conferences after permissionless the next one you need to go to particularly if you are a builder is graph day graph day is happening June 2nd it's going to be a learning session on June 2nd a ton of fantastic speakers followed by a three-day hackathon okay speakers like who David name some of these out for us oh so many we got Kevin owaki and from git coin we got Arjun bhuptani from connects Camila Russo from the defiant she's gonna be there uh also one of my one of my personal heroes in the space Rhys lindmark is going to be there as well we got Ava Balin from the graph foundation and so many others Jake Berman who Jake Berkman who killed us on nfts in the first place they're all going to be there so if you are looking to bootstrap your web 3 career if you just want to hear from the builders or if you're looking to hack and be a part of the hackathon the graph Day event in San Francisco June 2nd to 4th is for you you there is a link in the show notes to get 50 off if you are so inclined you should be so inclined especially if you're a builder this is the the place to go but David let's get into the markets first you know what is more than 50 off Ryan yeah what's what's more than 50 off you're gonna tell me it's Bitcoin it's Bitcoin it's Bitcoin Bitcoin started the week at forty one thousand three hundred dollars it's down three point nine percent oh gosh it jumped actually since I wrote These numbers uh so my numbers are out of date uh started the week at forty one thousand three hundred dollars I thought it went down 3.9 but it looks like it only went down uh fifty dollars because apparently it's mooning as we speak so that's pretty cool so I guess flat on the week my numbers are already I put the seats 30 minutes ago Dude by the time people hear this it'll be inaccurate anyway Guys these numbers are all it's always inaccurate 12 hour lags yeah at least uh anyway so we're what are we kind of steady on the week yeah on the week flat on the week wow my numbers got rugged by Bitcoin all right well let's go to Ether and see see how good or bad these numbers are it's got to be down too since you wrote this right yes yes right okay so we started last week at three thousand eighty dollars we are currently at two thousand nine hundred and sixty dollars we're down just a couple percent on the week uh not too bad not too bad yeah kind of a flat week and the eth Bitcoin ratio we were down at the time of recording as well what does that look like yeah we were down 1.5 percent it's probably gonna be uh about there still nonetheless how about all of crypto total crypto market cap uh we are at let's see 1.9 trillion uh below 2 trillion mm-hmm sad that's a shame ended last week at 1.98 trillion we are at 1.9 at 3 trillion right now okay but last fit lost 50 billion dollars in the crypto market cap and so but what's a few billion dollars you know here's the thing we're we're kind of crapping out we have been for the last few months crab season back and forth not necessarily up or down just kind of back and forth but we should also count our blessings because US dollars is heading towards all-time highs the Dixie this is where you measure US Dollars hasn't looked like this in a long time we mentioned this last week and it's been up only since last week and what's the big story here it's not that US dollars are up but US dollars are up and yet what and yet crypto prices are flat so like relatively it's a it's a win I think because it usually when the Dixie goes up crypto prices go down uh and so when the Dixie goes up a lot as if it has as it has because it's actually higher the Dixie is higher than it was during the depths of covid where people were fleeing two dollars uh in the in when during that March liquidation event uh people are fleeing to Dollars and we we are well above that point in the Dixie right now and yet over the last I don't know like month or so crypto prices are flat historically when the Dixie goes down crypto prices go up bigly uh and so right now we're watching the Dixie go up and crypto markets stay flat if the Dixie goes down well crypto markets still go up is a bit Yeah the Dixie is kind of a short-term fear Index right and so you're talking about that spike in March 2020 when covet happened and the spike all the way up in the dollar and yet and what happened to crypto it went the complete opposite direction absolutely tanked and now markets are fearful again and yet crypto is not getting too hit to impact it and of course in markets all of this comes on the back of huge gains that crypto investors made in 2021 last year so while this year feels a little bit like crab season last year was like Boom Town crypto investors made 163 billion dollars in gains in 2021 that is according to a chain analysis report and they've looked directly at the data to derive that number uh incredible 162 billion dollars what do you think yeah I mean it's no wonder that like all of a sudden sports stadiums now have like companies names including ours as their as their uh as their new naming rights right I just love that this is chain Alice's report chain analysis just like the this I have Sauron of the government probably sending this information straight to the IRS oh definitely absolutely they are average chain analysis uh chain analysis is advertising their services to every tax jurisdiction in the world yes like hey you want some money because all governments want money right now uh look at this 163 billion dollars sitting for you we know where the capital gains are it says it says chain Alexis this is also why you should pay your taxes incidentally as well I mean there are crypto people who are like how are they gonna know I'm like chain analysis doesn't know how to town attacks jpegs uh ens bull market yeah right there has been a bull market in dot eats the ens domain name haven't heard a lot about ens at least you know kind of in the narrative section since their big airdrop and ens price governance token responsibility token price has been down since but I've always seen this and I think you have too as like maybe the best nft out there one of the OG nfts and what's happening now is ens registrations are going like crazy particularly in is it four-digit ens names yeah yeah low digit ens names like three digits were also hot but there's just so few of those so four digits are the ones I think there's like something like 16 000 combinations of four digit ens names so you know not that many if we're talking about like the URL of the future internet uh and so for this uh ens broker which looks like a bot Twitter account says 70 to 100 four-digit ens registrations in under an hour only six thousand 622 remain so not all of them are minted so that's what's going on there's like a gold rush to Mint the remaining four four digit combination ens names look here's one that went uh55.eath went for 55.5 eth so it's just it was sold for 55.5 feet I think I think some of this is coming from uh nft world right so people are like basically buying the you know their board ape number or their or their crypto Punk number that's some of the speculation you see that snap is one available yeah it's like yeah so you now now you're getting the most snap it's the 10 key K nft market right and so people are you know how there are uh crypto punks who go by like I'm six four one zero or whatever and so why not have 6410.e 1118 is already minted is that your crypto plug that's my crypto Punk yeah too late see yeah what do we talk about on a bank list it's too late yeah someone's gonna sell it to me for 1118 uh decline on that one yeah there you go I got rsa.e I'm hoddling that um but this is crazy if you look at the revenue ens revenue is now greater than all the fee revenue of Bitcoin right now yeah at this point like so is everything else is higher than Bitcoin like Bitcoin just doesn't generate Revenue dude but it kind of needs to for a security budget uh bitcoiners should be a little bit more worried about that than they are yeah uh the ens revenue is also kind of the ens security budget because that is the value flow that the ens Dow governs over uh and part of the uh this enf ens Mania is probably triggered at least a little bit by fallon.ethjimmy fallon.eth the biggest.eth name uh yet he is I think number one on the leaderboard now or at least no excuse me he's in the top 100 most followed Twitter accounts with a dot eth in the Twitter name so congratulations Jimmy Fallon also owner of abort ape and then of course there's also Budweiser beer.eath we all know that Budweiser by beer.east previously but now Budweiser owns budweiser.beer.eath this is a future of ens sub-domains so if you own something.eath you can make something.something.eath kind of like how you can make a goo like a gmail.com right like I own I I own money legos.heath did you know that Ryan yeah I knew somebody did yeah so I could sell david.moneylegos.eath or I can sell you Ryan ryan.moneylagos.eth and so now Budweiser how much you want for it uh you I'll give it to you Ryan oh my God thank you David I appreciate you I'll give you a david.rsa a day I love it it only trades these uh so yeah budweiser.beer.heath maybe dude I would love david.beer.eath I like beer david.beer.e [Laughter] think of the possibilities right like not a lot of people I I absolutely absolutely um that's all the combinations anyways this is a PSA uh to claim your ens drop because the last time that you are able to do that is on May 4th if you have for some reason I don't know maybe your private keys are locked in a safe or something somewhere you don't live some or somewhere else like you need to go get your private keys and like unlock your ens airdrop by May 4th or else it's gone forever so if you haven't done that yet uh don't go do that you know that's happening to a friend that I know yeah private keys in a safe yeah I don't know who that would be their airdrop so is it worth the flight home or not I don't know no no I have the safe here it's just um yeah you know what this also goes to show you that like nfts are the gateway to the rest of ethereum they really are here's Fallon buying aboard ape right wouldn't have even known what a DOT the dot uh domain name was prior to his board ape but now he's doing fallon.eth and he's the biggest one and that propagates it because he's got bajillions of followers lots of Market sections just going up when it got air dropped it got air drops at something like an eight to ten billion dollar market cap just eight points like valueless governance token of this unbuilt thing came in at 10 billion dollars and like literally every other like responsibility token that gets airdropped just is like down only versus like basically for example of course it's the ape coin which governs over nothing is gets air dropped at eight to ten dollars and is now at twenty two dollars at a 22 billion dollar market cap right you sound a little upset you sound a little are you salty about this this is ridiculous uh like but this is so classic board names like and I knew this was gonna happen I'm pretty sure I said this on the Roll-Ups like I'm like everything that the Apes touch just goes up uh and so like why won't this go up as well uh and look at this this is the ens drops about all of the virtues and values of the ens with an actual product that's built and it's ready not only higher Revenue than uh Bitcoin and down to like two billion dollars so like 10x 10x 10x there's no fundamentals like maybe I'm missing something I don't pay attention to the AP custom it system that much but like yeah what the hell dude I don't get the fundamentals don't matter in crypto attention does um and apes have the attention and so they have the capital in the short run that's how it works guys that's the lesson uh enough of markets because we're tired of talking about it we'll be back with some releases of the week then we got some hot news for you and of course the rest of the show but before we get there we got to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible the era of proof of stake is upon us and Lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone lydo is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using Lido's distributed network of nodes don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral and defy with Lido you can have both using Lido you can stake any amount of your eth to the Lido validating Network and receive steth in return SC East can be traded used as collateral for Lending and borrowing or leverage on your favorite D5 protocols all this without giving up your ease to centralized staking services or exchanges Lido now supports Tara Solana kusama and polygon staking whatever your preferred proof of stake asset is Lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake if you want to stake your East Tara Soul or Matic and get liquidity on your stake go to lido.fi to get started that's l-i-d-o dot f i to get started the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need Bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer to life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain Bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously Lacross bridges are powered by uma's optimistic Oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a

that's a-l-t-o-i-r-a.com slash banklist and start investing in crypto today alright guys we are back with the releases of the week this one's big this is part of the D5 mullet thesis David which is basically fintech is going to look nice and fresh in the front the party's going to be in the back that's the D5 mullet and the party is of course decentralized Finance right that's here that's not bankless bankless in the back uh this is an example of that fintech giant stripe they just jumped into crypto with a feature that lets Twitter users get paid in stable coins what is the stable coin I believe it's usdc are they deploying it polygon an ethereum Layer Two slash side chain and this is really interesting because stripe has talked for a while about like ah crypto whatever it's a fad they actually abandoned they adopted Bitcoin as payment and they abandoned it back in 2018. now here they are in 2022 re-entering stable coins on ethereum this is uh this is the utility that that D5 mullet gives you uh kind of cool to see no this is what we love it this is why layer twos are so so important and in the layer 222 revolution has only just begun and so stripe is getting ahead of a curve here before other payment providers so as layer 2 progresses I expect a lot more things of this nature here all right coming up next there is volt protocol now live on the ethereum mainnet volt protocol is a CPI adjusted stablecoin and is now live and so if you don't like losing the value of your dollars due to inflation there's a stable coin on ethereum that can help with that uh volt is a fork out of the Fey protocol and so I was using phase protocols code base which is generally well battle tested as far as stable coins go uh and then they also integrate chain link oracles to help with the CPI adjusted number over time and so as the chain link oracles report a an increasing inflation the value of the stable coin will go up and there's also just a bunch of uh D5 2.0 Mafia gang people I think you'll recognize a lot of people here Sam kosmani from frax we had him on the show recently Joey from tribe J from Rari Tim Baco as well and of course the man whale himself Tetra node so really solid project or a really solid team behind this project yeah equal to C more more entrance into the freight excuse me those are not those are not people in on the project those are just Angel Investors but they probably are going to help nonetheless I'm sure they will um speaking of helping Fidelity they're helping Bitcoin right now and they're helping all of crypto they are allowing retirement Savers to put Bitcoin in 401K accounts this is absolutely massive David because so many companies use Fidelity for their 401K service Fidelity has something like a 2.7 trillion dollars 2.7 trillion dollars with a t of assets under management wow it's absolutely insane 23 000 companies yeah it's a little bit more not much more but 23 000 companies use Fidelity for their retirement uh plans and you know Bitcoin is coming like Bitcoins here but other crypto assets are coming in fact they mentioned that in the press release Fidelity is the custodian here okay so Fidelity is taking custody of the Bitcoin uh assets too and they've developed out their custody service for like the last five six years so that's all in place um it's really funny in the The Wall Street Journal article that I have linked here at the bottom there's quotes from the labor department of the US saying this is seriously concerning and that people should use extreme care when investing in crypto so a little bit of fun coming out of uh the Department of Labor because they are of course material scared of Bitcoin and Fidelity put a cap on it so the max cap is you can only YOLO in 20 of your retirement account right so it is still a traditional Finance like we don't want you to be too risky not too much crypto on on the cap there but still a big step in the right direction correct direction yeah super cool and it's big look this is gonna usher in a lot of new money into the space yeah awesome well again directionally correct nice job um this is another cool thing Angelus is rolling out usdc so Angel lists is kind of a you know a place that Naval actually uh you created it's a place for Angel Investors to like um Network and connect to uh to to startups and so the traditional way if if you were an angel investor you wanted to invest in a startup you had to wire funds or ACH transfer the bank and now they just rolled out usdc another example of stablecoins usdc winning and like I am so glad that we don't have to wire funds as much as we used to when that goes away that will be a happy day for me David there are some Angel Investments that that we've participated in Ryan where they're like no we can't accept usdc you must wire funds and we're both like well I'm not sure anymore yeah wait you're a crypto native company and you want me to wire funds from a bank account like all right what are we doing here folks yeah angel angel list those rolling that out for everybody this is another thing you want to talk about this Nike yeah and artifact they're doing something yeah artifact they're the nft studio reveal crypto kicks the first ever ethereum nft metaverse sneakers uh I mean there are sneaker heads out there they're like the OG nfts before nfts were really a thing right like you know people some people collect coins some people collect stamps some people collect sneakers uh and sneakers generally be the most future of those things so I guess it makes sense to put sneakers into the metaverse like sneaker heads they don't even wear their sneakers anyways they just collect them so I guess it makes sense to have nfts they look pretty sick as far as shoes go uh but yeah that is what is going on uh you want to see what these puppies are going for on openc oh I don't but you're gonna tell me anyways uh here's floor price uh 2.1 each okay it's not terrible oh come on man how much like so convert that into uh dollars what's that like seven six thousand two hundred and thirty one dollars would you you pay that for a pair of sneakers if you were a sneaker head David absolutely not but it's a JPEG Ryan of course what's the maximum amount you've paid for sneakers oh are you sneaker culture guy no absolutely not I have my pair of Nike Nike Dunks I paid like 80 dollars for I had one yes I had one red and black one and one blue and white one and on Fourth of July I would wear one of each that's awesome man so no Nike sneaky sneakers for David but I bet you pay more in the metaverse though there's always the metaverse premium Ryan I guess there is now uh David's jpeg protocol what's this jpeg protocol uh dubious name but okay uh quite dubious I don't need to explain that okay you don't know Ryan doesn't know but this is a kid this is this isn't somewhere else we don't need to go uh jpeg collateralize nfts uh we know that this is on the frontier this is coming out now there is the P USD stablecoin uh which you can get a uh borrow at two percent uh which is uh pretty low as for a fee so if you put you put your nfts into jpeg you get to borrow PUSD at a two percent uh interest rate um and that's how you get liquidity on your jpegs they also have this insurance mechanism uh actually I'll get to that in a second users can borrow up to 32 of the floor price of their jpegs in PUSD liquid liquidation will happen when the debt to equity ratio equals or exceeds 33 there is a chain link Oracle for that floor price I truly hope that they've thought about gaming because like you know you can totally game the floor price of something they must have thought about this uh I don't know how they did but like I can't imagine that they just like that in there they also have Ryan an insurance mechanism which is only made possible about the how because the underwrites the debt so users can purchase insurance to repurchase their nft in case they get they get liquidated so like if I put my crypto Punk up for uh upper collateralization I borrowed against it I got liquidated I could go with that insurance which cost me five percent uh I could go back buy back my jpeg uh rather than just having to buy back any old random crypto Puck and that is right do you think this is kind of why the metaverse premium exists because you can't do that if you're a sneaker head you can't do that with your sneakers right but you can do this with your six thousand dollar metaverse sneakers you can actually take a loan out against it yeah and I I also it just makes me laugh do you know in the future how many like 12 year olds are gonna like become Millionaires and then go broke and then become millionaires again and go broke because of this sort of mechanic mechanic you get like nft game items suddenly they're worth like tens of thousands of dollars overnight and then some 12 year old like goes and leverages them on JPEG and like loses it all doesn't understand what it means to leverage up all of your jpegs I always as soon as I realize that NFC collateralization was going to be a thing I've always been of the opinion that this is going to result in a lot of nfts changing hands and a lot of people being really upset because like I mean we all know like the the I keep on harping on the ape community so sorry about that but I'm going to keep on doing it like if they lose their private Keys they're going to take an unreasonable amount of debt probably like those students it's easy to do that yes as soon as it's easy to do that it's probably going to happen and like there's just going to be a big churning of like d gen nft holders because there's going to be some nft drop they're not going to have any more cash they're going to go to JPEG and collateralize their nfts and leverage up on nfts the most ridiculous thing to leverage up on and then Ryan they are going to get jpegged this is this is great because uh we you know I've been hoping for better Financial education in the US in the world for like kids this is how they're gonna learn look man this is how everyone learns unless you lose a lot of money unless you get liquidated better to learn these lessons when you're 12 years old you're getting jpeg then rather than get jpeg when you're in the early 30s and you get jpeged on your house yeah just just hand that tax bill off to Mommy okay uh there you go um 12 year olds having to pay taxes on nfts what is happening ah so much great stuff with crypto um let's get to races though uh another one billion dollars has just entered crypto in the form of a new fund this time Joe McCann is Raising Joe McCann is a targeting one billion dollars not one targeting one billion yeah okay well I bet they'll be able to do it uh this guy's career has spanned um Microsoft also um asymmetric passport Capital look man the tldr is another one billion dollar fund has entered The Fray I've been talking like channels people are like well private Equity where are they going to deploy all of this in crypto it's getting crazy like these these deals that you know aren't public for credited investors a billion dollars has to go somewhere where is it gonna go it's just going to increase the valuations of all of these crypto startups so it's absolutely insane dude like 1999. you know what we should do Ryan like there is there there's a number of stories I've heard of just like insane valuations I heard a story where some startup founder was doing some like modest raise at like 20 to 30 million dollar evaluation which is not modest but now it is uh and then the VC firm that wanted to that it was going to lead that round came back to him and said hey we are going to double the valuation that you're asking for we'll let you raise it 60 million dollars but you have to give us all of it because they don't have any places to deploy all the capital Ryan so the the private Equity rounds are extremely overvalued uh and there's so much cash laying around and you know what is happening Ryan is everyone is forgetting about the Blue Chips they're forgetting about Bitcoin they're forgetting about eth and like I think a mistake that people like perhaps Joe McCann are doing is they're thinking like okay get me into crypto I don't know what to buy so like diversify right I just invest all across the board and just diversify me into crypto not not realizing and not real not knowing that like Bitcoin and eth are basically indices they're basically indices of the whole entire crypto market cap ether is formally an indicate of the ethereum economy and so they're they're making the mistake of thinking okay like I don't want concentrated bets deploying my Capital everywhere but then they're deploying their capital in these overvalue valuations and they're forgetting about the Blue Chips Ryan what should we do we should start a startup that takes in money from all these investors and we just buy eth and we're gonna outperform every single startup ever in the last year that's kind of what I was thinking if I had a billion dollar VC fund first thing I'd do is I'd be like thank you for your money I'm deploying all of this right away and I'm buying a billion dollars worth of eth yes and then I would take that Eve I would stake a portion of it and then my objective would be to go beat the value of eth measure all of my denominator would be eaten all future Investments I would weight them against is this going to appreciate relative to eth or not if it does I deploy there there's gonna there's our fun David we just made it and and and Ryan it's going to outperform every other fund or every other like yeah private Equity Fund that came out in the last year I'm firmly believe in that we'll see we'll see maybe we'll maybe we'll announce the launch next week David uh every single VC fund operator is like listening to this is like you guys are idiots yeah but they definitely are but for those of you listening you're idiots but who knows who knows an idiot he'll see him there but this is uh his firm oh he's part of this firm dragonfly Capital we should talk about this yeah raise 650 million dollars in their third fund they actually can't deploy money into eth so they are restricting that they have to do it into private Equity uh and so 650 million dollars into dragonfly capitals third fund extremely successful fund uh I actually did a show with his Eve on layer zero about how to be a VC if you want to get into the brain of one of the most articulate VCS out there uh and what it takes to become a VC that was a really good episode uh dragonfly 650 million dollars third fund it's like man I want to be fair I want to be fair to VCS they actually crushed it last year the last couple of years relative to eth right they absolutely crushed it so I guess you know there's Credit Credit where it's due liquify they're building a Carta of web 3. Cardis where you basically track your your pre-public uh shares investing whether whether you're an employee and you're getting vested shares or whether it's some sort of a startup and liquify is bringing that to web 3 companies doing that with Dallas I assume so um something interesting going on there David next up yeah this is pretty cool ethereum scaling solution scroll raises 30 million dollars from Bain Capital and some other Angel Investments of which Ryan and I are some of them uh so disclaimer there Scrolls building a ZK evm I met some of the teams at Amsterdam at Mev day talented group of people uh and some other Angels include Santiago Santos Anthony cesano and many others in the ethereum community yeah scroll is a really interesting layer too they've got some work to do though first it's not going to be ready for me net uh for a while um zero X they just raised 70 million dollars from Greylock openc and Jared Leto why yeah Jared Leto's actually the actor of one of my favorite movies it's called Mr Nobody but very few people actually know that movie it's a good movie it's not I've never I've never watched it but Mr Nobody is now investing in zero X so it's cool the celebrities are getting into the game too a little bit um David jobs report you ready for it let's do it okay this is our weekly reminder to tell you to get a job in crypto oh my God this first job looks amazing I'm gonna read some of them out Elite Community manager at crypto skulls Dao can't even imagine what crypto skulls does but that's you got to get that job senior product engineer at parcel Junior engineer Bank list and ethereum core developer nethermind golang engineer starknet clients nethermine bankless newsletter editor we're still looking content manager at tally director of developer relations the salinity architect marketing manager at mesha ux designer Prometheus Community manager the DJ and dogs Club co-founder for a TBD D5 primitive a back-end software engineer agmi I could go on but I won't there's a link in the show notes to all of these jobs and David is exhausted because he's been dancing this whole time as usual what do we have to say about that just get a job in crypto help David dance less by getting a job in crypto and making this jobs board go down if you want to post your job there's a link in the show notes also ballot bankless.palette.com jobs now also there's this thing called the talent Collective for the other side of the matchmaking market so if you are good talent and you want to be uh you know pitched to join other people's company there is a talent Collective where you can upload your resume and and be have your uh your your resume be reviewed by all the companies that are hiring in crypto so that is sometimes that's a good play you know you play hard to get you just like make them come for you that's exactly right all right our first news item the biggest Elon Musk just bought Twitter a couple weeks ago he said he was wanted to buy it Twitter said no they've been doing The Stance back and forth It's all public it's very great now he purchased it so breaking news Twitter and Elon Musk reach a deal on the bio to be announced shortly that was announced I'm not sure if it's fully closed yet but it's basically for all intents and purposes Elon Musk now owns Twitter neat uh how do I feel about that uh I think pretty good I think pretty good I mean he built he he built one of the coolest car companies that exists he's sending Rockets to the moon so like you know don't fade Elon and his ability to innovate like turtle will probably be pretty cool uh as a result of that um I have a take later on the show about this but you know uh I think probably big changes coming to Twitter I don't think he bought Twitter Ryan just to add an edit button or just to do a few other tweaks like no he didn't want to just add that he's got big plans Elon Musk never has small plans he only has big plans well I hope one of those plans is actually to distribute ownership to you know those who aren't Elon Musk and maybe we'll talk about that because what's still going on right now is people are getting banned often for no reason and stani from the Ave protocol D5 founder was actually banned just this week we actually had a conversation with stani this morning and we're gonna play the highlights now stani how's Twitter Dale going for you like what's what's going on here not very well to be honest there's no one to talk to here you know I I feel like I don't I feel like I don't have any audience I I have I have all my audience and Twitter um and I got banned and and I don't know who to talk to look if you're on Twitter any social media account for that matter you don't actually own the property there right you don't do you own don't own the list of of your followers it's completely private property and we are viewing the actual tweets on YouTube and I just want to recap this okay so this is innocent this is innocent AF this is like even wholesome it's funny stani tweets breaking joining Twitter as interim CEO clearly an Elon Musk style joke and then it's a follow-up he offers an actual like tongue-in-cheek list of solutions of what Twitter should be implementing moving forward if I'm on the product team of Twitter I'm like jotting some of this stuff down potentially uh and he says this thank you for the opportunity to work at Twitter my first agenda in the roadmap for the first 90 days is ship and edit button open source the Twitter Algos add support for ens and ethereum integrate with lens protocol I ask you the viewer is this a bannable offense on Twitter like what is going on no due process no explanation as to why this is not a threat of violence in any way shape or form or incitement of violence how does this break the the policy of of Twitter these are some of the questions I have but now this is Elon musk's problem isn't it because Elon Musk just majority purchased all of Twitter which makes him kind of the the governance vote for everything that happens on this platform and we have also seen Elon Musk dabble in the world of web3 you know he loves to pay attention to Dogecoin which is like almost web 3. uh he knows what ethereum is he knows he knows the basics of this are you optimistic that Elon Musk might actually look into the fundamentals of what web3 is and how it when why it has drawn so much excitement from the the world around it and perhaps use his platform use his now majority share over Twitter to turn Twitter into something like web3 uh I I very very much hope so because uh there's just so much value added in in the web 3 um pretty much like a even if you think about protocols uh on-chip protocols with with different kinds of rules whether it's decent class Finance or web free social media um or or something else so it's very valuable uh and and efficient way to actually provide the ownerships to the users but also if you kind of like approach the whole idea of um you know who is the epicenter most valuable uh kind of like a um stakeholder in in social media it's it's pretty much the users and the way we have built social media is that uh we extract a lot of data from the users and then pretty much use that data and algorithms to essentially sell different kinds of services to the user I mean in terms of like literally uh social you can actually we turn around this this mechanism in a way where the user is actually the the the the the one who owns it owns its own network and and then these applications experience layers algorithms are actually competing um to to provide the best Services uh bringing transparency and and other values I have tweeted this tweet L as an experiment I'm wondering if I'm about to get banned oh you're not joining Twitter as an interim CEO Ryan I I I'm I maybe I will maybe we are all CEOs maybe that is the web three-way I think that's ultimately what we are saying here is we should be CEOs of our own Twitter account so if you want to tweet out breaking joining Twitter is interim CEO you can let's see if we get banned here I really like that line you said Ryan we should all be CEOs of your own social media account you think about that on the spot yeah yeah well yes I mean it's basically what the Tweet was saying right it's like um Stoney was I want to be the I'm the new CEO of Twitter and it's just like you know what we should all be CEOs of our individual Twitter accounts that is the decentralized web3 model isn't it yeah that's exactly right all right right and the other big news of the week optimism introduced the optimism Collective which is code word for releasing an airdrop uh so that happened on Tuesday morning we did a show with um an hour and a half long show going all the way into the details about the optimism Collective what it is uh and it's basically a two house model uh and so it's got the token house which is governed by I think you can guess a token but it also has the citizens house which is kind of this new innovation and they have this bicameral system this two-party system of sorts uh where one is focused on the short-term incentives which is the tokens and the one that is focused on the long-term incentives which is the citizens house the tokens houses of course composed by all the people that own the tokens the citizens house are on-chain identities on-chained people governed by a soul-bound nft so an nft that is fixed to your wallet you cannot transfer that you have been given because the optimism Collective has deemed you a valuable contributor who understands how to drive sustainable growth to optimism ethereum and the new internet and so this whole idea this whole concept is that optimism can use the block space revenue from the optimism layer 2 and it will generate that generate that revenue and then we'll it will send that to uh to the the protocol and the citizens house will govern over what is called retroactive public goods funding which is going to unlock something that I think is super massive Ryan and I are about to record a podcast about this because Ryan I think this is a billion dollar opportunity toward by the end of this year and probably more than that and then by starting next year it's going to be something like a 10 to 50 billion dollar opportunity what is opportunity block space Revenue going to people who create public goods this is what optimism has pioneered where you can if you think that you can build public goods then you can get money for that and not just a little bit of money Ryan uh this whole concept of retroactive public goods funding is injecting Silicon Valley type incentives but allowing for public goods to be a product this is something brand new in the crypto space I'm extremely excited about it I think this is the new Alpha for the rest of the 2022 and 2023 because this I think will become standard for l2s l2s will need to invest in infrastructure they're going to use the revenue for their block space to do it and they will need Builders who can build products that have never before has been seen on the face of this Earth which are public goods so the upside potential of a tech startup but the product potential of a public good brand new brand new thing out of crypto we needed crypto to unlock this and this has never been seen before I'm really excited about this you know another term for public goods that people are probably familiar with because we use it all the time is um open source software yes like that is open source software and that is one of the main public goods that people will be creating uh clients and all sorts of Open Source tools that will support the crypto industry that's exactly right in addition to these airdrop and this new optimism Collective they have also created the optimism Foundation which will be the way that the optimism public benefits Corporation the the or Company the company that has existed thus far will start to add in other members that are not part of that company to start to slowly dilute the original members and be a path towards decentralization so the optimism Foundation has been created and it will eventually defer all governance rights of the foundation to the on-chain citizens house eventually a big step forward for building out an ecosystem of contributors for optimism so the members of the two members of the optimism team Jing and Ben will be joining the optimism Foundation Carl from optimism will be sticking around with the optimism Labs which is a new organization the the protocol Engineers of optimism sticking around and then over time this will be a fully decentralized but of course Ryan there was an airdrop and so uh five percent of the total supply of optimism was airdropped uh just last Tuesday you can go check your eligibility I've got a couple eligible addresses which is just lovely if you've donated to gitcoin you're eligible if you have been quote price out of ethereum you're eligible if you have uh done a bunch of other things I think if you've used optimism deposited into optimism and used it for four weeks you've got an airdrop there's a bunch of different ways to have gone the airdrop if you've got the airdrop for multiple reasons there is a multiple reason uh bonus and then there are tiers to that as well so if you did all six I think of the criteria for getting the optimism airdrop you've got the third tier bonus size so you get bonus for doing more things so that is is pretty cool and the other cool thing Ryan is that there's not just one airdrop that is airdrop number one uh and so implying there will be also airdrop 2 and airdrop 3 and airdrop 4 going forward as determined by the community and what is best for the optimism Layer Two what are we looking at here Ryan uh this looks like some data some transaction and wallet data I think for for optimism and it's really cool to Benchmark this and actually look at you know the usage of the thing because the optimism network is being used pretty heavily I think it's actually the sixth uh the the network with the sixth most fees and they did all of that previously without any token okay so this is uh definitely top 10 of all chains and so what we're looking at here is the number of transactions in wallets over the last 30 days there's been about 66 000 wallets so every wallet is like a bank account so 66 000 bank accounts um a total number of addresses that have been created on optimism 330k so these could be all potential citizens some citizens might have one more than one bank account a lot of fees being generated here too I've got some other charts here David before you go on though very very important to note there's two two metrics I want to pull out here last 30 days optimism has saved 192 000 ether from getting spent on gas and because it has saved that much easier being spent on gas it has been able to collect 520 ether so this is the business of optimism and it's saving users it saved users over the last 30 days 192 000 ether and for that service it collected it's for itself 520 ether in 30 days and Ryan you can see what happens when a token gets injected look at the bottom left chart transacting addresses per day up and to the right in the final days of April because of the token transacting addresses uh on a daily weekly monthly basis you can see that all go up into the right transactions per day up and to the right this is what happens when you inject token incentives we know this is true and if you go look at Ryan Avalanche which is like optimism a fork of Geth when they started doing liquidity mining incentives that's when Avalanche started really succeeding really getting tvl and driving usage and optimism has been able to do comparable amounts of usage before having a token Ryan so this is why we're calling this the starting pistol for L2 22 it's got to come with the tokens and the cool thing about all of these layers twos of course is because they are a primary consumer of block space on ethereum and so they ultimately they settle on ethereum because that's where they're driving their security so this is optimism's layer one gas used per month and transaction fees the amount of transaction fees they are actually spending the amount of block space L1 purchase purchases they have on ethereum so what does this indicate to us yeah I mean you can just see that especially that that top chart of just the gas per used per day just going up and up and up especially now that there's a token and as layer 2 is built out we are not even close to being done with reducing fees on Layer Two so that's also going to drive a ton of adoption and of course that is going to increase the total transactions of on the layer one burning ether on the layer one because of course as we have said ethereum turns into to a settlement layer not for people but for other blockchains optimism layer 2 and other layer twos like it are the settlement layers for people the L1 is the settlement layer for other blockchains and then I thought this one was funny Ryan as soon as they airdrop the token like look at that Spike at the very far right side like just two hours in a sense dropping a token the number of unique addresses on optimism jumped from what was that 350 000 to where it is now at over 800 000 inside of one day four hundred thousand unique new addresses came onto optimism because of the token l222 man it's right around the corner I mean here's here's the reality here's that list uh that we talked about earlier optimism is the sixth Most Feed generating chain right now and it's above Solana for instance just below arbitrum which is another layer two it's getting close to passing Bitcoin and then Avalanche and binance are the only higher ones and then of course ethereum it's just Nails home I think something that we've been saying we expect layer twos like optimism to compete with the alternate alternative layer ones of the world so it's kind of like an execution layer competition here it's Solana Avalanche versus layer twos it's really what's going on and it feels like because ethereum is positioning itself as a settlement layer is something different it kind of stands on its own it's part of the reason we've been a a little um bearish on the alternative layer one narrative not that there won't be other alternative uh ethereum chains of course there will be but how will they fare in the backdrop of layer twos that are getting usage getting market share getting uh free low-cost Economic Security from ethereum and then starting to issue tokens that that'll be the big question I think that will start to be answered as we get into uh as we go through the rest of 2022. optimism's live stream viewer account when we did our live stream with him was our second highest ever after Mark Cuban this is what happens when you release tokens you get attention and we all know that in the crypto space attention price follows attention and tokens will put the attention back onto layer twos retroactive public goods because we are funding public goods for not just optimism not just for ethereum but for the whole world eventually will eventually push ethereum into mainstream legitimacy and also layer 22 22 will also lead us into the merge Ryan I'm just feeling really bullish about the ethereum ecosystem it's because we needed the tokens the L2 tokens all along yeah I could tell and I do think this uh the citizen house is a really unique design and gets us away from the the thing that I've been really Disturbed with with kind of you know token governance which is this plutocracy where you basically have token holders and capital holders that set all of the rules so I'm really hopeful that that will be successful um other news I guess on the ethereum side is Ridley Scott his production house Ridley Scott director fantastic movies like alien uh aliens Gladiator Blade Runner that sort of thing his production house is pretty producing an ethereum documentary yeah it's going to be based off of Cami Russo's book her fantastic book The Infinite machine and so a great history of ethereum walks of you before ethereum was even a thing into where it is now uh and so I can't think of a better book to base a documentary on so congratulations to Cami Russo a bunch of news is coming out next week about that uh and so I'm just excited to watch it man more and like Ryan I'm there's two other ethereum documentaries that I know are being worked on under the uh in not in secret but just like you know they're working on it and so like there's also the era of ethereum documentaries coming to things like Netflix or whatever other Studios and this isn't a documentary right this is a full-scale movie so they're gonna have to actually find actors to play all of these rules I believe it's gonna be a drama yeah dude who's gonna play Vital this is going to be like The Social Network you remember that movie who's gonna play vitalik who's going to play uh Charles hodgkinson who's gonna play Joe Lubin uh like so all of these characters are completely unreplaceable Irreplaceable well really I can't I can't think of anyone in Hollywood today that could play vitalik yeah no neither could I don't pass my mind I got a few for Charles though we'll save that for later at least a few uh infuria let's talk about that it was down last week last Friday I believe the PSA here is even when inferior is down and metamath doesn't work there are alternative nodes and our friend David mihal has a fantastic website where you can see at any point in time any of the data providers whether they are serving uh data or not and metamag you change your metamask settings and tap into one of these if something like inferior goes down so not awesome but we are not fully reliant on uh in in Fiora I mean if if you're hearing that kind of thing it's like it's absolute flood it's not true haters yeah so and you could just like prove that by redirecting your node to something else you can even run your own node and uh process transactions that way but let's get to some nft stuff David uh what's this first one yeah Moon Birds Kevin Rose's Moon Birds nft profile picture uh uh project a bird sold for a million dollars within one week of launch yeah they're all owls called Moon Birds they're all owl owls uh and the floor price on these things have just like left people completely astounded I think the last I checked it was a 33 ether floor for this profile picture nft and this just goes to and teaches about the power of community because this is not just a profile picture project this is a profile picture for a specific community that has a bunch of Highly researched highly engaged nft collectors that are here for the long term being stewarded by our friend Kevin Rose uh and so this it's just a combination of like some cool pixel art plus a very powerful Community behind it yeah I can't believe these uh these numbers um but they're also getting getting some major funded funding so um Alexis ohanian's VC firm just announced along with some others true Ventures as well a 10 million dollar investment into the moon Birds ecosystem so that happened this week also there was some controversy this week as well so the moonbird c-o-o Ryan Carson announced he was leaving the project and I think that that took some in the community by a surprise who thought that you know Kevin and Ryan some of the others were in it for the long term I think Kevin Rose is completely in it for the long term all indications point that way uh but uh Ryan Carson left he's now starting an nft firm there are some back and forth about that and um you know some price reaction as well but I don't know I feel long-term pretty bullish about about this project and um I think the team is positioned to execute I don't know about these valuations though like it's just I I it's it's really hard to get my head around why Moon birds are worth what they are worth but I mean you could buy when we first had Kevin on the podcast you could buy a proof pass for like a few eth at that time wow and now that that's gone up massively in value since since then and has paid dividends for those who've held it so this is the bankless curse we bring people along because like yo this Project's really cool we do a podcast on it and we forget to buy stuff every single time yeah do you remember like the most painful one is probably uh what was the most painful one there's so many in 2020 when we got like nft pilled and and uh you were like hey how are nfts any different from this painting I had do you remember that podcast he did of course of course right we should just use crypto punks as an example I was like how is it any different from this crypto Punk painting that I have on my wall two years later and that took like that took two years later that's probably nine months nine months it was nine months uh anyway I have a I have an answer as to why the the floor price has done so well is because Kevin they're doing it like the the proof Collective is like this uh Community bottom-up like alternative to paid research like somebody some people instead of just going and Googling and looking at bias research they pay for research to be done about things and this feels like that where the community is engaged and the community is serious uh and so when that Community is successful Ryan there they all have a bunch of money because they all research stuff together that's good there's such strength in community they have so much ammo to pump the the bird price floor because they all have made each other very wealthy that is my interpretation of the of the Moon uh the the proof Collective and you notice I have a bird right behind me that's because uh this was given to me uh David and I have stepped in enjoyed as advisors of this project and I think it's because we saw a lot of like parallels with the bankless community and with proof like at some level what proof is doing for nfts is what bankless could do in the future on the defy side of things with some sort of of membership so there's a lot of commonality a lot of synergy between these communities and uh you know Kevin asked us to be part of this and we want it to be because it's a cool experiment that we hope to bring maybe into the bankless ecosystem a little bit more maybe there's some potential for collaboration opportunities so we'll see have to see how that that emerges but the power of strong communities who are super knowledgeable in crypto is just like that's all you're doing you're buying you're investing in communities at some level the network effects of communities right and you plus you can't share Alpha on Twitter because it's not Alpha anymore so you gotta you gotta grow your very like specialist network of of Alpha and that's what they've done with nfts that's what we want to do with defy and there's always a power of composable communities there's a ton of overlap between the bird Community the proof community and the bankless community and so we're going to work on the defy side of this whole entire thing listeners or people that are watching on the YouTube drop a comment in the show notes as who's got the better bird you can see my bird on the left it's the pink background with the moon hat uh you know you're only asking that question because you know you got the better Bird that's why yeah you think I got the better liver Brian my bird looks a little angry you know and I'm a little angry I'm only anger when do I get angry David I've never seen you angry once well I I just I don't get angry usually but this bird is angry so you know David is not angry man that bird is determined thank you all right determine to go bankless let's talk about the Solana ecosystem you got something here yeah yeah Solana nft is a crazy nft drops birds are not the only crazy thing happening in nfts uh there there is okay Bears the new nft project on Solana beats out all every single one Ryan every single nft project to ever have day one volume uh which is all of them uh okay Bears beat all of them be friends is now number two it got dethroned from number one as the highest nft project with the most amount of volume uh coming in at 13 million dollars in 24 hours me bits is now number three at 12 million dollars in 24 hours followed by what's now number four at invisible friends at 10 million dollars Solana and the Solana okay Bears came in at 18 and a half million dollars in in sales inside of the first 24 hours they look a lot like board Apes they look a lot yeah grapes that's cool and look this is bullish I think for sold price because uh the unit of account and the unit of exchange the money in the Solana ecosystem is sold so all of these things are being priced in Souls so that is somewhat bullish to the extent that Souls get used as money in the in Solana ecosystem that's monetary premium uh let's talk a little bit about some other news that came out open C just acquired gem what is Gem David yeah it's a it's a floor sweeper so if you just don't care about what you buy but you know you want to buy a collection you can just go to gym say I have a five youth budget a one eighth budget whatever a 50 youth budget and you can just press buy and you can just sweep the floor automatedly in an automated fashion and so now that functionality is part of openc that's a really cool Buy in kind of a tuck in acquisition the the trouble with some of that according to the community is like gem users were hopeful that gem would release a token and now that they're going into open C that's increasingly unlikely because openc is somewhat stated that they're planning to go the IPO route not do go the token route unless Forest so uh no token it looks like for Gem at least in the in the short run and maybe maybe forever yeah real quickly here Central African Republic is now accepting Bitcoin as legal tender so we have moved into Bitcoin macro adoption news so another country has adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender and we are also perhaps about to have a third because if the president of Panama signs it all that's left is a signature it will also become legal tender in Panama so two big dubs for Bitcoin this week uh almost almost two one for sure almost a second uh and so this is uh the final step is the presidential signature and Bitcoin can be legal tender in almost three countries by the end of this this week Ryan that's crazy that that's happening so quickly um let's talk uh regulation but first maybe this is not quite regulation Snowden and Z cash what's the tie here yeah yeah so there's been this Anonymous semi-anonymous contributor to Z cash called John dobberton he was part of the ceremony for launching the zcash network we'll get into that in the details turns out that was Edward Snowden from from Genesis uh turns out Edward Snowden was one of the original uh uh signers on the what do you call a trusted setup is what they call it so Z cash uh it's got there with a zero knowledge technology there's this thing called a trusted setup where a bunch of people come and they participate in this like zero knowledge ceremony and in order for this to work one person just needs to permanently destroy their keys and if one person does it then this whole thing is completely decentralized right uh and so uh the the final ceremony which was held in locations across the world because we're on the internet it was in the October of 2020 uh 2016 and that's where people all destroyed their keys uh and as long as again as long as one of these people destroy their keys it works and everyone has said like oh I destroyed my keys too and John doberton who was one of the original guys turns out it was Edward Snowden uh Ryan if Edward Sonnen told you that he burned his ceremony Keys would you believe him yeah I think especially in 2016 before any of this stuff was valuable I mean the man is principled enough to be like extradited from the United States yeah right so I would I would say there's a there's a high chance of that and so this is coming out and this is giving Z costume additional legitimacy as well and giving this some attention so it's a cool project really like what zcash is doing and I'm not sure this will increase their favorability like uh in the market favorability not well in the market but also just like U.S Regulators I mean they already don't like Snowden you think this is going to make them excited about zcash and Anonymous cryptocurrency prospects yeah that's a good point that's a good point that there is a coming just like Collision that we know is happening is privacy on blockchains and regulation oh God here we go all right this is coming out of uh the time the Tron ecosystem Justin Sun the infinite copycatter has imitated Tara to launch an algorithmic stable coin usdd on trond and with a reserve of 10 million dollars for the Tron Dao and also has intra basic interest rate of 30 so trumping anchor at twenty percent be higher gotta be higher so Tron refuses to be outdone and so just copying the terror ecosystem once again uh copy Couture or Justin Sun you know it's it's a little sad but the saddest thing of all is that it actually works it's worked for him in the past and he's just playing the same thing it could work for him again all right last news item the ECB some officials gave a speech there Central Bankers of course for the European Union I'll just give you the tldr but we'll include the link in the show notes the tldr is the bankers say crypto is scary and that we should be scared of it and what do they say to do about it well inject some additional regulation this speech goes through four points of that number one they gotta treat all crypto like banks that is the recipe that is the prescription for fixing crypto number two State surveillance for everything they want to make sure that they collect all of their taxes including taxing the hell out of proof of work uh number three adding disclosures everywhere it's interesting is I partially I I partially agree with like the centralized pieces but I don't think they're they're realizing that defy has like disclosures written into the code it's all open anyway no disclosures exactly and number four make everyone uh basically registered financial advisors right so a lot more disclosures a lot more certifications like it goes through this in more detail I've I've super summarized it but I feel like this is uh this is how to miss the next internet in four easy steps basically um I think central Bankers are right after a fashion that that crypto and defy and like does need some more regulation in spots but if you treat this entire industry just like the traditional banking industry you'll get what you've already got which is a broken system that doesn't service the people and services the elite few that's the end of that you can read the full report if you want but we're going to cut to sponsors and then be right back with the takes Ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now Ave

this guy Ryan Sean Adams he says the more toxic the community the more insecurities is trying to hide if you were confident in the success of your crypto you wouldn't be toxic you're toxic because you're worried don't at me Ryan I love this take what inspired you I wouldn't Inspire this one man I was inspired by toxic communities David like toxic communities it's just this it's just kind of a pattern what I mean by toxic communities is just uh communities that kind of like swarm you they they drowned out all possible logical responses right they call everything fud uh they hurl insults without engaging with the argument and they use like swarm techniques and often these swarm techniques are like pushed down by some sort of a cult leader that says hey get them get them and then they kind of like they're so there are communities like that and I just I kind of identified what the what the pattern is and they're all just a little bit scared they're a little bit worried it's like a human fear type response and I think that is the source of this toxicity if look if you're if you're confident that X chain is going to dominate like you don't want to be toxic yeah yeah why do you have to like project these insecurities through toxicity I don't think you have to I think the quiet confident chains and communities are the ones um that um yeah that are not worried yeah that's exactly right I have so much to say about this but we'll have to leave that for another day uh I thought this would take was interesting this actually is not about crypto but Jon Stewart warns the authoritarianism is the greatest threat to Comedy as he receives a Martin Mark Twain humor prize the reason why I want to bring this up Ryan is because authoritarian authoritarianism is also perhaps one of the biggest threats to crypto authoritarianism is just a threat in general uh it's a it's a threat towards expression and comedy is a an expression of just that humor and and social life and social culture and crypto what it is is a financial expression we get to express things in the financial ecosystem much more than we previously could which is a threat to authoritarianism so Ryan authoritarian authoritarianism not just a threat to crypto also to Comedy uh and I like both of those things I agree I um if you hear a political take on Bank list it's not going to be right or left it's going to be anti-authoritarian every single time 100 uh let's go to this next one look at this very clear divide this is on crypto Twitter and you notice two clusters here uh one a cluster is kind of like and if like and it not nft nft world I would say and the other is a cluster of like sort of the crypto money type people and these are these two clusters and they're living almost like separate lives in different tribes what do you think of this yeah well on the left you can see the erc20 folk and on the right you can see the ERC 721 that's kind of how I divide this there's some people in the middle I bet I have people like a DC investor would probably find himself in that middle cluster somewhere the crazy thing is like the whole like top third of the whole nft side are bored Apes so just like it's showing you how gargantuan the ape Community is uh which is interesting in of itself and also for the podcast listeners the nft cluster is like three times larger than the crypto Twitter last her and so like it's just showing you how much adoption came in the last year because of nfts oh I think there's tons of people in the nft world that have no idea what bankless is probably like no idea whereas that would be a bit more rare I would say on the crypto Twitter side of things all right well you know what Ryan we don't know who they are either that's true that's why we're in separate clusters somewhat uh it's pretty cool more surface area uh David this is uh this is a take from you why don't I read it out if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together that's not your take it's not my point that's an African proverb or or something like this and uh that is a shout out to you and there is a meme that we're looking at one says evm equivalence the other evm compatibility could you explain this meme for us yeah so there's this concept of a Peloton right like no not the Silicon Valley like exercise machine the Peloton is like the cluster of bicycles in in cycling is when people are racing they all cluster up right to reduce drag and this is what open source software is the more open source software can tributors you have contributing to the same piece of software such as the evm such as Geth things go faster the network effects are shared because when any other developer contributes something to Geth everyone who's using that get standard gets to benefit from that when you Fork death and turn it into something else or if you just rebuild something else completely from scratch you don't get to join in the Peloton you are bicycling solo you don't get to draft on anyone you don't get to drag on anyone and so you are not in the Peloton and the Peloton Ryan if you're in the middle of a Peloton like in the middle of that very big one it you you reduce drag by like five by 95 at times so like it's basically effortless to keep up with the network effects whereas if you have a smaller Peloton or if you're just going slow solo you have to Bicycle you have to work so much harder than the Peloton so the Peloton always wins and this is a metaphor for open source nature collaborative nature versus BC backed forks and that is to take care of wrote an entire article on this which I'm super proud of actually I'm bankless it is also a video on the YouTube that you can listen to as well I think the big takeaway here is if you want to understand the evm that's the ethereum virtual machines Network effect read David's article because that spells it out in detail and I think it's very bullish for the evm and for ethereum so expect nothing less from bankless a bullish article about ethereum uh David this is another take what's this yeah this is coming from bartai from Layer Two beat where uh he uh one of my takeaways from eth Amsterdam is that everyone is hiring and there's no one left to hire because everyone has gotten a hired so we have an extreme Supply glut of talent so I asked bartek for somebody because he's looking to hire at layer 2B bartek what are you looking for for a prospect at layer 2B and he says these four things and if you can do these four things you can get a job that's like 200 000 plus as an engineer for 50 different companies so it can make you extremely competitive and he says willingness to become an L2 expert in the shortest amount of time possible implying that they're willing to hire people who are unknowledgeable in layer twos but are very very hungry for it full full stack typescript a must web3 and understanding understanding web3 typescript is a nice to have plus a passion for exploring the frontiers of the bankless world shout out to us I guess thank you and also excellent communication skills so what are you waiting for is what he asks get a job in crypto as we say all right guys that was all the takes coming in to the final question I've got for you Ryan what are you excited about I'm excited about the permissionless conference David okay so this is happening Palm Beach Florida two and a half weeks I can't believe two and a half weeks we are busy dotting the eyes and Crossing all of the t's on content um I'm excited about a few main stage sessions that I'm going to mention number one we're doing this panel with Chris Dixon that's okay we did the mental models uh for web3 with him that was like a fantastic podcast number one referenced yeah and um and you know I think we're gonna do some of that it'll be a repeat of some of that but also some really new Concepts and christics and is great on anything especially in person we're also doing a why we're all here panel with All-Stars uh Evan McMullen Kevin awwaki Justin Drake and Mariano these are four individuals who are perfectly situated to explain why we're here like why crypto and then we are also doing probably my all-time favorite podcast is it yours too absolutely okay the crypto Renaissance podcast with Josh Rosenthal we did that episode Josh Rosenthal is bringing that to life with some new really interesting additions with a keynote presentation and that's just day one what I just said to you is just day one and also all of the kind of the you know like party events and everything that's going on all the great conversations we're gonna have uh permissionless is going to be awesome I think there are still tickets left maybe not too many but still a few this is going to be like Max packed sold out six thousand people seven thousand people biggest fight conference ever really excited to be involved in this one yeah and for those that haven't listened to the Josh Rosenthal podcast you do not know what you're missing is absolutely crazy the number of times I go to a conference and people tell me that that specific episode was what made them drop everything and get into crypto is like I can't I haven't been able to count it's been like 30 or 40 or 50 or something like that that's awesome man and the other takeaway from that podcast was that we are speed running the renaissance renaissance took like 200 years Ryan but we are going to compress that amount of time into just like 20 in the crypto Renaissance that's why this is a whole Revolution is so powerful and it's been over a year since we did that podcast with him so we have basically like a couple decades worth of the Renaissance to catch up on so I'm excited to see what Josh Rosenthal has in store a few a few brief centuries have flown by since then uh all right David what are you excited about man dude I'm excited to meet you man it's like 10 days away before before either this whole thing falls apart because we don't like each other oh my God or it just goes just fine uh bankless LLC has an Airbnb where all of us are going to be in the same place for the first time ever uh and including where I get to meet my co-hosts here that's gonna be awesome man this can be fun yeah I guess the the bankless podcast hangs on a knife edge it could go either way yeah I'm optimistic though David I think look I think I think I feel like I have met you and like people people are like you've people are blown away that we've actually never met like they're legitimately blown away because I've spent God knows how many hours right with you in like the metaverse like according to everything like I feel like I know you I don't know but look man we get in person something changes I don't know maybe I'm maybe not a total jerk maybe you could smell bad yeah something like this something could break up the podcast so I don't know maybe the second last Roll Up Guys we'll have to see we'll let you know after the conference out goes see if you still like me you'll see all right guys all right Ryan should get into the meme of the week take us there yeah let's do meme of the week I'll take you there so this is uh what are we looking at we're looking at some sort of airdrop metrics David what's this yeah yeah this is the optimism airdrop metrics where like I said earlier in the show there are different criteria that you could have met to get different distributions to optimism so here's the meme version of this uh rug pulled by Andre twice if you got rugboat by Andre twice you got 152 million op if you're a seed oil eater which is a deep cut of a reference for crypto Twitter uh you've got 420 000 op tokens if you're a price out of Twitter you got a hundred thousand and if you're an Aries sign if you also got 274 op tokens uh other qualifying things would be donating to Joe Biden's campaign and also an a16z partner uh and yeah uh that is the meme of the week if you had done those things you'd have gotten 6.5 million op tokens uh but of course this is just a meme that's a deep cut uh somebody might try that sometime guys of course we have enjoyed being with you this has been your your weekly roll-up uh ethus risky Bitcoin is risky so is all of crypto including D5 you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is
