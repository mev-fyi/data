bankless nation welcome to another state of the nation got a hot episode for you today we've got polygon on but we're talking about this instagram is adding nfts okay facebook is getting on board with crypto this is absolutely huge news which you might have missed because it came out of monday of last week and crypto had other things to worry about rather than instagram adding nfts but we're surfacing it to you today because we think it was the big one of the biggest news items and most bullish content things that we've had happen in crypto content events that we've had happen in crypto this entire year and that's not even the only thing we're talking about david what else are we covering in this episode yeah stripe also doing web three things and really the theme of this episode if you can uh you know expand your your brain and and project this into the future this is really the web three three-isation of web two platforms uh so we got instagram doing both read and eventually write access to blockchains two public permissionless blockchains with nfts starting with polygon ethereum and also solana and flow uh people have onboarded nfts creators into their into their public profile so we actually took some screenshots this is live right now certain creators have this functionality where they have an nft page next to their posts and videos and reels pages on instagram so nfts going into the heart of the biggest web 2 app of all time which is instagram at the same time this week before this stripe announced that they are allowing people to instead of using usd to go into their bank account they can allow usdc to go to their polygon ethereum address and so as we just think about these things and ideate on these things on the future we have web 2 protocols instagram and stripe that are leveraging web3 technologies and there's so much potential here twitter also allowing their creators who have ticketed spaces and super follows which is allowing twitter accounts to make money off of their brand and off of their network which is very much web3 ethos allowing those people to receive money in uscc on polygon for their for the value of their web to profile and so you can only imagine what happens when instagram enables the ability to mint nfts for the posts that they make and sell those nfts perhaps natively in the app this is just ideation this is just speculation instagram is slow rolling this thing out but you can only imagine what happens when they allow instagram creators and influencers to monetize their and the power of nfts directly in the web 2 apps where i'm going with this ryan why this is such a long-winded intro is that you can also talk about the composability of web 2 apps because now they're based on all the same blockchains stripe and instagram are building both on top of polygon stripe is a commerce platform for selling digital goods instagram is a platform for viewing digital goods and also has its own shop features what happens when we can make these things composable with each other because they're now based on web3 protocols ryan there's not much that there's a lot of stuff that's under nda and so we got as much out of sandeep and mahalo that we could from the polygon team but this is going to be something that is a long developing story that i'm really excited for it's going to keep us entertained during the bear market but really like i said at the beginning this is the web 3ization of web 2 protocols yeah it's certainly really cool and i'll just say it we said in the podcast i'll just say it again 2.9 billion people are part of the instagram facebook social network okay and they're about to get an onboarding path into crypto through nfts you know our uh our best onboarding tool that crypto has ever produced full disclosure david and i are excited bullish about polygon i'm also an advisor of polygon we really believe in what they're doing over there and the pragmatic approach brian i'm super eager to get into this conversation with the two co-founders of polygonal hilo and sandeep but we also have got to talk about alchemix's self-repaying loan technology uh because this is one of the few things in the world of crypto that is uniquely created by crypto you cannot recreate this feature this function inside of the world of tradify something that only crypto can produce for if you guys are not familiar with alchemix it's a self-repaying loan system so if you take like ten thousand dollars you put it into alcoholics it'll go yield farm that 10 000 die in in in d5 for you uh just as as yield farming aggregators do but also at the same time alchemix lets you borrow 50 of your deposits while your loan automatically pays itself off it is just absolute alchemy if you will uh perhaps why they call it alchemics uh say self-repaying loans don't tell this to anyone that has student debt they'll get mad uh but it's pretty pretty crazy and not only can you do this with stable coins like die but you can also do this with ether and so uh if you just a self repaying loan it pays itself back and so you can get your future yield payments for your stable coin yields your ether yields and d5 paid to you up front and that loan will slowly pay itself back you can avoid liquidations because we don't like liquidations because this is a liquidation free protocol you cannot get liquidated as a function of the protocol itself so there is a link in the show notes if you want to take a peek at some of this absolute alchemy magic at bankless dot cc slash alchemics that starts as a capital a at the beginning uh pretty cool stuff pretty cool stuff david i gotta ask you the question before every episode which is what is the state of the nation today around the state of the nation this week is rebuilding there was a lot of destruction last week and so we are going into a new phase of crypto trying to repair what's going on in the crypto industry but not just that ryan uh web 2 protocols they're also broken they also need rebuilding and so we are reconstructing the entire broken system of web 2 because like my genius co-founder once said if you adopt crypto protocols you adopt crypto values and there is a lot of crypto values that i would like to inject into facebook because they really need it and instagram and all the other web 2 platforms out there so ryan we are rebuilding the world and that's what we're doing here we're rebuilding the crypto industry licking our wounds moving forward and we're also rebuilding web 2 while we were at it ryan we are rebuilding today well who am i to disagree with your genius co-founder you know we'll just leave it at that and let's get right into the episode with sandeep and mahalo but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible if you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the

everyone lydo is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using lido's distributed network of nodes don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in defy with lido you can have both using lido you can stick any amount of your eth to the lido validating network and receive st eth in return ses can be traded used as collateral for lending and borrowing or leverage on your favorite d5 protocols all this without giving up your eath to centralized staking services or exchanges lido now supports terra solana kusama and polygon staking whatever your preferred proof-of-stake asset is lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake if you want to stake your east terra soul or matic and get liquidity on your steak go to lido.fi to get started that's l-i-d-o-f-i to get started the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution you can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitram or boba networks bankless nation super excited to introduce you to mahalo and sandeep they are the co-founders of polygon won't introduce their full backgrounds in bio because you know them you've seen them before on bankless uh polygon of course offers a suite of scaling solutions for ethereum from side chains proof of stake chains all the way to zk roll up layer 2 so there's a lot going on here and we've got so much to cover i think we want to start with some of the massive adoption we've seen with meta with nfts with instagram also talk about stripe there's so much to cover here mahalo sandeep welcome back to bankless how you guys doing thank you so much ryan and david uh for the invite you're doing great as always so much work you guys are building so much and i think uh so we are coming off of a week that was uh very hard for a lot of people in crypto uh and um we've never seen anything like it i think this week we can start to get back to building some of the news last week that was missed in the whole tara luna ust fiasco was absolutely monumental and any other news week would have been something that would have echoed all around crypto twitter echoed around all of our media channels and that was this instagram is adding nfts okay instagram adding nfts mark zuckerberg released some statements where he talked about the integration of web 2 and web 3 how he was going to build components of meta social networks spanning 2.9 billion people uh he was going to build components using decentralized protocols and nfts and so we saw the first edition of nfts to instagram something a lot of us hoped for and predicted for a while i think we want to start there can you guys summarize for the audience what instagram is doing with nfts yeah so maybe hello i can't start so of course of course i just want to basically mention that we are of course super excited about this we still have some nda signed we cannot talk about everything but i just want to say that we are super excited excited and that i'm very thankful to sandeep for all his business development efforts and yeah so so basically uh on the on the you know facebook meta side like you know the most important thing is the vision that meta team is carrying on this like you know we were so you know like uh happily thrilled to kind of you know the kind of vision they have like you know they want to i mean the teams that meta has like you know they are pretty strong d5 you know d5 designs we had even if you know the uh like the blockchain dj basically block crypto dj kind of communication discussions also with them wow so they are pretty neat they know stuff like pretty deep and their strategy and everything that the the leadership team over there both on the product side and technical side is absolutely deep into the blockchain special we were very you know i mean as i said that we were thrilled to to be in those conversations and right now uh what they are starting is that you know the it will start with the read they have you know as of yet announced the read of the blockchain like what all they will be reading from these four uh blockchains the nfps where ethereum and polygon will go live uh first and then eventually you know one or two other blockchains will also be added and then post that like basically it's like twitter the phase one is like twitter where uh you know they uh people can uh you know have their display their nfps as a profile pic or wherever they can on the instagram and you know the user experience also they are built around nfps is pretty crazy like you know we should wait uh when it comes and then they have a pretty long and you know pretty deep uh and very interesting road map uh in terms of bringing uh web3 to you know uh facebook so i was actually you know even i even joked with them that you know facebook is going to be the you know be the facebook of web3 like you know a lot of projects will come to you and say that we want to be the facebook of three years so you know facebook is going to be the facebook of web3 so it's it's pretty exciting yeah i think i think this this time at least we know the history with libra and everything i think this time the whole the whole team and the whole company gets it right they understood that they cannot own if they really want to kind of survive this this evolution that we started with befree if they really want to survive it they need to embrace it they need to do it the right way they need to do it properly they need to accept items or assets that are actually on these public networks and become if you want the interface to these networks and maybe something more in the future but in general i think they get it right now and and and i can just second what sandeep said especially on the on the tech side which is closer to i guess to my heart the team their tech team is extremely competent like extremely they uh uh they grilled me for quite some time over there during our sessions that we had and yeah i was quite impressed yeah and and in terms of the functionalities like i think we already said that you know the read is coming first and i think they have a pretty long plan but yeah a lot of things remain on the under nda so maybe you know they will announce and let's let them know it can be we believe it can be really exciting exciting and it can really make a huge impact and really bring web free mainstream yeah potentially to especially their core users yeah i mean it goes beyond an ft is beyond this thing like whatever like without divulging too many details like you know i mean it's pretty impressive and again the point is that uh i think at least that they understand that they cannot make walled gardens anymore if you want to support this pep free asset movement inside and outside of this whatever meta ecosystem needs to be permissionless needs to be allowed and and yeah it's pretty exciting amazing amazing and uh something that that ryan has said a number of times before is that when you adopt crypto protocols you adopt crypto values so maybe cautiously optimistic of course but maybe uh facebook is turning a page when it integrates web three things uh it's going to have to actually induce some web three values into its product uh ryan and i before we started recording we're ideating about what potentially could be done both with with twitter because there's also a twitter conversation here as well but also with nft creators about how they can you finally monetize their own platform in self-sovereign ways so i think we'll we'll ideate a little bit further further on to this episode but before we go in and start actually showing some screenshots as to what the actual functionality is as of today as of right now screenshots that i took live from my own instagram account um i just want to double down on on the whole technical competency of the team because whenever i see some sort of like web 2 you know tradify boomer entity coming into web 3 i'm like all right what are you guys really doing though uh because there's always it should always be met with some sort of healthy skepticism you know there's there's good and bad ways to integrate web3 protocols and what you guys are saying is these are crypto natives at meta these are crypto natives at instagram who know what they're talking about who know the values and know the potential here yes david like you know what i want to say here is that you know we coming from the ethereum uh you know ethereum ecosystem and all that and thinking about all those web 3 values how the world will change and all that like if you you guys are also there in the room discussing all those things the vision that they presented you would you would get goosebumps even now i'm getting goosebumps in terms of those values where they want to take facebook like it's absolutely amazing yeah and we really have to be also careful completely transparent as we're always trying and responsible when once we heard the long-term vision that they had uh we have to basically uh um make it clear that at this point the infrastructure that polygon has can simply cannot support uh uh uh that this grant plan the scale that they have in mind potentially but we are as you as you all know we are working around the clock on improving our infrastructure scalability and other all other uh aspects of our technology and we again we are 100 sure and we told them you won't find better partner than polygon you won't find it but really like the vision is so grand that we are aware that there's there's a lot of work ahead of us to really uh um be able to support and facilitate all that i think i think for me i mean it's been an exciting year for crypto in many respects last week aside but this is actually one of the most exciting things i've i've seen this year and i'm gonna get uh david to maybe pop up his uh instagram account and and show us all what this looks like and of course you know polygon uh team you don't have to comment or speculate i know there's a lot under nda that you can't say so allow us to do some of that for you if you will the other thing i'll say and i'll do a plus one on what you were talking about is actually um the uh instagram facebook team reached out to us too apparently there are many people internal to meta that listen to the bankless podcast and listen to the newsletter and i do think that uh they are absorbing this content and as david was saying earlier starting to adopt crypto values so when mark zuckerberg on the podcast what's up zuck hmm we'll see but david let's show us what's happening what's cooking in your instagram account because i've been so busy this week man i'm like i'm barely on instagram anyway but first of all by the way do you use instagram for crypto stuff or is this all personal i'm just curious uh me me personally uh it's staying connected to old college buddies while also uh connecting to newer crypto the crypto socialites the web3 socialites are all on instagram so yes there is a growing crypto culture brewing inside of instagram but now it's actually in the actual app so here is a normal instagram page i'm not sure if my mouse is going to make it into the screen recording and we post it um but like uh this is a normal instagram page but there's this new hexagon with a check mark next to uh next in in people's profile so you have the typical grid of pictures that's normal and then recently they added the whole reels thing and there's tagged photos as well but also there is a new tab that has the check mark with the hexagon which is the same format that twitter uh used to talk about is nfts so this seemed the hexagon with the with the check mark verification seems to be the new status quo this is one of the few artists the nft artists that have been rolled out in this beginning stages of nfts on instagram uh the handle is the blue great i don't know who that person is but this is their uh this is a digital collectible this is what uh sandeep was talking about about the read side of the blockchain so instagram is reading the polygon blockchain to look at this nft which is now embedded into the actual instagram app itself on the actual profile so there's got the little hexagon check mark with the digital collectible tag and then you can when you tap on that it shows up as it just gives you giving you a little bit more details who minted it who the artist is and then also at the very bottom you can see this collectible is an nft on the ethereum blockchain with a learn more tab there's not too much here it's basic read functionality but the but the world is the oyster here there is so much to open up uh here is the the the atom bomb squad who i did an nft drop on ethereum a while ago so here's his uh picture which is just an nft with the digital collectible tab uh and then uh and then uh here is just like again the the same sort of like um uh the profile for like people's nft page on their instagram account so they have a dedicated nft page on your own instagram account for the creators out there uh so this is of just a very logical first step to like displaying and reading the blockchain and displaying the data on the blockchain on people's instagram pages i i think you listeners can start to ideate with their own imagination as about where this could go from here yeah it's like maybe maybe i'm easily impressed but i don't think so because this is just a flag in the ground uh for what facebook meta instagram are going to do in the future okay and crossing the rubicon of actually connecting and basing your strategy on ethereum on polygon on other blockchains that is the thing i wasn't ever sure and i think a lot of people weren't sure they'd actually cross back in 2018 it was very much the narrative was web 2 was going to come and build their own chains and knock out ethereum knock out bitcoin sort of centralize the universe that paradigm has completely shifted this cycle now it's not about replacing it's about building on top of which is the perfect space so david you know how we talk about the d5 mullet all of the time okay this is the web 2 mullet man we got two mullets going on creator mullet yeah it's the crater mullet and uh what's happening is we're getting kind of like web 2 social in the front and then we've got web 3 in the back we've got crypto and we've got blockchain so you can imagine a listener if you saw some of the demos if you're watching on on on youtube what the possibilities are the ability to now write back to a chain like polygon or ethereum a creator minting their own nfts a link out to a place to purchase these nfts through open seat my god like uh nft passes where there's like pieces of instagram that are exclusive and you have to have an nft in your wallet in order to access them there's so many different ideas here and if there's one thing instagram and facebook and medica do it's actually build features that their communities want so super bullish on what's coming down the pipeline david you want to say something before you throw it back to these guys i know we're having fun speculating right yeah so since you guys are on nda the world is our oyster to to think about uh and we we see similar uh activity going around with twitter and we'll get to this later in the show when we talk about the stripe integration with usdc on polygon twitter is going to be allowing the users their users their creators who have ticketed spaces and super follows these are these are current features inside of twitter they can the creators can receive payment in uscc on polygon for this activity on twitter you can only imagine what happens when uh uh instagram elevates itself from not only just reading the blockchain but reading and writing to the blockchain as you upload an instagram post a movie a picture something to instagram you can maybe there's a toggle button saying would you like to mint this as an nft on polygon and then it's as you make the post on instagram it becomes an nft and it's there's already like web 2 tradfi normie uh shop features in embedded in instagram today so it's not that far like away from reason to think that uscc on polygon can be made to purchase nfts uploaded by creators that got minted on polygon directly from the instagram app itself i know you guys are under nda so these are our id ideations is there anything that has come to mind about uh these hypothetical use cases about what you can do with instagram on polygon are we in the ballpark guys yeah no yeah maybe you are maybe you are maybe you are not i didn't really i didn't really listen to what you guys were talking about [Laughter] uh no you guys have great ideas and as we said this team really knows their thing and uh as you said they're listening to bankless and yeah it's really really but but but david like one more thing like you said you you presented very nice ideas that what could happen on instagram i would say you know think even beyond like i'll just leave at that like their their vision is pretty grand like i would say i have never been told that i need to think bigger sandeep that is that is first it's it's even more bullish than you think david but ryan you really nailed it like this is a big paradigm shift from you know co-opting and and hijacking the free to embracing the free and becoming the interface or the gateway to web free in in a manner similar the centralized exchanges are you know centralized exchanges definitely contribute to the ecosystem significantly by onboarding uh users to the actual web free and actual protocols here we have we have basically a company with multi-billion user base uh and they are really really taking this seriously and this is really a big opportunity for for the industry and big opportunity for for polygon first of all now now you are basically challenged previously we were building tech and we were hoping you know we will on board this this uh uh one billion users and or onboard the world to polygon and ethereum as we were hoping now we have the chance and now we're actually challenged now we need to actually even speed up our tech efforts and everything that we're doing to to basically uh prove ourselves and and take this chance that we have so uh instagram the way that they're rolling out they've only rolled it out to a few creators i think they're doing a slow rollout plan making sure like nothing breaks and nothing goes wrong with any logical rollout plan this is par for the course uh as they onboard more and more creators they'll figure out more and more things to do and be able to iterate better uh but i can only imagine that like when they finally roll this out to the entire instagram app for all creators and then also all for users that's a lot of activity is polygon is the polygon l2 have the capacity to support instagram if they release the nft minting nft transfers like are you guys i mean l2s are scalable but like there's limits to everything are you guys ready to be able to host an entire instagram app of activity as i said like we made it really we had to be responsible and disclose to them that this technology this is still very in early days of web free of building this this infrastructure this infrastructure will not be built in one year's two years or three years like internet wasn't built in in five years it was built over the the span of 30 years something similar maybe we probably don't need 30 years but we'll still need i guess three four five years maybe even seven until we really have robust scalable proven decentralized technology that can support this massive global scale but that being said sorry so we are definitely planning accordingly we have so many efforts under the polygon umbrella on the the cryptography side improving optimizing our our provers on the the actual infrastructure side the remain remaining of the stack how we uh are trying to deal now with state bloat issues with everything that comes once you achieve scale for example on the on the zk side then you need then you have other problems like for example state load creeping creeping in we need to uh see how to address that and we are actually looking into that on the harder side so we need basically with some of our efforts for example like plonky too i don't want to go too technical now but some of our zk efforts they are really really uh optimized to the to the maximum limits of the software itself now we have internal very strong hardware acceleration team that is working on now accelerating more in hardware actually so we have the custom built hardware like fpdas in the future ideally a6 that we're currently working on we have internal team very very competent working on that so we are really i think we have the right approach we are taking this very seriously and we are trying to improve on all all possible uh um sides and aspects yeah and one more thing i want to say that you know we just mentioned that the team there is pretty you know crypto native right so they understand all of these challenges like you know what are the what is the current scale of blockchains where you can go and all that and the way they have they have designed their product launch strategy is actually takes into account like you know that's what i'm saying that you know they know it pretty deep as good as us that what can be done today what can be done in six months in 12 months and all that and they're planning accordingly yes that's also very important to say maybe it wasn't clear for what i was saying they have this gradual plan of embracing basically they're free and slowly on boarding and it's also as important thing for them they cannot bet all in immediately you know and and just open the float gates uh of their whole user bases and all of that so so i think we're aligned there so guys this in and of itself is absolutely massive meta uh instagram facebook again 2.9 billion users potentially have a way to now on board socially that's like that's a lot so i know like uh mahalo get your get your technical capabilities ready we should also mention that uh of course the in the facebook announcement a post it was ethereum and polygon and also flow and solana were other chains that are going to be added to this so uh some of that burden might be uh alleviated but that in itself is amazing no i think right now yeah right now ryan it's only the read and read also is going live with ethereum and polygon only uh the solana and flow are going to come later on yes for the right it's like undisclosed from them they only will disclose when the right time comes got it and so of course for bankless listeners if that wasn't clear the read portion is where you can actually connect your nft be able to see it within instagram that's kind of step one phase one but the right portion that's where things get super interesting for creators when they can actually mint things on instagram straight to the blockchain and of course they're going to need a scalable solution in order to do that so gas fees aren't super expensive okay but that's not the only onboarding path we have david alluded to it a little bit further up in the episode uh with a stripe actually coming on board and this is i i can't even keep track of all of this but i think it's within the last 30 days that uh stripe just announced they are going to let clients make payments in usdc uh the stablecoin of course on polygon again i'm going back like the old you know crypto grandpa uh i'm going back to the days of 2018 when none of the fintechs would even touch crypto okay it was sort of like is it a scam you know what is this thing fintech's completely staying away blockchains don't really have a use case that sort of thing and now we've got stripe a major payment processor okay stripe is actually does the payment processing right now for the bankless newsletter for example if you want to become a premium member we use stripe under the covers so they i don't even know the scale of stripe but almost all of these sas web 2 platforms use stripe in some capacity and now here they are allowing usdc payments and they're using polygon to do it starting with twitter so again it's a pilot test right the floodgates haven't completely opened uh mahalo and sandeep do you guys have any comments on this give us some insight uh is this all part of the business development effort and what are fintechs and the stripes of the world thinking about this yeah sure i'm going to leave it again to sunday if i just want to say it's really really exciting as you said exciting as you said that we are seeing these big names with huge user bases infrastructure embracing basically and being ready to embrace web free and on our side it's again like one one great win from from uh sandeep side and the team that he established yeah so i'm gonna leave so yeah uh on the on the stripe side like you know i mean the the basic part is very clear that you know now the users can actually pay via usdc uh using stripe right uh to their uh i think twitter already uh is going to pay the creators if the creators choose why usdc so it's not like a product announcement there is a client which is actually uh you know twitter in this in this in this scenario where the creators can actually opt in for the usdc payments uh and the the other part is that you know this is a uh you know kind of uh um you know place where like for example this is basically into payments right so we our business develop development is like you know multi-pronged right so uh you know d5 there is d5 is gaming like polygon studios everyone knows which has gaming and nfp then you have like you know web 2 segment and there also we are seeing such a huge growth actually you know meta is a part of that our web 2 division itself and then enterprises and all that which nobody right now even talking and all that and we have a pretty strong uh you know base that is forming over there also so uh so payment is is one part which you know has not grown as as much it was expected i think because both btc and ethereum payments were not you know tenable before but now with let's say the layer two you know layer two is coming along we have a ethereum like polygon hermes roll up is already live which only supports payments and then you know polygon pos chain is there which supports all these stable coin payments and all that so the payments are one particular division where we keep you know we have a long term strategic focus we have like probably to the scale of stripe or some even bigger players on the payment side uh who are uh you know dabbling with it and probably will reach a place where you know hundreds of millions of payments can be routed through uh you know polygon and you know when people think polygon right now they all think only polygon previous but polygon is a multi-chain uh you know ecosystem maybe you know uh maybe there could be a roll-up which is only optimized for payments which could process like you know hundreds of thousands or millions of payments in a single day and uh you know those roll ups uh can be there uh on top of ethereum and all that so there is a lot happening in that sense and uh you know this this particular stripe announcement is a part of a larger concerted effort on the payment side of things uh from us at polygon amazing a technical question that i have is uh with people who are uh using stripe like businesses uh creators their stripe is really doing a great job allowing individuals to create their own shops stuff like this where does the address come from if creators can get paid in uscc via stripe on polygon do creators need to bring their own ethereum address or does stripe provide one for them how does that work no i think like you know uh in terms of the implementation i have not seen that interface but you know uh basically when you are getting the from the early discussions i remember that you know it is basically the the the end uh user actually brings their address ethereum address and he gets uh the payment on uh on polygon yeah okay so they're on their site maybe they can even allow to they can even create an address for for user if user doesn't have one it's a matter of kind of front-end yeah on the front end basically you can you can allow multiple wallets so you can allow metamask then you wouldn't have need to bring your own address you can allow let's say a custodial wallet like you know all of these like you know taurus mainly portis and all that and you can you know with your email you can create an address and get over there and things like that so all of them are on the cards is it is it crazy to think that stripe might actually get into the custodial game because they kind of already are with other payments right like uh if you are building up a balance based off your sales on stripe uh regardless of whether it's usd from like visa or usdc on polygon like and you are building up a balance because you're making a bunch of sales stripe is holding that balance for you either way and so is it that crazy to assume that stripe would also custody private keys for their users might this probably might be a question for stripe better yeah yeah i guess we can only speculate but i believe many of these big traditional payment companies or or even whatever centralized exchanges etc they will probably most of them will enter this custody custody business and it's it's a fair game as as long as everyone are still able to own their assets and on their private keys as long as that is not the default but an added feature for people who actually want it or service sorry right as long as we keep the the core uh itos uh alive right and uh polygon's not the only like crypto integration they also have a partnership with ftx as well so one can not only one can start to begin to imagine what what all of these uh features look like when they start to get stitched together one last technical question who pays polygon gas feeds when a usdc transfer happens so uh you know many of the times uh the uh like for example in case of stripe also as far as i'm aware they are using meta transactions and uh you know they pay they cover for the gas for the payment and it's adjusted within the uh transaction fees so you also have okay you got it no generally just we also have a budget and we are generally willing to cover these costs because i fortunately are still very much negligible most of the time uh so it's not really a huge expense either for us or for the the that company that is doing the integration actually ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows for a higher loan to value ratios and of course portals allowing users to port their ave position across all of the networks that ave operates on like polygon phantom avalanche arbitram optimism and harmony the beautiful thing about ave is that it's completely open source decentralized and governed by its community enabling a truly bankless future for us all to get your first crypto collateralized loan get started at ave.com that's aabe.com and also check out the ave protocol governance forums to see what more than a hundred thousand dow members are all robbing about at

eath and other tokens in order to experience defy nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free okay so uh guys the theme of this episode so far has been uh due to onboarding the world which is really what we're beginning to see in a way we've we've never seen in previous cycles right and this is this is all happening during the so-called bear market that crypto is in this this crypto recession so this this is why we are so bullish on bankless still all of this this building is getting done um sandeep you were kind of talking a little bit about how polygon fits in the strategy this swiss army knife of of of tools that you have and so now we're seeing the two themes we've discussed so far is web 2 entering the game the big social media platforms boy once you get facebook i mean who's bigger than facebook right so we've got we've got that going on on polygon we also have the stripes of the world and the fintechs that are starting to build on crypto rails as well uh what is polygon's strategy in the midst of this are you trying to provide like a suite of technical solutions with with different uh degrees of of security settlement assurances across the scope i know we haven't had time to talk enterprise that's that's another thing or gaming we'll talk about that in future episodes but even if you're just scoping it to all of the potential opportunities in in social media web 2 and d5 what's how does polygon fit in here yeah so see on the technical side like as as we said and may hello can speak more that the technical solutions are you know multi-fold on the business side like my goal is that uh you know simply that uh you know if i mean i feel that you know in this current uh since 2020 mid 2020 when some of the proof of stake chains went live polygon went live and all that like the the amount of users that we could address on blockchains you know suddenly grew from like a few million users a day to probably 10 15 million users and with this new wave of scalability solutions like layer twos particularly uh which are you know which we are at the you know approaching the dawn of layer twos very soon and then once that comes in i think we will reach a place where overall as an industry i'm not talking about only overall as an industry we could probably support like 50 200 million users right so you know my goal at polygon is that you know if 100 million users are going to come into web 3 how can we uh you know make sure that polygon is that uh you know uh the the transaction layer and and you know then being layer two is like you know ethereum becomes the settlement right now that so this is that is the way we are approaching into it and from the like i am looking from the business side like okay these these these are the various segments and here all we need to speak to the partners and and and you know people who are looking to build and bring them on board and then you know uh you know our other co-founders like mihaelo jayanthi and rag you know like polygon hermes team zero they all are you know working on providing all those tech pieces in place to reach uh or to realize that vision so uh you know that's like the on the higher level the strategy and for polygon yes like you know we want to be pressed present across the spectrum for ethereum scalability whether it's like supernet kind of uh dedicated chains because you know all these public chains that we see today are kind of like those shared hosting servers that used to be there in uh you know two thousand three four five and you know many of us they were used to be in college and we built our first website we always you know hosted on a cheap shared server so these current public blockchains are uh are you know shared servers in that sense right in that analogy but as and when these bigger players are entering the the field many of them would need public dedicated chains for them like the chains are still public fully like fairly decentralized or fully decentralized depending upon the player and everything but it is dedicated to one particular application or one particular dow which allows certain applications uh to be run on that particular chain so that that future is approaching and our goal is that that multi-chain future for dedicated chains or public chains for fully secured chains by ethereum or uh you know just connected chains to ethereum all of this you know should fall under this ethereum ecosystem and within this multi-chain blockchain region that we are building at polygon yes yes i mean i can only second that and we see polygon as ethereum's multi-chain we see polygon as a massively scalable moving forward massively scalable multi-chain system that consists of uh multiple public nets if you want to call them that way like polygon ps polygon hermes et cetera and potentially a number of of these dedicated networks which are sandeep said they can be thought of as an equivalent to dedicated uh hosting in web 2 world so nowadays when when web 2 is mainstream and we have these applications with high with the big user bases no one is even thinking of shared hostings uh they all have their dedicated dedicated servers etc so we see as the industry matures web prematures we have uh we see we have three applications reaching product market fit establishing big user bases they will uh a number of them will move to these dedicated networks and it's then it's important to to basically uh uh uh provide a powerful enough technology for these networks to be built and uh uh remain secure with something like ethereum yeah and one last piece i wanted to add that with like our other like you know i mean this this looks like more crypto chili statement but you know the goal is that you know with all these polygon tools around can we take ethereum to a 1 million tps like you know where we were saying that can we take instagram scale if there are 100 chains right and somehow the interoperability is figured out and all that like you know imagine 100 1000 chain probably and each chain has its own you know reasonable amount of tps fast chain but there are multiple chains on ethereum can overall pps in the ethereum ecosystem with polygon with other layer tools also can that touch one million tps or even beyond technically it should be you know milo can comment more technically it should be infinite tps on top of ethereum right where ethereum has a settlement layer providing all that security and decentralization and you know the transactions are being done on these layer 2 chains yes yes in such setup we're very confident about scalability scalability is basically practically unlimited in that case uh we figured out how to secure all that all those transactions by ethereum so regarding security regarding throughput there are no particular concerns at this moment it's just a matter of time and we're basically racing against the time and working around the clock and we strongly believe we're going to be the first ones to offer these dk powered evm compatible solutions we are very confident about that right now so these challenges we don't consider them as uh we consider them solved basically we're gonna what we need to focus on is interoperability at some point and how we're gonna connect this multitude multitude of chains and enable them to to exchange messages in some seamless manner that is something uh that we uh need to focus on but these other challenges like security and and throughput i i think they are practically solved they're just a matter of time now i i do think for um people who haven't listened to our previous episode that we did with polygon where we sort of broke down the um the swiss army knife of different chain tools that you have and the degrees of of kind of security and settlement risks spanning from like side chains to like pos chains all the way to all of the zk roll up stuff you're doing should go listen to that episode or refer bankless listeners back to that to get the full scope but there's one thing that that you mentioned sandeep and i'm wondering mahalo if you could comment on this so uh this thing called supernets was also launched within the last 30 days or so this is another you know tool on the swiss army knife if you will what specifically are super nets mahalo yeah so uh super nets are exactly this concept that i that ty and sandy previously mentioned of these dedicated blockchain networks so as we said as the industry is maturing as webfree is maturing we will see more and more applications ideally with huge user bases and these applications really need high throughput and the other day even dedicated throughput they cannot allow themselves to to share resources with the 100 or 1000 other applications and hope for the best basically so this is the concept of these application or use case specific uh chains that we are now offering to the to the whole community what is specific about supernet so the concept of application specific or use case-specific chains is not new of course what we're offering with with supernats is we have several i guess unique value propositions polygon supernets are first of all based on polygon edge which is our framework for building these dedicated blockchain networks but on top of it we're offering several things first of all we're offering offering this shared security concept where we offer this uh uh polygon set of validators that can provide out of the box security for these chains and in the future these chains once the l2 technology is ready ideally based on ek they can upgrade seamlessly to layer tools if they decide to do that it's completely up to up to these projects so basically we cover this whole spectrum of of solutions and we provide different options for security which is not really the case or which was not the case with this previously uh used application specific chains on top of it we are offering this managed service what we call it so um unfortunately with these application specific chains uh launching them it's it is easy with polygon edge to launch this application specific chains but maintaining upgrading them is not really a trivial task especially for application developers they don't really have that protocol level expertise they don't have expert knowledge domain knowledge et cetera so unfortunately we have recently seen some high profile hacks in not in the polygon ecosystem but in in these application specific chains and that is partially because the teams were not really fully ready to to maintain this somewhat complex architecture so what we're offering with supernats is basically a team of certified partners these are experienced dev shops and dev teams that can actually help these application teams manage their trends manage upgrades manage security devops etc so it's like a convenient thing for these application developers to basically focus on what they do the best to focus on their application focus on their users on adoption don't bother kind of with with securing the chain and operating it and the same goes for this security whether you opt in to use this poly polygon validator pool or you opt in to become a layer 2 you don't think about security anymore if you want to bootstrap your own application specific chain you need to bootstrap a validator set you need to if you have a token as an application you need to think okay how i'm going to revoke reward the validators now you need to incorporate that in your token design so all these things are consuming a lot of bandwidth of you as an application developer instead of this you you kind of with supernets you get your dedicated ethereum compatible chain out of the box it it is optionally managed by one of polygon certified partners and what you do you just build an application the same manner in the same manner like you would on ethereum you deploy to your dedicated chain you're part of the ethereum wider ethereum ecosystem it's been being managed for you and you just focus on your application and what you do the best a line that i recently heard out of hazu actually has stuck with me and it was that ethereum has deregulated the market for execution and i think that is actually a great way to describe what polygon is up to is that there are infinite many ways to construct an execution layer on top of ethereum and polygon is doing every single one and it's just throwing everything at the wall and and whatever stick sticks and whatever's in demand is in demand and i think that is a really elegant way to find product market fit because you let the market determine as to what they want and so this openness and and uh permissionlessness about literally the design constructions that can go into polygon layer twos i think is is particularly elegant but uh mahalo and sandeep i have one last question for you guys you guys have grown polygon has grown insanely uh and and uh mihallo i ran into you at devconnect and you talked about just like the scale of the polygon team and how that's grown there's so many different chains and so many moving parts and also crypto prices ether is down 65 in the last like four months and so i'm wondering how you guys are going into this quote-unquote bear market like how would you guys plan on weathering the storm and just overall do you have any sentiments into the layer two side of this industry as we go into a bear market so i mean you know i mean as we we do like some of the critical things like you know we uh you know even though we are moving at this exhilarating you know speed but there are some critical fundamentals that we always you know take care of and you guys know that you know recently uh the part of like that 450 million dollar fund that we raised the reason for that was in anticipation of something as catastrophic as this like you know that we experienced and then we are fairly you know i mean i would say that we are one of the most capitalized uh you know teams in that sense and one more thing that you know for polygon how we are seeing this you know this decentralized transaction layer that will emerge out like you know how polygon is built it's it's kind of a you know conglomerate of various different independent autonomous teams like polygon hermes zero all these teams collaborate with each other but they have their full autonomy within their divisions and all that and eventually when it emerges out like now with the including the polygon hermes and zero co-founders and all that we have probably like around 10 co-founders right kind of like you know who will act as the leader figures in the in the in the coming days so it's not dependent on one single party or one you know single person in the future when we fully uh sort of decentralize so you know we had to take care or you know that these die separate teams are amply capitalized for at least three to five years of work which we believe is you know kind of you know at max should be the unless we get into a great depression kind of situation you know like it should be like a one or two year maximum beer cycle and uh you know we have enough amount of firepower to reach there and on top of that we have a you know one billion plus dollars worth of you know matic tokens also in the foundation uh you know uh with even at these prices right and it may be probably even more than that so i think we are fairly settled on that for a long haul and uh in fact like you know yesterday only i wrote the mail to uh you know to my team internally also that you know to everyone basically and then you know all the founders are also chipping in over there is that you know this is the time for us at polygon to double down because this is what we were preparing for right you know this is the beer market where we really shine because everybody will will will get throttled out right everybody will slow down and this is the time where we go aggressive on hiring marketing you know business development building the cutting edge infrastructure getting the back maximum tile you know best talent into the into the company and we are already 400 people strong and we probably you know like as a whole i'm saying the whole polygon various different different entities which are contributing to polygon protocol and uh we you know we believe that within this beer market i think we will grow to probably 800 or 1000 people also who knows but uh you know the goal is to build this you know large conglomerate which has individual small small protocol teams but they are highly autonomous at their this thing at their level but they collaborate and you know share resources with each other each one has their own well-defined role so that's the goal we see and uh you know that's how we are preparing for the market modular polygon just like modular ethereum huh yes yes yes yes and as sandy said we're really well capitalized at this point so we have no concerns on that side we are more motivated than ever we're more optimistic about the future than ever both in terms of the interest that we're seeing now on the adoption side on the tech side we have really really great teams i am humbled day after day by by the quality of the talent that i'm working with and people who are who are building these these advanced solutions at polygon so we cannot be really more bullish in the future and sandeep said he recently he yesterday sent this email because some of the people working on polygon got basically concerned you know did this whole market crash what is going to happen are we going to cut down our costs and what not actually we're planning the opposite as san diego said so we cannot be more really bullish and optimistic about about the future uh tell us your thoughts on the market crash so what happened last week how do we recover from this guys i think this was expected really and i think what happened with the with the this project that we all i can even say with luna basically it was it was a minsky moment basically for for crypto and and a funny thing the the term risky moment first was used as far as i know in 1997 when uh speculators were putting increasing pressure on some asian dollar pegged currencies so in this case history repeats itself so so i think the whole market went a little bit uh um [Music] uh irrational we became a little bit reckless as an industry as the whole community we kind of saw signs of something like this happening and i can only say that it's really fortunate that this happened now not in let's say one to three months from now the the impact would be probably even even bigger so we are still kind of lucky and i would say crypto gods still uh saved us to to a certain extent and yeah i think as every market correction it's at the end of the day it's really healthy like we really need to get rid of uh speculators people with monster egos people who don't really uh approach uh the whole the whole founder concept responsibly and people who are investing rationally we really need to kind of level down and uh calm our heads and that's basically a healthy foundation for for us to move forward that being said the the fundamentals of of the industry have never been this strong the fundamentals are i don't know mind-blowingly strong i i would say so we have really zero concerns about about the long-term perspective of the industry but this correction was really kind of you you could see it coming and i think it was an unavoidable and better that it happened now than in one two three or six months yeah but i mean i as a human being like you know i mean i feel that i feel for the community like i mean i think you guys also multiple times said that you know overall uh it was no fault of luna community which you know many of them were very passionate uh supporters also over there and i hope that the builders in that community somehow are able to survive and you know figure out their their challenges obviously we invite all of them uh to ethereum because this is you know we believe that you know this is the is the this is the place to be and uh and individually as the team members also like you know that i also tweeted out like you know as human beings like they i i i i know that i think that doe recently had a baby and i also like last friday had a baby and you know imagine i had to spend like four days without even uh you know looking at five for five minutes at him you know i'll be going crazy so as a human being like i also you know treated that i hope team maintains that okay at the end of this this is not beyond life right so okay you know this was a big mistake big you know problem that that got created or you know they created i still find like hopefully uh they would have more chances in future to come back uh but nothing is you know bigger than the the lives that we that we have so everybody like uh for the community for the team members i would you know request them to calm down and you know think about the future instead of like you know being sad about this like of course it will take some time but these two shall shall pass well said well said let's let's end it there let's end it there this too shall pass is a great is a great ending and at the end of the day if you were affected by um the luna events of of last week um you know life goes on you could pick yourself up all of us have been have done things in crypto we regret we've all aped into things uh we have gotten back up and we've recovered and been better for it and i think the industry will be better for it as well and this is still the greatest financial opportunity of all time uh and so we still can't forget that absolutely the best opportunities are ahead guys we've gone through so much today okay we just talked about onboarding the world through instagram adding nfts and the fintechs like stripe adding polygon and ethereum capabilities stable coins usdc and we talked about how do we build through the bear market so sandeep and mahalo thank you so much for joining us this has been a fantastic episode yep thank you guys thank you for inviting us here thank you so much guys of course as always risks and disclaimers guys crypto is risky we say this every episode i hope you realize it this we make it a point uh you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier
