welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and always has been today on layer zero i'm speaking with jijong who i'm sure i just butchered his name but jojong previously worked in china during kovid and came to america a little bit thereafter but zhao zhang has this incredible story of working for what we would call a silicon valley tech company but in china but specifically on the content moderation team and he tells a story of how content moderation actually works in china and the level and the degree that these chinese tech companies must go through in order to moderate and censor their content in order to even operate as a business so we go through for about 45 minutes to an hour of the whole complex of industry behind content moderation in china and then we explore a little bit of just the chinese people and how they think about content moderation in china and how they accept it and what they do about it and also a little bit is a layer zero of the people of china and censorship but of course we ultimately converge on the topic of ethereum how xi jiang thinks about ethereum and how ethereum relates to the people of china so i hope you enjoy this fantastic episode diving into a part of the world that the west doesn't really get to get too much of a peak of here and there but before we get to our conversation with zha zhang we'll hear from a few of our sponsors to make going bank lists a little bit easier zk sync is an ethereum layer 2 network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zk sync has combined the power of zero knowledge roll-ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but cryptokiller apps need zk-sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge roll-ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zk-sync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future-proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zk sync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on twitter too at zksync rocketpool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there lens protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era through social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create so in order to get started there is a secret code word in the show notes enter that code word in the google form link and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3 social what's up judging how's it going hey hey david i'm i'm good how are you i'm doing doing really good uh you have a fantastic story that i definitely want to get into but maybe just to tell the bankless listeners bankless audience who you are could you just uh tell us who are you oh um hi uh bankless fans i'm also a huge bankless fan so uh who am i hmm good question well i would uh consider myself as a huge fan of ethereum first and i get into ethereum like most of us maybe during the device summer so uh after that i'm really passionate about the ethereum overall so i hang out with a a bunch of friends on crypto twitter every day so yeah i would consider myself a huge fan of uh ethereum and now nowadays i'm trying to be a builder trying to build a smart contract wallet that support eip erc437 yeah so uh before ethereum i was a product manager at uh maiton it's like a uber uber aids in in the us and also i'm a product manager at uh by dance the parent company of uh titok by dance the parent company of tick tock and i believe that's where the the super interesting parts of your background i think that a lot of the people in the west won't be familiar with and part of the reason why i want to pull you onto the show today uh but can you tell the listeners a little bit more what what is buy dance other than just being the parent company of tick tock like what do they do okay uh buy dance uh is a like to facebook or like facebook of uh in in the us so the main business uh con is consists of a a few parts first is the ted talk that everybody use title is the name of the brand they use in in in the west and in china they use another brand called doin yeah this is where their most revenue comes from and they also have another news uh aggregator app uh it's called um like uh headline uh daily so which is a how they uh comes from like how the business uh started from yeah which aggregate huge traffic for them to uh also uh help them to get familiar with ai and recommendation algorithm for them to build the tip top the video business uh later uh today and that really seems to be uh kind of the new meta in a lot of these apps that are coming about these days is it's really the power of that recommendation algorithm tick tock especially that has really elevated some of this newer generation of of tick-tock apps or tick-top-like apps or these newer generation of apps in general uh how were you involved in that side of the business or what were you doing when you were working for by dance okay so uh when i work at bet by dance uh i'm not involved in the recommendation part i'm mainly focused on the moderation part so the difference is that the recommendation part is trying to uh pick up the best content for you uh to be addictive to interact with the app more often to spend as long as as much as time as you can but most of my time i'm focusing on the moderation part or they call a trust and safety nowadays so our job is yes our job is mainly to uh to censor or moderate uh that kind of content that we don't want you to see or we would like to let you see less and so what how did you how was the company deciding what content to moderate like uh was it like pornography child pornography or was it like what was the categories of content that by dance would moderate oh uh i think just like most of the web 2 company or content platform there are several categories of content that they won't like to let the user see it for example the the most common one is just spent like twitter is doing terrible on anti-spend and anti-spending and for yeah the most part is spent and also uh pornography that uh that that that's another huge part and uh also in terms of t talk uh they have huge amount of uh users that are like under 18 so child child related you need to be more sensitive about that kind of content and also violence uh for example uh you are you're definitely not allowed to uh kill yourself or serious i or show someone and put some very bloody content online yeah uh that would be the most most part and also for for china and maybe some more restricted country like in india or middle middle middle east we have some different kind of uh political specific rules that was not allowed to pose and with that part the political specific stuff that would you say that that part is the difference between the content moderation and the western apps like twitter versus the content moderation apps that you would see out of china yeah that's definitely the most uh different part for example in in china in order to let the company to survive you are not allowed to let the user to use your platform to advocate any uh political disobedience to have their own political agenda all you can do is to be a good propaganda you either allow the the state to publish their own agenda or you can only have some uh some very like soft or entertainment content that is harmless okay so how that that's that could begs the question is like how does an app actually detect uh political content that is against the political parties of uh the chinese communist party right so like i'm assuming it's relatively easy to detect porn or nudity for example i feel like that's just a generic you know scanning of the video and seeing if it looks like a an image that's banned how how does content moderation look like when it's something a little bit more just generalized like political speech how does that work oh good question so um yeah political content is um well you can do it the hallway and the easy way the the easy way is uh well there are several ways for you to uh scan or to understand the content right so first is the the the the graphic side so like what's in this video and uh for example uh it's easy to analyze for example if there's a picture of the political leader like uh president xi jinping so if his uh picture is uh in the in some frame then it's easy to detect so uh this part of the graphic will be record uh back to the moderator so the model the writer will take a look at this like video to check whether it's uh it's it's spreading some political rumor quote unquote or uh other things they are discrediting the political leader yeah uh so this is the graphic part yeah so you can detect what's in in the video also uh we are because you know china because of the time and square uh protests uh or massacre uh they will censor like tank uh during the in in june every year yeah so uh this is from the graphic side and also uh from the and sound is another uh huge part of a video right so what what will you speak during the video or uh what is the voice content in the video so we will like we will use some voice detection uh technology to translate those voice into tests and then we will match those texts with some key words to to to trying to understand what are you speaking so if your your speech hits some or match some keywords then yeah again this part of content will be recalled and will be moderate and so it's really just about flagging the content that picks up like okay this is a picture of xi jinping or this is uh words that are saying the name xi jinping and then it goes for manual review and then like people manually review it and check it out is that what's next in the flow here yes uh people will manually uh like check it yeah and also uh well we will have some like algorithm that to detect if this speech is uh spoken by some sensitive people for example like dalai lama or maybe speaker nancy pelosi i assume recent days so if there's any uh sensitive political celebrity that maybe you are not allowed to put their voice into the public platform and so what would happen next if if it was deemed that it needs to be censored what does that sensor censorship actually looks like are we just deleting the videos or what happens to these video files or audio files yeah so there are several options for the moderator or the nowadays maybe the moderators moderation system they will automatically decide what to do next depends on which kind of policy you apply or this content being applied to so either this content will be take down or this content will be hide or or even worse the this this account will be deleted and uh how how is this how much of a tech company in china how much of their resources have to go into doing this like is this like a small part of their team is this like a large part of their team like how much resource consumption does this take up huge huge i would say maybe like two years ago at least we have 20k to 30k moderators that is moderating the content daily there's wait 20 to 30 000 individual employees that are doing this yes and they are spreading all around china like some somewhere in the northern part some in the southern part we are just trying to build a distributed base or system to to handle the business well just in case if we have one bait well base is the place people do the moderation like uh uh job yeah so we have different base in different regions so just to avoid a single point of failure yeah they they know this uh they use anti-anti-fragile to sensor so in case uh one place was done then they can use another place yeah but usually the daily work is pretty occupied since it's uh there are so many content and upload it daily okay so there's tens of thousands of people in multiple different spots all doing this content moderation and you're saying that it needs to be having a very high up time because we have to the the company by dance has to actually be ensuring that the content going out is appropriately filtered like like say telling me that like 20 to 30 000 employees are moderating content on a daily given basis is like damn that's insane i'm pretty sure that's more total employees than like twitter has and it's just doing content moderation but also they're in multiple different geographic locations so that they don't get they don't so they can always remain why is it important that there are so many people that are like working on making sure that the content moderation uptime is like at 100 like why so much energy is going into this well this is how business can survive in the uh in the authoritarian country it's a ha it's a statue that you have to keep like 99 99.99 of our time just to minimum to minimize the risk of leaking any political sensitive speech authoritarian regime are very like fragile even though they have they control the cut they control like everything they control the media they control the army they control like even the land is stay on but they they are afraid they are so afraid that even we let the free media or uh free user content that got leaked that my then my spreads maybe the spirit of freedom so yeah so the uptime must be very high so and there are often some like uh unexpected events for example maybe some like uh fiber network was uh cut uh for some uh for some reason but uh so maybe one of our base will be down so it will create a huge panic even the like the ceo or maybe one level down there at the executive they will intervene they will model they will check the progress like when the moderation system will go back online oh my god so so this is a cost that the business takes on of itself like this this isn't the government paying these companies to do this this is a cost that the business is doing because they are so fearful of accidentally accidentally letting some politically sensitive speech through their system and onto the app that's right exactly so u.s corporate uh companies should feel especially those social media companies they should feel very lucky to operate in the u.s they they don't need such a huge burden to run their daily business so what happened what would happen if some video got through the system that was politically sensitive what would the chinese government do well chinese government they have a special office to handle this like cyber space administration office so they will they have several ways to to to monitor well they will like go through the social media like like by themselves to check whether those uh social media platforms are uh following the rules following the order yeah another way is that they will receive some like reports or like flag so if they receive those they will uh so they will gather those case they received to send back to the social media company to like ask why this content or this video about this specific issue what was leaked why you failed to stop it from spreading and is is there something in the laws of china that says like you cannot you what's it or is it just implied as in like is it actually illegal to have politically sensitive speech out there from uh like an individual or business standpoint or is it just kind of implied that if you do this the chinese government is going to do bad things to you like where what's the actual legal precedent here well um i don't think there's any legal president here well the constitution of china is like the best but you know it's all come down to the uh implement they can always try to find some like law to [Music] to punish you uh-huh and so who's that who's at risk i'll say by dance this uh by dance accidentally lets uh accidentally let some content through its system that's politically sensitive it's talking crap about xi jinping uh saying china's bad uh and and maybe that happens a second time or a third time and then all of a sudden like what would the chinese government do to buy dance like what would it how would it react good question like uh a few a few years ago at that time i think the restriction on moderation is not that strict so uh so by dance just saying that um um like a recommendation algorithm is not political but a lot of like political sensitive content are recommended or spread on their platform so the authority just just have some police go straight to their to their office require some reports or they were intervened directly and even those those of those uh police will even set office directly at the by dance uh headquarter and also all the apps are built by bidens will be take down from the app store uh yeah and they say i think recently there's a company called dd and they are the uber of china so they go they listed in the in the u.s without the direct permission from the chinese authority so their app has been take down for i guess already one year so and does the what so the revenue of that business is dropped to zero yes so only existing so only existing users can you can access their app since uh app store can no longer distribute those uh app in insta uh uh yeah installation and so this kind of feels like a fine a temporary fines like your revenue is gonna drop for a year is it possible to recover from that yeah if you comply or if you apply very strict moderation policy so that's why we need 20 or 30 30 000 people to do the daily job and to apply maybe a streeter or you have very strong self uh you need to have a very strong self discipline to to moderate the content even though sometimes maybe the the stay or the authority only require you to go to go 50 mile but you have to go 100 mile just to uh be sure you are safe and you said it's 20 to 30 000 people of moderators uh content moderators for bidance but i'm assuming there's another there's like each app or each company has their own army of moderators and so that you know you multiply this by like in the number of companies that that are in this game like how many how many companies out there in in china do you think have this like army of content moderators well another huge huge content platform is uh is wechat or a tencent yeah they have even straighter rules so uh like tencent run uh wechats so it's like the an instant message message app like uh like uh what what's up in in the us yeah so if you uh criticize uh xi jinping or any leader in the wechat group the police can directly intervene and ask you to go to the police office to have a cup of coffee it's that kind of serious and is that because uh wechat reported the transaction the not the transaction uh reported the text message or the message to the authority saying hey this person just said something negative about um about the government uh i think the local even the local police they have direct assets to to to moderate uh like what's happening in the local area so and they since your vision account is linked to your uh link to your uh cell phone your phone number so they can reach out to you uh easily yeah you don't even need the tencent to do that kind of like reporting stuff the the local police will will do it themselves okay so uh by dance has like 20 to 30 000 content moderators maybe something like 10 has 30 40 50 000 moderators i think if you add up a number of apps we're going to quickly get past 100 maybe 200 000 content moderators if you add them all up maybe way more like at some point the topic of like automation comes into play because that's really expensive like that's a hundred to two hundred thousand content moderators that are manually scouring content how how does this thing scale out is is china like trying to like make this thing uh automated so we can start saving some costs yeah we are yeah that's where ai play the play the roles so uh we always say like ai goes to the left and crito goes to the right so ai is kind of like a to that authoritarian regime like since it can easily to [Music] to figure out the pattern so they can uh figure out like what kind of content it is so uh other companies are heavily heavily using the ai model to to help the moderator uh to be more efficient finding out the content we don't like and so where does this go when like the algorithms the ai algorithms get like really really really good at their job and like i mean i mean imagine like we don't need so many content moderators it's just so effectively streamlined do people are people like concerned about the logical conclusion of this um i'm i'm what do you mean like uh is like how good at its job is the ai content moderation is it like really good well uh well it really depends on like what kind of content you are trying to moderate for example uh if you pull out a gun and put it into in front of the camera then like it will be detect easily like within within seconds and this kind of a frame or this graph will be reported and goes to the to the moderator yeah but most of their company are trying to find a good balance between uh between user experience and uh and compliance so that's why they are hiring so many uh moderator to to do the manual uh check that yeah of course you can use ai to uh to do the automation to do the uh moderation automatically but yeah there's a trade-off if there's a huge like mistake then maybe a lot of content will be deleted and a lot of uh account will be banned so it's hard to fund those uh uh balance uh but i guess they are getting better on this uh gradually so we can like even though our business is growing like 10 less but we can try to keep our moderator uh account the same okay so moderator head count stays the same content grows and like it's ai that's really filling that gap to really allow for the scaling of this moderation yeah what happened i remember a few years ago and probably still going on to this day but there was this uh big controversy with the uyghurs and the uyghurs were being like oppressed and censored what's their story with this with content in inside of china like how how did the uyghur and content moderation uh intersection interact with each other yeah good question well um i think dialect is kind of a encryption so if you speak english as the chinese then the moderator who only know chinese they cannot figure out what like what david is speaking right so uh in china most of the people speak mandarin yeah and most of our moderators only know mandarin or maybe their own local diet but dialect but there are a lot of dialects in in china so it's uh so some people speak cantonese and some people speak like a weaker language yeah and a weaker and tibetan area are like very political sensitive in in china so [Music] uh well first uh people from that kind of region from uh uh rigger and tibet uh they are not allowed to like live stream so because live streaming is very dangerous because every content you upload is uh is uh going out uh without uh moderation in advance so they are not allowed to uh live stream uh at that kind of region yeah and also uh whenever the but of course there are maybe some uyghur and uh uh tibetan they live in the uh uh chinese mainland like in beijing and shanghai they can continue to live stream but whenever they speak their local language their live streaming will be will be stopped because the moderator cannot understand what they are saying so it put a huge risk uh to the to the platform uh because like if we cannot understand what they're uh speaking then what if they say something political politically sensitive then maybe our platform will be in trouble so yeah people just brutally uh stop order like streaming or even some like video content that speaking some weaker or tibetan language so i encounter one case during my work at uh by dance so so this kind of process is kind of quite quite stressful and tiring for the for the moderators uh because they will because the rules is so simple right whenever you speak weaker or tibetan or any local dialect that uh moderator don't understand you can just cut it or you can just you can just stop it so i received some requests from the moderate model model register manage management so they ask us to develop a algorithm that can automatically detect the people who is speaking weaker or tibetan language so our system can automatically cut those uh live streaming yeah but uh we we didn't do that i i feel it's inappropriate a company to do this kind of things even though in in china but so i just use a excuse uh saying that we don't have enough data points so uh we cannot do this just to uh uh push it through yeah well what is this uh what what were you not wanting to do like i cut down the live stream or create the algorithm yeah create the algorithm because uh the policy part is not uh i'm not responsible for the policy part and i can i i have no power to to change it all i can do is me as a product manager at uh balance all i can do is to like um request some algorithm uh uh needs or requests to our engineer and build a product and process to to moderate yeah so i'm just trying to do my best to like stop the the harm and if but uh so you you were were you like in protest as in you were saying that you are not going to take part in building this algorithm yeah it's it's not a it's not a protest it's more like a passive way to [Music] trying to not do some dirty job sure but if you did it did that job get finished anyways okay i'm assuming if you didn't do it somebody else would uh i guess yeah i guess uh they just uh believe what what i say to them because we don't have enough data this you know algorithm require huge amount of data to be more precise and uh yeah to be more precise if you don't enough don't have enough data then you can easily make a mistake yeah right okay so you were just saying that uh we don't have enough of like the audio data of the uyghur language to be able to put this into an algorithm exactly and was that true uh no i mean for for big company if you really want to do something you can always do something it's just a like uh trade-off uh it's just about the cause like how badly do you want to do something right did did other um tech companies do this as in automatically take down the live streams of people who spoke uyghur to my knowledge uh no no do you know why they haven't had that ability yet um [Music] huh good question oh i'm not sure yeah i'm i don't know how how other companies do this kind of uh uh product and process stuff juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your trucking account with juno you can send money from your

always meant to be fast cheap secure and fiction free one thing that stands out to me is that the tech companies the private sector if you can really call it the private sector in china they it wasn't done out of racism it was done out of a need to be compliant and so exactly and so like it wasn't like there's this systemic racism against the uyghurs it's just that we the the the uh we the private sector has this fear of accidentally putting out uh politically dissident content and it just so happened that they weren't able to moderate the uyghur language like and so my mind goes to well then the if that is the policy that really forces a lot of china to stick to like the conventional dialects like traditional or i don't know again i'm not sure if i'm using the right words traditional but like conventional mandarin i'm assuming there are thousands and thousands of dialects in china or at least a very large number does that kind of mean that the the smaller more peripheral dialects get more oppressed than like the more canonical like languages and as if you are like a speaker of a you know a smaller dialect you don't have the same access and service and services that you do if you speak mandarin is that is that a fair assumption yes yes that's true nowadays most of the kids grow up speaking uh mandarin even in in school so they only speed their own local dinolet at their at their own house yeah even but uh yeah i think gradually people are speaking more and more mandarin even uh at home right and is that an explicit desire of the chinese government as in they want to funnel everyone into this like same culture well i would think so yes uh yeah of course this have a lot of huge benefit because people in the same region can communicate better easily and it's also easier for the uh for the government to to control because they're always trying to know trying to moderate what people are thinking what people are speaking yeah if you use another encryption or english and algorithm or local dialect then it's hard to yeah it's hard to govern um that's nuts uh is there any sort of sentiment of like do the people uh do the chinese people like this or do they accept this or like what is the positive to negative sentiment of the chinese people about like this extreme level of like content moderation well oh good question of course nobody liked it but everyone ever it's like universally accepted that no one likes it no no one likes it you always feel that frustrated whenever like uh the thing you post got deleted or the thing you retweet got deleted so chinese gov chinese people become like really good first at self moderating we know what to say and we know what should not say and if we really want to say something that is not allowed we will create our own language to to to this to describe it and every everybody just know that the meaning so yeah this is one thing uh how when how to express yourself uh in such a harsh environment and also uh we know when to save the content that will be possibly censored so we always like screenshot everything like whenever there's a hot take or popular article that uh regarding maybe some social event or criticizing the government yeah then people will automatically screenshot it and share it in different kind of media because they think that it might get taken down so they want to save it themselves yes yes so it's like everybody become a note note in in the critical world so they will just uh they will just download those content into their local device and maybe post it or share in their small small distribution channel with their with their friends family right they make they make the data sharing more decentralized um yeah is the is like the hot take or popular article is that like a code word for this is politically dubious content so you better like keep it uh perk up your ears yeah i think people are just very sensitive after i think especially after after the colvate people have experienced a large scale of a harsh content moderation so yeah people people know what to what to say and what to save and so is there any sense of like the people pushing back against this so if you're if you're telling me that uh there's like this alternative language like a secret language out there that like is used on social media to indicate um something and that indication is like oh yeah you should take take a screenshot of this or maybe you just want to like pay attention to this a little bit more is it does that mean that like the populist the general populist is like finding ways to explicitly push back against this censorship or or is it more of just people kind of want to keep their keep their head down and not get themselves into trouble yeah the the pushback is very i would say very weak and it's really event driven so whenever there's a huge uh like whenever there's a popular uh article that got deleted people will try to fight back by posting uh like posting their own screenshot or they are trying to like uh that they're not trying to upload the screenshot directly they might rotate the screenshots or they might draw something on the screenshot just to make the moderation much difficult or they will use their like local dialect to translate the original article so that it's even more difficult to to moderate yeah and is it dangerous to do this uh in general is not yeah yeah it's not very dangerous to to spread the content since you are not the original creator of this content interesting interesting but if but if you are the aggregator you aggregate all the content and share it to the public then you will be arrested and there are already several young young young young people that are already being arrested for aggregating and spreading those content what does it mean to get arrested do you go to jail for like a week a month a year well yeah i think for what i know that those people have been arrested and waiting for the for the sentence i'm not sure how long the sentence will be but at least a few years and when when people are like face to face and they're not using their devices or the internet to communicate do they speak more freely or do they do they also kind of maintain some level of self-censorship um yeah when you speak face to face you definitely more more uh lose or you have more freedom to speak so that's why maybe people uh authorities are very afraid of huge gathering especially during covet that's why maybe recently when people go to a uh so recently there's a web 3 conference or event happen in dali it's a place in the south uh south southwestern china so people just gather in there to have some uh meeting but uh whenever there is a like huge meeting if the people the attendance exceed 100 the police will precisely break in and ask everyone to like to recall every uh to record the information from all the for all the people who attend this kind of event um well there's been a couple of people that i've talked to uh who who are there used to live in china or still do live in china we we once did a show on bank lists about the chinese cbdc with this author richard turin and the author uh was giving rave reviews about the cbdc saying it was putting like financial tools in a lot more people's hands it was doing a great job it was just like banking the unbanked and like i i can't remember where it was it was um another uh crypto event where i met somebody who was from china and they said like yeah like well the west kind of thinks china is a super oppressive authoritarian state you know i actually like appreciate what my government does for for better or for worse and they actually do a lot of good and they help out with they just they just help i'm wondering if if like well this so far this episode has all been about just like the insane levels of content moderation and censorship out of china but is there also a feeling of just like yeah the chinese government is like effective and and they perform well and we appreciate them just like what's the other side of of this story um good question or would you say it's all negative well it's definitely not all negative for example china have a great infrastructure like we have a high-speed uh high-speed railway that uh goes like literally everywhere yeah so sometimes uh you don't even want to take the plane since you know the security check the the wait time is so it's so long so unless you would just prefer to go to the uh use the railway and i think maybe the 5g infrastructure is quite stable and the internet service is quite stable uh i i it's like i never feel any like internet shutdown in in china but even in the silicon valley i'm not living in silicon valley it's like it already happened to or at least three times during my stay here within within one year so yeah a centralized and a very centralized government can can definitely produce something that uh western democracy that cannot but uh maybe at the price of taxpayers money those those projects may not be very profitable so yeah so it's like everybody is subsidizing for that but uh yeah and people of course can have some of benefit from that also yeah how would you say uh how do the people of china think about the future of china are they like optimistic about the future are they pessimistic about the future what's their general opinion uh i talked to a few of my friends and chinese or american in general people are very pessimistic in the short run but very optimistic in the long run yeah the generation well why is that um why we are very pessimistic about the short run because uh i think because often cleans it up well first it's because of the kovic like everybody in this planet and it feels like china is the only huge nation state that haven't recovered from the kobe or even still have very strict kobe restriction rules and you can often hear in the lockdown news now and then here and there and you know the lockdown in china is different than the west in california during lockdown you can still walk the dog right you can still go to go to the coast guard or targets to buy your grocery but the lockdown in china means locked down you are locked down your own apartment you are not allowed to go out all you can do is order the delivery but what about the poor people right how about the delivery man how about their life that's that's very kind of suffering so first is kobe and second is about about our president so he changed the constitution a few years ago so he can be the pr so he eliminate he made the turn limit so he can be the president like for life indefinitely yeah so that's why people are very passionate uh pessimistic in the in the short run why were they optimistic in the long term well i don't know i guess we are always optimistic and [Music] we have a huge domestic market we have a huge amount of population and i think china have very a lot of similarity just like russia so we all live in the authoritarian regime for for for now and but i mean if you can just look at the history for example like uh uh like math olympics you just take a look at the winner they are all like chinese even though they might be american chinese so yeah and just just take a look like web 2 uh like during the web 2 era the only great company that is capable of competing with the with the west uh is like the chinese company so yeah so in general we are quite optimistic if we can live without a limitation without the burden that that's not necessary yeah well you lived in china were you familiar with ethereum or did that come after you left yeah good question so uh during covey i i quit my job i feel very pessimistic in the shop in the show run so i feel like uh maybe going to the us is my only way so in the summer so i'm just browsing on on the twitter i saw one of my friend post a blog regarding your farming so i so i found it very interesting i mean like amazing how can you get like yo like 20 apr unstable unstable i mean it's it's ridiculous you can only get maybe 30 or 5 from the chinese bank so i feel like it's a huge arbitrage opportunity so i put all my uh money yeah through the usd t usdc and start uh your farming with with stable we study bitcoin so first from bsc yeah that's that that's another topic i i feel like all uv and a good evm so it's good for onboarding new users since at that time i feel like you just if you do a swap on units walk it costs like 100 or 200 us us dollar that's uh so expensive yeah yeah so long story short i go to bsc and i try to do some your farming and i'm getting more comfortable so i go to polygon for you for me again yeah and i think since then i was like uh went into the rabbit holes like most of us most of the people who uh here nowadays and listen to like bankless unchained the daily grade those are amazing content you guys provided yeah so uh so i'm become more active in the ethereum community reading with ali's blog yeah this is like how i get into ethereum how did you think about um or do you think about like the intersection of your previous job at bi-dance and ethereum like how do you think those things relate was that something you were thinking of while you were going down the rabbit hole yes i think it's a huge huge difference about this to to world so what what are they in in imbalance is like moderation or censorship to be more precise but ethereum is like anti-censorship uh so i feel like my work in the crypto space in the ethereum ecosystem is feel like a redemption i'm trying to retain my my scene i'm trying to save myself from my past past 30 30 work yeah because oh sorry to interrupt uh i think there are only two things in the world that authoritarian regime that cannot censor so one is bitcoin of course and second is ethereum especially when ethereum go to after the merge it's like unstoppable so i guess that's why i love ethereum so much since i focus so much on the decentralization and anti-censorship so yeah i feel like it's a good fit and especially my work after my work in in finance i appreciate the the feature of anti-censorship uh a lot more than than other people maybe especially with the people who live in the u.s uh maybe the most difficult things you ever experience is uh deep deep platforming uh trump even though i think it makes sense but it's still a big shock for a lot of people yeah what about um just uh the general chinese populists is there like positive pro crypto sentiment among the people or neutral or what's the people's thoughts on bitcoin and ethereum in china um i think for general public i think the sentiment i think for the general public the sentiment would be quite similar no matter in the in the west or in the china uh there are still a lot of speculation going on people really don't understand the fundamental the always consider cryptocurrency as a replacement for fiat which it doesn't make sense unless it's stable coins right yeah and especially i think uh chinese government like send out those kind of propaganda every year telling people to avoid to touch the cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency is a is a scam i think still a lot of people have doubt about about crypto in general right but but also here it kind of sounds like it's pretty similar to what it is here like some people think it's a scam like you know our mom's thing is like oh yeah it's a scam right but then also is there like also like the crypto scene in in china or or is there a crypto scene in china uh yes i think it's getting more and more like crypto is attracting more and more people in in china especially after the after defy after uh git coin like refi uh public goods con concept um like soul bank token concept and dao dao governance a lot of people with a social science background are trying to break in into the crypto space i think especially after all the web 2 company got wrecked by by the authority so uh people it's it's getting difficult for young people to have a good job in the way to work so people are like uh escaping or running to to the crypto for various other reasons beautiful well jijong now that i have you on bank list is there anything uh any message that you have for the bankless nation anything you want to say um yeah uh i think i have a few things to say well uh first uh real vitalis block that's very important that's the best best source and best source you can get to help you to understand crypto how you is understand ethereum yeah and the second is focus on the fundamentals trying to understand the product and process and care less about the price movement and i think for those people who really bullish on ethereum or or crypto in general i think the cheaper the token price gets you should be like more happier since you can buy it by in such a low price right yeah um yeah and trying to build i think building is a it's super fun and it's a really good period to build especially the uh the vcs i mean huge amount of money from vc no matter what you build even though you build something extremely stupid there are still people are willing to to to to invest in you so it's a really good time to build and yeah i say basically that's it thank you dave awesome of course ji jong thank you for so much for coming on bank
