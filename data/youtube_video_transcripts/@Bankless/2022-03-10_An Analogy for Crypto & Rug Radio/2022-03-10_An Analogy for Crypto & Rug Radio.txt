i had spent a little bit of time in my company beforehand in um organic agriculture natural complex decentralized systems is what nature actually runs by and when i read the ethereum white paper i could just see that had a natural complex system element to it that's the most interesting answer i've ever heard of like somebody's click moment like i studied complex systems in nature and i saw ethereum and that's why what does that actually mean like what what was the complexity that was being abstracted away or the potential there that you saw with ethereum if you look at your garden a rose bush in the soil and all the bugs around it and the rain and atmosphere that's a natural decentralized system right none of those components are talking to each other it's only existing because of each other's existence like it's a perpetual network effect of each other's existence constantly compounding on itself if you really break down crypto and the technology that's kind of essentially how it works it's just a group of complex system compounding against each other
