thankless Nation today we've got an episode for you with the founders of polygon we are talking about the polygon end game this release the software release this upgrade that polygon is doing they call it polygon 2.0 why is this important well polygon is one of the most used chains in crypto and I think that in itself is a massive accomplishment there's also been some criticism of polygon in the past some critiques that it's just a side chain and maybe it doesn't have the ethereum alignment that the marketing says it does I think the release of polygon 2.0 will Silence the Critics there's a lot of decentralization going on in today's conversation including a path forward for the polygon proof of stake chain a few things we talk about number one how polygon is scaling ethereum using ZK technology number two promised polygon meets the community to upgrade the polygon proof of stake chain and change it to a roll-up more specifically a validium we'll talk about what they're doing there number free we'll talk about polygon's big token upgrade what they're doing with the Matic token they're converting it to even more of a work token interesting discussion follows there they don't see Matic being a money token and number four we conclude with what is going on with layer twos the infrastructure Wars as they were called in today's episode David what were your takes on this episode well we all know that we are in the middle of the layer 2 War so the the layer two Wars are definitely heating up especially here at ECC and polygons transition to polygon 2 also enters into the game their strategy for going from a single chain to many many chains uh we have of course have the op stack the ZK stack arbitrine recently has now uh orbits and now polygon has their fully fledged ecosystem to have what they call Super Nets to also fit into the world of all of these layer 2 platforms that want to turn into standards for horizontal scaling so we could all have infinite block space especially by the time this next bull market comes around which uh lately seems to be coming a little bit closer than a little bit sooner than I think we all anticipated so I think listeners are going to learn a ton in this episode about polygon about one of the most used networks that we have on ethereum before we get into the episode quick disclosures polygon is a sponsor to bankless Ryan here is also an advisor to polygon I also have some small amount of polytokines as well um polygon's been around for a while and we're big fans and so those are our disclosures you can see all of our disclosures at bankless.com disclosures all right let's go and hear it from Sandeep and me Hollow the two co-founders of polygon but first I want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that

get started today introducing polygon 2.0 the value layer for the internet for too long the limitations of blockchains have held back app development and stifled user adoption the internet allows anyone to create and exchange information what's missing is a value layer that lets anyone Exchange store and program value that's where polygon 2.0 comes in polygon Labs has unveiled a series of innovations that will radically alter the polygon ecosystem and web3 as a whole by leveraging groundbreaking ZK Innovations such as polygon ZK evm the next iteration of the Best in Class plonky 2 proving system and a first of its kind ZK powered interoperability layer polygon 2.0 will give users and devs unlimited scalability and unified liquidity right now there is a polygon Improvement proposal regarding a potential ZK powered upgrade of polygon proof of stake if approved polygon proof of stake would become a layer 2 ZK evm validium so make your voice heard on this proposal by joining the polygon Discord today you have a chance to help the polygon Community give the internet the value layer it deserves mantle formerly known as bit Dao is the first dao-led web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce mantle Network's gas fees by 80 but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web3 space for mantle mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded like game 7 for web free gaming and buy bit for tvl and liquidity and on-ramp so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle Banco station we are super excited to introduce you once again to Sandeep and Mahalo there the co-founders of polygon they are beaming in from ethcc the conference so we're all in hotel rooms well except for me of course I'm always at home never on the conference scene Sandeep Mahalo how are you guys doing great doing great doing great doing great what are you showing us wait what's happening polygon tattoos you got a polygon tattoo oh it's temporary uh and yeah like just uh hustling through the CC it's like uh arguably the best uh event in that like very high quality really great event I'm glad it's been good for you guys um David's been filling me in and we've got a whole bunch of uh conversations coming out of that but that tattoo I'm a little concerned saying deep that it's temporary because you know we're all about immutability in crypto here so I'm waiting for the immutable polygon tattoo that is Inked and cannot be removed so in this episode we're gonna get into all of polygon 2.0 because there's a big update we're getting some changes to the polygon token we're going to talk about the technology transition from the proof of stake to the zkevm but before it's just a little bit more on ECC I've had a fantastic ECC but I want to get your guys's perceptions as to who is asking you guys about what about polygon what's been the the response because this announcement went out you know earlier than ECC so when people come up to talk to you guys and ask you guys questions what are they what are they poking around about like what's the hype about polygon when they come to talk to you I think generally like the polygon 2.0 has been received very very well in the industry like much beyond the expectations that we were thinking and everybody is like you know this is like I actually met like some of the researchers which you know including you know I mean a lot of researchers from the from from ethereum Foundation to Cosmos to to like various different ecosystems and you know many of them said that you know the polygon 2.0 architecture that this they see it's it feels like the most you know kind of practical and probable architecture like whether polygon builds that or somebody else builds that that's a separate thing but point being that using the power of ZK this looks look looks to be the architecture which can actually provide this infinitely scaling web3 uh you know trustless computation and you know also while even though you are scaling infinitely while providing a level of like you know proven composability or a cross chain uh as we say Unified liquidity across this value layer of Internet we say so I think that that has been that has been the highlight uh for us and definitely a lot a lot of discussion around ZK because you know arguably now our uh you know polygon ZK stuff is like absolutely state of that so uh Jordy is like a rock star you know here so yeah a lot of GK related discussions and uh developers coming after us yeah I can just take over what's what Sandeep said I think in in addition to that I think it's kind of becoming obvious we at some point became not not really irritated but we felt a little bit sad that we were not really able to communicate all the great development that's happening on the ZK front uh within polygon now and I think now finally Community understands how how strong polygon zkt means and how exciting everything that you're working on uh uh is so so that was my maybe second biggest kind of impression that that people are starting to to kind of realize that and with yeah with polygon 2.0 the the the um the the feedback has been really really great and we are very excited to to move forward with the whole um with the whole concept one of my favorite memories of ECC Mahalo was in 2021 it was you me and Mariano Conte and it was the last day of VCC a lot of people had already left and it was just us three left it felt like yeah and we were just grabbing some beers and I remember you get a phone call and you jump up from the table and go take this phone call for five to ten minutes and just me and Mariano just like chatting just chatting drinking our beers and then you come back and you sit down and he goes oh really good news guys really good news and me and Mariano are like oh great what what is it tell us and you go I can't say I can't say I'm like well Hollow come on bro what you got you got to say it's like no I can't say it guys I can't say and then like six weeks eight weeks later polygon announces the acquisition of Hermes which later turned her into polygon Hermes which is of course jordy's project and then next EC a year later was the announcement of polygon ZK evm and then now here we are at the ZK evm polygon 2.0 stack so it's just a nice little like quick story about like ECC in the progression of these systems over the years and you know the players that stick around through the years and relentlessly build forward totally and then at this point I I as you know and as you understood later I had that kind of vote of NDA type of author because Hermes had a token right and we could not have publicly said anything in order to avoid any sort of speculation and whatnot that was the only reason otherwise of course I would have shared with you with pleasure but uh yeah Paris is very significant kind of for for development of polygon and this short but very exciting history and yeah we also announced zkvm here in Paris and now we were kind of wrapping up the whole polygon 2.0 thing here as well yeah and I think for Jordy it's even more historical like you know he actually presented the first time the idea of a ZK based roll up like he's the 90 people don't know that he's the one who came up with this idea he originally presented it here next year presented like the the Hermes 1.0 which was only a payment thing launched that then next year we announced the polygon uh you know working together and they announced last year they had announced test net uh I think right in the in the HTC and this year last year was the competition of the code it was feature complete we released the code base completely and uh yeah now the maintenance it's incredible how um crypto has has kind of grown I remember a time where I could keep track of all of the major projects you just see even all of the major projects that we're building on ethereum right it's just like I had them in my brain and now it's getting difficult to even keep up with all of the major projects on top of polygon right like the polygon ecosystem is probably bigger than the entire ethereum ecosystem uh Circa 2019 2020. right that that's how fast it's grown and so we're I think we want to start this conversation because this is a conversation to really unpack this thing called polygon 2.0 and I want to make sure that listeners understand what polygon 2.0 is and what it contains because there's a lot going on here right it just inside of the polygon ecosystem and I think the way um I understand this is maybe divided into into three parts that we want to touch on today the first part is polygon proof of stake moving to a ZK evm and what that means so that's the first thread we'll pull on a secondly I think we want to talk about the holistic stack here the tech stack you know the layers and what you're doing here because this will give people a sense for what the capabilities of the polygon ecosystem and architecture are and then thirdly I think we want to talk about token economics the token economics of Matic and where this is moving uh moving forward so those are the three kind of pillars we're going to touch does that sound good yeah and there's a fourth one which is the the governance the the release of the new governance framework that you're proposing for for the whole ecosystem for governing pre important or free pillars as we Define them of of uh polygon ecosystem and polygon governance lovely okay so we got three pillars and then we got this governance wrapper around those three pillars that we're going to talk about so um so I mean the polygon 2.0 like I'll first take a stab I did like at a high level yeah yeah give us the high level and then you know go more deep into technical stuff but basically the whole design of polygon 2.0 is the philosophy is exactly how uh or as derived from the current web to internet right like you know this is web 3 and we want to say that if web3 is going to achieve or is is uh you know we want web3 to achieve that level of scale of web 2 then it needs to have two key characteristics that webto has the first key characteristics as web 2 web 2 has is practically infinitely scalable more websites more apps more uh you know softwares are going uh you know need to be created you you create more and more servers and you know it keeps on growing like you know every year we have like millions of millions of uh apps join the system so it needs to be infinitely scalable second the second part is even more important is that this is this web 2 is basically this internet of information internet of data where the information can seamlessly flow from like it doesn't matter whether I am you know sitting in Paris and you guys are in us and the the website that we are accessing in between is from some other part of the of the world and uh you know we can seamlessly you know use this uh or share and create and exchange that information with each other right whether it's video content this content that content it's seamless basically it it wasn't like that uh you know 30 40 years back when the internet actually came it was named internet because it was a network of networks previous through that there was a lot of networks but they were like darpanet and things like that they were die separate networks and previously you know if you wanted to have some information or data moving from one kind of network to another Network it almost felt like that like it feels today when you have to bridge your usdt into other chain and things like that right so the information also was not seamless but today it's seamless so these two should be the characteristics like infinitely scalable and unified liquidity that we say we because it's the internet of value we say Unified liquidity means value can move from one layer to another layer seamlessly and how we achieve that is basically uh you know we have a very nice diagram also very simply which says that which shows that you know polygon is is basically is going to become this multi-chain network of layer twos secured by ZK so everything needs to be secured by ZK and we will discuss about like our polygon POS converting into ZK and all that all that combines and aligns into this Vision that all the chains here whether it's supernet supernet previously used to be like individual side chains and eventually they were going to have ZK proofs so that moment has arrived now that where all you can have like polygon POS chain like chain public chains ZK VM chain or these supernets everything uh you know acts as a layer two uh you know proven on ethereum on top of ethereum using the power of ZK and then we have an aggregator layer which actually combines the ZK proofs in one recursively and puts one single proof on ethereum what happens with these recursive combination in this aggregator layer is that one chain like let's say you are on a chain number 100 and you are you want to swap some value from chain number 10 to chain number 100 right what you do essentially there is simply the moment the chain number 10 has put some put the ZK proof on the aggregator layer the chain number 100 can easily see that that ZK proof and knows that the XYZ transaction that is coming on chain number 100 is a part of this ZK proof that has been submitted that means you can allow that cross chain transaction to happen so and imagine like how big big this concept is that you don't care whether that chain has one validator too well later 100 validator doesn't matter it's a private chain doesn't matter for you as far as the transaction can be proven that this transaction is a part of this ZK proof the other chains in the ecosystem will be able to Simply uh you know take that right so essentially what is being solved here first you can have as much as much block space if you want like as many chains can be seen so it's infinitely scalable second because of the power of these ZK proofs all the in all the value is seamlessly able to move across These Chains right so unified liquidity and this is the architecture using this power of ZK and recursion what we have figured out in last two years uh with these multiple ZK teams this brings us to this combination of this polygon 2.0 which is like infinitely scalable and uh you know unified liquidity and uh and yeah like you know that's why uh you know some of these interoperability features and and these features like this all aligns into whatever next Things We Said like polygon PO is becoming ZK and things like that hello not so much sweat I just um maybe I can just say that we are very very kind of uh happy and confident about this Tech stack that you're proposing now and it is uh the result of this of practically two years long period of I I would say Divergence that we have had in polygon um so we understood that we shouldn't really try to predict the future to to from the get-go propose one single approach one single Tech stack and and that has played out pretty badly for for some of the projects projects out there in the in the past right and and um proposing or or or creating the architecture that is indeed that can support mainstream adoption that can support practically unlimited scalability and seamless interoperability is not an easy task obviously and we have intentionally uh um encouraged this period of experimentation and as I said that it has lasted for almost two years and we have had multiple client development efforts multiple ZK projects experimenting even with data availability and whatnot and we have really learned a lot uh uh during during that period and we slowly sometime ago started converging so to say towards a more concrete architecture and now we are I would say very confident uh uh that this is the way to go and yeah by leveraging as Sandeep said the the power of ZK and advanced advanced implementations like ZK VM that we have been able to ship uh uh and this Advanced and in my uh um to to the best of my knowledge the only interoperability protocol that allows uh um scalability and Global consistency across the whole ecosystem I have never seen such approach um we are very confident that this is the the optimal uh architecture to build basically the value layer of the internet this is very cool there's there's two themes I'm kind of drawing upon maybe for the listener and what you're describing for polygon 2.0 uh here uh you know the first is what you were just talking about Mahalo is this journey for polygon from Divergence to convergence and I'll just say um one of the strengths of polygon has always been I think it's practicality in that you guys didn't just test one approach you tested like all of the approaches at once like even I remember for a while when it kind of Matic uh you know was doing like the plasma based approach as well and so you had side chains you had plasma you had proof of stake you have Roll-Ups you're doing all of the approaches at once and the concern about that the the benefit of that kind of Divergence is you get to test all the experiments you don't have to bet on a single experiment the concern about that is well what if it fractures what if we're not able to create a unified experience what if we're not able to scale this what if it's brittle and so now the next move and why this is a 1.0 to a 2.0 is because this is a move towards convergence where you can unify all of these approaches and I've heard you say it so many times that I want to like I want to emphasize it feels like ZK that this term zero knowledge these ZK proofs have been kind of the unlock that allows for that a convergence and I I don't know that I sufficiently understand how that works I I'm hopeful I get a better understanding by the end of this episode but that if we can unlock ZK that gives us this scalability and the unified one network type of user experience that we're all looking for so let's talk about that and um I think a lot of listeners will be familiar with or will have used uh polygons proof of stake Network at some point in time you know with it with Matic tokens and you're doing all sorts of D5 types of things on top of polygon proof of stake chain that is moving to ZK evm type of technology or actually why don't you guys describe what this proof of stake chain to ZK transition is going to look like so the before State and the after State and the increased kind of unification security guarantees that we get after this change is in place um do you want to start do you want to start Sandeep yep uh so basically first I want to give a very you know kind of layman uh definition of zika like what exactly like why why are we able to use ZK for the zero knowledge technology which was used to be a privacy technology like which was initially popular for privacy technology how it is used for scaling essentially in ZK what what you are doing is that uh what you do is that you proved someone that you have something or you did something right it's a very simple way especially in the case of computation like it might sound simple but let's say today if let's say Ryan like you said that Sandeep I'm going to pay for your if I was a student you say I'm going to pay for your all your uh education bill for next one year right and at the end of the year I came to you and I gave you 1 000 bills and I said that Ryan like total was a total expense was twenty thousand dollars right the only way you can actually verify that this is actually twenty thousand dollars is you have to go through all the bills and then you have to do the total yourself right if it's plotted in Excel you have to total total it yourself there is no other way now imagine if if my whole billing process was a bigger uh you know computational process like I was doing a lot of things right and I wanted to prove to you there is only one way I have to give you all the data you have to run the whole program yourself and then prove something right and when we are trying to scale ethereum now think of it from from ethereum's murder we are trying to scale the execution power on ethereum right the only way like for example how it works in let's say in case of uh previously like you know ZK or the solidity Soul VM and all those attempts were there and kind of like optimistic rollups also they don't execute the whole transaction whole data but what they do is in optimistic rollups you put all the data and all the you know State Route and everything on ethereum and then you expect that somebody will run the whole chain and if there is something wrong is found you will raise you will raise the fraud proof right this is why there is a limit to the scalability optimistic rollups can provide and that's why you have a seven day withdrawal period because it's inherently optimistic in nature you are assuming everything is correct but with the power of ZK I can prove you a full blown computation like in the same example I was if I was a student and you paid 20 000 I had thousand bills but we can agree on a simple you know kind of a proof in between or a proof layer in between and I will just give you a proof like and I need 20 000 I will need twenty thousand dollars because this was my bill I give you that succinct proof you put it on that validity proof layer and you are 100 sure that Sandeep is saying correct he's not fudging the bills the same case goes in this situation like if I am a layer two and I am doing a lot of computation like you know the smart contracts are happening and billions of dollars are are being transacted but on ethereum ethereum doesn't need to run all those you know source code on ethereum to be sure that this layer 2 is working fine that's the whole point of layer two right you want ethereum's final guarantee that everything that layer 2 is doing is correct right so instead of that instead of giving the whole transaction like what happens with optimistic rollups they're giving the whole data and the state route and everything to ethereum and then assume somebody will run and you know run the fraud group with ZK you simply provide the whole proof of the computation you say this is a succinct proof this proves that whatever I have done is correct and as per the rules of the of the evm like virtual machine I'm not changing values from my side and all that and ethereum just needs to run that small proof and is 100 sure that the sequencer whether it's one single sequencer it's ten sequencer no matter what everything was executed correctly that is the power of ZK and imagine how big this concept is now you can do huge amount of computations of chin and just bring back small proofs on ethereum the final guarantee is provided by ethereum but you can do huge amount of compute this can provide you that level of scalability that's the simple magic of ZK right and and then it it's only about how much you can optimize those EK proofs how the cost of those creating those proofs can be simpler lower and all that and that's where it's it's like you know the differentiation comes where polygon and especially polygon Z KVM and polygon zero teams and modern teams they have combined like completely like smashed it in terms of the performance of how fast you can improve and how low costly in a low cost manner you can prove on or validate on ethereum that's why ZK proofs are called validity proofs the another benefit of ZK is that since it's a validity proof the moment you put the proof on ethereum and ethereum accepts the proof that means everything was correct so you don't need a seven day withdrawal period compared to what you need in optimistic roles if you are putting a proof every five minutes you can withdraw your funds every five minutes using the power GK and this actually like this is why I'm saying that this again let's revisit the polygon 2.0 Vision all these chains layer twos on top of ethereum using the using ZK proofs so it doesn't matter there are five chains 10 chains 100 chains and who is running those changes if it's a college dorm room guy running the chain uh you know that this proof is coming on on this on this uh you know aggregator layer and each chain knows that the execution is done correct and once the proof is submitted to ethereum ethereum also verifies that all these hundreds or thousands of chains they all are executing correctly so now you can have millions and millions of users individually running those chains and the interconnectivity between those changes there so it feels like one single large chain infinitely growing block space because there is interoperability between them and the chain you can add more and more chains to add more and more capacity that is the whole concept of layer 2 and you you said absolutely correctly that ZK is the unlock like these fast ZK proving and these recursive proofs is the unlock that you know are these three four teams working together were able to crack and that's where we are at polygon 2.0 yeah and going back to to polygon ps10 and the the upgrade that you that you that you mentioned so uh currently as as I guess a lot of people know polygon ps10 is one of the most used uh uh chains in in the industry basically it has uh currently way more transactions than than ethereum uh pretty mature or quite mature ecosystem Etc 300 million plus end user wallets or addresses whatever you want to call them and um we definitely don't know what polygonps chain to be left out with this polygon 2.0 Vision right and and this proposed upgrade has two main uh consequences I would say one consequence is currently polygon PSJA is operated by a set of validators they are 100 plus uh uh Matic stakes validators and they're providing the security for the chain and theoretically there is this bridge that uh connects polygon ps10 to ethereum enter it and these validators practice critically and factually controlled this bridge so theoretically they could try if they collude if they gain a lot of or enough or super majority of the stake they could try to attack the chain and maybe withdraw funds from from the bridge itself and now with this proposed upgrade and and ZK VM that is showing great performance uh um already as a reference we have latest benchmarks which are uh of the proving costs for each transfers are 0.00085 so four zeros eight five for for uh I need transferring ZK VM these are the actual proving costs so practically these costs are negligible and and to be honest orders of magnitude lower than what we were initially expected when we when we started working on ZK AVM so and that's for the type 2 that that is already uh um in in production on mainnet VR major in great progress with type 1 and basically we will have opportunity to choose whichever approach is better for for the community and for for the peer exchange specifically but a long story short the RZ KVM Tech is definitely mature enough now so it can support uh the level of activity that POS change has uh hence why we decided to to put forward this proposal to upgrade it to the cable idiom so as I described described the the chain itself and the bridge is currently controlled by this set of validators after the upgrade we can continue to have these validators but but in the form of decentralized sequencers and use the power of zkvm to turn this POS chain which is practically a side train at the moment uh into a full-blown layer tool we are proposing the validium solution because we currently have roll up already live on on mainnet the zkb enrollment that is already active and zkv and validium and ZK VMware roll up would become kind of like a nice product mix where you have this trade-offs between validium and roll up roll up he has full-blown security of ethereum because it uses ethereum also for data availability but it has lower throughput and higher costs uh whereas the this validium has much higher throughput much lower footprint on ethereum hence can offer much lower transaction fees so basically any application can can pick uh one of these two solutions so that's currently what we're proposing we're also in discussions with the with people from the the ethereum foundation and dencrat we just discussed here in in Paris and Justin Drake we are practically not even against turning this POS chain into a full-blown roll-up but for that we were we would at the very least need four eight four four eip8 4844 uh activ1 minute we will have some sort of uh working group group in the following weeks to just basically explore even that as an option but the current proposal is to turn POS 10 into validium and we have this roll up already on mainnet so that would be as I said kind of like a nice product mix um that would uh increase significantly there too as I said major consequences of that one major consequence is that the security of the pH chain would meet dramatically I would say uh improved in a sense that all transactions uh on polygon POS 10 would be proven uh back on ethereum and it would become the first decentralized uh layer 2 in the in the ethereum ecosystem to the best of my knowledge at least and uh and by far the most used one so we're very excited about this proposal uh because of that and the second major consequence is that polygon PSG would become compatible so to say with the wider polygon 2.0 Vision that we are proposing now given that it's going to use or it will use a ZK VM it can plug into this kind of interoperability protocol and seamlessly exchange uh value with any other chain in in the polygonic system so there are these two major consequences of this of this upgrade then yeah it's a very big event for the for the polygonic system and we're very excited about it so we've seen layer twos upgrade themselves both Arbitron and optimism they've had their Nitro and Bedrock upgrades but that's going from one optimistic roll-up upgrade to just a better optimistic roll-up upgrade we haven't seen an optimistic roll-up proof of stake chain upgrade to a ZK evm okay you talk about the actual details of that transition uh what will people have to do what will users have to do what will node operators have to do what what are they how how should we think about that actual upgrade event yeah for sure so so it's going to be pretty seamless upgrade then it's generally pretty straightforward the building the tech components for that will enable the upgrade was the hard part um so practically what we have to do currently polygon pschain runs uh the block the validators are producing blocks and extending the chain and every half an hour there is a checkpoint on ethereum the checkpoint in order for a checkpoint to be accepted on ethereum there has to be a signature or a set of signatures from the super majority of the stake in the in the polygon POS chain we're only that's the only way the checkpoint can get accepted on ethereum what we practically need to do is to modify smart contracts uh for checkpoints on ethereum instead of or in addition to these validator signatures it will also require the zkbm proof so uh that's more or less the only thing you need to do uh on a high level to upgrade this POS chain to uh ZK yongolidium and obviously there has to be a client upgrade then all validators will have to upgrade their clients but that is pretty similar basically to any other upgrade or hard Fork that as you said other layer tools or ethereum or rzkvm or posj and all of these chains are doing generally regular upgrades I.E hard forks and that's going to be just another one for the validators there is one additional component is now this unified liquidity and and this interoperability this bridge that is already holding some assets basically billions of dollars of different types of assets we'll just have to merge with this with this um interoperability pool or bridge that we are proposing now in that substantive uh kind of described but that is a separate process so to say uh of the upgrade itself so long story short and that has to be done also you know Community has to be involved only on that part like polygon Community has to get involved where they have to vote and there has to be a governance process and how this Bridge moves into this ZK secured secured bridge but uh otherwise like for end users it will be just like ethereum much like we actually wanted to call it like at one point in time I was a you know prop owner of calling it polygon much because it's that unprecedented uh kind of thing as you David rightly said that it has never happened before so it's kind of a very big event and and you know uh if when if and when the polygon beam pulls uh pulls through it I think is going to be a technological feat like the way ethereum much was and you know the it will look like and feel like exactly almost like the same event uh that happened yeah I will tell you for me personally the the movement in this direction is kind of like a promises made Promises Kept moment for me because um it could have been easier and it probably would have been easier for you guys to keep um polygon as a side chain and not um pursue this whole ZK path it would have it would have been uh easier probably less expensive you wouldn't have to kind of make the Investments that you're making and so for me and I just want to be clear in kind of the summary of what's happening for for listeners who aren't in the weeds here but uh the polygon proof of stake chain moving to be more secured by ethereum and settled on ethereum is a really big move and a really big moment and Davey called it unprecedented for kind of a side chain to do this and what's happening it sounds like to me is the polygon proof of stake chain is converting to what's called a validium and if bankless listeners aren't familiar with that the term validium means it means basically like the consensus layer settles on ethereum the data layer settles not on ethereum somewhere else for now that's what a validium is and there are other validium examples that you know on layer 2 beat you can see immutable X is one such example arbitrum has some you know validium types of architecture so that's where the proof of stake chain is going and polygon also has a chain that is fully fledged ZK evm that the data layer and consensus layer completely settles down to an ethereum and these are kind of two chains that are working in parallel right now and two different options when about is this change going to happen well the polygon merge actually occur is this sort of up to the community are we talking weeks months uh something longer uh definitely up to the community we have this governance process for for currently for the polygon pH chain which is uh coordinated through the concept of Pips polygon Improvement proposals which are kind of equivalent to ethereum Improvement proposals um so uh we will put an actual pip out there for the community to to discuss very soon I believe in a matter of uh weeks even um after that it depends on on the feedback there is a set of public discussions on forums on polygon protocol governance calls Etc uh but so far we have we have uh proposed this upgrade as a what we call a pre-pip it's uh like a document official document meant for kind of temperature check of the community and whatnot and the responses have been extremely positive so far which means that the governance process can can uh we can go through it pretty fast I would say after we post the actual beep I believe maybe one to two months uh to to kind of uh gather the community consensus and then it's a matter of actual implementation and implementation will uh will happen in several uh phases but I believe uh definitely end of year should be realistic at least for the first phase uh in my opinion given the great kind of community feedback we have uh we have received so far metamask has

bank list or click the link in the description below one very big component of this upgrade is of course the upgrade to the Matic token and governance of course implies we have to govern with something you need a tool to govern with that's that's the token can you guys walk us through how the Matic token is evolving here because this is a very big part of the story correct yeah so the the magic token like again this is as Ryan said uh you know promises uh kept uh you know uh is basically made promises skipped so basically this also when we actually rebranded from Matic Network to to polygon uh that was the same uh you know again we had promised that uh you know eventually Matic Network which is which was a single chain kind of a ecosystem at that point in time will migrate into this multi-chain on top of ethereum even we initially call it a he called it like ethereum's internet or blockchain so uh you know that uh this will move from one single blockchain ecosystem into this token which can support this multi-chain uh you know ecosystem and also this token is like uh uh a very uh different in the sense that you know as as we call it like this third generation uh you know token why we say third generation is that first generation was BTC right and BTC essentially as a as a token of the network uh you can't you it doesn't have any utility for you as a holder in the network like you can't participate in the network using the PTC in order to participate you have to buy hardware and do the proof of work then ethereum especially after this uh proof of stake merge uh that happened now every ethereum holder can participate in ethereum uh Main blockchain and stake it and participate in in securing the network right and but then this happens natively this can only happen on ethereum network itself and there are like some product calls have been proposed that we can which can you know on the top of the protocol they can do it separately but natively it happens only on uh ethereum whereas in case of polygon and that's why we call it a third generation token is basically with one single token you can actually validate on hundreds and hundreds of chains right so and that's why we call it hyper productive token that you know with you have Matic pole token you can stake it on hundreds of chains and validate provide your services on that not only you can validate on multiple chains but you also have multiple roles to play in the chains because these Layer Two Chains you can actually play a role of a plane vanilla validate validator or sequencer which is only just plugging the transaction and creating blocks you can also participate as a you know uh in the aggregator layer as the the interoperability layer that we just described you can also participate as a local data availability cluster provider like many of the chains which will act as validiums eventually like the the the supernet chains that are launching app change basically polygon app change that are launching those many of those app chains need low cost data availability for them many of them who will not be able to afford ethereum data availability even after 4844 because the moment a 4844 launches you will have a lot of like you know people doing nfts and all that stuff so it will the cost will grow only few in my analysis like few Roll-Ups will be able to top Roll-Ups which have high value in them uh they will be able to afford that datability but that has to be seen but you can play the role technically if you wanted to play to provide this small level data availability once a chain grows then you will need a global datability like ethereum 4844 and all that then fourth you can also uh you know provide the uh the role of uh I said sequencer datability providers and uh then the aggregator layer and then finally the Proverbs because the way that that now we are doing the proofs the proofs are like single transaction based proof so we have the tech technology basically eventually it's not the high priority right now but in one one and a half years we'll be able to or maybe two years we'll be able to create a decentralized layer of provers where you stake your Matic Network magic token or Paul token and then participate uh in the network by providing the proofs for the chains so essentially you have multiple chains and multiple roles for the users that's why we call it the hyper productive token and you participate in the Network provide the security of the network and on the return returns like which we call return on work row I really like that progression because I think it gives us a short history of the evolution of crypto networks so you have you have Bitcoin which is you have zero networks to participate in you just have the asset you can't participate in the network then you have ethereum which you have one network you can participate in one proof of stake ethereum chain and then you have polygon which true to its name has a poly number of networks to participate in and so you have zero progresses to one which progresses to n and chains poly chains to validate and also like not adjust that but also like not just chains uh but also like data availability and other services as well uh and I'm just reminded by uh the early strategy that was polygon I'm sure this was uh formally like it uh emphasized as part of the strategy with the naming of polygons the early strategy was to try all the chains try all the strategies all the combinations chains and now it looks like everything has like Ryan said and one of the themes of this uh is that the convergence of the stuff that worked to conversion the right way and then all of a sudden you have one token to validate them all uh I think you guys should have called it a hyper sound money right that's just me um one thing I will say is the upgraded I don't want to be actually we don't see that except Bitcoin and ethereum I don't think all the other tokens should have to do anything related to money like money okay I agree yeah that's interesting I okay so a few things maybe to draw out of this too so just so listeners get this in their mind um yeah Sandeep mentioned uh Paul token Pol token okay so the Matic token becomes the Paul token is that correct we're not talking about two tokens at the same time Matic becomes Paul it's it's kind of a re uh Rebrand if you will basically upgrade of the token yeah and it's a one there is a new token because their token itself does need to evolve and become imbued with new features correct yes but it's a one-to-one so if you have one Matic token you get one uh pull token is is that correct yes yes but for all practical kind of purposes it's a it's an upgrade of a token it's just that you you have to due to the nature of metic erc20 contract which is not upgradable you technically have to deploy a new erc20 contract which is a poor but there has to be the proposal is a part of the provider proposal for the new polygon architecture right it's a it's literally integral part and it ties together and secures uh the whole uh um architecture that we're proposing and it's uh a subject has to be accepted by the community and if it is to be accepted by the community metic will for practical purposes cease to exist it still have no role in the in the polygon ecosystem so so for practical purposes it's an upgrade David you know what this reminds me of and it's kind of interesting um I guess a few things you mentioned you know poly networks poly chains that you can you can validate with it's also um poly in terms of the functions uh it sounds like so it's not just being a validator you could be a sequencer you could be a data availability provider and it brings me back to um you know 2018 2019 when we were talking about the value of tokens in general and this is right on the back of icos right or we had this run up in all of these tokens and on the back of that we realized there was no such thing really as a utility token it was a whole bunch of futility tokens and we had these ideas that well what if we create imbue our tokens with the ability to service a network create work tokens if you will similar to maybe a taxi cab medallion in New York City where you have to have in order to be part of the taxi Network you have to have your taxi cab medallion and that's worth a certain amount of assets and if you have that Medallion then you can service the New York City Taxi Network okay well it's so interesting to me that's like a throwback it took us a while to get there but here we are this is a work token and Sandeep called this thing a return on work right so if you if you have the Matic token and later the pull token then it gives you the license to serve some function in the network to be a worker bee essentially and what do you get for that you get paid workers get paid in this type of a network and that's effectively what we've created here so sometimes I'm just struck by it's taken a few years but like the original Promises of crypto and the ideas that we've had just like take a while to play out but they eventually play out and now we have another example of a work token to service the polygon ecosystem uh it's pretty exciting absolutely and I think this is because this stems from uh from the roots of crypto roots of crypto we started all all started with BTC and BTC was a currency or money it's trying to be a money and currency and every token in 2017-18 I used to see like oh we will have this this Healthcare ecosystem and our token will be the token of payment prevents a coin it was a day you pay for your dental appointment in denta coin Bitcoin for Dentistry so that doesn't work like only there can be only one or maximum two Global currencies or monies and everything else every other token needs to have an actual you know stream of revenue for the end you know holders who are actually using that uh token to participate in the economic activity of the network and then as per their work they are rewarded with the or given the incentive uh informal transaction fees whatever service they are providing for that and that's that's very straightforward and and clean like actually senzie Mahalo I've got a I've got a bond to pick with you guys it's called polygon but you called it the Paul token why didn't you call it the poly token yeah I mean the poly first of all there was like there is an existing token called polymath or something and then yeah it's a 2017 Ico that's forgotten I got there two chairs just name it Paulie and you know we actually thought about it and then some people actually were making funnels can be polyamorous poly this yeah poly networks right it's Polly it should be Paulie so we thought about that but we we thought that you know let's keep this uh like again like high quality only three character uh we don't want to have like if you got Bitcoin you got Paul exactly something like that so yeah that was also reason but hello nothing but that's pretty much it there is I I believe that there is there is some trading volume like that so we didn't want to just uh get involved with it okay well walk us through the third pillar of this big upgrade the governance framework because I would like to submit a governance proposal to change your character yeah some decent decent support for that uh yeah so um polygon is obviously Envision then is the community own network but we with this proposal we believe this is like the polygon 2.0 we feel like polygon is maturing in in going to the next uh stage or next chapter in every aspect right with the with the architecture with the native asset of the protocol and with the way we really kind of facilitate that Community ownership which is the governance framework itself right so uh there are there are three components of governance that we kind of identified uh working together with the community on this framework and they are first of all protocol governance and that is uh the process is comparable to to ethereum Improvement proposals have this process of Pips which is currently active on the POS chain we are just expanding it to the entirety of the polygon 2.0 stack basically so uh it's a it's a framework similar to or also as I said eip's uh Bitcoin Improvement proposals uh python Improvement proposals Etc ietf so anyone is encouraged to to propose an upgrade to any of the polygon protocols there is a process of public discussion rough consensus Gathering and if there is rough consensus that the protocol is that the upgrade is useful for the protocol it's going to be included in one of the upcoming upgrades so pretty standard thing similar to what ethereum for example is already doing so that is protocol uh development the second component uh uh or aspect of governance is what we call system smart contract uh governance system smart contracts are uh smart contracts that are necessary to for the polygon protocols to operate like bridging protocols taking staking smart contracts uh bridging smart contracts validation smart contracts for ZK proofs Etc so any type of smart contracts that lives on ethereum uh and have to be governed in some ways so if you want to upgrade these contracts the difference with ethereum governance is that someone has to actually execute the the upgrade of the smart contract uh ethereum doesn't have that so to say issue because there are no system smart contracts in in in such way here we have this kind of concept of multisigs or or a group of entities or individuals that can actually execute these upgrades uh there um as most of the people know significant concerns with with these multisigs so we just want to upgrade this uh um this process and make it more Community involved make it more secure increase the standards there and that's kind of the second aspect of the of the governance uh we are on all these aspects including this one we are working quite a lot with the community and today we published a report uh uh actually l2bit worked on it and we just supported it and and uh uh um proudly kind of funded it uh on on system smart contract governance across the layer 2 ecosystem right so we want to establish kind of the standards here to work with the community to improve these standards and to increase transparency uh with this kind of delicate uh component of layer 2 governance because we need a way we will need a way to in years to come to upgrade these system smart contracts so we just want to make an effort uh to make this process as secure and Community involved as possible and the third component is this uh Community treasury governance so the poll proposal introduces what we call the the community Treasury and Community treasury is protocol funded so self-sustainable basically support vehicle if you if you will for for the polygon ecosystem so uh we propose this one percent uh yearly emission of of the poll token that will go directly to that Treasury and the treasury's community controlled Community governed Envy just with this uh uh governance framework a proposal we propose how the the community treasury should be governed how are we thinking about these governance and we're also very excited about that because it further increases the decentralization of the project uh uh gives more kind of uh um more power to the community and introduce this kind of a Perpetual uh support vehicle uh for for the polygon ecosystem as we know both web free and and polygon are in this early kind of phase of uh intense development and early adoption and in years to come the ecosystem will definitely require ongoing support and we believe this is the uh probably the optimal way to to provide that support so these are three components of of the governances as you can I guess see it's a pretty comprehensive framework uh we have worked with the community quite a lot on it and uh yeah we are very happy to to uh to see initial very nice very good reactions to it we've just published it basically here at HCC the day before yesterday so this is of course polygon's biggest upgrade ever and it comes with the actual upgrade of the token itself and I think the the upgrading of the token along with all the details that we've gone through on this podcast with the the unlocking of the token to be more intimately a part of this network complete with governance abilities It Feels Like The Logical conclusion of polygon it feels like the culmination the completion of the project from the original Vision maybe there's additional steps and additional upgrades and improvements but as far as maybe to use ethereum as an example we are now post proof of stake with ethereum post eip1559 we have like Deng sharding but like really left left to do but left to include but really it feels like ethereum from its core vision is basically complete is that about where you would say polygon will be post upgrade with with the upgrade to the from the Matic to pull and upgrade from uh from the proof of sectane to the zkevm it feels like we are we're like you know done ish absolutely like I think the the polygon 2.0 Vision actually is the like we believe is the the end game uh for the for any infrastructure provider like I I was saying that you know whether polygon implements it or somebody else implements it but this looks to be an infrastructure or architecture which can actually uh you know resolve the infrastructure era of of blockchain like not only for polygon but that's actually like you know what we always believed as you rightly said David that is this culmination of polygon like we always started with this thing that eventually the end of the infrastructure era of web3 would be where you have a network which is you know infinitely scalable and it's composable across the network right and uh that way it definitely feels like uh you know a kind of the ultimate uh consolidated architecture not only for polygon 2.0 I am obviously biased but I feel for the whole of web3 like you know this kind of architecture this kind of architecture will eventually uh you know feels like end up becoming the end game of the infrastructure around and it's so it's like I I always keep saying that you know in these crypto conferences and all that like we will not succeed till the time like on the stage it's people like me and Michael who are still building infrastructure and all that and all the other protocols like you know are building infrastructure they are on stage or they are the front faces of this of this ecosystem right whereas actually it should be the apps which are actually building useful applications for the users they should be the heroes of this and this will only happen when this infrastructure Wars an infrastructure era is at least this stage one of this infrastructure era is over and you know we have a decent enough infrastructure which can you know scale web 3 200 million users or even like billion users and this definitely from our side like me hello as you guys know he's been very active in the ethereum ecosystem and he has actually evaluated the uh like multi-sharded approach of ethereum versus like you know all the other kind of multi-chain approaches and uh you know scaling approaches and I think mihilo also I I you know that they felt confident like you know when mihalo also said that to me also without any bias even if I remove like this feels like something which doesn't look to have like any kind of there's no dream in the polygon DuPont window like there is it's not like this will happen and that will happen and this kind of sequencer will come it's not like it's basically pure engineering part from here there's no research angle involved in this now it's all engineering optimization of these things and uh you know productionization of these things and then we have that system ready so that's there and then second part like which is also very close to both of our hearts is that we always told ethereum community that you know all the not only polygon POS whatever this decentralized uh these infinitely scaling uh you know block space that we will build they all will be secured by ethereum and if this was whole a process of last two years to reach that place where we have the the viable technology which can actually prove and secure it on ethereum which we never believed in like you know it's going to be optimistic uh you know approach it has to be ZK approach and you see already few optimistic projects already talking about the ZK proofs and all that because it is the the end game and you know I think for us like for me also personally also and for me hello also that's a like a very great it's going to be a great satisfaction that we delivered on that promise that you know this whole we are not ethereum aligned for the for the sake of saying because polygon PS is not secured by by ethereum we are actually we what we committed we are going to deliver and with polygon 2.0 also what we what we have committed we are going to deliver that there is absolutely no doubts about that like the way we have shown it before we will keep doing it in the coming days yeah definitely I I would agree polygon 2.0 seems to be kind of kind of the end game vote for a polygonian for the for the um uh infrastructure of every infrastructure overall obviously we're biased but but um yeah I I don't know if you have time to maybe run through but I have been always very very interested in multi-chain systems in cross-chain communication in obviously layer twos and scaling infrastructure and there have if you really want to uh design uh um this mainstream uh uh uh capable so to say web free infrastructure you have this free comp you have to have basically these three components strongest possible security which is this theory of security unlimited practical scalability and seamless interoperability there has not been a solution that or architecture that provides all free and we have we cannot identify any major concern with regards to these three properties uh in the architecture that we're proposing and that's something that I really needed basically as a as as I really needed such an architecture so I can stand behind it um Sandeep and I have had Sandeep he's very focused on shipping and and is pushing for for acceleration of development Cycles which I completely understand and it's super important but I have always been the one who kind of who who has been prolonging this Divergence process right an experimentation process I just really needed that confidence that okay I can stand behind this we I'm very confident that we should as a community push towards this North Star and we are at this point now and I'm personally very very happy and very confident uh uh that this is the the right approach and after that they are I don't see practically any major upgrades kind of being required I think as Sandeep said in in years to come we will in ideal case just become that boring infrastructure player that is available scalable and everyone's using Independence I think one of the most impressive things about the story of polygon is it seems the vision was articulated so early and I it was articulated I think before you guys even knew how you were going to get there it was like the destination was known but the path there wasn't totally clear yet and you guys just started throwing stuff at the wall to see what it worked and fast forward three four years later and now we're now we're finally here and so I know polygon has gotten its fair share of flack as as we all do in the crypto space over the years and yet you guys have committed to the vision that you set forth you're for yourselves very very early and now we are finally here and I'm sure that is uh that is uh just you know a huge weight off of your shoulders because we're here and also just I'm sure you guys are quite proud of the work that you guys have laid down so congrats thank you so much to be fair this song has to be built now but at least like there's uh I believe out two point architecture I would say at least 40 percent is full-blown built and in production maybe additional 30 is being built and will be basically the staking layer it's pretty much built uh interoperability layer is at least halfway built because radiator is already on the way I would say actually I would say it's actually 70 80 it's the productionization that we are doing more but yeah this cross chain also we were just talking about it that is already there in production in the form of lxly bridge but it just needs to be speeded up with this aggregator layer so that that's the part and that is also rebuilt we have to decentralize it's actually 70 80 prepared to say at least yeah let's say we are speculating a little bit but let's say at least 60 percent is built in production I think that's fair to say because execution layer is fully commoditized basically already yeah and yeah but there is still we need to tie everything together and and deploy everything in production but it's indeed huge weight of of my shoulder personally because I have full confidence in this in this approach yeah every time we seem to hit a Finish Line here in crypto it actually appears to just be another starting line but this is this is the journey right this is what we signed up for this is why this is so much fun I want to ask you guys about how polygon fits into the the layer 2 meta that we know today so of course we have the op stack for optimism is their scaling strategy for producing many many chains the ZK sync team has the ZK stack which is of the same vein arbitrum now has orbits what's what's the polygon chain what's the what are they poly chains what what can we call these things yeah so we actually have that supernet program already likely but that supernets originally till the time ZK proofs are not there this these were all like you know side chains and there are already like quite a large number of people who have developed that now we have the ZK proofs and like you know they all will be upgraded into the ZK too so we just we're just calling them just for a different uh differentiation as ZK supernets but we still have to package that but I think already ready by the number of chains if you see I think it will already be it would already be uh you know I think probably the number one or equal number one or number two with the number of people that are already building on them uh and it's just that we have not like combined and branded that as yet like you know we are approaching that in in next maybe couple of weeks we will announce that uh but like on the sidelines already people like samoji projects like idex recently announced the ZK uh supernet and uh nurses pay has announced a GK supernet and multiple more like avechi and this and that like they're immutable already has one correct oh yeah immutable is like you know the biggest one and I think you know if you know gaming web3 gaming like immutable and polygon together uh you know are like 85 to 90 of the whole like uh you know high quality double a triple a gaming market and uh you know immutable also completely moving from Star Square to uh this architecture um and yeah like you know there are like just too many in that sense and we are just we just have to combine and Market that like you know we have not marketed that yet because this whole uh stack and deployment and everything uh you know was separated out in the last uh four or five weeks only but people could use RZ KVM code to launch their own chains already for quite some time yes the Supreme program itself has more demand how it basically projects either in some phase of building or already deployed or whatnot and now they just need to kind of uh align with this 2.0 Vision that that we haven't that's like for the better of each of these supernets so we're very excited and we believe we'll see more and more of these dedicated so so to say chains equivalent to what we have seen in Web 2.0 right in the earlier days of web2 at this kind of shared hosting which is basically ethereum or polygon POS chain where multiple applications are just deploying and using it as a shared infra was much more common as as web 2 matured dedicated uh hosting or dedicated servers become kind of the norm right because of increased number of users and then traffic and everything so we believe this is kind of equivalent to what we have seen there and as applications are maturing we are uh as an industry web free is getting more and more users we will see more and more of these kind of dedicated servers in web free terms which are basically polygon supernets and all of them will be secured by ZK uh plugged into the same source of liquidity and seamlessly interoperable and yeah that's how we do that well Sandeep and Mahalo it's been great to have you on Bank list to explain what polygon's end game is uh it looks like it's within sight here and you guys have clearly laid out the vision today and are building that Vision so thank you so much for joining us The Wider context for this is we are in the infrastructure build out season where all of our layer twos are getting massive upgrades so I hope this conversation was helpful for you to learn about what's coming down the pike a lot of ZK magic in store that is making our layer twos and our chains more decentralized it's a very exciting time to be in crypto although we're still in the infrastructure phase and I'm excited to get to the Future phases or we talk even more about the apps being built on top of these things we've got some resources for you in the show notes one is the polygon roadmap that we talked about today and some tweets about the stack about the token about polygon POS and its move to ZK but I gotta end with this as we always do none of this has been Financial advice of course crypto is risky Defy is layer twos are you could lose what you put in but we are headed west layer twos are the new frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thank you thank you foreign
