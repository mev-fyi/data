[Music] welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community ethereum is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the ethereum community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been i'm david hoffman and today we are talking with eric connor eric connor is what i have been calling the unofficial community manager of ethereum he the metaphor i like to use is that he was uh stoking the fire during the 2018-1920 bear market keeping the fire warm for all of us while we all kind of coped with having absolutely no interesting price action at all while meanwhile the innovation and development behind ethereum and what was going on in the early early stages of d5 was absolutely insane and eric was one of those people who has helped everyone i think understand that no we're not crazy everything that's happening here is insanely awesome and cool and just because the prices don't reflect that doesn't mean that it's not awesome and cool eric has gone in and out of being a prominent crypto twitter individual as soon as the the bull market came on he started to kind of take a step back and now he's kind of graduated into more or less just a posting position and i actually kind of find his journey in relationship to ethereum pretty interesting uh as we all know ethereum is very as an ecosystem it's very dominating very overwhelming and eric has gone through the whole entire stages of like you know early stage interest in ethereum deep diving all the way into it getting overwhelmed having a bull market come taking a step back and learning how to really um walk the line of of like ethereum life balance where you can actually live a life that is actually not completely defined by like being an ethereum or crypto twitter person um eric's has always been a mentor to me and learning how to navigate the space and some of the insights and just you know things that he says i always i always find are more and more true as time goes on so i hope you enjoy this conversation with eric connor but first before we get there we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your dapps all in one place arbitrarum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use d5 if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbor trump comes in arbitrary is a layer 2 to ethereum which means arbitrarium can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrary arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrom so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord hey eric how's it going hey david good how are you pretty good pretty good you are guest number two on layer zero nice so yeah i'm excited for this new format you were telling me about it sounds like a nice little change up i feel like in the podcast space like we were just talking about this before recording but stuff gets a little like not scripted but like you kind of hear the same questions and formats over and over so just kind of a freestyle is my vibe these days yeah and and freestyling is definitely something like missing in crypto because like there's so many projects to talk about and some people like explain the rationale behind their projects in really like awesome ways but to me that makes me think of like okay why is this person like so good at x a coming up with a project and then b explaining it like that that tells me there's like a little bit more behind the scenes of what's going on there yeah totally no i know there's so many like i mean cryptos in general is funny right like i feel like going beyond just the typical like interviews and talks is when you get into the more interesting conversations like doing it into the ether when i would do guest episodes the best stuff always happened after the mics got turned off and it's like every time dude it's not because people are like scared to say stuff either it's just like when you just i don't know and there's this free flow conversation with no one's looking at questions and stuff i feel like people just say it's not like they're saying stuff they wouldn't have wanted to say on mic it's just like a more natural conversation oh i mean it's definitely like a little bit of that right it's like all right now that we're suffering stopping recording i can like take the persona off and i can like like kind of speak a little bit more freely a little bit more uh like i don't i don't have to consider like lawyers or anything um yeah but then also to some degree like it's just like you bring up all the things that you forgot to talk about while you were on the actual recording right and then that's like like you said like the super interesting stuff uh i mean it's it's terrible practice and you know i would never actually do this but like i always wanted to like just leave the recording actually going like all right we're done now but i'm gonna leave it i'm gonna still record though yeah then like release like blooper clips that's like one big people would not be too happy about that i'm sure no no not not at all not at all uh so i kind of want to start this uh this conversation and then actually work backwards from it with um ether delta tell us tell us about ether delta and what it was like to trade on ether delta yeah man wow that's a huge throwback yeah i guess most people listening probably know at this point i i got into this the ethereum scene because i had was like in irc trading channels man it's funny even thinking back to like irc now we're on discord so i actually don't even know what irc is i never got that experience it's like yeah it's like the original like totally it you didn't miss much like it was kind of like um where people that anonymous wanted to go and kind of hide and like it wasn't being tracked and stuff but just total shitty just like text channels right and but that's where like a lot of bitcoin traders hung out in their early days and i had some friends that got owned in the gox hack and that led us to say okay what are we doing here we've got this technology potential why are we trading these decentralized assets why are we hiding in irc channels and all this stuff when we're just trading on centralized exchanges and that sent me down like around that exact time um was when vitalik pitched theorem at bitcoin miami and everything just kind of clicked so long story short we we three of us a couple friends i got owned by gox and myself who didn't get owned by gox luckily um set out to build ether x which was a way too early attempt at building a decentralized exchange but funny enough that ended up one of the people he wasn't like a direct team member at the time but he was in like our um slack channel he went on to build ether delta um and man like that feels like a totally different universe at this point right like you had to literally go like people are so spoiled now by amms right but you go on you just trade and matching happens and even like if you're using like matcha or one inch like all this stuff just happens easily and you get match on ether delta you literally have to go like click the specific order to get matched um and it was so shady right there there was no market buys right like you couldn't just market buy you had to actually select an order out of and you could if you were not paying attention you could in theory like select a a less optimal order than what was best offered and sometimes you would actually have to if your trade was larger than like the actual best offer but your trade was so large like it just wouldn't matter and you didn't want to go through all the steps you'd actually have to take it go down the list yeah yeah no it was it was brutal and it's funny because like anybody could list a token which you know that created chaos too and you could plug in like addresses but like if you think back right like it's funny how sophisticated that actually was it was just like the user experience was horrible we hadn't quite figured out the user experience but like in a way that's kind of how like uni swap you just plug in an address and it pulls up the token right it's just it was done differently there was too much information on screen so like you knew you knew something was there um but you weren't sure like how long it was going to take to become mainstream and i would say it happened a lot faster than i actually thought it would i i've kind of always back then probably would have said ah 10 years down the road mainstream might be using dexes and then all of a sudden you know what two years later people uni swap came along and stuff like that it's crazy how fast it actually moved that's definitely been like the pattern that i've noticed is like all right we have this ether delta thing like it's a great proof of concept it's obviously broken and then you don't see any progress for a really long time and you get a little bit disillusioned you get a little bit frustrated you're like all right what is this thing that we are actually doing here and then all of a sudden boom there's unit swap and then like just a few short months later we've solved all those problems like all at once like it's like there's nothing happens you get frustrated and then boom the solution happens and then it's just like an uh a step order function and like the way this stuff works it's crazy and i guess it's because of all the geniuses in this space i think i mean my investment thesis for ethan's always been like the smartest people i know are essentially all in essence like the smartest people i've run across my life i mean obviously there's some outside the space but like in general the mo the more amount of smart people i know are in the ethereum space and like that's always been my investment thesis and i think that's why things happen faster and also like we've totally cut out like the corporate bureaucracy crap too and like even coming down to like creating products right like i have a background in product management before that it was financed and like things just take longer to build in the traditional space you have like managers and you've got these like silos and you're going through like these old outdated processes right and i feel like now people are like let's just get a small team together and build this and we'll figure out funding later and a lot of that has to do i think with these teams know they can launch a token or easily raise money later right and i think that allows people to fearlessly build things um and that's kind of i believe why things seem to move so fast in this space yeah that is a good point that i don't think i've thought of before one of the magic things about tokens is like they're easy to issue their permission list to issue so they're always a tool for every single team but like people can like quote unquote like go public and get liquidity way faster in the ethereum world than they ever could in in the traditional world right so you'd have to go like seed round after seed round after seed round just to stay alive uh and like now we're seeing like things and projects develop with just like one or two seed rounds and then token and then like they at that point they have all the money that they could ever ask for that they would ever need yeah totally it's interesting right and like you're putting that risk more on just random speculators which back in like the i guess in the 17 ico days that wasn't ideal because people there were a lot of promises made and like the icos happened and teams disappeared but now like you just said we kind of are getting the product first at least like i don't i can't remember a team in the last like two years that launched a token really before products like maybe a few scammy ones but nothing like legit right and i think that's been the big shift i mean tying this all the way back like ether delta right that was the first time we're like oh man these tokens like tokens have been talked about in the white paper and theorized on reddit and all this but that was the first time we were like wow i can get like instant liquidity for anything i create and that that was a huge breakthrough that ethereum created and i think got lost in a lot of the 17 ico fund was it wasn't like about scammy icos it was about anybody in the world being able to fundraise at a click of a button like and that's that's insanely powerful um and now at least we're seeing products be built before you launch like a governance token and that gives speculators a little more neat to work with right and i think it's less risky yeah they're taking on risks that the team disappeared or the token doesn't do well but that's a way better model that we're at now than back in the ether delta days there's probably like a connection between the how powerful the concept of early liquidity and token liquidity that we were just talking about and the magnitude of like the ico craze like early liquidity is such a powerful concept that it accidentally created the ico mania because like we got just like over our ski tips like way too soon uh and so like there's a connection there like the ico mania was so incredibly massive because this tool of early liquidity is so incredibly powerful yeah no absolutely and it's like we saw people just totally fomo into that and it's funny the other the flip side of that is not only could anybody raise liquidity anybody could get into early startups right and that's something that i think people under appreciate as well and like i think regulators are most scared of that i would say um i think when the sec claims they're trying to protect investors really they want to have a say on like who they want the gates of entry right control of who can get into these things and traditionally it's just been accredited investors which are people that are already well off and wealthy that can get into seed rounds and series a and early equity investments right and that this is a huge paradigm shift so i think on one side you saw these teams say oh wow we can raise money instantly let's do it and on the flip side it was like a perfect boiling point right on the other side it's like oh wow for the first time ever i could try to be an early investor in a project and those two concepts are not going anywhere and i think oddly enough we're kind of self-regulating pretty well as an ethereum community um i think it pretty quickly on twitter like if something seems scammy like it's called out um you know some people are gonna get burnt of course like we we're gonna go through booms and busts but um i think we're doing a pretty good job as a community and realizing you know these models i think we're at a good point now where it's like at least like we were just saying you have a product and then you do it but it'll be interesting to see like is the sccr regulator is gonna try to really crack down on this like anthony and i were just talking last week i mean poloniex got fined but it was only like 10 million dollars and it's like how big is the sec's bite really right like polonia fx has made way more money than that and that was their fine we saw that with eos too so i think that's going to be an interesting narrative to watch going forward totally uh here's something i want to get your perspective on and this is something that ryan and i talk about unlike the weekly roll ups all the time where we talk about like the sec regulators preventing like imx and like uh the other like token airdrops from going to u.s citizens and like it's all under the guise of like yeah we're protecting investors but like in this format they're definitely not because all they're doing is protecting investors from air drops and like the one of the cool things we've unlocked with early liquidity is you know putting like like potential 1000 x opportunities into the hands of individuals so like there's two rationales that i could come out of this one is that like the uh tax reporting requirements gets a lot hairier when like it moves from just like you know small funds and and accredited investors and there's only like a handful of those that invest right like for an if the first like seed round or angel round like it's just like maybe 50 different entities right but then when we do it like an ico that moves into like 5 000 plus individuals and so from like a tax collecting and reporting perspective it's just like two multiple orders of magnitude more hairy to make sure that all the citizenry is reporting the taxes that they are obligated to report so there's one perspective the other perspective is that all this regulation is just like done by incumbents to gatekeep so that they can have all the exposure for themselves and so like you know if only 50 entities are getting into an early you know investment opportunity it's more likely that you know they are the incumbents are one of them and they can keep all the the you know the small fries from having these massive upside opportunities from early stage startups and so that's the other perspective i'm sure it's a little bit of both true but like which do you think is more true yeah i agree that it's a little bit of both i think there's so i if i had to pick one i would agree most with the first because i do think government irs are definitely feeling overwhelmed with tax reporting and how to even handle this right like i i don't even know like honestly if someone tried to look at my transactions from 2020 i can barely figure them out enough to report right individuals can't figure it out how is how is the irs going to do it for everyone right exactly and like the reporting rules are still not quite there i think we're years away from those being really clear so i do think it's it's that right right now like you said a lot of wealth is concentrated in a few entities a few people and it's easy to audit them and look at those returns right and that's where a lot of the money is being made so that's where a lot of the taxes are coming from now that wealth is spreading out more i believe crypto is really kind of spreading wealth out to a newer younger generation and amongst more people um yeah if they can't track that they're going to be worried because they're potentially losing out more if people aren't reporting them correctly right um i also think there's a perspective too where in general like within regulators and within the government there's a power game as well and i think some of these some of these entities need to stay relevant and they're like crypto's the thing coming down the pipeline right and they're all trying to become the agency that regulates crypto right because that gets some more funding more bodies more power um but yeah i don't know how i mean they have to be scared right not scared because it's scared because it's overwhelming to them it's new and some of this stuff is just really really hard to trace there's there's software out there but like you know lp positions and how that's treated and all this stuff um i mean i think if ever they're 20 years away from being able to properly understand this so they're trying to figure it out to some degree that's like the think of the people behind behind the the with their responsibility of like figuring out all this stuff like i said we can't figure it out it's gonna have to be some sort of like automated thing like something like chain analysis or some like government like automation of just because we can read the blockchain like it's going to have to be like an input input your addresses receive a number type of thing and like maybe you can make arguments about like how the calculations were done wrong but like there's so much like and plus like people i play with my ledger all the time it's like oh i like sometimes i'll wake up and i'll make 50 transactions in a day for some reason now i don't know why um and like all of a sudden there's 50 transactions that i have to like log and report and like again for the indiv if the individuals are overwhelmed there's no way that like the the irs isn't going to get overwhelmed so it's and and it's also the perfect substrate to automate right it's literally a blockchain with all the transactions it has to be an automated thing yeah i agree i think that's the way forward and i think really what it's exposing is how ancient and outdated the tax laws are in general right so i think what we might see is agencies just being too overwhelmed and that leading to simplification of tax laws so what might that look like i know some countries have basically just like a fiat and fiat out policy where it's like just net gain or loss on your fiat yes it's just freaking that simple it's just like that well the problem is that then that incentivizes never actually going back out to fiat which is like definitely something that i preach yeah yeah exactly yeah that's the banquo's motto right but like something like this right to get things more a flat text for example and not all these different taxes but like ethereum defy has become too complicated for the tax laws like how you handle amms some you know like i report them one way i know some people report it a different way other countries treat it like they need to just come up to the times i think i hope this is going to result in simplification like i don't mind paying my taxes but the the huge of it is trying to figure this all out yeah i do make 7 000 transactions and all that i do mind spending like 40 hours a month of my life like trying to actually do it right exactly you you talked about how like these different agencies are trying to like all jostle for position to try and like be the agency that regulates uh regulates crypto and this is something that like well while generally most all big all bitcoin maxies and most bitcoiners are pretty naive sometimes the stories that they tell and the narratives that they weave are like super accurate uh and maybe maybe this bitcoin don't have a monopoly on this narrative but like the state is an organization and like all organizations everywhere have a incentive to grow larger right and so like there's like the cftc sec the treasury they all have their incentives to grow their funding and grow their influence and power just because they're by the nature of a very organization right and so like no ma and so this is always why bitcoiners are so like anti-state is because they all like see the logical conclusion that like some sort of like three or four letter agency out of the government is going to want to capture our industry uh and so what what are your thoughts on that like how do you think about it yeah i mean i agree i definitely agree with any organization's going to try to get bigger and over time because get more barnacles and become less efficient right and i think like you see that in this infrastructure bill right like it's supposed to be an infrastructure bill but then there's all these amendments and tack-ons and the crypto laws are in there and like to me it's just become inefficient i would say and i i definitely am worried i don't know whether what the fix is going to be i personally like for if i had to vote on something i'd probably say like term limits just to kind of keep career politicians out of this um you know i agree but i don't okay so everyone was freaking out over the infrastructure bill stuff and like kind of rightfully so we need to fight for ourselves we need to lobby but i think what people don't realize is that this crypto generation is growing up and getting larger and a lot of people from this crypto generation are either going to become politicians or have power to vote in politicians right and i think what we're seeing now is a lot of you know politicians may be going out near the end of their terms life whatever it might be i mean some of these politicians like 100 years old in congress um i think they're going to just eventually be replaced with crypto friendly people um i know it's hard to imagine now because people think that yeah the state's against crypto and all that stuff but if you kind of grow up in this it takes a while for a paradigm shift to happen right um that's why i'm not too worried about long-term you know regulation of this stuff but at the end of the day right it if we can be regulated if if defy can be shut down then we're doing something wrong right there's some centralized point of failure and that's kind of been my point on the infrastructure bill like guys okay yes it would suck to get some regulation put in against us some tax reporting requirements but if you can stop d5 we're doing something wrong we're here to make sure that this stuff doesn't matter right right yeah all they're doing is they're just putting more and more onus upon the individual but they're not putting more and more more onus on unit swap and that's like that's the important thing right like so long as uni swap and so long as long as the actual code is untouched then fine like we'll take we'll concede whatever as long as it's you know reasonable yeah totally i mean i think we have done ourselves a little bit of a disservice with um heavy reliance on centralized stable coins usdt usdc i do think there's a point of attack there for governments that we need to be careful with i mean most all d5 protocols are very heavily reliant on this liquidity from centralized coins i think that's where they would try to go after first if they could um but you know now coinbase is a public company they they have a bunch of lobbyists themselves so um yeah i mean this is a long battle but i i do wish we would kind of reduce our reliance on that if anything right yeah uh i do hope and i'm sure amin would agree with me is like rye is actually the way that we stop giving so much power over to usdc right um you said that you have a background in in finance and so i actually want to want to pick your brain on that so i my uh oh my old roommate and a bunch of my friends from college they were in like the business school part of the college uh part of the university and i kind of like tease them and joke with them about like one of the reasons that i've done so well in crypto is that instead of majoring in business i majored in psychology so i didn't actually have to unlearn anything in order to learn crypto but you actually majored in in finance or have a background in finance so what was it like coming into crypto with a finance background do you think that was all like relevant or like what was that story like um i would say yeah it's interesting it's funny i've always been kind of fascinated with finance i was like my dad set me up with an e-trade account when i was 10 years old and like dial up internet and gave me a little bit of money in there and i was picking out some stocks that i liked tonight so i've always been into trading and kind of my own personal financial stuff which led me to a finance degree but you know the finance degree was more of a play and i've always been a numbers guy and into trading but more just like it was going to be safety coming out of college into a job but then the financial crisis happened and i graduated in 09 and that wasn't really the case but everything worked out yeah i would say oh no i know that finally jesus christ i got lucky enough to find a good internship and then a job right after somehow but yeah it wasn't the best timing in the world you know i would say like what helped me most was more that background i had in like trading and finance i don't think my finance degree specifically has been too applicable um in crypto but what it has helped me with is like realizing how outdated the traditional finance world is right i worked at a bank for five years and like it was great experience met great people but man just like the processes in place and the technology what's funny is i discovered crypto while sitting at my desk working in a bank bank yeah i ran across an article about bitcoin in early 2013 as i was like bored at work scrolling through something i think it was on reddit um and what a hilarious just like snapshot of his of i'm just like oh yeah bored at work at a bank discovered bitcoin because he was bored exactly and then it you know it fascinated me i sent it to my girlfriend at the time now my wife i sent it to her and i'm like oh yeah we should probably like kind of look into this thing led me to buying some what's really funny wait so you bought bitcoin and and saw that thought that bitcoin was cool on your first exposure to it yeah well i would never hear that i would i didn't buy it that day sure but a few days after i did a little research and created a coinbase account and then most people like they get exposed to bitcoin and then they're like man this is and then the price runs up and they're like oh i miss out on that and then that's when they get in you know what's funny about me is like i i get very upset if i miss out on something that i after the fact find to be really awesome and so i was already mad that it had gone from a dollar to like 200 at the time so i'm like i already missed this but i'm going to buy some anyways so like you know i felt like some of that was some nfts these days too but um yeah anyways then i i found it and then i just kind of went down the reddit rabbit hole irc rabbit hole um and then what what's really funny about the story to kind of tie it all back to my finance degree is like i worked in the treasury department and our treasurer at the time had this little like box in the kitchen you could put questions in so i i wrote a question mainly i've been a troll i guess my whole life but i put a question in there what and i said what do you think of bitcoin like it's been on this big run lately and this is the treasure of like a large regional bank right and he responded to it and he actually had a good response and like it kind of he would respond over email to the whole group and like he he was like you know the typical it's probably in a blah blah blah blah but he had some good thoughts on it and it kind of like sent this like bitcoin like exploration across the whole floor of the treasury department of this bank you know i don't know if many people actually bought into it but um i gave i would say at least 30 people exposure to bitcoin at about 200 so hopefully some of them bought it wow that's hilarious asking uh who who is like that was the ceo of the company or who was who the question is about the treasurer yeah the treasurer so asking some like leader of a financial organization their opinions on bitcoin after it just ran up in price you can repeat that story like every four years of yesterday today that's what's funny yeah i mean you know some people you know i haven't worked there for a while i still have some friends from there but you know some people think back oh man remember when that guy was talking about bitcoin in 13 i really wish i bought it i really wish i said who was that guy you gotta look him up right yeah it's funny right like early on i mean i know you were in ether early too and like just all these technologies early like no one believes you really like i never really talked about it early on because i didn't want to be the guy giving out like financial advice when something could go to zero but like i had friends and family i would mention around no one gave it a thought and like during bear markets no one talks to you and then the second price starts going up and it's way past where it was one day everyone starts talking about it right now first you're the crazy crypto person and then and then you're the poor crazy crypto person and then you're like the rich crazy crypto person but but people love you when you're at the third point exactly and you know what's funny is it's happened like three times in the ethereum now with eth and then defy tokens and now nfts they've all kind of gone through the same like wait now you're crazy on e no you're crazy d5 is never gonna happen now nfts why would i buy a jpeg and like all three have gone through the same cycle right yeah now if people people like assets and people like digital assets for some reason yeah i uh during uh during 2018 and 19 when i was first getting into into crypto my mom's friends would always like in a very concerned fashion ask me ask my mom like how i was doing uh and and like to this day and then like crypto prices starting started to go up and they would still ask her and it's very concerned is he still doing like that weird bitcoin thing like i was here is he interesting and like he would tell himself oh no he's like he's actually doing pretty well like his podcast is like going all right like he's actually doing making a name for himself in the industry and then they still like don't get it like no no he should get out of that like that's gonna that's gonna knock me out gonna work out it's funny right like even to this day where you know crypto twitter's giant listening and followers of podcasts and youtube channels whatever and like you know multi billions of dollars in market caps out there it's funny how a lot of people in the mainstream still think it's like a fad or there's only like five people into it it really has been i've talked a lot in the past if i'm not sure if these two worlds are going to collide or just run parallel forever right um i mean they truly are just running parallel now i feel like i live in an alternate reality and i don't know like when i go back to the traditional world and like people that don't know about crypto and stuff honestly i feel like kind of so disconnected from them because this is such a different life right not going to make it you're we earlier we were talking about just like how we're going to get like good regulation and just good relationships with the nation state and like to some degree like as soon as like there's this phrase like science moves on one grave at a time like honestly once the boomers all die like it's gonna things are just gonna get a lot easier like no offense to the boomers like both my parents are boomers but like that's kind of what we need for this like digital world this digital financial system to either get more integrated into the into the rest of the world or just have started absorbing all the people and we can finally like leave that behind yeah totally i mean and that's kind of what i'm saying earlier too right with like eventually crypto native people will become the people making the laws right i think you know i'm even like a boomer i guess when it comes to crypto right there's there's a huge younger generation of anywhere from i'm sure all the way down to like 15 years old now up to you know 25 that's coming up too um so it's going to take some time but yeah like your quote about science i mean this is just kind of how humanity works in general right a new idea a new movement comes along and people are skeptical of it at first i mean look at the internet right you can pull up tons of articles about the internet where people are laughing at it making fun of it and like why would we ever use the internet the famous today show clip right all this stuff um and then stuff just takes over now what's interesting with crypto is like you're challenging a lot of you know institutions the state moneyness and that's going to take longer than the internet to take things over right because those are bigger concepts they're bigger institutions to kind of have to uproot um but eventually i mean it's inevitable at this point i don't even i don't even think like two years ago i would have said that it's inevitable i still thought there was a path where ethereum didn't win but there's i mean it's there's no doubt in my mind at this point like at a minimum it might not just like totally usurp the current system but at the this parallel world which is its own financial system its own creator economy all this stuff that that's not being stopped at this point yeah at the very least it maybe maybe it doesn't make like the the past system completely irrelevant but it gives the option for people to make it irrelevant for them as as individuals right like if you want to just forget about the legacy world you can uh i mean there's still some problems that we need to figure out like i still need to figure out how to pay my rent without using my wells fargo account maybe that never happens um but maybe that's just what like wells fargo has succumbed to it's like what what is your purpose like you pay my rent right yeah speaking of like wells fargo man going into like a branch i had to go on the branch the other day and send a wire i i can't believe like it that still exists and like when you realize like not that i want people to lose their jobs but i think what people will realize is how much of this can be automated and fixed with a blockchain right like i'm going into a branch to talk to like two people to send money like and i have to fill out forms like it's just crazy right like all this stuff can be fixed with technology i mean even technology better than the bank staff that's not blockchain but i think what's eventually what will win the banks over are two things i the first is global access to liquidity right so right now you're like a bank you kind of just have your branches like if you're not a wells fargo you're probably a smaller regional bank you can only tap into like one or two states right and that that gives you a very small reach of a customer base when these larger institutions realize hey we can access money anywhere in the world at any point on defy that's going to be like wow we can make a lot more money right here we have we can access a lot more liquidity and the second is cost savings so once they can you know replace all these people they don't need because the technology is outdated exactly yep um all the paperwork stuff um you know these companies are looking to cut costs everywhere so once it becomes kind of an accepted thing in the world by regulators and whatnot those are the two things that are going to win the banks over yeah and to some degree like some of the processes that banks have are just like uh we just do them just because we do them right like the reason why you have to go into a bank is like historically is because the bank would actually know who you were right that's not like no bank knows who anyone is anymore like you just show your id and then like oh yeah the picture matches the face that is you signing a transaction like does your id match your face like oh yeah okay does the private key align with the uh with the public address like yes yes it does um and like uh there was there was one time i needed to send a wire transfer that was over over the limit and i couldn't do it for my computer so i had to go into a bank but i was in a situation i didn't have enough time to go into a bank and so i called the bank up to see if i could do it over the phone and like no the only way that we let you do this is we send you like a a pgp like encryption device and i'm like that's just a hardware wallet you're gonna send me a hardware wallet so i can make a transfer out of wells fargo like it's just like so obvious that they are like trying to incrementally like do the same things that crypto does an order of magnitude better and did that like 10 years ago yeah totally i mean i think your point about personal relationships is an interesting one i mean you used to go into a bank and they knew you like you said and like that that's nice right like these people have your money they're dealing with your money like that that's something that most people would want that's gone now for multiple reasons the you know the banks have combined merged and gotten too big for that and all this stuff but i think one interesting thing that defy has is this like connection and relationship to team members and that kind of happens through discord channels and twitter you kind of feel at any point now it's a little easier for us to say we're kind of prominent in the space and have been around a while and a little more well-known so maybe for people newer to space they don't quite feel this as much but it feels like at any point you could hop on and talk to someone from the team and that's almost like being able to hop on and talk to a bank ceo or jeff bezos with an amazon order right now how the scales long term will be interesting but i think that's one of the cooler things about d5 right now yeah and that definitely makes people feel a little bit more like trusting in this like weird code thing that's like ruling our financial lives but like oh yeah there's that and like to some degree it's not necessarily even the team it can actually just be the community that's in there too right and for some reason the communities love to answer questions and be customer support um yeah very like collaborative and social of environment totally i i want to actually go back to like the pre-ethereum era of of your crypto life when you were focused on bitcoin because there was only bitcoin to focus on like was your imagination as like grandiose as like ethereum is now or like what did you think like the future prospects of bitcoin would be at that time because there wasn't bitcoin maximism back then right no yeah that's what's interesting it didn't really exist it was still like this and when i entered in like 13 it felt more like the ethereum community does now to me um what first just kind of attracted me was okay this concept of a digital currency of digital money and like i mentioned i have like a trading background and i like just getting in on new trends and so that's actually what captured me first and why i kind of instantly went to like these irc channels right of trading but what was interesting is most people then and like these we weren't just talking about like price and trading right people were talking about these larger visions of kind of what we're talking about right now like how can bitcoin usurp the traditional finance system and talking about concepts that we're talking about on ethereum now so it's not like the traditional or the bitcoin maximalist following that we're used to at this point um and it's what's really funny is most of the people in those chats when uh vitalik pitched at uh or didn't really pitch but gave a talk about ethereum at bitcoin miami most of those people bought into eth because that's kind of the vision that they had seen right so i think when i first saw bitcoin just it was such a new concept to me i didn't really know where it would go i don't think i really had that vision until we started working on ether x which was like end of 14 i believe uh tried to launch it beginning of 15. and i mean i had such conviction in a theory like not one day like i said earlier like i had some days where i'm not sure if ethereum's gonna like be this huge like takeover thing but i've never one day thought ethereum wouldn't be like a success on its own right like this idea of code running smart contracts running i i don't know why it clicked with me so much because i before it i had never thought of it right um but the second i saw this i'm just like so bitcoin kind of like led me into the rabbit hole and got me thinking about this digital money idea what could be done with like a trustless ledger and all that stuff um you know and having worked in like a treasury department which is kind of like the heart of a bank um i kind of like saw how ledgers worked at a bank and it like you know they're so antiquated so that kind of like trapped me in um but really the second i saw that talk about ethereum i i've never looked back but i don't know what i don't know why it captured me so much to this day to be honest but i think it just clicks with me so much i'm glad it did because it's obviously paid off um but yeah that's kind of you know my bitcoin to ethereum journey see this is also always why i call like bitcoin as just a massive proof of concept like it was the conversation starter and like it got started conversations around like digital identity and trustless peer-to-peer like transactions and swaps and you know to some degree like even colored coins was like an early version of like the erc20 token uh and we're talking about how like your bitcoin address is like your your i your passport into like the digital nation state like bitcoiners were talking about like what i call like the bankless nation before ethereum was like even in existence um and uh hey i want to get your opinion on this take bitcoin maximalism wasn't really a thing in the way that it is now until like roughly around the time that vitalik coined it right like first bitcoin was bitcoin and bitcoiners were bitcoiners and they had all these fantastic ideas about a trustless nation-state-free future with no regulation and like all these all these possibilities with bitcoin and then and then this like bitcoin maximalism switch happened where like bitcoiner subconsciously realized that the only thing you can do on bitcoin is have bitcoins and like all these grandiose ideas are gonna actually happen elsewhere and a decent amount of like bitcoiners are just like in denial about that and so like they created bitcoin maximalism to like cope with that fact that's kind of how that's my interpretation of history yeah no i agree with that it was a defense mechanism i think so going back to you mentioned colored coins like that i think that's one of the most interesting things because i think that's where the pivot really happened so back in like 13 when i discovered bitcoin people were talking about colored coins they were talking about scaling um these were big topics in the space and like color coins excited people because it was like this idea of tokens and i remember people even talking about like stable coins right like getting like usdt or usd peg tokens through colored coins and all this stuff so there was this vision and when ethereum came along you know the stories of course are vitalik really wanted to build ethereum on top of bitcoin and kind of got shut down on that idea and stuff um so that kind of created the initial rift i would say yeah and then once ethereum took off i think it started taking these ideas and it was more of a defense mechanism and obviously a little bit of saltiness right like any bitcoiner could have bought into the ethereum pre-sale i mean they accepted bitcoin right um so i think once they saw those ideas going away and realizing that they weren't going to happen on bitcoin because not because at that point like now nothing's going to happen on bitcoin let's be honest because like the maximalism the minimalist approach has taken over but i think even right when ethereum launched it still had a chance but it was gonna just be more cumbersome now to do it on bitcoin there was no reason um and it became a defense mechanism because it's like okay we had these bigger ideas we wanted to do them now we're not going to do them and look i'll give them a little credit like backing into the digital gold store value narrative has paid off for bitcoin it's an easily translatable thing to the mainstream i think people buy into it that's why bitcoins at what forty nine thousand dollars today um but long term it's not the winning narrative right ethereum's narrative is much stronger but it's gonna take a little bit longer for people to understand it um you know bitcoin's not going anywhere but um they had to kind of pick this narrative right because there wasn't gonna be another one right and in my mind picking the narrative of like digital gold you're adding a futuristic word upon a an ancient word it's like hey there's this ancient thing and we're going to make it futuristic again but like the reason why ethereum's narrative is so complex is because there is no ancient corollary to ethereum it's purely it's digital layered on top of digital right like it's only sci-fi and that's why that's where so many people get confused and skeptical about what ethereum is but like when you kind of like suspend your disbelief like oh yeah no this is like the most sci-fi thing that we can ever think of right yeah i mean it's still hard to explain to people i mean i've been in the space seven years now on ethereum and if people ask me like to explain it i still struggle right like it's tough to do like because there are so many things happening in so many visions but yeah i mean the digital gold thing it's like really what bitcoin is saying at this point is we're scarce there's a scarce amount of these things you should collect them right and scarcity goes back a long time now for bitcoin what's interesting is i don't think the 21 million cap is viable so at some point we'll we'll be long gone probably but at some point the scarce narrative is going to kind of blow up a bit um and that'll be interesting to see what i find really interesting is like okay so here's here's a good prompt are crypto punks a better store of value than bitcoin long term 100 100 because they don't have to secure secure themselves right exactly and there's never like there might be more bitcoin in mind uh because they need to secure the network there'll never be more punk's minds and what's funny is like some people listening to this may be laughing oh it's ridiculous to compare crypto punks to bitcoin but really what bitcoin's entire pitch is behind the digital goal pitch is hey there's only 21 million of these you should own one right crypto punch is the exact same pitch and cryptopunx has cool art behind it and has some traits so yeah it triggers the fomo there's like a status symbol behind it like you get to say that you got in early like it's all the same things um the only difference is one's fungible and one's non-fungible uh i i don't think bitcoin will have to mint more bitcoins i don't think bitcoin will ever hard fork i think it'll just like get reorged over and over and over again until like it turns into like where something like bsv is now where like exchanges just de-list it because like they can't keep on dealing dealing with the reorgs that seems like that that's like the hands off like we're just going to send this thing off into the ether and then and this is like the inevitable outcome to it because like bitcoiners are already committed to like never ever hard forking yeah it's interesting right it's like if they don't and fees aren't high enough at that point like you said it'll be easily attackable um but yeah but even at that point we're gonna be so far down the road like with the whole deflationary ultrasound money thing like yeah is it even gonna be worth them to fork it and add it because that is their only narrative left and if they remove that what's the point right yeah i mean they they talk about the bitcoiners say like if uh something hard forks out of bitcoin then it's not bitcoin anymore right like they've they've committed to like whatever this bitcoin thing is and they will ride that thing into the sunset and crash and burn along the way in my opinion right yeah we might see it sooner than later i mean we might see it within three happenings i think um so that's another 12 years or so right yeah you said we're going to be long gone by that no i think i think it's going to be within yeah three or four happenings sounds about right um hey bankless nation i hope you're enjoying the show so far in the second half of the show we talk about uh what i've been calling ethereum brain and what happens to the person when they have just overwhelming amounts of ethereum and crypto just going around in their lives and how eric has uh has managed you know ethereum brain and what he does about it to like retain his grip on humanity we also talk about bitcoin maximalism a little bit and we're talking about about how bitcoin maximum maximalism is a coping mechanism for coming to terms with a protocol that has never upgraded and we also talk about defy tokens and our mutual desire to see tokens distribute cash flows to holders as well as the long term outlook of yield in defy we also talk about some golf we talked about some electric cars and some other grab bag subjects so i hope you're gonna enjoy the second half of the conversation before we get there though we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dals have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uni swap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless so eric you you've been when was the moment you were like quote unquote like full-time crypto as in like it consumed eight to ten hours of your life at least yeah uh let's see i would say is around well i didn't go full time working in crypto so about two years ago right after we started ethub into the ether and then i got a job at gnosis that's when i really left the traditional world behind but i would say since 15 even though i had a traditional job i was probably on the side spending way too much time on crypto right like either on my phone or when i would get home spend the entire evening in the space so what's you know what's interesting though is like i always wanted it was still speculative like even when eth did its first like run up to like a thousand or whatever you just didn't know like if it was gonna go back so i always wanted like a steady salary for the family on the side right and not just totally yolo it and two so that that was a very fun thing to finally hop over to gnosis and i'm always thankful for the opportunity they gave me because that was like okay now i'm full-time eth but i would say i've been pretty much entirely down the rabbit hole since about the time we tried to launch etherex which was like 15 or so so it's been like six years now and i at this point it's getting too hard for me to keep up i think what we're seeing is like the d we're seeing like not silos but like different ecosystems pop out within ethereum we're getting the deep ecosystem the nft ecosystem i mean keeping up with both is nearly impossible at this point i just almost can't do it right and like even when you're at like a legacy job like in your mind is still thinking about crypto like i kind of still consider that like full-time crypto if like if that's where your brain is all of the time then like that's kind of where you are and so then then you started ether because we needed to fight the bitcoiner flood thank you for doing that got a job at gnosis so you're doing the ether podcast which like in in the past had like three episodes a week sometimes at minimum uh and then you're also doing your gnosis job like how how did you deal with that like i i kind of have called gotten this thing that i'm been calling like ethereum brain as in just like oh you wake up and think about ethereum you're thinking about ethereum all day you're doing ethereum things like have you noticed ethereum brain have you gotten an ethereum brain totally yeah i got largely burnt out probably like well first of all you can see these gray hairs here and i don't know are those ethereum gray hairs i i definitely reached a point where i got burnt out and just one day it's more just like constantly looking at screens on your phone and one day i just said i gotta like drop off twitter and discord for like a few weeks right because this is yeah actually you and i have talked about this a little bit offline but the difference to me and working and loving the ethereum space for the traditional world is most people work their traditional job you know eight to five they come home they totally disconnect right maybe you have some friends from work but you're not then going home really i wasn't going home and reading about treasury departments and treasury functions right like i wasn't passionate about it the difference in ethereum like you and i and many others is we work in it we invest in it all of our friends are in it all the conferences and travel we do are in it and it just becomes it does become overwhelming and i recently have tried to start stepping back at times like i'll take breaks from twitter we scaled back the ether podcast a little bit i mean i recently had a baby girl too so that's obviously taken over life priorities but i do think it's such an interesting thing and it's a bit it's healthy it's very healthy to work in something you're very passionate about i'm very thankful for that and like not many people can say that but i do think there's an unhealthy element to not being able to disconnect and it's the 24 7 nature of things people across the world the price is always trading everything's always on um i think it'll hit us all a little bit it has me but i would just suggest stepping back taking a break go to hawaii for a couple weeks if you can do something like that and leave your phone at home yeah that i remember as soon as like towards the end of 2020 or no towards at the beginning of 2020 right after the march crash and things like really accelerated right after the march crash like it started like april april and may you kind of got the tremors of like defy defy summer and like defy summer was such a just like whiplash of you know the 2018 2019 early 2020 bear market was like it was just like people really got to know each other i got to know you i got to know anthony i got to know like dc uh and it's like it was just like a very calm peaceful environment like we're just like taking this one the one news event of like the month which is like this uniswap thing and we're all like parsing it apart together collectively on twitter like the only crypto twitter conversation was unit swap for like three weeks because we all invented this crazy new paradigm that solves all this ether delta thing and then like we get smacked by defy summer like 2020 and like a bull market and a bunch of new entrants and all of a sudden just like we were all so hungry for like crypto innovation and crypto content and crypto stuff that like we forgot to learn how to like tune things out and so then and then defy summer comes and like all of the things that we were longing for in like 2019 and 2020 all came and hit us all at once and so we're all like primed to consume literally everything and and the where like you know things could ethereum could only saturate your life like you know five to eight hours a day all of a sudden goes like well you could actually spend like all 24 hours a day like consuming ethereum stuff totally i mean it's it's funny right like i don't work a traditional nine-to-five job anymore i kind of do my own investing and startups kind of like angel investing but i s so people are like oh so you don't work and i just kind of laugh like yeah i do still like i still work like i'm managing yield farms i'm trying to find new investment opportunities i'm doing the podcast i'm trying to keep up with the news twitter discord like that's still a job but it's almost like a new paradigm job right like in this ethereum space we found so many different ways to like make money and connect with people um that like you don't feel like you're really working but you still are working right like i'm not just sitting on a lounge chair all day like taking in the sun but yeah it's long term it'll be interesting to watch like how people do get burnt out in the response to that because it's still hard to step away because you feel like you're missing something right like oh man and so i had finally gotten a point like around when my daughter was born where like my farms were on auto control like i wasn't really like moving funds around and chasing yields and like price had kind of calmed down a little bit and then all of a sudden the nfts blew up and i'm like are you kidding me now i have to spend you know more time tracking nfts and i don't want to miss out on some opportunities here and i want to feel obligated for some reason like oh and if these are a thing like now i do this this is what i do now i did i felt obligated and part of it's because like what i told you earlier like i i feel like if i missed out on something that i end up liking and i had a big price appreciation i'm just gonna hate myself so i had to dive in and like understand like all these drops and the generative art stuff and like i've been a crypto punk guy since day one i was on there claiming um when they were going out for free but that's kind of been the only nfc i didn't go down like the crypto kitties thing and i've kind of just held my punks and you know not done much with them um but i had to like reteach myself this and now it's like okay i just added more work to my job and now it's right ethereum defy and nfts right yeah and it kind of seems like there's just like always something like on the horizon right right like when you've when you've stepped back like if from the perspective of like stepping back from ethereum as like a skill like what advice do you have yeah so okay this is one of the more interesting things i've personally run into lately is you know a decent amount of us i guess we could say have made it or will make it with their investments and whether it's defy nfts or whatever and like we work in this space that we might get burnt out on but what i kind of struggle with is when i step back i've become so enamored and so into ethereum the space like i'm not really sure what to do like i always have to be working towards something right so you know i like to golf but i have hobbies outside but like i can't fully leave the ethereum space so like what i would say for it's almost like trying to quit something cold turkey right whether it's like drinking or smoking or like eating something bad um what i've realized is don't just give it all up at once right like keep your favorite discord server give up twitter and step away from everything else because honestly you kind of feel a little bit lost which is weird for me to say like it sounds strange but you all of a sudden you're like wait what am i waking up for what am i like trying to accomplish and that's like honestly why i had to go down the nft hole it's like i wanted something new to bite on like i feel like i had kind of accomplished the east side and the defy side and now like what's next um so i think that's why it keeps bringing people back too though to be honest it reminds me of the metaphor of like carrying the the i don't know what camera the ring from lord of the rings like frodo carrying the ring around his neck like yeah he carried it for too long and like now he can't get rid of it like it's not on his body anymore but like it's still burned into his soul like once once you like consume enough of aetherium like you can think of it as a drug like you actually can't like leave like it's it's got you it and it and it's and it traps you and then and and doubt like ethereum was like my i haven't talked about this too much but like before i got into ethereum um before i got into crypto uh i got broken up with with a girl that i thought i was going to marry and ethereum like filled that void for me he's like oh i like this is super entertaining i can like forget about like like just like being really bummed about life and i can i can like just think about ethereum all the time and like you know four years later i'm like okay like no you can't marry ethereum david like you you need to like step back and like and that's why i like straight up moved to san diego like i needed to like step myself out of like seattle and just where i was like raised and had to put myself into like a new environment uh and and like if you're like there's this thing called state dependent learning uh if you like i haven't like lived in san diego before so it's like trying to welcome myself like into a new life and give myself like permission to like stop having so much like ethereum brain totally yeah i know i mean i moved too which is funny like i feel like a lot of people moved and that was a way to like kind of get out and escape a little bit but i mean the whole like marrying ethereum thing is a funny metaphor if you think about it like i i also think like why some of us have such a hard time stepping away is we kind of like think of a theorem as our baby a little bit right like you mentioned starting ethub like why did we start ether well because bitcoin maximalists were spreading fun narratives and smacking each down all the time and we needed to fight for right and now ethereum's like grown up and come out of that and it has its own narratives and those things don't matter anymore but a lot of us have helped shape where ethereum is today right like even down to one five five nine right like i co-author you were have really involved in like helping people understand it like these are big things that shape the future of ethereum and it's hard to like just like no one wants to abandon their baby right so like it's hard to fully step away and i i don't think i would ever fully step away i think it's just going to be too impossible but it's kind of like like where do we go after this stage of ethereum where it grows up like what is our next role right what does that look like because there's always going to be like younger more eager people coming up that want to do i mean you're doing five podcasts a week or whatever like that's probably not gonna you're gonna get burnt out eventually right but like i feel like we're all gonna always be in the space and just kind of do different things yeah and like you said the space is splitting into like the nft cohort the d5 cohort and there's gonna be more cohorts into the future um and like keeping up with all of them is going to be absolutely insane but maybe there's just like maybe the people kind of come into ethereum at their own specific like generation so there's just going to be like generational cohorts of ethereum that all kind of like go through their own just like you know the learning journey of crypto and then like finding their place in in ethereum that's right for them yeah i mean that's one of the biggest transformations i've seen too like early ethereum it was only a space for devs right and like no one wanted to see like speculators or traders like the ethereum reddit literally doesn't allow price talk still to this day um and you felt like you didn't have a place it's crazy how much that's changed right it's a place for anybody now like you don't need a finance background you don't need a trading background you don't need a coding background um you know this was even still a problem i would say back in early 18 even there was like this pretentiousness of oh if you're not a dev you don't have a spot in the space and man how's that change fast right god that that was going through my brain like endlessly in 2017 it's like oh this crypto stuff is super cool i guess i'm just gonna watch it grow in front of my eyes for the rest of my life because i won't be able to actually like do anything because i don't know how to code yeah no it's crazy how much that's changed right absolutely how's it how's uh since you've practiced stepping back from ethereum how's your golf game gone well not great because it's not very easy to go off with a baby um i'm hoping to get out here soon it's been solid but it's not where i want it to be let's move that one yeah before i play with you i need to get a lot better so i can kick your ass oh i am not good at golf at all i'm very much one of those people where like i hate putting first off but like i know that if i stop there if i start giving giving a about golf then like i'm actually going to start and go out and practice i've never practiced golf i only play i never practice only play which is a tough sport to do that yeah what's funny is like i feel like golf's a great sport for people into ethereum like i feel like if you're looking for a hobby or something new and you haven't tried golfing and you're super into theorem try golf because just like ethereum you can never perfect it and there's always something new to learn be frustrated by get happy about like there's a lot of similarities so oh god we need an ethereum golf outing ethereum golfer golfer retreat oh god so uh how's your porsche [Laughter] it's it's nice yeah it fits golf clubs which is good is that yeah basically all you needed to i just recently got a pole star which is not a porsche but it's definitely a an electric car that goes really really fast and like i keep having to remind myself that like okay just because you have a really fast electric car doesn't mean you get to go like 100 miles an hour down that like the san diego highway it's dangerous the fast electric cars man you're going like a hundred and you don't realize it it's crazy i've only owned one electric car i'm never going back i don't think like it's just it's too great the experience is awesome just be able to plug it in like i know where the environmental impact right now is we have the production and all that so it's a bit minimal but i do feel better about myself driving it around that's for sure yeah no like sometimes like uh there's been times where i have friends all the way up in la and like a little bit maybe in like south anaheim or orange or something and just like if i ever want to go out there like i actually don't have like the weight of like consuming gas to go do that it's like oh yeah this is a lot more casual now i don't have to fill up my gas tank with gasoline like i'll just plug it in later yeah yeah i feel like we're finally seeing the electric car revolution happen i feel like a lot like we're getting nice looking electric cars now which i never knew like before why they made them look so horrible um but i think we're fine the porsche take hand is like one of the best looking cars i think that's out there nice car they finally realized like let's not make this look like electric car let's just make it look like a porsche like i don't know why these car companies didn't do that did i uh i test drove that car uh a few a few months ago and you told me to do the like the stomp on the brake and then hit the gas and do the launch oh my god man like that it just puts your stomach into like a different dimension it feels like you know those roller coasters that launch you like zero to 60 or whatever it feels exactly like that right yeah and there was and i was being an absolute idiot on the test drive definitely going over 100 and uh coming coming up behind a guy and a guy like turned on like didn't turn on his blinkers and came into my lane so i had to swerve and they handle it i swerved at like 100 plus miles an hour and the handling on that thing just like it cradled it it cradled the swerve and just put me exactly where i needed to go i feel like if i did that on any like normal car i would have just like spun out and died right exactly yeah if you haven't drove the porsche side can go test drive it porsche's gonna see a spike of a bunch of test drives next week now that we're talking about this [Laughter] no i i absolutely recommend it um yeah no it's it's it's been fun uh have you seen what a pulsar looks like uh i looked it up the other day yeah it's nice yeah so what's the deal are they like in product they're easy to get in production yeah yeah yeah so like i was going back and forth between a pull star and a tesla it's like the more affordable versions of an electric car i didn't i i i couldn't get myself to dish out the cost of a cost of it take hand just like one jpeg man depending on the jpeg um but uh tesla is you can't get a tesla like they're all you can't get one until 2022. uh and also polstar is a derivative off of volvo like they used to pulsar used to be um uh uh volvo's like skunk works like they're like performance uh division and then they just spun out made the pulse r1 which is like the supreme luxury uh car for like 150 000 it's a hybrid uh gasoline electric car and then they made the pulse r2 which is like the affordable affordable version uh but like since it's like for some reason volvo's have always been in my family um my dad and his dad had matching uh 1972 volvos uh which which he still has uh and then my first car out of college was a volvo so then i decided like oh pulsar close enough sometimes isn't it right yeah exactly that's funny so eric since as a uh host of a podcast uh usually sometimes hosts don't get to say everything that they get to say because they're always talking to guests is there any subject matter that you've never been able to talk about that you've always wanted to curious like to have the floor on that's an interesting one what haven't i been fully honest about um you know i've talked about this a little bit i guess this is still ethereum related of course but i've been a little bit disappointed in the governance tokens and like where we haven't evolved like at all so when governance tokens came out the pitch was hey you can have a you know if you own this you'll probably own a portion of our protocol fee going forward right and like when i've had guests on i've brought this up a little bit but i'm not like the the response from most d5 founders is oh that's in the token holders hands right like i love robert lesner but like if you listen to my episode with him like the entire time oh comp token holders oh which makes sense right now for legal reasons and all this um but i'm a little disappointed in the advancement of that like i think sushi is kind of one of the only protocols that's doing any revenue take to token holders and i really wish that we would come further than just pure speculation for the value on these things so i think decentralized government vitalik put out a good piece about token voting the other day i think we're kind of just like shooting some of these problems under the rug we saw like a weird uni swap vote happened the other day where some team tried to get like 25 million it took like the last second for like a twitter outrage to happen for it to get shut down um did that actually end up because when i last i looked at it it actually uh had more yes votes and no votes after it got flipped with more no votes after people like realized what was going on did that have attracted today i haven't tracked it today so that could be the case there were all kinds of weird things like the ui was broken like no votes were going to yes votes and stuff it was a mess but i'm a little disappointed in the progress of governance tokens now i will say most of this stuff and fixing and innovation happens in bear markets i think people are just distracted right now um but man we're missing like such a good long-term value value narrative for d5 tokens if they're actually paying a part of the protocol revenue to token holders right that kind of gives a nice little like feedback loop so if i had to pick a topic where i think people people in the ecosystem are kind of like ignoring or not paying enough attention to i think it would be that uh so yeah that vote did end with the grants uh grant getting approved oh it did yeah was that today earlier today yeah interesting so that's kind of interesting the i i have said that like it would be nice to not just emulate like the uh greater fool's valuation of like the traditional stock market is like oh we got the uni token get the comp token and like oh governance like buy the token but actually like morph that into actual like analysis analysis of on-chain cash flows yeah but one thing in in like there are certain paradigms that ethereum completely breaks and and renews and there are certain other paradigms that like it absolutely doesn't right and like well if you start to spend cash flows then like you actually like that you can't spend them on like development and and you know uh innovation into the protocol right so like maybe it is actually like too soon there there i do think there is room for that to be like a paradigm that ethereum doesn't actually fix yeah like where this goes like how it relates traditional evaluation is still to be known and there's gonna be like a lot of tweaking of this right and i think even like we could go way further where it's like incentivize people more to not just farm and dump the token like if you hold it longer you get some kind of incentive there's all kinds of things isn't that just a greater fools like ponzi game thing too because that just turns into a ponzi game yeah kind of i mean this is leading to the ultimate conversation right where i haven't brought up too much on the podcast but um what's like the end game for d5 once incentives run out right like what what do yields start to look like do users just drop off um you know everyone in in the space touts these super high yields but the reality is they're not long-term sustainable right like the token so there's two aspects to a lot of these yield farms right or these d5 protocols there's the the core rate which say like on an off air compound that rate is driven if you're lending that's driven by borrowing demand right so if there's a huge spike in borrowing demand for usdc your interest rate's going to go up um now that can be muted down if more deposits come in to the lending side and then the second part is a lot of protocols are giving away their own token now they're probably not going to give away their token forever although i would debate that like the supply cap meme isn't really necessary for d5 protocols so we might see that lifted and kept um but once say the um subsidy of the coin like in comp's case you're giving away a comp on top of the interest rate once that dries up and you get a lot of cash that starts to come into d5 over time because it becomes easier if rates start to settle down to like traditional finance levels what like what's the strong narrative for defy at that point beyond just trustless holding up your own wealth or your own money or whatever right um so i'm curious to see how that shakes out i mean if we do settle down to like traditional finance levels like to some degree that might just signal that like a a it got actually adopted or b people might actually feel more secure about like entering into that market and like keep keeping that because like aside from how like magical and wonderful and fantastic and efficient defy is like there's plenty of other reasons to adopt ethereum infrastructure rather than your traditional banking infrastructure totally yeah i think that's where we will go um but i don't know if people realize that these rates are gonna eventually get armed down to traditional rates right there's nothing really magical the magic right now is it's it's harder to get into ethereum so the rates are higher and there's more speculation happening but the second you know large funds hedge funds banks can put in their deposits those rates are going to get crushed down and they're going to be pretty equal to traditional world so i think people should expect that going forward we're starting to see it a little bit like last year comp you could earn eight to ten percent pretty easily um these days it's more like three um just on the core rate not the comp subsidy on top but yeah right but d5 has also been like pretty quiet right like as soon as like trading activity picks up like yields yields pick up like yeah my gut is that rates will always be at least marginally higher than traditional rates uh on their floor at the very least yeah agreed there will be a spread for sure um yeah it would be interesting and plus if like if these things do get down they're just the market itself is going to be like insanely liquid uh and also if if like a bunch of like traditional money comes in two of that down it's gonna be really bullish for ether yeah totally yeah and what's interesting is i i don't put anything in um d5 that's not insured through nexus mutual um so it becomes interesting for me when rate so it costs like 2.4 or whatever to ensure on most protocol most safe protocols through nexus if rates start creeping down towards that it becomes a net negative for me right yield wise so i think the whole insurance thing needs to be figured out a little bit better long term as well and i know there's a lot of teams working on of course nexus too um but more streamlined like the ideas of i'm only insured when i'm actually in the protocol um and rates need to get a little bit more competitive there so do you micromanage that insurance or like if things like go negative do you just like i'm just gonna like not bother and like two days later it'll be positive again yeah i do i do manage it it kind of sucks right like they they do like 30 90 or 180 days i always do 30 because if like the rates were to tank or whatever i don't want to be net negative for longer um but yeah then you got to like in your calendar remember when your compound cover is expiring you gotta go re-up it and like sometimes there's the work you're talking about yeah exactly right it's a full-time job i know there's been what was it like armor like armor fire someone was doing where like you would only be covered if you were in the protocol like so if you took your funds out and then that cuts down your costs too um there's a lot of tweaks and improvements i would like to see where protocols offer an insurance native option right so like this stuff's baked into say ave and it's like do you want an insured deposit you get two percent less or do you not um that would be so much easier yeah that that seems to be like with the logical conclusion of where that would go yeah yeah i think it has to all right eric well i think we could wrap it up there cool thanks thanks for coming on uh layer zero and let me uh pick your brain a little bit yeah absolutely i appreciate it invited me i like i like this format so i'll definitely be tuning in to others too because i think it allows a nice flow of conversation uh after you i have
