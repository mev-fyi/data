[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david inflation episode we booked lynn alden on this episode because we wanted to learn more about inflation it's in the headlines it's everywhere i feel like for the first time maybe i'm experiencing it in everyday life what a fantastic conversation with lynn huh inflation in 2021 i think is a a massive subject that we're all trying to wrap our heads around and i i'm actually really excited that the i think the number one person to help answer this question is a crypto person i mean lynn alden she isn't like exclusively a crypto person but she really understands crypto to a very deep degree and you know talks about crypto when when we talk about inflation interestingly enough however ryan we obviously actually didn't get to the crypto conversation until the very very end of the podcast it was inflation for like the first two thirds of it but this is a subject that i really wanted to answer for my own benefit uh and we had to just go out to the leading expert on inflation and federal uh federal reserve policy monetary policy macro markets to help us understand like what the heck is going on with inflation in 2021 yeah it's funny because i i feel like um i'm seeing in everyday life like at the grocery store right you know like gas pump like restaurant prices um supply shortages ever since uh we had jim bianco on and he talked about hey when inflation comes you'll feel it in the form of all these things you can't get that you want all of these like um disparities in in supply and and demand and i'm starting to see that everywhere so i i think it was really important we've never had a episode that just dives right into the topic of inflation and it's three forms and that's what this episode is so if you don't know anything about inflation this is a fantastic episode if you know a decent amount like intermediate level this is still a fantastic episode because lynn gives these really deep and nuanced explanations of just about every facet of this thing whether it's like the geopolitical implications or wage earners versus kind of capital asset holders or like all of the related subjects of of you know what the fed can do about this super nuance su super detailed this is kind of a canonical episode for me at least on inflation i plan to listen to this a few more times i find it really interesting at the very least partly also concerning that the most the person that can explain uh inflation with the level of precision that lynn alden can that's not it's not coming from the federal reserve like the the word salad coming out of the federal reserve is not helping me understand what inflation is who's helping me understand what inflation is is somebody like lynn alden who you know private sector does her own research uh pays attention to crypto uh and that's what you're gonna see on cnbc right right yeah yeah and and so like the person that i go to to understand inflation the most is a somebody who like is really bullish on crypto uh and that makes me feel good in the sense that like oh i'm glad that i feel like i'm in the right place but also bad in the sense that the policy makers and the leaders can't extend explain inflation the way that lynn alden can absolutely i i think very few people actually know what inflation actually is and why it's caused and whether it will be transient or whether it will be persistent how to even think about the topic and that's what this episode goes into so guys we are going to get to the episode but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go

alden investment strategy lynn alden herself she's a leading expert in macro market she's no stranger to crypto and she's absolutely no stranger to the bankless podcast we had her on the show about six weeks ago where we talked about the the dollar dominance six months ago excuse me the we talked about the dollar dominance and the death of the dollar dominance um she focuses on long-term debt cycles how it's impacting virtually every market out there so crypto fiat bonds equities everything and when we asked crypto because dave and i wanted to have an inflation podcast when we asked krypto who the best person to bring on to explain inflation to us there was a resounding message from crypto and that was bring on lynn alden once again so here we are lynn alden it is fantastic to have you back on bank list thanks for having me back and i'm always happy to talk about inflation it's been a big topic that i've been covering for the past couple years yeah absolutely and this feels like a topic that is increasing into uh mainstream headlines where i'm starting to see it starting to get like people on the street asking about inflation starting to think about inflation this is something that they haven't thought about uh for a while you've been thinking about it dave and i think about it from time to time but inflation is here 5.4 in june that is from a previous the previous years june so it's kind of a 12-month trailing 5.4 percent should we be alarmed lynn uh you know certainly obviously it it impacts people differently uh and so probably people like us are less impacted than than people that say have a much tighter uh you know uh difference between their income and their expenses right so uh people that are more sensitive to grocery prices and more sensitive that sort of thing are getting pretty hit by this uh and so you know we are in in a period where inflation is going up pretty heavily and the key thing i think to keep in mind is that it's not it's not like the same things are going up we're kind of getting the cycle going out so one of the big drivers of inflation over the past say you know four months uh was used car prices skyrocketing there's actually ended up being a pretty big part of that component we've also seen food prices go up a bunch of other things go up while we still had disinflation or deflation in some other categories like for example you know men's business clothes for example are actually deflationary while you have things like used car prices are going up and so it's kind of like things that are experiencing supply bottlenecks while their demand is still pretty persistent they're the things we're seeing inflation in and i think the thing to kind of worry about uh maybe you know going into the later half this year the second half this year is rent inflation right because this actually this five percent inflation spike happened while rent inflation was actually decreasing so it was still positive it wasn't deflating but there but the you know basically went down from say three percent inflation down to like two percent inflation because you had you know uh rent moratoriums and things like that uh but we've got this big surge in house prices uh and as rent moratoriums and and basically all these different things kind of expire uh we're starting to see a bottoming in that rent inflation and you know if they if they follow real estate prices as they historically have let's say like a 18 month lag we should see some pretty significant rent and owner's equivalent rent inflation in the back half this year so i do think that this is going to be stickier than some of the economists expect uh and that there is still uh parts of the market to worry about i'd be especially worried if i was in in bonds right for example investors that are overweight bonds and cash lin that really weaves together a story that i'm particularly trying to just to find out what what this story is for for my own purposes and this uh story got weaved together i remember when we had jim bianco on the podcast and he talked about how there was just breakdowns in supply chains and there were certain sectors of consumer goods that had just incredible shortages just because the supply chains couldn't handle it there's also labor shortages everywhere and then there's weird market dynamics going on in the commodities like we saw lumber just go absolutely crazy and then now it's retraced but there's a lot of different things happening and and then coming in with this extremely high inflation in may is what's the common denominator to all these things that are have been happening happening in the last like few months or so is it all a story of inflation or is there something else that's also going on that's worth uh discussing i would say the two common denominators are fiscal policy so the fiscal stimulus on one hand uh that impacts uh demand levels and then of course uh you know the virus the the the lockdowns the logistics there have kind of been been backed up over the past year and a half and so if you look at the supply side obviously when you have you know over you know uh basically uh supply constrained shipping constraints right there's so many so only so many ships built right they can transport things from china to elsewhere and so when you have a highly global supply chain uh you know you basically you you increase efficiency but you decrease resiliency and so we've spent the last 25 years uh making our supply chains as global and efficient as possible but less resilient than they would be if they were you know more kind of in-house sort of speak and so you know on one hand you have that problem uh and there you know you have specific bottlenecks like ships semiconductor foundries and some of those key things trickled everything else right so so for example the car the limitation on new cars and and now even used cars is part because of that semiconductor shortage right so obviously the auto industry is a big consumer of semiconductors and so if you have supply bottlenecks there it trickles up to the whole supply chain pretty much everything we use has semiconductors now it's like the new oil on the other hand you know you have the demand surge partially from uh physical stimulus and so for example if you if you just kind of went through this say uh you know a recession we've been in uh and you didn't do stimulus you'd have a reduction in both supply and demand and so instead of inflationary conditions you probably would have depressionary conditions right so fewer people would be able to afford things uh and so that would keep a lid on demand right so used car prices wouldn't build a skyrocket because there'd be fewer people buying cars uh you know but of course you'd have other problems and so policymakers were kind of in a rock and a hard place and they went the the you know the stimulus route and so what that does is you know uh you know most people got more money in their pocket uh that could you know that took the form of stimulus checks it took the form of uh extra unemployment benefits it took the form of ppp loans to small businesses that turned to grants there's there's child tax credits all sorts of things uh and so that increased the demand that people have for various goods and services while supplies were still constrained and so historically whenever you have a significant rise in money supply while you have some sort of supply constraints and key things that's when you get inflation so in the 1940s we had obviously inflation in all sorts of commodities and shortages like that in the 70s it was very much tied to oil right so we had a rapid increase in money supply while we had constraints about how much foreign oil we could get and then here in in 2021 it's semiconductors and shipping and certain other things one pattern that i've noticed is that the united states was definitely the most aggressive with its stimulus and now it's also experiencing the most amount of inflation how correlated would you say those two things are i would say highly correlated and that's something i've been pointing out since 2020 saying that i i was expecting the u.s to have more inflation outcome because if you look at say you know i think a lot of people make this mistake of looking at just central bank balance sheets going up uh but that's not you know that's not tightly correlated with inflation instead it's about broad money supply so that the money that's actually in people's checking in bank accounts in broad circulation rather than say the wholesale money that banks have with each other uh and so you know over the past uh you know 18 months we've seen a much larger increase in u.s broad money supply than we saw in europe that we saw in japan that we saw in china most other countries other than the you know the the a handful of emerging markets that are experiencing you know borderline hyperinflation but besides those the us has been you know pretty much the largest increase in broad money supply at least out of the developed and most emerging world uh and so that's it's it's it has good and bad things on one hand you know that the gdp recovered quicker right so people bounce back quicker our our consumer expectations and and positive sentiment rebounded faster uh but on the other hand uh you know increased demand faster than the supply constraints could handle uh and so you know basically our imports increased while our exports didn't really increase as much right because we're the ones inflating more stimulating more and so our demand recovered faster than our supply and so yeah i think that's a very tightly correlated thing so if you look at a chart of money supply and inflation from most of these kind of you know large markets you'll see that there's pretty much a one-to-one correlation between how much their money supply went up and how much inflation they're currently experiencing with a lag lynn you talked about how uh the decision makers were in a rock and a hard place and they eventually had to choose one path and we'll get into why people why why the policy makers are in the the rough spot that they were in and we talked about that in our first podcast with you as well i'm sure it's going to be a recurring theme but with with regards to you know either choosing to you know add stimulus or or not and then you know eventually policymakers chose to add more and more stimulus would you say that that was the correct move or just the a an overall good move how would you uh you know on how would you rate the the goodness of that choice i think there's parts of it that are good and bad so i would say somewhere in the middle of that score range and i would say that the mistakes a lot of the mistakes that that basically were paying for now were set back decades ago so i would say that policy from from you know say the past 25 years has been a very low score i think that that's yeah that's the kind of plan of the seats for this and so i would place the problems mostly at you know in that sense so when you look at what's happening in in this kind of whole fiscal round and monetary round i would say you know policymakers basically you know because there's so much debt in the system and because they've so relied on on using uh increasing uh prices of financial assets to to prop up the market and because of the structure of the the global dollar system uh the us is very financialized more so than even most other developed countries and we're very reliant on our asset prices being elevated uh and you know the the average consumer only has say a month before they run out of money right they don't have a lot of savings uh and so when we encounter this problem you know they in any kind of fiat regime right when they're faced with like nominal collapse right they always choose to print and so we saw that this time that was kind of my base case going into this and there are certain things that are that are worse than others right so the big the big kind of you know back in 2008 the biggest problem with how they did that was that they bailed out the banks and things like that but they didn't bail out the homeowners right so it was kind of the worst of all worlds it was like socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor and so that's why you had on you know different types of populism from different sides of the political spectrum so you had the tea party on the right you had occupy wall street on the left and you got a lot of pushback for that and this time you know they kind of said okay socialism for everyone we're gonna we're gonna bail out companies we're gonna send stimulus checks we're gonna send uh you know all sorts of things and so one hand that's it's less bad than what what the 2008 thing was right but it's uh you know so you have for example personal income for the median person went up rather than down because if you include all the stimulus they got to kind of offset a lot of their issues not for every single person but on a kind of a large aggregate uh but that does come with consequences and then there's kind of subsets of their policy response that i think were terrible like the fed buying corporate bonds for example i think that's a really really bad precedent uh and and certain policy actions like that i also think that the fed's kind of you know uh like verbal navigation what's going on was was in large part inaccurate and misleading and kind of you know it's like they can't say certain things out loud so they have to kind of say things in in ways that end up sounding like political speech so we just kind of you know make make fun of them uh and so i would say it's a very mixed outcome uh but they just didn't have that many options so pretty much all of their options were bad more or less and they you know they kind of could navigate that in different ways and i think they some are in the middle i would say so so lynn i want to uh zone in on a few things that you're saying you said that the seeds for the inflation that we're experiencing now um were planted like like decades ago right and um i i think people are sort of wondering what the connection is between say 2008 and now like are at some level are we sort of reaping what we sowed then and i'm wondering if you sort of get into the the different types of inflation because for let me throw out so kind of the the way i see inflation you you tell you'll you tell me if this is correct there's kind of money supply inflation which is sort of fed balance sheet level inflation then you have asset price inflation which is the price of stocks and you know homes and assets that investors buy then you have cpi inflation which is what we were just talking about when i asked you the question of like 5.4 um june year of the year that that's large and it seems like mainstream only focuses on that third component right that that cpi inflation but i'm wondering if all of these are somewhat tied together you also mentioned like fiscal policy it seems like once fiscal policy once we start printing uh checks and actually giving it to individuals that's when you start to get that cpi inflation to go up before that when we were printing money and giving those to bank bailouts seemed like that inflation went into asset price inflation am i thinking about this correct is that like generally in the ballpark or what edits would you have to that i think that's a pretty accurate way to describe it and when i refer to decades ago it's not only that doesn't it crisis but it goes back to say the late 90s uh and so basically i mean you can actually go back all the way to 1987 under greenspan where we started to do this concept where the fed begins caring about asset prices so before then they cared you know they cared less about asset prices but started with that 1987 crash under under uh greenspan as a federal reserve chair they started to uh you know have a kind of an unofficial mandate to bail out the stock market when it crashes and so that that started in 1987 and then we started to see it in the late 90s when you saw long-term capital management for people that are aware of of you know that that big uh you know kind of uh implosion that happened in markets it's not really well-versed among say retail investors but most people are uh you know involved in say macro level trading or are familiar with that the fed and the banking system basically had to bail that out they could have chosen not to or they could have done it in a different way but so they kind of you know we started to get this concept of the greenspan put the idea that if markets go down greenspin will be there to do things and so even when you had a dip in say the late 90s right after a massive economic boom massive stock price boom when you had a pretty small dip green spin came in there cut interest rates it was always very accommodative always always airing in the side of lower industry it's very accommodative try to get those asset prices back up and so that really kind of set the stage for the dot-com bubble and then when that you know fell apart then they said basically we need to inflate a housing bubble right we needed we need to get this all back up again so they cut interest rates and that kind of led to a housing bubble boom uh and then when that fell apart he had to reflate the banking system and then kind of prop up the stock market again and so really ever since the late 80s and especially in the late 90s they've been in this thing where that they just keep pushing up asset prices and keeping interest rates as low as possible and that really set the stage for a lot of things we're experiencing now that that look those low interest rates uh basically incentivize you know companies households and all sorts of you know different uh entities to take out a lot of debt especially because they're trying to buy say high priced homes and things like that let alone what corporations are doing with their balance sheet and so that you know we've had this kind of multi-decade structure of encouraging debt accumulation uh and so and when you get down to where we are now where interest rates eventually hit zero and debts extremely high they've boxed themselves into a corner and so that goes back to i i learned a lot from ray dalio and his and his concept of the long-term debt cycle which is basically that in a normal economic cycle like a five to ten year business cycle you know during the expansion phase you get more credit in the system uh some of it's constructive but then towards the end of it you start to get you know kind of malinvestment people get over over excited about the market they start making they start you know kind of uh losing their discipline and then some sort of external catalyst comes along or some sort of policy error or something and you get a recession at deleveraging and so you reduce that debt the problem is the policymakers come in uh they try to prop that back up rather than letting it run its course and so when you kind of you know basically you short circuit that deleveraging and so debt doesn't go down to where it started interest rates end up at a lower low and so debt starts going back up for the next cycle without having fully deleveraged and so when you string multiple of those business cycles together you get higher and higher debt as a percentage of gdp you get lower and lower interest rates until you find out what we had you know in 2008 and then especially here in in you know back in 2020 was the interest rates are zero uh and there's all that debt in the system and everyone's so highly leveraged that their next mechanism is to go down that fiscal policy route which is actually where you get kind of that consumer price inflation so lowering interest rates and doing quantitative easing is very good for asset prices uh so you get asset price inflation and then when you actually do that fiscal spending combined with that with that say monetization of those of those fiscal deficits that's when you get an actual increase in the broad money supply very quickly and you get outright consumer price inflation because that's when you get more money in people's pockets uh and so you get a big kind of shift from that from that environment you've been in for the past 10 20 years this is the thing lynn which kind of drives me crazy about the mainstream conversation around uh inflation like like first of all they almost painted like it's kind of somewhat inevitable right it's just like once in a while the pernicious inflation kind of raises its head but the but the other thing when when people start talking about you know now we have high inflation you know five percent high inflation part of me wants to go to them and be like no we've had high inflation like let's let's talk about the last 15 years you guys aren't talking about asset price inflation and that's where we've seen a massive amount of inflation that has contributed to what we're seeing today but also the massive inequality that like the population is so upset about now um why does mainstream ignore asset price inflation when they talk about when they have conversations about inflation is this sort of a just a narrow definition um painted by i guess like mainstream economists and central bankers that sort of thing like what's the what's the reason why they don't include asset price inflation as part of this broader conversation yeah partially comes down from what economic school they come from uh and then it comes down from what the government figures define as inflation so when you look at say cpi right that that's what people think of as inflation that purpose excludes asset prices it actually used to include home prices but then excluded that they exchange it for owner's equivalent rent which is kind of an indirect proxy for housing prices but basically understates it and so you know because because all of our major indicators of inflation at least the the ones that are often used by by the the government the fed uh p uh cpi uh pce uh all those different uh you know uh acronyms those are measuring just the consumer part of that inflation and they're doing it in a way that is of course controversial because they have all sorts of quality adjustments in there that people can disagree with uh but basically that's what they define as inflation whereas you rarely hear about say the money supply until of course 2020 when it went up like 25 year-over-year that's when everybody on twitter is talking about the money supply but in most circumstances you don't hear about that type of inflation you don't hear about asset price inflation you just hear about the ones that are officially measured by those government statistics which focuses narrowly on that consumer component and so i think that is a mistake and so you know we've had more awareness of it i think over the past year and a half because you started to see this money supply growth and there are some people out there including me that are trying to you know make people aware of the money supply more than just the the cpi lynn would you say that seeing inflation in consumer prices seeing cpi inflation that that is like the last place that you finally see inflation it's like the last place for inflation to finally like emerge and like instantiate itself in like you get you get asset price inflation first like you get monetary base growth first and you know we if we do things right and play they play the economic game right like we can have those for a while without asset price inflation or excuse me without cpi inflation but ultimately like when it when at the end of the day when it's when it's too much money gets printed too too quickly it finally ultimately shows up at the last like most difficult level which is like the cpi inflation would you agree with that characterization so that's certainly the order we're experiencing at this time it's every cycle is a little bit different and so for example back in the 1930s you had a pretty disinflationary environment so low asset prices and disinflation and when you moved into the 40s you got that outright consumer price inflation without really getting asset price inflation uh you know before it and so you can have periods where you go straight to consumer price inflation so largely it comes down to which segments of society are getting that extra money supply right so if it's primarily the rich that are getting the money supply uh it goes into assets right so they don't a billionaire that makes another billion doesn't really consume that much more right he or she already has all of their needs met so they go buy more financial assets right they buy more more real estate they buy more equities they buy more businesses uh they don't go out and buy you know if they do buy another car it's a drop in the bucket compared to you know the consumer they already have whereas if you give more money to someone who spends most of their money on consumption right someone who makes a middle class salary uh that translates right into you know food prices and gasoline prices and housing prices much more rapidly and so really kind of comes down to where that injection of money is going uh how quickly kind of goes from asset price inflation to consumer price inflation so asset price inflation is more influenced by interest rates uh and basically the wealthy getting the money and you know if we if we you know kind of take a step back uh you know that part of what's kind of pressure the middle class is that we've had this asset price inflation and so for example we've monetized things like our homes right so so for you know our parents or grandparents when they bought a home it was a much lower ratio of their income right so much lower multiple of their income whereas today when people want to buy a home it's a much higher ratio of their income and their only offsetting factors that mortgage rates are so low that it keeps their monthly uh uh you know payment kind of uh moderate uh but then they're of course very reliant on low interest rates and so you've kind of built that up and so that's kind of what we're going through now so you know it really kind of comes down to who's getting the money where that money supply is growing uh that triggers what type of inflation you get there's also you know technology over the long run has generally been disinflationary right so obviously if you make technology better we should make certain things cheaper right so tractors made food cheaper than paying someone to do it by hand whereas uh you know basically flagship type of assets like coastal property or the best stocks or gold or or or bitcoin whatever the case may be when you have something that people want that's inherently scarce uh that's not really you know technology is not really taking away from that so the money supply kind of those things tend to track money supply growth uh whereas say food and technology items those things tend to undershoot the broad money supply growth because they're also being made more abundant by technology it's so fascinating and it's it's such a more nuanced view than than you hear in in sort of mainstream about inflation i i'm just curious because it seems to be the case that when we just take cpi into account we're measuring inflation wrong at the base of it if if lynn alden was in charge of of things for for a minute uh how would you measure inflation is there a better economic indicator out there so i would i think there's it's one of those things there's no perfect metric so i would present it as a number of metrics which is how i do it and so when i have articles or newsletters about inflation i often break it into the different components so i would say okay here's what's happening with monetary inflation here's what's happening with say the broad money supply so i would focus on that and that kind of presents mostly the upper range for what other types of inflation can be the broad money supply and then you know from there we can say okay what is a basket of goods doing right and then of course you can have disagreements about what should be included in that basket of goods uh but at least i think when you have that combination of watching the broad money supply and then watching a basket of goods that can tell you quite a bit about inflation then if you want to get into asset price inflation you can do things like okay how's the median home price uh comparing to that basket of goods how's it comparing to wages how is it comparing to broad money supply and then you can kind of do the same thing with equities you can say what is the perce you know the percentages of the market capitalization to gdp and you can offset it by a couple different factors that could influence that outside of inflation you can also look at equity valuations things like that so price to earnings ratios including some of the more smoothed out ones like cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratios and so whenever i'm talking about inflation i would try to include you know multiple different metrics say a basket of five different ways to measure it rather than trying to encapsulate everything with one indicator the central bank it appears to me does not do that level analysis lin maybe that's part part of the reason we're in the trouble that we're in at least it sounds like there's going to be trouble ahead but but we're going to talk about that more one of the main questions i think in this in this mainstream discourse though is this people will acknowledge that uh inflation is here now finally right they may have ignored asset price inflation but when you see you know 5.4 percent inflation is here um but they'll say oh it's just it's just transitory right we're getting over this coveted thing of course you you know use a price of used cars that goes up of course that's going to fall back down once we're over the this transitory period we're not going to have a long-term inflation problem and i think some of that message is coming out of the fed some of that message is coming out of mainstream media outlets some of that message is coming out of mainstream economists i'm wondering because i feel like you are best positioned maybe to give both sides of the argument could you give us both sides so first what is like the steel man argument that inflation is transitory and then what's the argument that it's that's a bit more persistent a bit more long-term so let's start with the argument for why it might be transitory what do people say about this sure and when they're talking about transfer inflation they're talking about the cpi and those kind of consumer indicators so we'll focus on that uh and so you know when to steal man that argument basically you say okay we have these very deflationary backdrops so demographics are more deflationary right because we have an aging population we have slower population growth uh we have a lot of debt in the system that's very disinflationary and of course we have technology disinflation and so all those kind of structural forces if you look if you look over say a multi-century view kind of the law the long arc of history is is tends towards disinflation in the sense that you know uh you know our ability to access resources generally gets easier right so so the average middle class person can live in a way that a king or queen from 500 years ago would find remarkable right so basically we have this long arc of disinflation but is punctuated by periods of inflation and so that part i would say is true but then when you zoom in on it and you see okay so uh what is transitory and so on one hand i will say certain things i do think will be transitory right so the biggest argument for being transitory is that it's due to specific uh bottlenecks related to the virus related to shutdowns related to uh you know kind of abrupt changes in consumer demand right so everybody wants suburban real estate instead of urban real estate and you know there's kind of a bottleneck for that that'll resolve uh and so you know what we're seeing price increases now but that'll subside uh in say you know the next year right so that that'd be the more transitory argument for inflation uh and another part of it is that you can look at base effects so when we talk about say the five percent inflation that we saw since since last june uh we can say okay well may and june of last year were you know that was kind of a particularly low point for inflation right because that was kind of the heart of the lockdowns uh that was when everyone you know was not really spending uh and so if you say compare it to 18 months ago uh you know that say or two years ago that to rate average inflation has not been quite as high as say the 5.4 that we see when we specifically measure from that dip last year uh and so those are the those are the more transitory arguments um and and there is a lot of truth to that and so if we take the lumber example because lumber went up remarkable it was like you know went from a few hundred uh dollars per uh whatever quantity they used as their futures contract i think it's a thousand feet uh and that sort all up like 1700 it was like a parabolic increase and if we look at why that happened obviously a lot of people wanted suburban homes rural homes so we had a big increase in lumber demand and then the question is where is that supply constraint and so if you look at say timber which is you know earlier in the supply chain there was no spike in timber there was no shortage of timber there's no shortage of wood the problem was that there was a there was a limitation in sawmill capacity so turning uh timber into lumber and and those sawmill capacity though they were at capacity and they could have you know built more sawmills but they said no we think this is not going to be super persistent so we're just going to you know have higher prices enjoy that rather than go out and build a lot more salt mills just in time for this demand to go away and so you had that i would describe that as a shallow bottleneck so it wasn't a deep bottleneck because it's a more easily resolved bottleneck and so when when eventually that demand subsided partly because lumber prices got so high that everyone kind of put their plans on hold uh to build new houses and things like that so it kind of took care of itself and started to get that demand in uh shrinking demand and lumber and that that bottleneck got resolved uh and so that's an example of truly transfer inflation prices went up and then they came back down uh now when we talk about transfer inflation i think a big thing that the fed and the corporate media leave out is that there's a difference between transfer inflation and rate of change terms and absolute terms an example i like to use for there is the 1940s so if you look at the 1940s you had three really big spikes in inflation the biggest spike was actually almost 20 year-over-year and so you'd have this massive spike in inflation and then the next year it would go away and partially that was from wage and price controls it was also partially just from that actual inflation was subsiding and because it was kind of a very specific type of inflation because it was kind of driven by fiscal spending rather than bank lending and so it was more kind of bumpy and so you did that that big in space inflation spike would end but there was no period of deflation to offset the fact that inflation just occurred so if you look at what actual cpi did is the prices went up and then they just leveled off and then we had another spike of inflation they went up again and then they leveled off and so it was it was not transitory in absolute terms right so prices went up and then they stayed at that new level whereas the the rate of change of that inflation was transitory and so of course when they talk about transits or in the media or the fed they're talking about that first one they're saying okay it went up and they're not saying it's going to come back down the prices they're saying that it's not going to keep going up at that rate and so that's important when you're holding cash or bonds right because you say okay you're losing purchasing power and we're just saying you're not going to lose purchasing power the same rate for the next you know three years we think that that rate is going to cool down and you're gonna have a one-time loss of purchasing power for example uh and so and then you know when you look at that you still look at the broad basket so individual things like lumber might very well come all the way back down they could be truly transitory in absolute terms whereas for example when chipotle says okay we're going to pay off our workers 15 we're going to raise our prices by 4 to compensate for that you know we're never seeing those lower prices again though that's the new floor for chipotle prices same thing for coca-cola proctor and gamble when they raise prices i mean that is i know 99 percent not coming back down uh whereas some of these more specific bottlenecks uh they can come back down so my overall base case is that you know some of this i think will be transitory in rate of change terms uh but it's you know in a broad way it's unlikely to be transitory in absolute terms and i think that the media does not do a very good job of separating these those two concepts uh and so that's how i phrase it and if you say okay you know if i was again putting on the transitory hat i would say that a lot of this inflation is is you know uh driven by the fiscal spending we saw and we're unlikely to get another large burst of that fiscal spending of the next year in the end the year after that right because now we have a senate that's more kind of divided on that subject uh and you know there's all sorts of reason now that you're actually experiencing inflation that might also might kind of pull them back from wanting to do more fiscal and so without that physical spending you know we kind of will revert to that more disinflationary trend over time and again i would i would agree with that if if you don't do any more physical spending at a very large level i think that you know uh prices will kind of level out and they might not keep going up at the same rate that they have been and so i do think that there are merits to the transfer inflation view uh but that they're often not described in a very detailed way but i think so the message coming from the fed and i think mainstream is that this won't be a problem in the future that this is a like a transitory one-time problem and then inflation's going to subside it'll go back to normal you don't think that's the case you think that this is going to be a bit more persistent into the future and that that narrative that you know the fed is saying mainstream is saying is somewhat downplaying inflation is that the case yeah i think so i think a lot of these prices that went up will not go back down and so people holding cash or bonds got devalued we're also seeing that bond yields are well below the inflation rate uh and so i think that the bond market's very complacent partially because it's being you know indirectly kind of held down by the fed and so you know i think that that those are actually pretty big problems for certain types of investors in those assets and i think you know say we've gotten past like the lumber spike for example but as you go farther into this year now we're looking at rent inflation uh and then the big question the long-term question is what happens with wage inflation right because it's hard to get really persistent inflation without wages going up because eventually that kind of limits demand for goods and services but if you start to see a a kind of feedback loop of wages going up that's how you get kind of that stickier type of inflation and so you saw that in the 70s for example whereas you know we're kind of in the early stage of that now so so partially from you know we've had 25 years or so of globalization right ever since the mid mid 90s we've had this big structural trend of globalization and that's put a lot of downward pressure on wages and there's there's other factors like unionization things like that but really the biggest factor overall was globalization combined with technology automation we found all sorts of different ways to hire cheaper labor or automate something whereas you know in the previous decades we would have had to you know actually increase wages for workers uh and so if we start to see signs of that trend reversing which i think we have you know globalization hasn't really reversed but it has kind of stopped growing so if you if you look at say global trade as a percentage of global gdp that was in a multi-decade structural increase uh but then it kind of topped out and we've been we've been kind of holding whatever percentage that is uh for several years now right so and and i think uh this whole kind of you know uh pandemic situation kind of highlighted some of the risks of of uh you know extreme globalization where the early phase of that pandemic the united states says wait we can't make ventilators we can barely make masks we have to ask china for masks and we find out that most of our pharmaceutical components are made in china and we say well that's not that's not kind of a good thing from national security right and so i think we've kind of topped out in terms of globalization and if indeed we start to see more of a political will to restore some of those supply chains you know that we go back to early thing we spent 25 years increasing efficiency at the cost of resiliency and if we start kind of going the other direction we want to increase resiliency and increase domestic uh you know opportunities uh that that will probably come with the cost of efficiency and therefore come with the cost of higher inflation and and and and you know in a good way your wage growth but then you also get you know inflation that kind of comes along with that and so i think that's the the big risk to watch from you know i think the the media is focused on these lumber spikes or these say specific semiconductor shortages whereas i think because the broad money supply has has increased and that's permanently increased i do think that we'll we'll start increasing see that trickling into wages uh trickling into rents uh because those people that that had you know the housing costs went up rents are going up uh they're going to demand higher wages in order to make ends meet and i do think that that's going to be persistent for longer than the fed is suggesting and that the corporate media is suggesting i really want to actually dive into that specifically because the this labor shortage uh phenomenon is is something that i'm seeing left and right and lynn when you were talking about the the lumber versus timber example where there was a bottleneck in turning timber into lumber we had no shortage of timber we had plenty of shortages of lumber i want to know if that was also a shortage of labor supply as well if that also got involved with that because uh we were we're seeing you know a bunch of stimulus a bunch of money get injected into the economy uh we're also seeing a bunch of demand for people to move and therefore to you know purchase or build new houses which is where that demand for uh lumber comes from all the available supply of lumber gets sucked up and then also the the labor uh required to turn timber into lumber well all those people just got a bunch of money put into their cash pockets uh and another interesting like statistic i heard i can't remember the number but there was a massive small business boom during covid and that's because people have the cash in their pockets to actually start off a a business and so maybe people are you know looking at their jobs that they previously had or the jobs that they are out in the on uh that are out on the market and they are aren't just they aren't compelled by them anymore and therefore they're turning elsewhere how does how does and a is that the way that you see it as well and then also b how does this uh factor into the whole uh transitory inflation conversation yeah so that definitely impacts certain industries more than others and so i would say that the lumber industry was less impacted by that because they were still you know for most of time they were running at full capacity and they just didn't have enough facilities to kind of keep up with that whereas what you described is is greatly impacting say restaurants and other things like that very service heavy uh type of environments that are often low paid as well and people i mean you know if you're working in as a as a waiter or waitress right now i mean a lot of them are still uh you know having to wear masks all day or they're on there and obviously it's a hard job to begin with you're on your feet for eight hours uh and now they're you know they're they're they're wearing masks the whole time uh and uh you know they're they're say their wages have not gone up enough to keep up the fact that their their groceries bill went up uh their gasoline you know that they paid to drive to work went up uh they have all sorts of constraints uh and so they say you know what it's it's not even worth working anymore until you pay me like 50 more than you were uh and so we've seen a big shortage in labor uh for uber drivers restaurants things like that some of these lower paid uh types of either gig work or uh structural work and so that is along with the fact that you know we've had this kind of push towards restoring some of our things we are kind of having this this pretty big gap between jobs open and jobs filled and that's in large part because those wages that that businesses have been you know willing to offer have not kept up with the with the cost of of say running a basic life of having rent of having food of having uh you know uh saving for college savings yeah having health care covered uh some of those really big expenses uh and so basically until wages kind of push back up it's really hard to kind of move forward and i think you know it's kind of been like a chess game between employers and and workers because employers are saying okay uh you know that they're kind of say looking at that transitory inflation argument and they're saying well i mean it's hard to get workers right now because they're getting all these uh stimulus checks and things like that but those have expiration dates and so if we can kind of wait until some of that expires uh then those workers will become more desperate and they'll come back to us and being willing to offer uh say slightly higher salaries rather than way higher salaries and so they've they've been doing things like saying okay we're not going to offer higher wages but we're all for a sign up bonus right so we want to get people in the door we want to get people working but we don't want to commit to permanently higher wages just yet and so you know employers are trying to wait this out uh and employees you know potential employees they have a good amount of money in the bank from some of the stimulus that they got or from other other areas as they're saying well i'm not going to rush back into such a low wage type environment just yet and so i think we're i think we're going to have to get into say late this year or next year to see how persistent that labor gap is we have to see kind of how people respond when some of these fiscal taps are closed uh you know so i think that could alleviate a little bit but i think that you know because this money supply was permanently increased uh and i think a lot of these home prices things like that are permanently higher uh you know they're they're gonna have to get paid higher wages in order to basically be able to make ends meet and so i do think that wages will follow and it just they they tend to do so with a lag hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation with lynn alden thus far in the second half of the show we talk about how this current environment with regards to inflation might actually lead to changes in wages that might actually be beneficial for the wage earning population of the united states which leads us into a question of who might the winners and losers be in this new economic environment which i thought linaldo's answered there was particularly interesting at the end of the show we finished up with a lightning round of a bunch of different questions such as has crypto and bitcoin stolen the wind out of gold's sales and also how she includes the delta variant of kovid into her future mental model of how the world might play out in the next few short months or so and then also of course has her mind changed about ethereum at all so don't go anywhere we have such a fantastic conversation left in the second half of the show but before we get there we have to take a moment to talk about some of

deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com so in the in this kind of condition where you've got employers paying wage earners more right they're paying them more in nominal units but it doesn't necessarily mean they're paying them more in like real units right i saw me another day like somebody said um like three percent raise awesome and then looks at inflation and inflation's like five percent you know and so like net earning potential is negative two from uh from a real uh earnings increase is this what's sort of bound to happen in this sort of environment uh wage earners might eke out some small wins and get nominal wages increased but under the backdrop inspector of inflation these aren't real wage increases these are just like nominal value wage increases how does this play out i agree yeah it's not yeah i agree with a nominal approach and so you know if you again if you go back and compare the asset price inflation for example to the the the you know the say wage inflation over the past 20 years if you look and say you know how you know how many hours of work does it take to buy a gold coin or how many hours of work does it take to buy a share of the s p 500 uh you know those that those have gone up dramatically right so basically wage wage uh growth has you know it's kind of tread water with official cpi measures but then it's vastly underperformed as the price inflation so you can buy fewer kind of uh financial assets uh with your wages uh and so then especially in this year because inflation's pretty hot and and you know companies been less prone to want to waste rages some of them are getting these kind of invisible uh you know that they're actually getting sale in real terms either they're shredding water or going down slightly you also see this happen with say savings accounts and bond and you know investors they say well i got say a one percent yield but it's like when you when you factor out inflation you're at like a negative four percent yield and so we're seeing that with wages we're seeing that with with paper assets and so i do think that that's an ongoing concern and that's why until you know wages go up even faster uh that's going to continue to be a problem and then you have things like you know when you look at say what is overall kind of personal income it's that it's that wage component combined with any sort of government transfer payments that happen and so during this whole past say 18 months you know uh you know kind of partially filling that gap with wages not increasing as fast as inflation have been these kind of transfer payments these stimulus payments and things like that and so that's kind of make that meat but it's also been inflationary and so there we are kind of treading water over time and i think you know where as we're kind of you know getting past last round of physical stimulus we're starting to see signs of consumer sentiment is dropping and things like that because they're saying okay well i got all these kind of you know one-time payments but now that i'm actually relying on wages uh you know it's actually getting harder to make ends meet now because you know i might have money saved up from some of those checks but not a lot and so unless i get real wage growth i'm going to have trouble say you know paying these higher rent prices or paying these higher food prices and so you know i think there's going to be another increased round of pressure uh to do another round of that that fiscal stimulus to kind of fill that gap and we'll see if if a tele-divided senate will able to get something like that through or not and that's the kind of thing that can create the flywheel of more structural inflation yeah and so i i'm curious here about maybe you can weigh in on what the effects of inflation are we talked a lot about the effect uh the effects of uh inflation on on the consumer maybe we could talk a little bit more about that but a lot of people listening to this podcast they don't remember the 1940s obviously they weren't there uh not neither the 1970s for that matter right so like most of my lifespan anyway has been sort of a normal inflationary uh environment i don't know the one to three percent or so um like how how how do things change when you get into higher inflation levels and i don't think you're definitely not saying i don't think anyone is really saying uh seriously that the u.s is going into a hyperinflationary type scenario but like even five six seven percent maybe low double digit percent inflation it's got to lead to behavior change how do people start changing and modifying their behavior of where they like how they spend how they store wealth how they use debt how they think about the future in areas like the 1940s and 1970s what can we learn about today's present state well in some of those environments you can you know see speculation in markets right because you saw that i mean i agree i don't think we're i don't think the us can experience hyperinflation for example but if you go to say you know the classic hyperinflation example of weimar germany uh especially during the early phases of that people were speculating on financial assets because they could see that the currency was debasing that was before they realized it was hyperinflationary uh but kind of that early sign to that money supply going up uh and that you know uh that cash not keeping up with with the inflation rate the interest rates they were getting and so you'd see more speculation so one of the signs of inflation is that you see these periods of retail investor speculation and different types of assets another challenge that you have is that you know it's partially a mindset thing and so when you start to expect prices to be structurally higher in the future you tend to want to pull forward your consumption you want to buy more now because you're not sure if you're going to be able to get it in the future or if you're going to get at the same price uh and so that that can then actually perpetuate inflation because then everybody wants things even earlier and and that kind of there's only so much supply of those things and that pushes up the prices even further and so you start to get that hoarding type of of mentality and then for businesses the big challenge is that it makes long-term planning difficult right because you know a lot of businesses you know that you you put in capital and then a year later you start to actually reap the benefits of that capital uh but if inflation has gone up six percent uh during that time uh that really changes the types of calculations that you wanna do uh and so when you have any sort of business with a long lead time uh it is kind of you know has that more inflationary risk and so if you take an example of a of a short lead time like say a toll road where they could just kind of increase uh tolls like a private toll road you can increase tolls you kind of get that cash input whenever people drive through it that's a pretty fast turnaround whereas if you were if you're a supplier or some sort of say manufactured component you might make six-month deals 12-month deals 36-month deals even five-year deals or more with your with your with your customers and it's really hard to kind of uh make long-term capital investment plans when the unit of account is is you're not sure what it's going to be is it going to be disinflationary is it going to be inflationary is it going to go up to 10 percent is it going to go back down to 2 inflation it makes it really hard to make long-term plans and then that can ironically then restrict the amount of supplies in the system which can then still perpetuate inflation and so that's why you can you risk getting these these kind of one-off inflationary spikes can potentially turn into something more uh because you know as you go downstream you start to get these feedback loops that make it harder to get inflation back down to the level that it was lynn i want to ask you your perspective as to who are the winners and losers in this inflationary environment or just over the next 10 years or so as we get you know as the consumer price index changes because of inflation and as the things that we've been talking about tend to play out into the future who who's the winners and who are the losers and we can talk about this across a variety of different variables right like intergenerational are the boomers better off than the the younger millennials and zoomers and then also what about geopolitically uh is this going to favor the united states over over other countries and then also uh the classes of people like the wage earners versus the asset holders uh are is there a clear delineation between winners and losers in this environment yeah it depends on which which subset of environment you refer to and so for example in this period over the past 25 years of asset price inflation without wage inflation that's that's obviously been really good for for the wealthy right so if you hold assets you've done very well whereas if you are a wage earner and you want to buy your first home uh that's a that's a headwind against you uh and so we've been in this environment of rising wealth concentration in part because of the monetary policy the fiscal policy that that we've had especially united states but also to slimmix and elsewhere and so if you compare say the united states wealth concentration to most of europe or japan uh we have we have among the highest wealth concentration in the in the in the developed world and that's partially because of the policies we've we've done and partially because we've relied on our trade deficits we've hollowed out our our manufacturing base more so than some of our developed peers as we've had this kind of pressure on the on the middle class and the working class uh even more significantly than many other developed countries uh and so that's that's really kind of been the detriment to that segment while it's been pretty good for for china for example they've been able to rise from from abject poverty up to a more sustainable level but that's kind of come out of the you know kind of the the u.s middle class to a certain extent where i say the top one percent the top five percent of the united states have benefited uh you know tremendously from that they've said okay we got a cheaper pool of labor uh and our asset prices went up a lot uh and so you've had the you know kind of these pockets of winners and losers from that uh when you get kind of a a broader type of inflation uh you know some of the winners tend to be for example uh if you have say if in the 70s for example if you had a house with a with a fixed rate mortgage you generally did pretty good right because your house uh over time kept up and exceeded inflation whereas your mortgage partially got inflated away so if you had a stable income uh and you could pay you could sustain that mortgage uh you actually did pretty well uh whereas large holders of cash and bonds generally got devalued and so you know we've been in this environment that has really kind of been good for the asset holders good for uh people that are that are older in terms of age because they're generally ones that have more assets uh so it's not even just a say a top one percent versus poor thing it's not just class it's also age right so because even among classes generally when you when you age you get more assets if you've been somewhat financially successful and so it's been very good for that demographic and so going forward if we if the pendulum starts to charge the change you can get a shift away from that right and so you know we've been in this this kind of multi-decade trend and we're starting to see early signs of that kind of shifting back right we've we've had say all this globalization and automation has been very you know kind of detrimental to say the working class and if you start to get kind of of a political reversal of that it could be good for them but then it also could be more inflationary and so you have these kind of pockets of of you know winners and losers in terms of geography and then losers winners and losers in terms of age and then also in terms of of wealth levels i'm curious about this so you mentioned sort of the at least the effect on cpi recently has been um often precipitated by the amount of fiscal stimulus that's caught out this is like uh helicopter money so we call it like writing checks to people get your government stimulus check it seems like many in maybe cross political parties i'm not sure it's concentrated in one or the other but they are in favor of things like universal basic income pushing more money out to laborers i'm curious if you think that this is a solution to the wealth inequality in equal distribution of wealth problems or does it come with some baggage that could actually exacerbate that so i'm kind of wondering if maybe some upside in this higher inflation high fiscal stimulus environment that that we find ourselves in might be some increasing uh or some lessening of the wealth concentration problems that the us faces what's your what's your take on that yes it's one of those very nuanced topics and so for example one thing i highlighted in my big inflation article is that if you look at the 40s and the 70s you actually had a reduction in wealth concentration in both of those decades you actually had a reduction in wealth concentration uh uh you know uh because in many of those you know those years wages actually uh did go up substantially uh and you had a you know a large pools of capital were invested in cash and bonds that got devalued in the 40s also for example you had much higher taxes on the wealthy uh than you have now and so basically from inflation and taxation you extract it out of that wealthy class and then you injected it into uh basically uh you know you know gi like the gi bill when all the soldiers came back they got you know tons of money for education they got uh mortgages things like that uh there was a lot of money put into building up the industrial base and so partially it comes down to how productively that's spent and so the 40s were actually a pretty good example of of you had kind of this mmt type of policy we were running absolutely massive fiscal deficits uh you're monetizing a lot of those deficits but the the money that they that they did it was actually pretty productive and so it actually increased the overall productive base of the country uh we were able to kind of convert a lot of those war factories into like domestic factories at the end of the war uh you you basically educated a whole class of people uh and it was actually kind of this this this you know kind of this this this uh pretty good environment for workers uh and for the middle class and so when done well that that can be one of the effects obviously it comes down to different political philosophies how much government they want uh you know how much uh gov how much they trust the government sorry that was a kind of a higher period of trusting the government uh and it was rewarded because the government actually was reasonably effective at those policies then when you got into the 50s say under eisenhower you started to get the say the inter interstate highway system that was another good example of productive government spending a lot of the space stuff eventually kind of resulted in new technologies that then trickled out into the private sector and so that was actually a kind of a kind of the best case scenario for an mmt type of environment uh and so that's if you're trying to imagine why where some of the mmt economists get their reviews from uh that that's the type of environment where they're kind of imagining uh things going or we're hoping things go we're trying to construct things to go in that direction of course the problem is that if you don't have a lot of those you know kind of i i'd say a combination of really good forces so say certain good leaders a certain political environment that makes that kind of thing possible if you don't have that and you you kind of have the government try to do things uh they could do things a lot less productively probably than they could back then and so you risk having this this kind of big injection of capital that doesn't really uh result in a greater ability to produce things you want and therefore you kind of risk getting stagnation or stagflation uh and so that's kind of the biggest risk here so i think that there is if you thread the needle well enough uh basically it's kind of one of those things like if you're gonna have a dictator you want it to be like a philosopher king you want a good dictator right so you can actually have an environment we have a dictatorship that goes well almost like an example would kind of be singapore it's been kind of a semi-authoritarian regime but they've managed it very well it's just kind of been an effective in that approach whereas if you you know if you roll the dice you're unlikely to get that too frequently right so so more often than not when you kind of have that top-down approach you're more likely to get the the the other end of the stick uh and so i say yeah i mean putting on kind of the steel man hat and kind of you know steel mending their view you say if you have a 1940s 50s environment uh then yes that that that kind of uh you know kind of that big fiscal heavy environment could be very productive and just the question is what is the probability of that happening uh ubi i mean that's that's one of those things if you look far enough into the future right when humans say robots get so good and ai gets so good that the vast majority of people just can't out compete humans and that even like you know the history technologies that we whenever we make automation it takes away some type of job but then opens up new opportunities so you know humans were able to leave the farms and go to the manufacturing uh then when we started automating some of the manufacturing they're able to go more into service uh but if you get to an environment where say 80 of jobs can be replaced by robots and ai and you know most people don't have to work then you then you get to all sorts of societal questions like how's that going to function because only so many people can be in creative professions uh and so that opens up some of those very long term kind of political questions but i mean that's that's still i think a quite a while away and so you know if you do ubi without making sure that there's enough products and services to support that type of income uh then that's when you run into stagflationary risks lynn a large part of what we've been talking about so far in the show it has been u.s centric and we talked about how we are one of the reasons why we are we think that we are seeing so much inflation in the us is because the us put out so much economic stimulus in the last year or so how does this conversation change as soon as we include uh you know the rest of the world is this uh the same story that the rest of the world is also going through or is it different if we start to include like europe and asia and you know all non-us countries yeah there are different environments for different countries and so the the specific like globalization problem has impacted the us more than other countries uh because as the country with the global reserve currency we've kind of in order to maintain that currency we've kind of had to sacrifice our manufacturing base because you can't really have as currently structured the whole dollar reserve system is kind of based on the us running these persistent trade deficits uh and so we've had that specific type of wealth concentration and that and that uh d uh um industrialization at a faster rate than our developed peers and so europe for example runs a trade surplus uh japan runs a pretty balanced trade situation uh whereas the united states is kind of this big developed country that's running a massive trade deficit so it's not just the developed controversy emerging market thing it's really that's more about the us specifically uh europe faces their own set of problems because as as conflicted as u.s politics are in europe in some ways it's even harder because you have a bunch of different sovereign countries that have then linked their currency together right so it's like if the united states and canada had a shared currency and neither of them could just print money well then the united states and canada are always going to be like debating with each other about what to do let alone different states in the us and different provinces in canada and so europe's done that with over a dozen countries uh and so you have this you know germany wants one thing italy wants another thing and you have sovereign countries that that really kind of can't control the volume of their own currency they're reliant on the on the european central bank uh and so they've had they've had less kind of political capability to do that physical stimulus and so in in some ways that's you know the euro has held up against the dollar over the past 18 months because they increased their money supply at a slower rate but they've also recovered at a slower rate in japan you're kind of you're kind of in the middle there where you know they're not doing this the same kind of massive fiscal spending that they're doing in the united states uh but they did a little bit more than europe uh and so they've been one of the more kind of societies that is less prone to pop popularization like populist politics uh because they generally have less wealth concentration they have kind of less somewhat less political conflicts but you've also had you know obviously a pretty significant degree of stagnation there uh when you go on to china uh they're in a pretty different environment they didn't do very much stimulus uh you know they did a little bit at the beginning but then they kind of cooled that off and now they they kind of entered this cooling off period before the united states and so they've they've been kind of you know trying to de-leverage some of their uh debt bubbles uh they've been trying to go after uh say the kind of the monopolization of big tech and so they've been going through that cycle uh at an earlier pace in the united states uh some of the places we see inflation impacting the worst are in emerging markets uh and especially the emerging markets that have kind of structural issues so some of the ones that say produce commodities right they've actually held up somewhat better because they're benefiting from commodity inflation whereas if you're an emerging market that also generally is a net commodity importer that's when you run into into issues uh or or ones that have had kind of you know poorly managed fiscal or monetary regimes like argentina and turkey and lebanon and so that's actually where you're seeing kind of the most acute suffering from this inflationary environment uh because that's where you have environments where people literally have trouble getting enough to eat in some cases or just trouble kind of you know managing a business or managing a company and obviously it varies between say argentina and lebanon but you have these environments that are it's much harder to do basic things when your inflation is well into the double digits is it the case that all central banks are pretty much um reading from the same handbook on this though lynn so like to one degree or another they're sort of handling things the way the fed is or are there some countries that are doing something that's that's completely different so russia is somewhat of an outlier in that they're doing uh something different they've historically been more hawkish in terms of their you know they're trying to keep interest rates higher uh and so in russia for example you have pretty low debt as a percentage of gdp and the central bank is pretty conservative uh they're buying gold pretty regularly right so so they're kind of this this more got some austrians over there awesome yeah they i mean they stop you know it's funny because even despite all of that the ruble actually actually you know went down versus the dollar in part because you know for a while there they were impacted by oil prices going down now that the the uptick has kind of benefited from them and so they they still have structural issues with their economy but from a central bank standpoint they've been pretty hawkish they've been kind of austrian in that sense uh and so whereas most other central banks especially developed central banks have kind of gone down in the same playbook and they're just on different timetables there because they have different demographic realities so japan's kind of been ahead of the curve because they've got the oldest society and so they you know they've been more aggressive in the monetary policy sense resident europe and the fed are kind of behind them uh and then we saw you know canada and australia were a little bit behind them uh and so we've had this this kind of all all kind of going in the same direction uh and emerging markets uh you know the ones that are not kind of um almost hyperinflating but the ones that are kind of trying to manage things more more realistically they have issues where you know they know that they can't do as much quantitative easing because their currencies weaker to begin with and so they risk inflation at a lower threshold so some of them have also you know been more conservative than say the united states in terms of how much fiscal stimulus they can offer their people because they know that they they risk inflation at a much lower threshold and so you haven't really seen that kind of same you know massive fiscal deficits and then deficit monetization out of a lot of those countries that you have from say the united states or europe trying to play in this game too lin less so i mean china's money supply grew at a slower pace than the united states since the beginning of the of the pandemic so they've been doing a lot less physical spending uh they haven't really been doing qe like the united states has and is instead they've kind of been been actually kind of trying to deleverage a little bit and so they're actually on on somewhat of a different path and so you know central bank central bankers do talk to each other especially throughout the western world and with japan uh whereas you know some of the some of the emerging markets are on their own kind of approach but generally you do see a lot of coordination but it's kind of then adjusted for different realities in different countries lynn last time we had you on six months ago we titled the episode of the podcast the death of the dollar dominance and it talked a little bit about some of the same things that we were talking about today on this episode uh you alluded to the the triffin dilemma and the the reducing position that the dollar has as the dominant currency of the world now that we have actually seen inflation show up across you know all metrics how would you say that this story has evolved over the last six months since since we last checked in on it it's pretty much continued i mean that's a long-term thing so that doesn't generally have a lot of news changing in six months that's not going to tell you the dollar index is going up or down three percent based on these global shifts but we have i think the things to watch are you know especially russia and china you know what are they doing with their dollar reserves what are they doing with with how they you know they pay internationally and so for example since that last conversation we've seen even more aggressive moves out of russia to de-dollarize uh you know their reserves and and their sovereign wealth fund and to focus on the euro to focus on gold to focus on uh chinese currency and so we've seen uh you know uh between russia and china for example you know china's opposite an energy importer russia is an energy exporter used to see that that trade is mostly dollar based uh and you know we we've seen ever since especially since 2018 that start to break down where they started to rely more on the euro and more on some of their local currencies and we've we've seen that accelerate since then so the dollar continues to be a lower and lower share of trade between russia and china as well as russia and europe and so we do see that long-term structural shift away from the dollar being used to price all global energy and all you know most global trade and we're starting to see kind of a regional currency system where the euro is being used more so in in eurasia uh and a little bit less so the dollar and so i think that that's likely to to continue for a lot like a lot longer but it's not going to be like a straight line it doesn't necessarily mean you have an impact on the dollar in say a six-month period we've also obviously seen acceleration in china uh for their central bank digital currency uh and so i think that's you know that's in addition to providing them all sorts of author authoritarian surveillance state type stuff that they love over there that also potentially uh will uh you know increase the their currency's usage in some of their trading partners maybe in africa and and some of the other markets around asia that they that they do business with but we'll see in time lynn you recently tweeted out something i thought was pretty pretty interesting it was a comparison of 2018 versus uh 2000 trade relationships between the united states and china and oh yeah there it is ryan's got it on the screen right now uh and i the transition the massive transition from the world being a u.s dominated trade environment to a chinese dominatrix environment is absolutely stark it just flips from being blue which is the u.s to red being being china that happening simultaneously with the very strong push by the chinese central bank digital currency is an interesting story what story do you hear being written when you see a lot of global trade starting to become chinese dominated while china's also pushing this new form of medium of exchange with their digital yuan well i think that that those charts kind of show triffen's dilemma in one of the clearest ways possible especially the the version of tripping dilemma that focuses on the current account rather than the capital account so the initial treatment dilemma was more about the capital count but kind of the restructured trip and dilemma trade uh ever since the 1970s with the petrodollar has really been about the fact that yeah that you have the chart up there so basically ever since we've shifted from the bretton wood system to the petroleum system uh we you know basically the release valve for that has been that the united states had to run these massive uh trade deficits uh to sustain that because you know if we if we pretty much tell the world you can only buy oil in dollars which is the the the deal that the united states made with opec uh and say okay you can only buy oil and dollars well they can only do that if they have a lot of dollars and so the way that they get dollars is that the united states runs big trade deficits with them uh and so there's a there's all this international demand for the dollar that kind of props up the strength of the dollar uh and so it increases our import power decreases our export power and so it naturally hollows out our industrial base uh and and so you know depending on if if you work and say technology you don't mind that right you get a lot of the benefits of globalization without the downsides whereas if you work in manufacturing there's a good chance that over the past 25 years you got your job replaced by someone in china or someone in some of these other countries uh and so uh that's i think that that map shows uh you know basically the downside of the system we've been in uh ever since the 70s and it really kind of accelerated in the 90s that's when that's when that system really started working against the united states and china's china has played this pretty smart because in addition to benefiting from all those trade surpluses you know they they also started to say okay you know over the past several decades all these countries that ran these trade services with the united states they would then take those dollars and go ahead and buy treasuries with it so they would fund u.s deficits and so europe did that japan did that china did that but then about something like seven years ago china said it's really no longer an interest to buy treasuries anymore especially with rates you know so low so we're going to go ahead and use those dollars to buy hard assets around the world so they started making loans to emerging markets that are often collateralized by real assets like ports and infrastructure if those loans are defaulted on they go to china you know the ownership of those goes to china and so china's been using that dollar system against the united states by basically expanding their reach you know the belt and road initiative and all those sorts of funding that they're doing around the world that's basically using the dollar-based system against the united states by plowing paper assets into hard assets so that they're increasing their their hard asset reach whereas the united states is kind of hollowing out its manufacturing base and it's kind of the you know the the percentage of people that are benefiting in the united states from that that plan is mostly limited to the top say 10 of the population uh rather than the country as a whole yeah it's pretty crazy so he's like i mean i'm sure people in china read ray dalio you know so sometimes i feel like economically china is playing chess and the us is playing checkers here within in particular with its reserve currency status dave and i are actually going to have a gentleman on the podcast next week by the name of richard turin who's written a book called cash list he's lived in beijing for the last 10 years and this is all about the chinese central bank digital currency and the leapfrogging that they've done on the us banking system in terms of just raw usability for chinese citizens very easy to pay for things to transact on the network to you know fulfill get your everyday banking needs done on uh we pay and um alley chat um or sorry alipay and wechat in in china and the us does not have this infrastructure we were talking earlier lynn about sort of the the winners and the losers from inflation do you think that um if the u.s reserve currency status erodes that a lot of this winning is going to go into the rmb the digital one do you think that's the trajectory or do you see a world that is a bit more and and like maybe that will start to assert its dominance or do you see a world that's a bit more i guess um multi multi multi-polar multi-reserve currencies in sort of a basket sdr type of thing how does this play out in your mind yeah so i think my base cases that were shifting towards more multi-polar world and so a lot of people ask if the dollar loses her stat it loses its status what could possibly replace it could it be the euro could it be china's currency and the answer is no really if you look at say the united states after world war ii and into the decades that followed it was kind of a unique position because most of the world was devastated the united states was like 40 of global gdp the biggest commodity importer by far and so is more feasible to have kind of that one currency be kind of the king of all currencies uh whereas you know in previous global reserve currency eras you know even though there was often one kind of major currency it was really gold that was the underlying kind of real reserve currency and it was it just so happened that one country had the biggest trading network and was used more heavily than the others it wasn't kind of that complete lock that the united states has had really since the since the 1940s but you know as the rest of world recovered from world war ii and then also developed from emerging market standpoint we've had the united states go down and down and down as a percentage of global gdp so even though we're still significant we're much lower percentage than we used to be and it's not really feasible to maintain the global reserve status when you're that increasingly small percentage of global gdp but then if you look at europe if you look at china they're not really a big enough percentage of global gdp either in order to have say the one currency to rule them all and you know i think also china kind of saw the u.s playbook over the past 50 years and they don't want they don't want to repeat that they don't want to hollow out their manufacturing base and so china's main goal is not necessarily that they want the same structure that the dollar had over the past say you know you know better part of last century instead they mainly want part of it they want to buy commodities and things in their own currency uh whereas they don't necessarily want everybody in the world to have to buy oil with yuan in the same way that the the whole petrodollar system since the 70s is based on the premise that every country buys oil with dollars and so i think we're shifting more over time to a regional reserve currency status and you know if that if that does continue to occur you know that could be painful for the us in many ways to to kind of lose that reserve currency status or at least change its relationship with the current with the with the reserve status by basically sharing it with a couple other currencies uh but it can also potentially end this structural trade deficit situation that the united states finds itself in and basically you know we go through a period of pain uh but then if we have say a weaker currency it makes our exports more competitive again right so instead we don't run these kind of structural trade deficits it becomes more economic to build things in the united states whereas it really hasn't been for the for the better part of the last 50 years and especially the past 25 years and so obviously depending on what kind of you know if you say work in healthcare or technology in the united states you've benefited from the from the global reserve status without really paying any downsides right so your job wasn't replaced but then you got the benefits of your global dollar because if you worked in manufacturing you got some of the benefits too but you also potentially lost your job or had your wages suppressed by that system more so than europeans more so than japanese and obviously more so than china and so if that pendulum shifts back the other way you know you could have somewhat of a realignment of what parties are benefiting from the system lynn as we come down to the close of this podcast and and thank you so much for your time this has already been extremely educational for me i want to get your opinion on the covet delta variant which has really kind of come around in the news lately and i'm actually in europe right now and uh europe is about to go or at least france is about to go into actually more restrictive lockdowns because uh this delta variant has kind of just gotten out of control and meanwhile i'm also hearing just conversations and murmurings about people coming to the terms that like a double dose of vaccine might not be enough and as uh kovid iterates and and you know has more and more of its own variants that our vaccines that we thought were going to be our silver bullet are actually going to become pretty obsolete and so there's there's worry on the horizon that we actually might be in for like a round two of more restricted coveted uh environment is this something that you're paying attention to and if that does unfold how do you think that that might impact the economy as it's related to the subjects matters we've been talking about yeah my newsletter this past weekend focused on that topic because we are starting to see that happening and i've been covering a little bit of my research service that you know that we had the big spike in india for example uh and then now that that's on the downtrend but then if you look at the surrounding countries in southeast asia indonesia malaysia thailand uh you know those countries like that they had the same kind of spike that india had two months ago and you know with a pretty high death count things like that and then what's interesting is there you know you see countries like australia that you know they've had a very very they've had like two deaths in the past month but they're already seeing this you know they see the smallest uptick so they say we gotta lock everything down again uh and so i'm kind of watching a couple things i mean obviously i'm not a medical expert so i have to i have to kind of see what what the consensus medical opinion is kind of look at different sources to see what what's actually happening and then because i'm numbers oriented i look at some of the numbers based things that we're seeing and you know it's it's we have to watch this on three layers so we have to watch what the virus does then and what vaccines do things like that so the medical question then you have to watch what governments do right are they going to have a quick trigger finger for wanting to lock everything down as soon as you get some deaths and then then you have the people's reaction to those government lockdowns like are people losing tolerance uh for this because obviously if this if this cycle continues you know over and over it's not like we lock down every year for the flu right we don't we don't lock things down for the flu and so you know in the beginning when we had say the the fire the pandemic just come out of china uh we saw you know a big huge death count out of italy right so they were building like emergency hospitals to support everyone you know you could you could justify certain types of lockdowns and saying you know we don't know anything about this virus you want to slow the spread we don't know what's going on and so we're going to do a three week thing and we're going to do stimulus to kind of offset that you know that's one thing but then when you're kind of a year and a half into this uh then you know over time you're two years into this three years into this you know there's only so many times you can say we're going to lock the entire economy down to deal with the fact that there's a virus that's killing a rather small percentage of the population and so i think we're going to we're going to have politics around booster shots right so ongoing vaccinations uh some countries are kind of you know playing with the idea of making backs vaccines mandatory which opens up all sorts of uh pushback against that uh and so i think that you know this is not an easy environment and it's it's it's part there's so many layers there watching the medical consensus watching the government reaction watching the people's reaction and so i do think that that is a big risk for some of these more inflationary trades and what governments find themselves in is that either if they do lockdowns they either have to compensate people with printed money right so they don't have a big reserve of money that they're that they're pulling out from and and they have to just print it right so they print the money they give it to people that can be stagflationary right because if you're if you're halting how many supplies and services can be produced but then you're still giving people money uh then you do you perpetuate that stagflation environment on the other hand if you don't pay them you just tell them they have to lock down well then you're destroying businesses uh and you're destroying livelihoods while amazon is getting all the benefits and and so uh it's gonna be really challenging environment and over time you know people can have to learn to to live with this and and basically you know make the best they can out of it and it's it's going to be interesting to see how different countries navigate that timeline right because obviously if some countries that are more kind of like well we can only do so much we have to keep the economy opening and other other economies are saying no no we have to shut everything down uh one more time and it kind of comes down to what you know when we have election cycles we'll get these kind of glimpses into what the people think about that if they re-elect the leaders that have been doing those lockdowns then obviously there's a significant political will to continue it and if they start to vote those people out of office then you might start to get a different uh like reaction function and obviously you have different politics in different countries so for example the united states lockdowns are more on the local and state level whereas the federal government can really only kind of issue guidance and only control certain areas uh whereas other countries you can have like the top level that government lock down parts of the country so it really kind of comes down to how individual politics affect this but i do think it's a huge risk a fascinating answer you know uh i think maybe for the first time in in a bagless podcast uh we've gotten this far without actually mentioning the word crypto so that's the first but now i'm gonna mention it um so in this backdrop where we have potentially lin in the future a multi-polar polar world as far as reserve currency status we've got inflation we've got sort of covid we've got china's fintech scene like absolutely exploding with alipay and wechat this sort of thing the crypto people have an argument don't they and their argument is that the world needs a non-sovereign money system and that's kind of the base argument that that bitcoiners have made and then the d5 argument is and then we can create a non-sovereign banking system on top of this um what's your take on how that argument holds up uh over the next decade or so in this uh in this new landscape we we find ourselves in are are these crypto solutions workable do the crypto people know what they talk they're talking about is there a real solution here potentially i i think so and obviously we'll see how different regulators push back against that right because you can have people trying to save the system uh from the new entrants uh but overall you know i'm all in favor of of you know basically private money basically innovations being able to do uh what they're going to do and if other people accept it as money then it becomes money and so that's kind of been the history of money uh throughout the ages uh and so i'm certainly in favor of that and it's sort of kind of like contracts that people want to make between themselves uh you know i think i support you know i support that in almost any context and so i hopefully uh i'm hoping that we're going to see basically a large and larger uh you know digital asset space over the coming decade and that you know more of this will be transferred you know because a lot of our conversation is going back to what a policymaker is going to do uh you know is money supply going to go up is fiscal spending going to happen we don't know uh whereas if you have more algorithmic uh monetary policy then that at least gives people even if they're say they're still using a currency a fiat currency for other purposes at least they have a digital asset that they can store value in or that they can they can transact with anyone they want uh with you know without having to get permission right so i think that basically scarcity and permissionless payments and all sorts of permission let's say lending environments or trading environments those are obviously i think really good things uh for people to have access to and in many you know in many cases i find that the most pushback against that is in developed markets where they're saying well why do you care about permissionless payments or why do you care about store value isn't isn't the dollar a good enough store of value and it's like well sure in developed countries we've had less extreme taste of this as if you're living in argentina or lebanon you have to sell the idea less there because it's like well they're not going to say what what do you mean store value why do we why would we need a store of value well they obviously need a store of value and so you have that argument and then even in developed countries because we're getting this more inflationary outcome especially not just inflation but also like negative real yields so inflation that's happening while bank accounts are still yielding roughly zero percent uh you know it's easier to make the case to say hold bitcoin and you say okay it might be volatile but with fiat currency it might be less volatile but you're guaranteed to lose money and so you know say bitcoin is volatile but at least it's volatile in the up direction just as often or more than it is in the down direction uh and so i think over time you know there's more global adoption of these types of of assets rather than relying strictly on their on their fiat currency and especially in emerging markets where they just have fewer options they have fewer active less access to equities and it's really about you know the fiat currency they have their home and besides that they haven't had a lot of other ways to try to store value and offset those inflationary risks in the last year or so as a result of covid we've seen gold not do what we at least i think what we would have expected gold to have done in a highly uh you know inflationary environment with a lot of monetary base expansion would you say that the crypto world and the growth of the crypto markets and uh bitcoin specifically sucked the wind out of gold sales during the last like 18 months or so i i think partially so i think the other factor the probably the bigger factor is the fact that the bond market doesn't fully believe the inflation narrative yet and so they're still kind of banking on it being transitory and of course that the bond market is partially influenced by the fed buying bonds right so that that's kind of a complicating factor but so if you look at gold for example gold historically follows uh you know real yields which is basically the 10-year treasury minus the break-even rate and the break-even rate is basically the treasury markets forward inflation expectations over a 10-year period right and so that's measured by the difference in yields between say the 10-year yield and the tips yield the treasure inflation protected security yield uh and so the bond market is basically saying okay inflation's five percent now but we think it's it's gonna be more like two and a half percent of averaging over the next 10 years and so by that metric it's less worried about inflation uh then the the near-term indicators are signaling and so gold is kind of you know because it's a rather financialized asset it's kind of following those break evens more closely than it's following the real-time inflation numbers and so obviously that's the biggest factor for for you know if you if you just look at gold compared to those it's actually doing almost exactly what you'd expect it to where you know those break evens kind of peaked and gold peaked and then ever since you you've kind of had the real yields kind of you know come off of their bottom you've had you've had gold kind of also come off of its top and so that that's kind of one story but then i do think in terms of magnitude you know i think that gold could have had a bigger spike it might have corrected less uh if there weren't these these cryptos competing with it right so obviously you know among younger investors in particular uh you know when they say i want to protect my money against fee at the basement they go out and buy bitcoin and then they might buy ethereum and then unfortunately they might buy doge and you kind of go down the the rabbit hole of things they might buy but a lot of them are not gold and so you know you silver still somewhat popular among younger investors but but you know a lot of them had a lot of that interest has translated into uh the digital asset space more than just you know gold and silver since you mentioned uh ethereum lynn i got to ask you so it's been about six months i think since we last talked and in those six months um eth staking has risen to about five to six percent of its supply locked in the proof of stake staking contract we are less than a month out as david likes to say less than one paycheck out from the potential release of something called eip 1559 which actually ties the network usage of ethereum to eat the asset in the form of a burning ethy asset every time a transaction is committed to to ethereum i'm just curious over the last six months or so has your mental model for ethereum or ethy asset changed it all or is it is it pretty much the same how would you describe how you think about ether and ethereum at this point so still pretty much the same as i described it in january and for people that you know follow my work closely i have a research service where i update on say bitcoin more regularly and i also include some ethereum updates uh in that service and so for example you know even though i have you know concerns about ethereum in the long run i say you know for example in january i'm like if this breaks over 1400 that's a really bullish sign uh and then i kind of watched that ethereum to bitcoin ratio and i kind of monitored that over time so my overall viewpoint for this this run has been that i'm somewhat tactically bullish on ethereum uh while still having kind of questions and concerns about the longer term technical details and implementations there and so even in my january ethereum piece that was it was otherwise pretty critical one of the things that i was was pretty favorable on was eip1559 that was kind of the one thing i singled out just saying i actually think that's pretty elegant for ethereum to do and so i do think that staking and eip 1559 have been pretty good for the ethereum protocol you know over this past year and i actually had a conversation with rao pow a couple i think was probably a month ago now and basically my view was that when you have eth2 on the horizon and you're locking up uh you know with eth into that staking and then also you get eip 1559 i think that you know that can be pretty bullish for the price in a similar way that a bitcoin having you know can be can be uh pretty bullish for the price and so we've seen bitcoin come off of exchanges until this recent correction you had a brief period of bitcoin going to exchanges now they're now they're kind of back to coming back off exchanges you see similar dynamics with ethereum leaving exchanges and going into these more illiquid formats and so overall that is pretty good for the price action while it happens and so whereas you know my concerns are the fear of a more longer term rather than say six to 12 month price action so i kind of separate my how i analyze price action of of bitcoin and ethereum versus how i analyze um you know the fundamentals and as you know even going back to bitcoin for example when bitcoin broke below like say 46 000 back in may i kind of uh issued an update to my subscribers saying okay i'm still long-term bullish on bitcoin uh but we're clearly seeing a risk-off environment in terms of price and so just like when i analyze an equity uh you know there's there's one story about what the fundamentals are doing good or bad and then there's another story about what the what the price is doing good or bad and so i kind of monitor that kind of relationship over time and sometimes my my opinion on the fundamentals and price are roughly in line whereas other times i might have a difference of opinion between price and fundamentals and so i think one way i'm looking at ethereum and some of the altcoins is that i'm kind of treating them in a similar way that i would treat in equity uh and that's kind of somewhat different than how i treat bitcoin which is as a money so i think that's probably the you know if my mental model has clarified it all over the past six months it's really about treating a lot of those those platforms as equities in a similar way that i would treat say you know equities in the stock market interesting and and what's your take on the uh the crypto bull run so is this a brief downturn or uh is this going to be a a mo more sustained bear market or are we just like you know are is this going to turn out okay for crypto in the short to medium turn lynn is kind of my question so in the near term i don't know and so i've been in my research service pretty much ever since it broke down uh i've been kind of unclear about the the near-term price action while still favorable long-term about the fundamentals and so you know with with bitcoin for example i was like until this breaks over like 41 42 000 uh there's not a lot of you know bullish tactical indicators to kind of go by and ethereum i forget exactly what price target i gave but it was like until breaks over this price target you know i'm also just not super favorable on it uh whereas you know i wouldn't that that's different than say selling my cold storage stuff right i'm not selling my cold storage stuff i'm also saying like you know from a from a three to six month perspective until i see kind of price confirmation i can't really be bullish and so that is kind of separating those different time horizons whereas long term is really going to be about what what's happening with the fundamentals what's happening with regulatory clarity to allow pools of capital to go into those assets at a bigger way and so i do think that you know especially in 2021 we've had an inverse relationship between quality and price among tokens right so you've had things like doge skyrocket uh whereas you know say bitcoin and ethereum have actually gone up less than say you know dogecoin or ethereum classic and things like that uh and so basically i think you still have to have some of that froth kind of taken out from some of those periphery projects before before you can see kind of sustained rises uh and so and another thing to keep in mind is that now that bitcoin and ethereum and some of these other protocols you know the whole space is like you know big enough to be a macro asset it's more influenced by these macro uh headwinds and so you know over 2020 people were getting stimulus checks that they could pile into stocks or cryptos uh whereas if those stimulus checks dry up that's less retail money that can pour into the space uh and so i think you know you have that kind of this period of consolidation where you separate the good projects from the bad projects until you can build a base and have the next bull run and so you know unfortunately it kind of comes down to the political question of are we going to see more stimulus checks are we going to see more fiscal stimulus what's going to happen with the delta virus i think all those sorts of things can trickle into the crypto industry now that the crypto industry is big enough to be a macro asset so i'm kind of uncertain in the near term when my long term case is still is still really bullish you know specifically for uh you know watching the fundamentals over time the network effects it seems very clear from this conversation when we started the bulk this context uh this podcast has been about inflation it seems very clear from this conversation that inflation is going to impact all of our lives uh in in very meaningful ways potentially very very large ways in this future this is going to be an interesting decade to to live through i guess maybe you know closing with this question lynn given everything that we've talked about through the course of this conversation what is your best advice for listeners maybe just individual wage earners also investors listening to this podcast what would you tell them to do well i think i mean you have to hold things that you know understand first of all you have to understand what you own you have to understand how to value it uh and then i you know generally preference things that are real assets and and that can include you know digital assets right basically things that have a degree of scarcity to them uh that say fiat currencies don't so then this can be a story of the 2020s is you know things that are scarce are going to you know maintain their purchasing power whereas uh fiat currencies and bonds and things like that will be debased but from there you know obviously some some people are real estate experts some people are equity experts some people are crypto experts and so they have to kind of you know make sure that they're invested in things that they understand to a reasonable degree the other thing i would i would suggest is always kind of playing the steel man approach so i think you guys did a good job of asking the question if you were to steal man the transfer inflation argument how would you do so so until you invest investing something you know you shouldn't do it until you can still man the reason why you should invest it right so for any asset you're buying there's someone selling it and so you have to make sure you understand why someone is selling it uh and if you can answer why they're selling it basically take the smartest seller of that asset understand his or her view and then say you know what is your counter argument to that why would i buy it despite the fact that there are intelligent reasons to sell it and if you can answer all those questions that's when i think you should go ahead and buy that asset and then you know and then from there separate the fundamentals from the price so so you know the price action is not necessarily saying what the fundamentals are doing because the fundamentals can be doing their own thing or price goes around and you know anyone from the the equity world knows that over the long run especially value investors or long-term fundamental investors you know kind of the buffett approach type of things that you can have say an asset that is you know it hasn't changed year to year but it went up 30 in price it went down 30 in price and it's still the same asset doing basically the same thing but sentiment around that has changed and obviously in digital assets because you were earlier on in the adoption curve uh because we don't know the full size the total adjustable market yet there's a lot more volatility there we also don't even know their regulatory clarity yet in many countries and so you have obviously increased volatility but that still can give you more opportunities to separate price and fundamentals and keep a closer eye on fundamentals than on price fantastic advice lin uh scarce assets for this decade build expertise in a specific asset area niche steel man the arguments and then invest in those fundamentals and double down on those fundamentals when the market doubts
