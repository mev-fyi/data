[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david got a banger of a show who do we have on dimitri coffinis of hidden forces podcast one of my favorite podcasts that really spans the gamut of just a number of different topics from finance politics culture really just trying to get down to the bottom of what the undercurrents of the world are dimitri does a fantastic job of going into conversations and topics in an extremely unbiased manner and that's why we wanted to get him on the bankless podcast he understands crypto he understands our industry but he views it from the outside in and he has a very balanced perception as to how the world of crypto fits into the world around it and so on the bankless program we beat some of the same drums over and over and over again but we also need to step outside of our bubble and make sure that what we are saying actually does resonate with people regardless of whether they're inside or outside of the industry and that's why we brought on dimitri onto the bankless podcast so we can discuss what parts about the crypto world he resonates with and what parts he is still skeptical on it is fantastic to bring on an informed skeptic i think you use the word to describe dimitri as secular that means sort of not in the crypto religion as you or i might be yet he is he's very informed so he's had many folks talk about crypto on his show he's very knowledgeable about bitcoin he's even had some d5 folks on his show so he brings that informed skeptic perspective that we don't often hear in the crypto world and it helps really test our assumptions i think we had a good conversation just in general at first about how you find truth in this mess that is 2020 podcaster to podcaster and he's a great synthesizer of all of these various economic financial geopolitical ideas that was the first part but it didn't take long david until we just jumped right into the heart of things and started talking about crypto and the nation state and that's where things got i think a little bit fun maybe spicy at times but also a little bit fun because we we went back and forth on his i guess criticisms or his skepticism about crypto and we tried to talk about our perspective on things in the end i think we both opened a dialogue to future discussions like this as dimitri learns more and as we learn more about his perspective dimitri is having some crypto related guests on his podcast about the stable act which is something that's going around in the crypto conversation and it's definitely one one of the main conversations that we have with dimitri about how regulation and the crypto industry will intersect and so there's a lot of layers to peel back there and that conversation is definitely something to pay attention to and we touched on it here in the podcast so let's go ahead and get right into the conversation with dimitri but first we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you are looking for a mobile wallet to hold and access your crypto assets you need to go to argent.xyz and download the argent smart contract wallet onto your android or ios device arjun is one of the most secure ways to hold your crypto assets on your mobile device while still being able to access all the d5 products and services that we know and love arjun has enabled one tap access to all the device applications that we all use the most and recently onboarded into the argent app is the yearn vaults you can now access yield from a specific vault from iron and then wire handles the rest also new to argent is balancer and being able to supply liquidity to balance or pools and also receive bowel rewards for doing so all from your arjun wallet one of arjun's newest features is the ability to route trades and swaps through the various liquidity pools in the ecosystem ensuring that you always receive the best rates when you trade inside of argent argent has done a ton of effort into making sure that your assets are as safe as possible they have social recovery options with their guardians feature making sure that any trusted friend or family member can restore your access back to your argent wallet if you were to ever lose or break your phone and there's also some simple account features such as sending limits and whitelisted accounts making sure that your money doesn't ever do anything that you don't explicitly approve in order to see the argent while in action go to argent dot link bank list and download the app when you own crypto what really matters is the security and ownership over your assets being a part of the bankless nation means having complete sovereignty over your crypto the easiest way to do that is with a ledger hardware wallet a hardware wall is a little device that manages your private keys for you so you don't have to worry about proper private key management your ledger hardware wallet keeps your private keys private but still lets you have easy access to your crypto the combination of my ledger hardware wallet and metamask lets me store my crypto assets in the most safe way possible but still lets me easily access uniswap or all the other defy apps that i use on a daily basis if you already have a ledger wallet you can use the ledger live app to participate in some of the money verbs that we discuss in the bankless program the ledger live app is your headquarters for managing your personal crypto finance it's a great tool to manage the assets you hold on your ledger as well as receive a portfolio summary of all the assets that you have stored using the ledger live app you can buy bitcoin ether and stable coins and have it sent directly to your ledger hardware wallet skipping over the trusted exchanges and getting your assets into your control you can even use the ledger live app to swap crypto assets natively inside of the app so you never need to send your crypto assets away from your ledger to make a trade buying a ledger is like buying a fire extinguisher the best time to get one was yesterday especially if you're doing something silly like holding your crypto in a hot wallet that's always connected to the internet if you haven't gained full control over your crypto yet go to the link in the show notes and get your ledger today all right guys here we go dimitri coffinis of hidden forces podcast bankless nation we are so excited to introduce our next guest dimitri kofinas is the host of the hidden forces podcast this is one of my favorite podcasts because it's a podcast that gives you an edge by teaching you not just what's going on but how to think critically about the systems of power that structure our world it's something we touch on in bankless as well of course dimitri would describe himself as crypto curious maybe crypto adjacent but he really understands the nature of the industry while he's staying on the periphery and we wanted to get his take as someone who is crypto curious crypto adjacent and who has synthesized and absorbed so much of the hidden forces that are going on in the world today dimitri it's fantastic to have you how are you doing i'm great guys thank you very much for having me on the podcast well we are so excited and this has been a i think a really interesting year to be the host of a podcast like hidden force is the type that you do when i i'm going to start with this question what's it been like to be a podcaster trying to find truth in the chaos of the year 2020 it has been very satisfying and exciting and fun i must say i think one of the great benefits of having a podcast like this is that when something strikes my curiosity i get to as a function of my job investigate it and then bring on people who i would normally not have access to if i didn't have a podcast like this to speak to me to try to help me make sense of whatever it is that's creating confusion in me and in society yeah absolutely but like has it been a harder year to find truth have you found or that's a great question figure out like find the signal and the noise here so that's a very complicated interesting question on many levels i think we are struggling today to come to a social consensus view of what we even mean when we talk about truth when i think about truth i think on an ontological level i don't think that any of us can ascertain what the truth is you know or what reality is at bottom but we attempt to approximate it we try to get close to it through things like empirical science or epistemology and i think that these are part of the tools that i use to think critically about the systems of power that structure our world and i do that starting with kind of questioning assumptions and those assumptions are what most people consider to be the truth you know consensus thinking so for me it's actually been quite satisfying because when people's assumptions are suddenly being confronted as perhaps being wrong in such a jarring way like we've been seeing in recent years as we're going through this radical period of change it really i think opens the door for podcasts like mine to step in and really help people think critically about those issues and those problems dmitry the name of your podcast is hidden forces and so i want to talk about what what that means the through line of your podcast seems to be uh surrounding so many different uh domains of knowledge domains of information what are the things that really grab your attention and that you fit into the through line of hidden forces and why did you call it hidden forces in the first place you know i i think i understood subconsciously why i did and i i began to articulate it early on but i've i've gone through a long period with the podcast where i didn't have much time to think about all that and i've gotten more clear on it recently i think the idea of hidden forces again you know to go back to this idea that there are there are systems of power that creates structure in our world and that structure is oftentimes in the form of a narrative there are things that we we generally come to believe and the reason why i think it's so important to challenge those narratives and this is something i learned from investing which is that you know in order to make money it's not enough to just be right about the future you also need to have a view that is you know different from the consensus view dimitri i think the the way andreessen horowitz describes this is you have to be contrarian but right yeah exactly well howard mark says who's also been on my podcast before and i i strongly recommend for your listeners to hear that episode he has like in all these little funny quips and i think his one of his quips is it's not enough to be a contrarian you also have to be right exactly and it's true but in order to be right you have to be able to think critically and that means knowing how to ask the right questions it means knowing how to assess evidence it means knowing how to evaluate arguments with the ultimate goal of coming to a conclusion and forming a judgment that you feel confident enough about that you can then rely on that judgment and that conclusion to make decisions and decisions that are materially important because oftentimes your conclusions will be contradicted or you will if you purchase apple at you know i don't know what it's trading at today but you know you purchase it at x and it falls 20 that could shake you out of your position likewise if you're on a panel or you're being interviewed and your views are challenged and you don't understand why you hold why you believe what you believe and you don't have conviction and that's something else that howard marks talks about it isn't just to be right it isn't just to have a different view you have to have conviction because you'll get stopped out of your position literally and metaphorically if you don't have conviction and that's the epistemic component of hidden forces it's you know not only what do i know but how do i know what i know how can i justify what i know to myself because what you'll often find is that people who hold beliefs and then have those beliefs challenged yes if you're investing in a market you may very well and oftentimes will sell out of your position but in the rest of the world in a bigger picture what you find is that people will tend to become more wedded to their beliefs they will clutch the cross and the reason that people do that is because they can't bear the uncertainty and that's because people need certainty they need models and frameworks to structure reality because reality is in its bare naked essence chaotic or at least it appears chaotic to human beings and we spent our entire lives doing that and then again that brings us back to this point about power and structure which is that we all need structure we all have biases we all have stereotypes we all have frameworks and theories that we use to make sense of the world but when you don't think critically you're relying on other people's structures and other people's theories and frameworks and narratives to explain the world and so you empower others at the expense of yourself and that's where critical thinking is so important because being able to think critically and i think that's something that i try to do on hidden forces and i think by extension i try to help other people do when you can think critically you can come to your own determination and that's empowering and i think that is for me ultimately why these subjects and this approach is something that i've developed over the years because at a young age i found it i'm a very competitive guy i've competitively physically i was a wrestler in high school i i did mixed martial arts in college and afterwards and i loved competition i loved to know that i could hold my own and early on in my life i found that i had beliefs but those beliefs were beliefs i couldn't justify and i didn't like the experience of you know having my hat handed to me in an argument because i didn't understand or didn't know why i believed what i believed it's bad in an argument it's even worse having your hat handed to you in a market when you bet on something and you're completely wrong yeah for sure it's an awful experience and i think it really helps even if you're wrong and i've been wrong plenty and i'll continue to be wrong plenty of times understanding or having some idea why i was wrong and being able to make changes so that i can be a little better next time makes all the difference for me and i think at a network level that is what moves society forward that's empiricism that's progress we have a lot of beliefs in the bankless podcast in the bank list program and there's so much in there about thinking critically that i think a lot of our listeners can start to figure out like why we wanted to get you on to the bankless podcast in the first place because like a lot of what crypto is in its current stage and form is belief about the future version of finance in the future version of economics and i'm reminded of a podcast we did with ben hunt a long time ago where he talked about and his entire newsletter epsilon theory is based off of his theory of epsilon where you have the alpha and the beta of markets and that's just the raw facts right the raw fundamentals the numbers on the spreadsheets et cetera but the epsilon is the perception of the masses right the the viewpoint of the people and that can change and that's one of the reason that's one of the things that we are seeing nowadays at least that's from the perspective of bankless and from to the outside world we're seeing so much shift right now and some of this has to do with crypto and some of it definitely does not uh we're seeing shifts in perception as to central banks and their relationship with money we're seeing shifts in perception in our trust or distrust in institutions uh and there's just a seemingly large number of undercurrents that seem to be shifting the perceptions of of everyone right and and some of those shifts have to do with like people like paul tudor jones reviewing and reorienting their their perceptions about what bitcoin is um you know microstrategy is is a big type of topic of conversation and so dimitri before we get into the topic of crypto and how things are shifting towards crypto i kind of want to talk about like what you see as shifting in in uh in the world to me hidden forces as a podcast has this like stream of consciousness about it right like it's a thought process and you know your decisions to bring on a new guest or a new piece of content to me represents your uh belief that this is an important piece of subject matter because it represents a shift in people's uh mentality what would you ascribe to be like the big paradigm shifts of people's thoughts in in 2020 sure so by the way you guys and your audience will be happy to know that i'm going to be bringing on two people who i think your audience will be very interested to hear from to speak directly about the stable act and that's going to be i think a very exciting episode i'm going to be recording that next week but oh dimitri do you have any teases on who this oh man well i want to i um let's just say that the one person is you know there's no one better that could speak about the stable act than one of the people that's going to be on the show and the other person is someone whose business is very well known and is going to be deeply impacted by any kind of regulation of the space and it's spoken you know very thoughtfully about it so it's kind of two countervailing opinions and and i'm very excited to do that what was your question again ryan or david yeah so there's just a fundamental there seems to be many different shifts in how people believe the world to be in 2020 i feel like the legacy of 2020 is like the year that it all changed but what changed what what are the big undercurrents of the world in 2020 from your perspective yeah i mean uh well i'll just you know point out one that was recently on my radar and and was on all of our radars which is the 2020 election and i i actually brought on david shore who has been called obama's nate silver he was the guy that built his forecasting engine for the 2012 election uh brilliant kid and we spent the you know the balance of the two hours talking about this and you know really what what did the 2016 and 2020 elections tell us about the electorate because there have been very again to bring it back to the point about narratives and ben hunt's epsilon there is a conventional narrative that has been pushed primarily by leftist media outlets and uh and the democratic party about why donald trump got elected but i think for a lot of us that you know never really you know felt like it told the whole picture and i think the election in 2020 kind of bore some of that evidence out when you look at the fact that african young african-american men and hispanics actually voted in greater numbers for donald trump in 2020 than they did in 2016 which you know really doesn't make sense on the face of it also why were the polls so off and a lot of these speak to what i think is an underlying demarcation of bifurcation in the electorate separated by class i think this is the really the big story that has been missed because conventional explanations either rely on identity politics based on race religion sexuality different markers of identity or something that i've actually talked about quite a bit which has been the wealth gap but i think what's actually more interesting is something that david talks about and also one of my my guest michael linda talked about and we talked about together which is class and i think that america is becoming a country that's increasingly breaking apart by class you know there are the the non-working class lower educated more highly mistrustful people kind of living in the midwest and other parts of the country and then there are people like let's say you and me or us who have the skills to be able to perform in a modern open economy we tend to be perhaps more liberal and we live in you know coastal cities and we take in this sort of progressive largely progressive popular culture crypto is a really interesting case because you've got these strong strains of libertarianism you know an austrian economic thought but i mean i think that's really one interesting subject which is how is our country dividing really you know we keep saying it america's never been this divided but what's dividing us really and how what are the dividing lines and how can we wrap our arms around that and can come to an understanding of what that means in order to make more informed decisions for ourselves right and i think one area where that's relevant is i mention it the stable act the stable act is i think one of the reasons why it's being introduced today is because we're coming into an environment into a decade where we can expect to see higher levels of progressive legislation and a greater desire to regulate the economy to regulate society and that i think stems from the failures of the last 30 to 40 years some of which are market failures many of which are the failures of government and the failure both to regulate and to regulate properly and over-regulate so dimitri what you're saying is one thing you've you've noticed and by the way we we will get to the stable act um for the bankless audience that is by the way some interesting an interesting bill that was just put before congress to regulate stable coins we want to get dimitri's opinion on that um but while we're talking about these kind of larger trends so i think what you're saying dimitri is that we've got now two americas and those two americas are divided by by class but possibly that's a symptom of something else so you mentioned the the wealth gap so this massive wealth inequality that we haven't seen since when the 1920s 1930s is that a symptom of something else i want to bring the the topic of central banks in here so a lot of the the crypto more consensus thought would be that the part of the reason for this inequality gap has actually been the mundine printing that has gone on um since you know before 2008 but certainly accelerated after 2008 and those closest to the money spiket uh those with stocks and assets um those things inflated and just accelerated uh the wealth gap that like was already in place it just kind of accelerated that trend into the future what's your take on that thought um the idea of central banks the idea of modern monetary policy that is continuing to print more money does that have a role in the 2020 narrative in your mind yes a great question i think it absolutely does you know the central banking story is a really interesting one because you know for the most part when we look back at history it's hard to point to one particular time or period or moment where everything changed but i think that in the case of central banks 2008 really was a watershed you know it really was unprecedented in an age where everything seems to be unprecedented and that word is so often misused in this case it is in fact true balance sheet expansion was more or less a very gradual process for the entire lifetime of the fed you know for 100 years almost but 2008 we saw a dramatic expansion of the balance sheet and i think we also understand why that happened it wasn't just to arrest a deleveraging a cataclysmic deflation that was going on in the economy that was driven by reckless decisions in the world's investment banks and large commercial banks and financial system but it was also because our elite our elite institutions and our elite individuals politicians and policy makers who revolve use a revolving door between government the private sector made a very conscious decision to prioritize themselves and their own assets and their own families at our expense and i think you can think of the 2008 financial crisis as what began as a financial crisis quickly became an economic crisis and has since become a political crisis and it's become a political crisis because of the choices made by policymakers to print their way out of the problem to cover up the problem with more and more paper and in that sense they have deferred it right because that what is a fiat denominated currency other than a liability a liability of who of the central bank and so the central bank credits that fiat money to the banking system in order to deal with in the short term a problem of too much debt and too much leverage and as a result when the chickens come home to roost where are they going to roost they're going to roost back at the issuing institution which is who the central bank because it is a liability of the central bank so that brings us back into a larger narrative that i think is foundational to crypto which is that cryptocurrency solves the problem of trust in money and we've lost faith in our our institutions of money do you buy do you so a banker might say yeah but dimitri we had no other choice here come on like this is this is really the only way yeah do you do you buy that argument that's like saying like i had no other choice i had to push her onto the train i had to push her in front of the line because the outline would have eaten me yeah yeah i mean i get why why they would answer that way right and i think also it's this is where you get into really interesting research around behavioral psychology they believe it you know when lloyd blankfein says we're doing god's work he believes it he's not just saying that you know there is probably some some level of but people go to great lengths to convince themselves of things you know someone who talks about this and i think talked about it on my show as well is the great short seller jim chanos who famously helped really bring down enron when you look at people that perpetuate giant frauds they will oftentimes come to very complex rationales to explain why they're actually not bad people central banks as a religious institution is kind of an interesting concept to think about money as a religion is an interesting concept to think about as well we often in the crypto space think of money as sort of a meme this socially propagated contract between all of us where we agree certain things our money and other things are not which is an interesting subject i think i've been reading a lot of ray dalio lately as well and you talked about kind of you know central banks and bankers and kind of the wealthy class choosing themselves over other members of society as part of this ray dalio would probably argue yeah this is all part of the rise and decline cycle of um a nation-state of an empire right and so we recently put out an article this week that said uh the us is at stage five almost like you know how cancer progresses in stages like one through five but we're at stage five that's comforting right well reading dahlia these days i don't know if you've you've done this much dmitry but it's like very sobering because uh he he's looking through history and he's sort of presenting uh evidence or reasons why um the us is is uh possibly in decline and this is just kind of like monetary reserve currency is sort of the last thing to go and the next stage is stage six where he talks about revolution and and civil war i'm not sure that i'm ready to fully commit on uh dahlia's like world view or thesis and he um to be fair i mean it's all probabilistic for him too but what's your thought on on this does does all of this um wealth gap inequality and kind of the divide that you're talking about it certainly makes for a more volatile 2020s but but how does it shake out i know you've been talking a lot about the the future of the us and how other geopolitical powers um you know play into that is this kind of a an empire in decline in your mind is the nation state experiment not working out so well these days you know interesting question does dalio say that the nation state is in decline is that his thesis not not so much that would be a bit more of a bankless philosophy i would say i just wanted to check fact check you guys yeah he doesn't say that but he what he would say yeah right well well we we connect the dots there to be fair what what dalia would say is possibly um the uh america is in decline uh the the empire the western empire if you will is kind of on the the end cycle of its you know 300-year uh go of things yeah i have a i you know it's i have probably a complicated series of answers there not fully thought through one is i don't think that the nation-state is in decline if anything this is going to sound controversial i think that there's never been a more bullish time for the nation state when is it really advantageous to have a government i don't know if you guys are familiar with thomas hobbs you know most famously wrote leviathan we've spoken about it quite frequently perfect so thomas hobbs was you know supposedly a very thin frail guy i think he wore glasses you know he was scared he was a guy that was very concerned about a world of you know violent anarchy you know of war of all against all and for thomas hobbes a strong national state and this i think gets to a another point which is you know what has been the appeal of authoritarianism a strong nation state is vital and it is more important than individual liberties because individual liberties you can only have them if you have a state and if you live in in an anarchic this is sort of the i'm really summarizing kind of butchering up his thesis and so i think that we're moving into a more chaotic world and in that type of a universe a strong competent national government or the hope even or the need for a strong national government supersedes any sort of lack of trust in its competence and its record so despite the fact that elites and institutions have lost a lot of trust in recent decades that doesn't negate the fact that we're heading into a period of time where we need them more than ever and so i think that yeah i would actually make the opposite point about nation states there was one other point you made about the u.s specifically i'm curious about the u.s right is it declining relative to well the u.s has been declining right i think that part and parcel of this is the the decline or the disaggregation of the american-led international order american hegemony american power and primacy which was really the defining ethos of the rise of neoliberalism and american empire in the 1990s and that's when i grew up i graduated high school in 2000 so i literally went through my entire childhood and you know early adolescence living in a completely different world granted i did live through the cold war as in the last you know the first decade of my life but you know i didn't fully remember it very well i really started to become politically of age in the maybe the george h w bush administration i had this vision this memory of seeing a girl crying on time magazine hugging her husband or boyfriend who was going off to fight in in the persian gulf but i was you know rudely awakened to what has now become the second half of my life in the 2001 terrorist attacks and the bush administration attempted to resolve that problem to address it by what by doubling down an american empire and that went terribly wrong and we've been living i think the two biggest events of the 20th century have been not so much the terrorist attacks but rather our response to them and that primarily means our misadventure in iraq and all the blood and treasure that it's cost us and the 2008 crisis and our response to it and the 2008 crisis was in some ways a response to the 911 attacks and the bush administration's war in iraq right because the greenspan administration dropped rates in the face of the collapsing nasdaq bubble and the subsequent terrorist attacks i also wonder if our response to covet in 2020 will be another one of those defining events um i guess that remains to be seen no that's a really interesting so when you say our response to kova do you mean our monetary response i mean all of it yeah i think it's yeah and i mean it it sort of gets into you another question about that that you made about strong national government um and like kind of authoritarianism i don't know david if you have a thought on that yeah um dimitri you talked about uh thomas hobbs leviathan and and we've used the the leviathan metaphor to ascribe meaning to what's going on in the world of crypto and specifically ethereum where you know thomas hobbs uh the the belief of leviathan is that you need a strong centralized government in order to keep the body of a nation composed and we we extend that metaphor to ethereum where ethereum is a protocol but it operates as a strong as in you can't do anything against the rules of ethereum by nature and it is the thing that keeps the community economy ecosystem of ethereum composed and in a world where we are we are losing trust in institutions ethereum offers and all the protocols on ethereum offers a place for that trust to migrate to which is something fundamentally different about uh the 2020 financial crisis versus the 28 funding or the 08 financial crisis is because you know in in 2008 we didn't really have an opportunity to opt out and in you know you also talked about how you are particularly bullish on the power and of the nation state and specifically right now as a time where the zeitgeist seems to be a pro regulation right because it's we haven't had regulation in the last 30 years not anything meaningful right and so now maybe you you alluded to how now might be the time to introduce you know stronger regulation because we haven't been doing that to me and i'm pretty sure ryan too when we hear that we hear you know more authoritarianism because if we want to have more regulation more control it's it's not the right time to have more control for when it when there is an option to exit out of a system and that and that exiting means cryptocurrencies right like using different infrastructure different institutions institutions run and operated by code to opt out of perhaps an authoritarian government a government that is very happy on the trigger of regulation that's that's one of the and the perception shifts the fundamental shifts in people's outlook upon the world seems to resonate with this um at least maybe that's our bias here on the bankless program but that's kind of like our underlying thesis that we wanted to get your gut gut uh take on well when you say opt out what do you mean so if the there's parallels to ethereum and a nation state right um they're not not completely right because they're you know roads are not going to be built by ethereum you know taxes aren't going to be collected by ethereum however there's increasingly more and more places for you to primarily deposit your capital and wealth right and what a nation state is uh in its you know most essence form is a system of organizing and then also taxing wealth it's a property a nation state is a property rights management system in addition to many other things uh and that's primarily the role of bitcoin and ethereum these are property rights management systems and so it's reducing the power or responsibility of the nation state if people perceive that ethereum is a better property rights management system than the nation state people might opt into ethereum because ethereum doesn't over regulate them ethereum doesn't you know peer into like doesn't ask them to download a covid uh contact tracing application on their phone uh it doesn't ask them to do all these things that they might not want to do and to get even more concrete on that things you can opt out of right now are obviously a nation-state monetary policy so you can buy bitcoin and ether rather than a very issuance happy um you know a system you can buy ether and stake it as a bond rather than t builds you can use ethereum as banking infrastructure rather than wells fargo and jp morgan you can register a capital pool on ethereum and it's globally accessible and available and permissionless to anyone rather than registering a delaware llc so it's not taking everything that the nation state does but it is becoming a an institution and unbundling possibly some of the services that the nation state provides and and by the way maybe the nation state isn't the most efficient way to do these things nation states are notoriously expensive from a security and from a tax perspective so you know the idea is that some of these things could be unbundled but the alternative view which the world seems to be moving in is is i think exactly as you said more authoritarian state control governments it's this crypto worldview that that offers kind of the the uh alternative at least in our minds what's what are your thoughts on that and just in general i'm super curious sure i guess a few points number one i think one of the most core characteristics of a nation state is its claim to the legal use of force and you know that came to me when you i think it was i don't know if it was ryan or david we're talking about property rights management because i think that what ethereum does is not property rights management i think it's property rights accounting and accounting in general i think what's really really unique and special about these open public ledgers is that they are sort of scribes of the historical record and you can do a lot with that that's extremely important you know and that speaks to the point about trust but ultimately it's physical force the ability to enforce physically that is the basis of power and even if the ethereum ledger says that you own something that doesn't prevent me from going and physically taking it from you in the world because we all live in the physical world so i think that drawing too strong of an analogy between these communities like ethereum and bitcoin and nation states is fundamentally wrong i want to get to your second point in a second but um just uh just a quick thought on that i i think you're absolutely right that like violence at its core is the thing that we gave up to uh governments right that's that's the thomas hobbs argument essentially it's like we give the leviathan the the power of violence and therefore we are able to socially um to collaborate better and coordinate better as as human individuals um but uh it that doesn't have to be the case like so when we graduate uh when we graduate above violence there are things that societies put together like um protocols like laws like the constitution so we're not cavemen running around hitting each other and stealing our things when we're not just you know war tribes essentially we have protocols and structures that define how we do commerce that define what our unit of of money is and crypto's answer to that might be a little bit um well in the crypto world code is is law so we do have a loss system and a set of protocols that means we don't have to resort to violence and there's this defensive aspect of cryptography that we've talked about before which gives asymmetric power to the defender so if i have private keys and you don't know i have a set of of private keys uh so assume that privacy is in the mix here dimitri then there's no way for you to to crack my cryptography and steal that from me okay i would say is that those laws are backed up by the use of force not on ethereum right but ethereum exists within a legal framework so whatever money you have on the ethereum ledger is in a practical sense a claim on assets in the real world so uh the the claim the ownership of property on ethereum doesn't always have claims in real world assets like and some of the most valuable assets on ethereum are specifically not found in the real world like notably ether itself the native currency of ethereum this the right right but what i'm saying is that the only reason that those assets have value is because you live in a physical world with physical things and physical needs and physical governments that can physically take those things or physically protect them so one of those things the ledger exists within a physical world and governments which have physical force have primacy over those assets and the reason that we you know the argument and i understand that there are anarchic philosophies anarchism is a philosophy of organization i think anarchism i think works at small scale i don't know i don't see how it could work at a large scale it hasn't worked historically but the reason that we empower governments and we give them the legitimacy to use force is in order to protect among other things life and property and liberty so i don't believe that you can have a world and this actually gets to a fundamental philosophical question which is can you have a world that exists solely off of math off of a cryptographic ledger and smart contract enforcement and i don't think that you can because that doesn't stop anyone from coming to your house and killing you or you know taking your house from you and squatting in it no smart contract is going to prevent that hey guys we're going to take a quick break in the action to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless nation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to a die which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith card tweet about it when you do i love seeing people on packaging they're beautiful bankless visa cards makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store wiring is defy's first self-building project on ethereum focus on producing products for those who are interested in earning yield in d5 y earns various products are all built to suit each individual investor's preferred level of risk from various vault strategies that leverage defy tokens to the safer urn system which relies on stable coins vaults are aggressive yield farming robots each with a unique strategy that is designed to maximize the yield of the deposited asset why iron employs some of the most informed developers in d5 to keep the vault strategies updated with the various yield farming opportunities on ethereum for customers who are more risk adverse the iron's earned product may be for you earn is a yield aware dynamic money market that automatically seeks the best interest rates across the various d5 protocols and regularly migrates your deposited stable coins between the d5 protocols that are returning the best yield at the present moment why iron is a system that is just a little over four months old so things are still very much an experiment however this hasn't stopped people from depositing over 700 million dollars worth of assets into the wire system in order to find yield on ethereum perhaps the people that deposited all this money were tired of constantly making daily transactions to follow the best defy interest rates and maybe the gas fees that they were paying ended up eating too much into their profits with wire it doesn't remove the risk of these various protocols that it leverages but it does remove the overhead of constantly trying to make sure you're finding the best yield and also so that you don't have to pay for gas to switch up your assets check out the products that iron has to offer at yearn.finance that's y e a r n dot finance which they also have a nice statistics page to see what other people are doing so there there is inevitably and this is one of the the main reasons why we wanted to get you on the podcast is because ryan and i are inherently bullish on the concept of like a math driven world but just to your point you know there's a math driven world doesn't employ a police force right it doesn't employ an army that protects from other nation states however there does seem to be a balance that could be stricken where um you know in theory a nation state could could do whatever they want right because they have a monopoly on violence however we've seen nation states you know overreach uh against the will of the people and that is inherently destabilizing to a nation state and i would say especially a nation-state like america where we are founded on principles of freedom and self-sovereignty the freedom of self-sovereignty of being able to transact on a permissionless ledger is seemingly completely aligned with the values of uh what makes an american right and and one of the and it seems to be that america slowly over time not not to the whole world seem but to to select parts seems to be kind of exporting that uh values the the values of freedom and self-sovereignty um what what ryan and i think really protect property rights management on ethereum is the desire and will of the people which seem to be shifting away from offering legitimacy to uh our legacy institutions because we don't trust these things anymore especially after you know the the nation states failed us during covet especially and then began to perhaps also fail us by you know printing a bunch of money to benefit a few people rather than the many and so people what the thesis is is people are removing their removing legitimacy from the nation state and offering it to trustless institutions on ethereum and a nation state can only go so far against the will of the people that it uh has domain over before they start to resist and fight back and i think that the the resistance of the people because the people inherently i don't know i don't know how much the people in north korea are resisting you know what i mean like i think that that's also i there are a lot of assumptions there baked in there that i would question you know and also i think we have a lot further to fall than a lot of those other countries and you can stay in an authoritarian you know totalitarian regime for quite a long time before you eventually rebel if you ever rebel at all you know that's one of the interesting things about looking at history it's an incomplete data set you know so i i there are a lot of assumptions baked in there that i'm not fully on board with you know i think these systems these platforms these ledgers these networks can be important and have been important contributors i think bitcoin is a classic example bitcoin more than any other protocol decentralized protocol has had a meaningful impact on society insofar as it is it has presented a huge challenge to fiat currencies not so much materially but ideologically in the same way that gold plays a role and it's really caused a lot of people to begin to question the viability of fiat money at the same time there are strong forces that compel societies to organize around fiat money because it empowers the government and there are periods in time where people want and demand stronger government and i think we are heading into one of those periods of time and it's not the first time that we've been in this in the united states that we've gone through a period like this these are cyclical processes and so i don't think that my hope for cryptocurrency and for platforms like ethereum and bitcoin is that they can survive that they can survive the regulation that they can work constructively with regulators who will regulate them to formulate regulations that don't  the industry that allow the industry to innovate and create value and solve problems without getting you know overburdened that's my hope but i don't see it as a kind of thing where we're going to escape into ethereum and that we're going to live on the cloud or on the you know the centralized cloud i don't think that's realistic and i think interestingly enough when i listen to a lot of people in the community talk about this i think that view is partly informed by what feels like a paradigm shifting moment i think a lot of people see how digitized the society has become they look at the advancements made in virtual reality in gaming and now with the pandemic and this sort of remote work situation and they i think they over extrapolate and think that that somehow then means that we really don't need to live in a physical world the contours of the state are not just less relevant but irrelevant and i think that's fundamentally incorrect is my view so dimitri what is that what you think accounts for the major rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap it's it's kind of this store of value gold alternative type of of thesis is that what you'd attribute to yeah i think that bitcoin has found a really good niche as a quote digital gold i think that and that's partly i think as a result of the failure to live up to its original vision which was as a sensorless peer-to-peer money because that really was an amazing you know story and was very compelling to people like me and that is one of the things that first got me attracted to cryptocurrency in the first place it was the the hope that really this was a way to opt out that we would be able to opt out of fiat money it's obviously proven much more complicated than that and you know i know that there are layer two solutions that are being implemented and being developed but to my knowledge those are still you know a ways away and it's not clear that they'll ever be really viable insofar as sustaining the kind of security promises that bitcoin initially promised while at the same time enabling the kind of speed and processing capability that you would need in order to operate at scale but i think the digital gold narrative is a powerful one but the thing with digital gold is like gold for example is a ponzi scheme it's a pyramid scheme largely not entirely because there are fundamental uses for gold it can be used in in electronics it's used as jewelry which is not really a ponzi scheme there's i think you know underlying attraction to that but you know fundamentally for the most part most of gold's value is ponzi value it's based on a conviction that what i buy it at the price i buy it at will be lower than what i can sell it to you for that it's going to keep going up over time and that's why i buy it otherwise people wouldn't buy gold and bitcoin people buy bitcoin for the same reason primarily most people buy bitcoin because they have an expectation or hope that its value will continue to rise and what's interesting about the bitcoin community and i'm not talking about traders and sharks that come in and out that trade on volume and buy and sell and i think it's kind of strong to a point that either you or ryan or david made earlier about religion it's got a strong religious fervor and one of the important sort of doctrinal forces in bitcoin is the notion that you should huddle and you hold on hold on until the rapture until the apocalypse until you know you're brought to heaven you're given your 40 virgins and i think that is again also for me that's not a particularly compelling vision and i don't know how sustainable it is so i guess i don't know if i'm really answering the question i might be meandering now but it's kind of a way of me saying that i think for bitcoin to graduate it's got to become more than just this for lack of a better word pyramid scheme i don't know how i don't know how you guys feel about that i i a couple comments there so you know one is uh i think that's a super interesting way of characterizing it uh the your comment about um this peer-to-peer cash thing being the original vision for bitcoin like i completely agree right but we also think uh on bagless that that vision in the wider crypto is not dead in fact it can live in places like ethereum where you have layer two and you have the ability to create stable coins and this sort of thing and you have scalability of of kind of the base layer infrastructure but maybe we can get back to that i i'd love to go into more detail on your um uh description of of bitcoin as a as a ponzi scheme and his gold as opposed to i'm gonna get so in trouble for saying yeah actually so so would you be surprised to know so would you be surprised to know that that um i and i don't want to speak for david but like i probably agree with you like i wouldn't change the i might change the the word ponzi scheme to ponzi game which maybe a pyramid game type of mechanism but i guess my my counter question to you dimitri is like isn't that what money is in general right peter calls money the bubble that never pops right in the boat like what is money uh naval uh um evol harare in in his book sapiens uh calls money a shared myth right yeah that's what it is it's a it's a shared meme that we all um totally yeah what what do we want what do we need as money well i want to have the money that you think is money and that the rest of the world thinks is money and there are some monies that are in different stages of development and growth there are monies that are new and have small networks and not everyone trusts and so if you choose to buy those monies you're kind of speculating that that money will be thought of as money by the rest of the world maybe that's a bit more what what bitcoin is and then when that happens at the nation state level with something like gold you get things called the gold standard in in the 1800s where nation states were playing the the uh ponzi game if you will of saying like well england has just switched to the gold standard so we better do it we don't want to be like china and the last one's left on the silver standard do we um so that's my like the more fundamental question is well when you think about it more deeply dimitri like isn't money just a ponzi game and importantly the distinction between scheme and game scheme alludes to somebody is going to like quote unquote like pull the rug right whereas game is something that everyone chooses to opt into and to play more more or less implicitly or perhaps explicitly understanding that this is a game to be played and when everyone plays the game well that's no longer a game no longer becomes a game it graduates so i have a lot of interesting thoughts about this where to start so i've heard this discussed often in crypto it's a really fascinating approach to trying to bootstrap money which is basically saying hey look money's just a myth the dollar is just a myth we just generally believe in in it it's a consensus narrative i would argue that that's not entirely correct because i think fiat money is not entirely a myth right it is actually the power of the state to enforce it as money which makes it money and then i think that there are myths on top of it that give it value or give it you know much more value than that but let's talk about like money as a sort of communal not enforced consensus yes it is mythology and i think what i see in the crypto community which is interesting is this kind of wink nod thing like hey we all know this is but like my is better than your and so like we're all just gonna like you know pump our here and then eventually because we're so religiously fervent we're such devotees that we're going to convert more and more people into our faith and once we get enough people then you're going to get the fomo i don't want to be left out of the gates of heaven right i don't want to be you know on scorched earth and this is very much the ideology what fascinates me about crypto among other things that bitcoin actually specifically is the extent to which this is true i noticed recently that sephidine i didn't know this he was a a carnivore which i didn't know what that was either actually to be honest but i saw that he had apparently someone who was a follower of his had adopted a carnivore diet and he developed some sort of bowel disorder which was a result of the fact that he was not he was not getting enough fiber which is like uh duh you know like you shouldn't be just eating meat maybe some people with extremely short you know intestines but for the most part human beings need to eat you know we're omnivores anyway and so you know he tweeted at sephora dean and safadeen was like no you idiot basically you're not doing it right you're not eating enough meat you weren't you know he found some way in which um this person was not you know dedicated enough to this discipline and what's interesting to me is that this carnivore diet that i discovered was actually something that was spreading generally in crypto and i think that you know it might just be sort of coincidental but i do think that there is a strong adherence the culture adheres to very basic ideologies i saw this in the case of a prominent podcaster who when he first came into bitcoin sort of adopted austrian economics and tried to figure out how to make austrian economic theory work with his conception of the world he was having difficulty doing that and the reason he was having difficulty doing that is because austrian economics is not a sufficient explanation for the world and for economics which is again this is the point about critical thinking but i think that that what you are seeing overall in bitcoin in order to bootstrap this mythology is you're seeing a strong adherence to ideology that feels very religious and that's the overall mechanism in the community to get the value to a place in the event that it's just digital gold and the event that we can't really create sufficiently robust layer two solutions to offset the need for you know fiat money and if fiat governments can't actually enforce the value of their currencies to get the value to a place where where it can actually be it can graduate from being a game to being the real thing well my first question on that is is it working i mean we have paul jones yeah right yeah yeah we have um publicly traded companies adding to their balance sheet we have the block uh the blackrock ceo eight trillion yeah in terms of uh assets under management say there might be something to this particular right larry fink larry thanks so guys this is this is actually the more interesting part of the discussion right you know i was on i was i did interviewed i mentioned i had jim chanos on my show not long ago and when we headed into the overtime someone had texted me a tweet had shared a tweet by ray dalio and it was something like i think i might have missed something about bitcoin i laughed so hard when i was when i read that the gym channels well did you read all the replies of all the people in crypto say here's what you missed sure so we can talk about it yeah sure man um well paul tudor jones an interesting character a really smart guy open-minded guy i think it would be interesting to see if stanley drucker miller gets converted those two guys are very close ray dalio is uh much more of an institutionalist than those two guys i think yeah so to get to the larger point i think it's fascinating to see this this is where we go back to the question about i said at the very top of the show when i had howard marks on he said it's not enough just to be contrarian you also have to be right and you also have to have conviction and i think that what you see in these cases for someone like ray dalio tweeting i might have missed something is my convictions are shaking and as the price goes higher they shake more it's like that scene i'm a huge nerd i used to watch among so many nerdy sci-fi things i used to watch star trek and in star trek six when uh sulu commander sulu was now a captain and he actually was captain of the excelsior i think the excelsior was the name of the of the ship i think it was the excelsior and he was flying in to you know assist captain kirk who was fighting the klingons and the ship was just rattling and it was rattling and it was going about to come apart and i think that's what it feels like for people who lack conviction or whose conviction begins to get because all of our convictions become challenged as the price moves against us and i think that that's what bitcoin has that's extremely powerful besides this community which is ultimately and the platform the network and the math behind it and the cryptography is also the price you know as much as i hate the casino culture vibe that grows around bitcoin as the price escalates i cannot deny that the single most important thing for driving adoption and for making it really graduate is the price the higher it goes and eventually if it could just reach escape velocity in that price and convert enough people then the people that are making the laws are going to regulate it in a way that's beneficial to holders of crypto so the pyramids the pyramid game works that's the thing that's so i'll just say this one more thing this is a thing that's that's that makes bitcoin unique theoretically if it succeeds it is the first attempt to institutionalize a ponzi scheme it is the first time in which the ponzi scheme doesn't end and it just becomes the new de facto reality the new de facto standard this is the explicit strategy that many of like the the deepest bitcoin extremists verbalize they they understand that number go up is bitcoin's best marketing tool and that also like bitcoiners can be can be anyone and that can include people in government because there is an incentive to hop on the ship and then to regulate bitcoin into existence into in it get bitcoin as an infrastructure stitched into the world because they are bag holders that are incentivized to also contribute to the ponzi but and here's the thing right so if that is uh bitcoin's you know best if price go up is its best marketing future you know what it's second best is to me dimitra i'd like your thought on this because this comes full circle to our conversation about central banks and authoritarian governments the second best is when a friend of mine receives a check from the government for a few thousand dollars right that's that's helicopter dropped to him essentially and he says unconditional and he says wait wait a second where's money really come from i thought this stuff was scarce you mean they could just print money at any point in time and of course crypto has a meme for this money printer go burr money works if people fiat money in particular works when people don't think about it too hard but when you're thinking about it now yeah when you're air dropping thousands of dollars to them when you have modern monetary theory that's that's crypto's second best uh tool well here's my question to you guys when did both of you first come to this realization and your your mythology around fiat currency broke it's a long long process i would say there's never any one particular aha moment um i mean i got i got into crypto in the middle of 2017 and my learning about crypto hasn't stopped so i can't actually pin it down but um you know i would say sometime between 2017 and 2019 my ideas have largely formulated around this this thesis it also starts i think for a lot of people start for me this way is at uh oh it's worth a shot you know it's like uh probabilistically will this thing become global money you know what's what's the probability of that and what's the price right now and what's the total total market cap if it succeeds maybe a lesser version of that is what's what's the total potential market cap of like the the gold market or the nation is it worth a bet that's where a lot of people start i think dimitri and that that's kind of where i started with things i think that yeah actually moving us away i'm taking over the interview i don't want to do that we love this conversation i don't want to do that i'm moving us away now if that's all right from the initial question which is when did you disabuse yourself of this mythology to the earlier observation about china using bitcoin or other countries using bitcoin and how that relates possibly to gold i think that's where bitcoin's opportunity to actually become digital gold is because it's not enough simply to go up if there's a consensus among global governments and this is why bitcoin actually can do better even though i said i'm bullish on governments in this world which i am i think also the same type of a world the multi-polar world is actually bullish for an independent monetary standard so you get it no one nation has the ability to impose that standard or the network effect to impose that standard and there are there are political incentives and rationales by competing nations to adopt an independent standard because with adopting an independent standard what you also do is you get an influx of capital and so if the united states decides to ban bitcoin within its borders and a lot of people own a lot of bitcoin they may decide you know what forget it i'm just going to move to china i don't care if it's not it doesn't have all the bells and whistles you know but i'll just i'd rather be in china and i could be rich because i've got all my capital on the on the blockchain i don't have any of it here so i think you know i think that's also a plus for bitcoin and for ethereum perhaps yeah one way we've used to describe that concept is basically the world in a world of of multiple sovereign powers it has to embrace the most credibly neutral monetary policies and monetary tools and even blockchain tools and by credibly neutral it just means the ones that none of the their their competing rival nation states can actually control right so it's kind of the reason why we're very bullish on um governance light type of protocols right where you can't really turn the dials and no one has complete control over it um it's it's kind of like tcp right that that's the the underlying protocol of the internet and everybody uses it and they use it because the us doesn't have control over it uh china doesn't have control over it it's just a dumb communication protocol that's kind of what we need for monetary standards and and even financial standards like ethereum is is something that is outside of the nation-state apparatus can't be controlled by a single nation state but ryan you will agree that despite those standards china has been able to exert its influence and exert complete control over the internet within its physical dominion totally agree yup no complete control well so there is there is a different um i think you'd agree with this david there there's a chinese internet there's a western inner there's like multiple internets yes but david you know if they want to turn china into north korea they can do it they're allowing enough internet to suit their interests if they wanted to ban it entirely they could do it because it comes with costs doing that you know and the interesting thing about that though is what's the check on china for western democracies it's to promote a more free internet right that's kind of the way you can challenge the authoritarian vision of the internet at least now i hope that's going to be the case or else you know we have multiple competing authoritarian governments and not a lot of freedom of the people well i would say what i would actually say is i kind of flip that on its head i don't think because it with the way you phrase that presumes that the goal a non-authoritarian government's goal is to thwart an authoritarian government but i actually think that the goal is simply to defeat the other government regardless of its ideology and so i think unfortunately it's i think the opposite is true the more totalitarian governments exist the fewer rights that individuals have in different parts of the world the less incentive the united states and western liberal democracies have to uphold their previous standard of liberty it becomes a race to the bottom and we've already seen that we've seen that here in the u.s so is that where the us is headed in your mind i think yeah so that's like one of my primary fears this is the double-edged sword of government you know when i when i was you know i've gone through multiple stages of personal development when i was younger during the bush years i really adopted a strong progressive view of the world and a progressive understanding of why we had financial crises why we were developing you know large gaps in our levels of wealth and equality et cetera et cetera and i pointed to deregulation and the whole period of the late 70s or 80s 90s but then the financial crisis happened and i was like wait no never mind i had it backwards it's these guys are the problem they're stealing all our money and our currencies are pure and and i became you know i adopted a lot of these other alternative ideologies i've come to a much more middle of the road approach i think that you have to look at these things with nuance and so there's a double-edged sword with government we need the government to impose for example i believe strongly in this environmental regulations of course they can go way overboard and often do or impose the wrong types of regulations but i think we want to have national parks we want to be able to protect the sea the air because these are places where companies and firms externalize costs because they don't have a price in the marketplace but at the same time governments can and do often act in very aggressive dangerous ways and edward snowden and glenn greenwald are well well aware of that so i do worry about that guys and i think that as we disassociate more and more from the physical world that also i feel like becomes even more dangerous because in some ways we kind of enter this dreamscape metaverse and in that world i think people can quickly find themselves enslaved without knowing it yeah there's no bill of rights yet for the metaverses there no no and the tools that that operate in this world are very good at their coercive tools they guide us and steer us and prod us in directions outside of our conscious awareness i mean that's how these tech platforms operate that's how facebook makes its money and they're becoming better and better at that and i do really worry about how our our democracy can survive our systems of government which depend on and assume human agency how can they survive in such a world and the answer is they cannot survive in such a world and so in order for us to survive and for them to survive before we get to that full expression or to the critical threshold we need people to use among other things regulation to rein in in this specific example these tech companies and their use of these business models in order to protect the viability of the systems of government that can check their power in the first place and i know that that can be controv a controversial opinion to take in the crypto community because so many people really are you know wedded to very narrow you know models of explaining the world and they're not prepared to leave those models because it's scary to them and that's exactly why we wanted to get you on to this podcast to have that conversation because you know bankless we we beat the drum on a very few number of very specific theses and getting somebody's perspective from the outside is is really really important to check ourselves right we want somebody to come check ourselves and you've definitely done that on the podcast thus far and i want to get that conversation uh continued into the world of defy you had vance spencer from from framework on the hidden forces podcast and it was one of my favorite podcast episodes that you did and it was insanely well researched and i kind of want to ask about the feedback that you got from your audience about that episode if if that was if there was anything there that was surprising to you or or what oh just the overall the nature of the response from from that podcast and then also uh want to turn to what your take is on defy like what is the value proposition of d5 what does d5 mean to you and how do you kind of fit it as a model into your head yeah i think that there was a positive response among there was no negative response there was a a positive response i think among people who primarily weren't familiar or weren't particularly they might have been familiar i mean in a lot of cases people that own ethereum and might own some of these different erc20 tokens like snx for example they don't actually understand the underlying technology or they understand the business models or how they work so i think in those cases they were very happy and excited that i covered it you know when i wrote my the intro that i did for that show was not my first intro my first intro was actually pretty negative but i felt like after i wrote it i was like well this is kind of shitty it doesn't because i feel like it didn't accurately represent my respect for you know what they were trying to do and by kind of focusing on everything i thought that was kind of incomplete and half baked about it and in that sense i thought maybe it's a little too cynical too i often try and check my cynicism i think that there's promise in all of this stuff but i think that it's the hype it wakes exceeds the promise and i think that defy is you know a perfect example of that i think that it's primarily used for gambling i think snx is a great example of that it's a derivatives platform and the advantage is that you can gamble unencumbered by regulation and you can innovate unencumbered by regulation but what is it used for primarily it's used for gambling and there are huge risks embedded in that when i look at what's going on in d5 i feel like people are just recreating the traditional financial system with all the same problems i don't actually see something the innovation that happens in defy is all user-based it's all about like the consumer experience that's what people mean when they talk about innovation and defy i don't see innovation in terms of making a more robust safer financial system that can help expand i mean is the issue even that we don't have it often i'm often confused about this because you know even if they could expand credit is that the problem that we're dealing with right now that we don't have enough credit i mean again i think i think bitcoin solves a or potentially solves a real problem in the immediate term despite its shortcomings as a peer-to-peer currency in that it has been a good store of value and in the world we're living in today people need a place to store their money because you know winter is coming and so i don't mean to like on defy and that was what i felt i was kind of doing in my initial intro to it but i do think that it's got a long ways to go before it can prove its value and i think a lot of the rhetoric and high-minded rhetoric around it doesn't meet the litmus test for you know the  indicator i have a few thoughts on that dimitri so like uh one i i think you've got like a a really interesting and good take in many ways on d5 as it is today um one thought i had is when you're describing kind of the speculation uh i don't think david or i would deny that there is rampant speculation in defy uh there absolutely is and there's always been rampant speculation and even something like bitcoin and ether of course the nature of the industry it's the nature of the industry but but not just the industry of all industries as they grow up i mean this is the nature of the 1990s internet this is the nature of uh settling and going out west on the frontier uh why did people move from the eastern elite coast because they were people without a lot of opportunity on the east coast and they wanted to go find gold so they so they'd set off an oregon trail west uh you know it's it's the nature of railroads um carleta perez is uh is an economist who kind of talks about this is when new industries are getting born there's this period of rampant speculation everybody outside of the industry it gives many people a bad taste in their mouth as it's being developed because they look at it and they see all the speculation they don't see the real promise but through a series of boom bust cycles that promise is slowly realized and the economy is is built up and there are some interesting things that you can do right now that aren't speculative in nature in d5 that you can't do that you couldn't do previously so i think of an ethereum address for instance it's like a bank account that no one can shut down so how do you get a bank account in in in the us or how do you get a bank account if you are in a country like argentina or or venezuela um like there's a massive amount of unbanked people well if you can just have an internet connection and create an eth address well now you have a bank account that's plugged into this global financial system which is the the ethereum ledger essentially you can do all sorts of things you can trade stable coins for instance you can move money from one place to another if you don't have access to a good money source uh you can trade from like different assets you can get exposure to the s p 500 if you want you can start to program against the system without asking anyone's permission so it becomes a sort of internet of money where it's completely permissionless and open and available to the world especially a world that doesn't have um a strong robust banking system so it remains to be seen i think it's a little early and i i bet you would you would take that view too uh that um it's a little early in in d5's cycle but that it maybe the speculation that we see that that's kind of rampant now that turns some folks off that's not going to be the final state in the end the internet produced a lot of value for the world but there was a period of time where it was just like oh my god that's like this is what yahoo stock is really just you know banner ads and you know very little revenue and being propelled by these bubble companies looks like a scam right what's your take on that yeah so first of all i mean i generally agree with your your framing of the boom bust cycle of the business cycle but i don't i would take issue with your interpretation of the internet and the railroads as being analogous to what we're seeing today in defy because you know the primary use case of the railroads was not trading railroad stock and the primary use case of the internet was certainly not trading internet stocks you know there were underlying businesses that were creating real value first that people were experiencing before they began to become excited about the value of the companies that provided the services so none of those industries were explicitly a recreation of money and value which is what sets this industry apart and perhaps why there's so much outside speculation yes that is a very good point but i guess two observations ethereum has graduated beyond being money it's supposed to be a a smart contract platform engine a touring complete global computer and i think a lot of that rhetoric again does not match up to what the use cases are are which is they are highly speculative and it's not clear to me how all the money that's pouring into defy is going to you know maybe it's because i'm not plugged in enough and that's perfectly possible right because i'm although i do deep dives when i have guys like vance and michael on or when i have you know vitalik on i spend most of my time on the periphery right and i'll circle in i'll dive in i'll come back out so maybe that's why i'm not really seeing the road map and because i'm also focused and i went through a long period of fiery baptism of trying to really understand the limitations of ethereum the limitations of bitcoin but i would also kind of ask a larger question and this is where i've i think become somewhat disenchanted with the crypto ecosystem which is that i initially came into it because i had this sort of starry eyed view of it and i was i'm a bit of a romantic in general and i was drawn in by these sort of romantic visions and ideas and i adopted a lot of them early on but what i would ask is what is the problem that cryptocurrencies that defy that bitcoin fundamentally as an ecosystem what are the fundamental problems or the fundamental problem that they seek to solve and what are the fundamental problems that society faces because i don't know that those two things actually coincide i do think that bitcoin's initial observation that we need to have a form of money that is you know independent of governments or that isn't co-opted by governments who have the ability to use it towards their own and is important but that's just become everything and that's just not enough for me right it wasn't enough for me either but like how i would answer what what problem does this solve in general crypto it's disintermediarying uh intermediating banks basically it's a self-sovereign so if bitcoin is uh self-sovereign store value ether is an ethereum is a self-sovereign store value plus banking system plus but we know that that's not true because as we know now these systems are going to require multiple layer solutions in order to operate and so what are you doing if not creating an entirely new financial system that looks just like the old one what's the difference between defy at scale and the modern banking system other than one settles on ethereum and the other settles at using you know a system of clearing houses operated and controlled by a central bank so and the through line here is what and one of the first conversations that we had is is that there's this paradigm shift in people's perceptions in the world right we are distrusting institutions we are distrusting our banks like the the the central bank has lost its close the emperor no longer wears clothes we distrust our government and with the fundamental problem for me that that define ethereum and bitcoin that that they that they all provide for the world is a new place to deposit your trust and so there is trust that is lost in the legacy world and it's now it now it doesn't know where to go but bitcoin and ethereum and all these d5 protocols while they may seem like speculative toys now every single uh d5 protocol that we've interviewed on the bankless podcast and and even the ones that we haven't the common problem that they're always trying to get right with their protocol is the removal of trust and while while we like call bitcoin and ethereum as like these property rights management systems or these ledgers what they really are are trustless institutions they are trust coordination layers in a world where we are losing our trust in our previous institutions because of the generalized mismanagement by messy humans we are gaining trust in these protocols that operate by code and to me that is the fundamental truth of what this industry is solving is the trust issue which is an a an issue as old as humanity itself and that's why i think there's so much speculation and gambling going on is because while i don't think a lot of the people participating in these markets explicitly understand this to be like a trust revolution people still know people still know about the potential upside of a new money like bitcoin or a new property rights management system trustless institution like ethereum and dimitri if all of that sounds uh a bit too abstract for you right um uh he here's a few things that could be interesting uh one is i would encourage you at some point you know maybe maybe get some holiday time or something go download a mobile app called argent which is basically a venmo type of experience on a decentralized finance protocols where there's no intermediary involved that's one thing you could do and then another dm me and i'll send you some dyes so you can play with it okay well there you go david if you send me if you send me money i'll i'll do it i will send you money i'll take your money i'll say if you don't mind magical internet money we call it money i don't know but the the second thing i think would really pique your interest is if at some point you get an opportunity to talk to hayden adams no relation to ryan john adams myself but he helped develop a protocol on ethereum called uniswap and the reason i think that uniswap is interesting is because in 18 months you know like you know the coinbase story obviously a large crypto bank developed on top of ether and bitcoin allows people to speculate right allows people to trade right um uniswap was built on 120 000 i think even less than that on a grant by one developer his first development project he coded a automated market maker embedded in code put it in put it on ethereum and recently it started doing more volume than coinbase so a team of like now it's more than one developer it's like 10 developers just out competed in a thousand plus person institutional company just with code on ethereum so like there is also a massive efficiency gain story that we we i think we'll see uh coming to the table in crypto in ethereum and it's just encapsulated in that way well all it does is match buyers and sellers in a liquidity pool through an algorithm and it turns out that's more efficient than you know the the 12 stories of jp morgan building or even a coin base that's kind of the power of d5 to me so those two things are some things to make it may be more concrete for you as you continue the exploration of this space no and i'm familiar with unit swap i i studied it a bit uh in preparation for my conversation with mance and michael and i i do think that decentralized exchanges are one of a number of promising use cases like again i don't mean to suggest that there isn't promise here and i don't mean to suggest that crypto is not an important evolution in the progression of the internet and hopefully a much bigger revolution than i even think at this very moment because as i said i've gone through different stages of sort of thinking about how far this can go and how big the promise is but i do think again my point simply is to say that what i often find when i dig into a lot of these projects is that the hype is vastly exceeds the underlying reality and that's been the case the entire time could you can be convinced that that's actually a feature not a bug you know that kind of opens up another can of worms which is that if it's a feature then again it brings us back to it being a ponzi scheme david we almost had him look dimitri david's gonna send you money so if nothing else it'll be useful to get money from your podcast or friends i'm very happy to do it i'm very happy to do it under the guys that it is for the purposes of learning as opposed to you paying me for coming on your podcast which is of course of course you know a funny story i'll tell you guys real quick i had a guest who came on the podcast tom burgess and he's a journalist for the ft or he was a journalist for the fd he may still be but he he's written two different books the most recent one of which was called cliptopia and it was about the world of dirty money and at the very end he said you know i won't tell your listeners that you know you promised to pay me a very large sum for appearing on your podcast and we both we both laughed and then i got a very long email from a listener who was very disappointed to hear that i pay my guests oh no i was i was like wait i was like you have to be kidding me like was this not the most obvious thing in the world that this is a joke well i mean a few people are going to miss the joke yeah just to be clear like you know we're joking here yeah absolutely um all right dimitri one one more subject we want to cover which is uh your take on the stable act itself um so maybe for folks that don't know would you be able to summarize that and then um give us give us your thoughts sure so um i did read through it's highly legalistic i'm not a lawyer i hate contracts they drive me nuts so i did pull out some interesting you know observations but i think the one that stuck out the most was actually not necessarily even in the the agreement explicitly so much as it was what something that one of the authors of the bill said on twitter which was that at the end of the day node operators are responsible for what what transactions get processed on the network and i i thought that was very interesting and i thought it was actually also accurate in the sense that if the government does want to regulate at all costs let's say ethereum or bitcoin legally they can make the argument and they can make the argument to hold responsible the node operators in the same way that napster held the government or whoever it was that was i guess it would be that would be the government held responsible the computers that were doing the file sharing of music on napster and the selective prosecution that came along with that i thought that was one of the really interesting kind of points but i can't claim to be an expert on the wording of the regulation but as i said i am as a result of that this is how my process works as a result of my peaked curiosity i have brought on invited on just the person to speak with me for two hours on this and i look forward to doing that next week yeah and i think folks should tune in to that it's um it's super interesting i guess you know maybe i i don't want to speak for the crypto community but the the take from most in the crypto community is this is this is a really ill-conceived bill that is not actually even achieving its stated purpose and i think part of the stated purpose of course of this bill and by the way it's just a it's a draft bill so you know the chances of this actually making it through and kind of becoming law uh maybe your guests could comment on that uh when you have them on dimitri but they seem kind of small to me um but the the purported purpose is to is consumer protection basically and specifically uh low-income folks moderate income folks right people uh who are possibly minorities i think this has been part of the the argument uh very interesting because this group of people has had trouble uh facing discrimination with the the banking apparatus in the us but as far as like we were aware most people who use stable coins to be honest dimitri are um crypto geeks like us you know they're they're not they're not the uh yeah i also don't think that like quote low-income folks whatever they mean by that because you know there's a lot of like verbage that's super popular yep within democratic circles and i know this is being put forward by a a strongly progressive democratic congresswoman or senator i don't think this is the primary concern of low-income folks so i think you know i i want to get i'll keep an open mind and this isn't even the primary point of the discussion that i'm going to have but you know i i i wouldn't ascribe too much value to the claims that this is why this right so then the question the crypto community is asking so if if if the if not that then why like so why is it is it because lawmakers aren't quite understanding like this technology it's because they're trying to get ahead of something is it because there's some like because part of the part of the bill as i understand it is that anyone who issues a stable coin be that a d5 protocol or be that a group like coinbase or you know center consortium that has usdc they have to uh become a bank they have to have a bank charter in which to do that which again weird because the stated purpose is to get um members of the vulnerable population in america outside of the yoke of banks weird to to make any stable coin issuers be a bank but that aside what do you think is the purpose of this thing well i really don't i mean i have to be honest i i'd be purely speculating i don't know what the purpose is and that's a great question it's one i want to ask my guest but i don't i wouldn't go so far as to say that the authors of this bill don't understand crypto i actually think that rohan gray for instance seems to be quite knowledgeable actually you know i've i've read some of his thoughts he's also a strong advocate of mmt which is a school of thought that i've investigated i've put some level of attention to over the years and i've struggled to really find any i mean i think it has an interesting descriptive component to it but as a prescriptive ideology i think it's deeply flawed and highly political but in that sense what is economics it's a political science it's not a physical science so there are political objectives you know and i think this bill is probably part of a larger ideological effort to put strict regulations around money and finance i don't think it's just about crypto this bill may just be about crypto but i think that the people working on it and the people introducing it are interested in much larger much broader financial regulations and this is just the tip of the iceberg it draws out maybe the sort of the question we could uh we could kind of end with here is do you think that crypto and the nation state are on some sort of inevitable collision course interesting crypto in the nation state i would say yeah maybe to a degree yes i think also crypto and people the masses are on a collision course guys you know the gold standard was deeply unpopular in the late 1800s it was not something that the mass of people wanted they particularly those who owed money debt holders of course people hold money also primarily farmers in the midwest exactly but ultimately what gold really was was an expression of power vested in the hands of the people who owned it and the people who trafficked in it and i do think that as crypto becomes bigger the value of the currency becomes greater the price increases and more and more of the world's value accrues to the public ledgers like ethereum and bitcoin the more ire discontent and will arise from the masses of people who simply don't own any of it and i think also the difficulty of governments to operate the types of programs that they will need to operate in order to assuage the voters who are pissed off at them primarily will compel them to regulate it and i think this is the kind of interesting nexus and complicated stew that ultimately independent crypto organizations and think tanks will have to navigate and i think to the extent to which the bitcoin and the ethereum community and other cryptocurrencies will be able to be successful in this environment will depend on the richness and competence of their intellectual communities and the ways in which they can organize to lobby against this type of regulation and i you know i think there are a lot of really brilliant people in bitcoin and in ethereum i actually think again this is just my perspective from where i stand i think there are distinctly two different cultures in bitcoin and ethereum i think that ethereum has much more of a builder mentality it certainly is not as ideologically right-wing as bitcoin certainly and i don't think it's as philosophical as bitcoin and i think the bitcoin community has a stronger strain of cultural philosophers and i think that actually bodes well for the entire crypto industry because i think a lot of those people are best positioned to try and make the case but i think of course you know there will be people from all different walks of life who will get involved i think that's the the best hope for the industry to be able to mount an offensive to be able to work constructively with regulators because absent that the industry is going to have the regulated out of it and it could regulate it out of existence dimitri it's been a fantastic time having you on the bank list podcast and we really value your very secular and unbiased opinions about the space we have we think about a lot of the same things and yet we think about them differently and getting that diverse perspective onto the bankless pod is
