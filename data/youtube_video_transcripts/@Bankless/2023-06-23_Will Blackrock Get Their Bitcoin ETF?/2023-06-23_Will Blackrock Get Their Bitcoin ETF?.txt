I really do think that we could get a repeat of D5 summer if the timing's right I think the timing will probably be right it just yeah maybe just a little bit more commentary in Alpha here I do know of at least two startups um that definitely was planning on releasing a token last bull market and then the bear Market hit and they were like we're gonna sit on our hands and release our token later so there is pent-up airdrops that people are just waiting for bullish sentiment to re-emerge so that they can release their airdrops Friday it is the bank List Friday weekly roll-up time where we covered the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor and yet again we have Anthony zazano tapping in to substitute teach for Ryan chat RSA Anthony welcome back to the weekly roll up thank you sir always a pleasure to be here Anthony it was um a bullish week this week which is like the first bullish week that we've had in a long time we're going to talk about why uh perhaps it's because tradfy decides to enter crypto all at once BlackRock Charles Schwab and the NASDAQ we're going to talk about all of the things that just came out in the last one one week 10 days that has changed the sentiment around crypto Twitter and crypto in general uh then we're going to get into polygon proof of stake and how it has just submitted a proposal to turn it into a ZK roll-up a validium specifically we're going to talk about I'm going to ask you Anthony the nuances between that and hopefully you can re-teach me something I learned forever ago and then lost and then finally Zac xbt is sued and the crypto Community is Gatherings to support him and all that is coming up as soon as I plug the daily guay Anthony this is your YouTube channel the daily way this is where I get my news and just has a big thank you and we gave you this plug at the end of last week's uh weekly roll up last week that we had you on on but we're gonna do it at the start this time Anthony who are you and what is the daily way yeah I I guess just generally I'm an ethereum educator ethereum Community member been around for quite a while uh and the daily way is an education ecosystem for ethereum so I do a 30 minutes or or so a video every weekday um on the YouTube channel and so it's available in podcast format as well just recapping everything that's happened in the ethereum ecosystem for that day and just giving my takes on things and I'm actually uh going to be doing a regular uh podcast with Eric Connor again uh we did one the other week as you can see that's called The Daily gray drive through so we're going to be doing that regularly and anyone who may have listened to a podcast called into The Ether back in the day that was Eric and myself as well so yeah it's going to be exciting for Eric to come back there but yeah it's mostly just like me talking on the daily videos but uh yeah from time to time there's other people as well but hopefully going forward um Eric and I will be doing a regular thing as well well it's a great service that you do for the ethereum and broader crypto ecosystem I often say if you listener can get to the point of under standing what Anthony cesano is saying on the daily way that you are in maintenance mode and you can just chillax and then just listen to the Daily way and you'll be fine and it's where we get a lot of just news for the bankers weekly roll up so a lot of this Anthony's probably already gonna have uh covered once before at least in the last week or so uh because like like he said he does this every single day uh moving forward Anthony I know I've been pestering you about this I'm trying to get you to come to permissionless this is a call to action for the bankless listeners out there we are less than three months away from permissionless in Austin Texas 11th through 13th I've tried to get Anthony to come I haven't convinced him yet we didn't get him last year uh getting him all the way out from Australia is going to be a little bit difficult but Anthony we're working on some extremely exciting topics that I think I can get you for but uh I will I will reserve and judgment until those topics come out uh-huh yeah I mean I I can't remember what are these exact dates for permission September 11th through 13th in Austin Texas yeah I I would have come if I can but I don't think I can make it work um not just the travel time which is brutal of course um but also I have prior engagements around that time uh already so unfortunately won't be able to make it but the lineup looks killer I mean I saw this earlier today the lineup looks a great guy uh really really great work you guys have done with that yeah and there's that's a without a bunch of uh EF members and some other topics as well coming on to the lineup there is a link in the show notes if you want to get a ticket if you are a banker assistant you get 30 off of the permissionless ticket which basically pays for bankless citizenship uh and so stay tuned to say you can follow the permissionless Twitter account as more talks and things are scheduled uh all right let's get into the markets Anthony uh like I said it was a bullish week this week uh so Bitcoin going up 15 look at that we were at thirty thousand and five dollars Bitcoin started the week at twenty six thousand dollars ending the the week just above thirty thousand dollars fifteen percent it is not often that you get a fifteen percent move in Bitcoin this week ether of course also up not as up as much starting the week as 17.50 went down to um almost below 1620. um but end of the week up eight and a half percent currently at nineteen hundred dollars eighteen ninety three uh and then of course that what does that mean for the ratio the ratio is down about four percent down to point zero six three so kind of a big move downwards on the ratio Anthony what's your favorite on the markets this week it's an exciting week for the markets yeah it definitely is I think it's it's pretty obvious why the markets moved over the past week for anyone who's been paying attention but just to recap uh a lot of noise is being made around Bitcoin ETFs again uh because BlackRock uh basically put in an application for a Bitcoin ETF and for those of you who don't know BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world they are not a small player for them to do something like this is actually a big signal and then a lot of other companies and money managers and stuff like that they've followed as well and have reapplied or applied for a Bitcoin ETF so and I mean on top of that as well there has new been a string of news coming out about different Trad fire institutions getting more involved with crypto we recently had powwow uh actually just yesterday I believe uh give um this kind of uh Speech or answer a few questions as part of some committee uh basically saying that is doing the need to kind of uh to pay it into the stable coins you know stable coins should be regulated as money uh and that crypto is kind of here to stay as well so just a lot of positive news from I guess like outside of crypto but in saying all of that I think that while it's been a bullish week I think that tempering expectations is also something that people should be doing as well because I think right now at least over the last week what people are doing is they're speculating on future inflows of money right like the existing money that's in crypto the Traders and everyone like that they're basically saying okay well this is a new narrative this is something to latch on to and there's potentially a lot of money coming in because maybe the ETF gets approved like for the for those who who don't know there is no Bitcoin ETF and every other application that has ever been put in has been declined there is a pseudo ETF known as gbtc which is not an ETF it is actually a pretty crappy product it trades at discounts uh quite regularly so it's not not something that that um that people really want to buy but uh but yeah people are speculating on this one actually getting approved so that's what you've seen so far that's what you've seen this week now whether this kind of continues this price at positive price action continues I think is going to definitely rely on new money coming in and if in absent that I I think it would it would just retrace because speculating that new money is going to come in can only get you so far because if it doesn't actually materialize you know what you're speculating on then it's just going to go back down that that's my kind of read so I'm not like bullish or bearish I guess uh it's more of like a neutral stance and just to wait and see yeah I think that's I think that's a smart take to have I'll add on additionally that yes there are traders that have rotated into Bitcoin it's why the ratio is down it's why Bitcoin dominance is up on the news of BlackRock the largest asset manager with over 10 billion dollars uh of assets under management has proposed a Bitcoin ETF that is Traders that have like that is not there's no no new money there they have just proposed an ETF along with everyone else that's also proposed and also gotten denied a big a Bitcoin ETF and so I totally agree that this is Traders making the Bitcoin price go up yeah at this also at the same time I think what is real is that it is different when BlackRock does it uh and also they are doing it in spite of the worst regulatory environment that crypto has ever had and so yes you could say that like there are a speculation of future cash flows going into Bitcoin so people are buying it now but also there's just like the crypto has gotten absolutely flooded in the last three weeks a month or so with regulatory concerns and so I think there is a take that the BlackRock ETF is a signal that hey those regulatory concerns were the bottom uh the the bottom of regulatory flood and so now that BlackRock is here and Charles Schwab and Fidelity are here entering the crypto space people are perhaps thinking that this will be the end of regulatory fund because now we have the Trad players involved yeah I think it's definitely a win change for sure and I guess my comments were more maybe the short-term kind of stuff not definitely not long term but it also means that the foundations are being laid for the next crypto bull market uh and I I believe strongly that there are foundations being laid everywhere right now not just in with tradfly coming in but also in crypto foundations start such as all the development in the ethereum ecosystem obviously we had I'm staking withdrawals go live which opened or de-risk staking for a lot of people and we've seen a lot of inflows there Layer Two stuff like that so all of this is just part of those foundations being laid um so long term yes it's incredibly bullish that that this is happening it's a win change I I did actually tweet uh the other day that I thought that the regulatory bottom was in and I think that was before all this news came out because it really did feel like The Regulators overstepped uh specifically the SEC just overstepped um their their bounds here and it doesn't matter you know how much support you think you have if certain I guess players don't support you then you're are going to you know lose this lose the support of people that matter very very quickly so I think there's definitely a win change and I'm actually trying to kind of figure out or speculating on you know who's the SEC going to go after next are they actually going to do any more high-profile lawsuits or are they going to pause now that these big players have basically shot this you know shot and basically put this signal out there saying hey you know we actually think crypto is legit we we don't think this stuff should be uh you know killed in the US and you know basically you guys should stop that's that's kind of my read on it yeah certainly certainly really quickly we have a 1.2 trillion dollar market cap which is up bigly we almost fell below uh a trillion dollars last week but this just shows what happens when Bitcoin puts a 15 week uh in the green there and then also like you said Anthony second withdrawals went live and so we've seen the post uh post withdrawals meta emerge on ethereum 23 million ether staked seemingly up only and interestingly also uh ethereum staked the supply of each state is ready to flip eth on crypto exchanges which is just something you gotta love to see crypto exchange is losing in their eth supply ownership percentage versus The Beacon chain so staking just really seems to be up only yeah 23 million ether Stakes any comments on this Anthony yeah I mean I it's definitely not something that surprised me but what did surprise me was the speed of which it happened I I knew that that staking withdrawals was going to be bullish I just didn't think that we would see this much eth fomo in because it's just I mean the validated queue's been over 90 000 for a while now it's like okay why didn't these people enter before well the obvious reason was is because they felt it was risky right and they felt it was risky to get in before withdrawals went live and now that withdrawals alive uh they're fine doing it now right obviously um you know the proof is in the numbers and uh and it's just been really amazing to to see that so yeah just generally great to see that the thesis played out that withdrawals was going to be bullish and I believe that each staking is going to be up only for a while it will obviously slow down and taper off um there's I think there there definitely is like a finite amount of of ether can be staked outside of the total supply of eighth and I think that I don't think it's going to get to like 70 or 80 staked unless there's like an outside incentives such as eigenlayer for example or restaking generally if it's just vanilla eatstaking yeah I don't see it going like too high because it's just the incentives aren't there for that um but yeah generally it's it's pretty bullish yeah we're looking at a chart here with two lines that are converging one is The Ether on Exchange and one is The Ether staked and we are basically at that flipping point I love the caption here it's not the actual flipping I think one one kind of nuance to this chart that I know this isn't probably something people want to hear but a lot of the eat steak goes through exchanges so if they're staking it it it means it's not being counted as their as their exchange balance but it's still theirs technically right because they're staking it on behalf of their users so I would like to see a more detailed chart breaking that out basically identifying which eighth was staked via a centralized exchange you know versus but generally I think it's still fine because you have I guess like eight being productive rather than just sitting um you know and securing the network so obviously there's there's benefits uh but yeah I just that's a that's a caveat on a Nuance I thought I would bring up yes yes they're very very important yeah there should be a third line which is East staked on exchanges uh and if we could get that line to also Trend downwards that would be great you brought up uh eigenlayer which I think this is a uh important to bring up here is a graphic of just all of the different uh each stake derivatives the staked eth from Lido r e from rocketpool and CBE from coinbase being deposited into like eigenlayer after mainnet launch uh and this happened in this is an hourly time frame so this is a very short period of time while the uh until the Caps were reached the Caps of 32 000 eth uh 3200 excuse me and so like not only do we have ether staked on the beacon chain to watch but now we have ether staked on eigenlayer to also watch all three of these these things are capped I think we covered this uh last um last week or last week we had you on Anthony but it's just fun to to watch these uh ether being staked across all of the different staking utility the ecosystems any last comments on augular before we move on uh no I mean I didn't uh I wasn't surprised by this I I actually kind of woke up to both the announcement and the pool's being filled that's how that's how fast it got filled up here uh but yeah it's going to be interesting to see which ones kind of fill up uh and and succeed like in terms of market share obviously it's gonna probably reflect the market share of each of these lsts themselves but will it actually change the Dynamics like will there be more RF minted um because the R8 cap you know won't be reached as fast as the stf cap is because it's just more stf out there so I'm I'm that's what I'm watching the Dynamics there between the different lsts and how that drives the I guess dynamics of LST market share on the beacon chain itself all right Bank location coming up next tradfi enters crypto all at once we're going to talk about each of the individual entrances into this crypto World followed by the polygon proof of stake chain set up to upgrade to a ZK validium and of course the

decentralized mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle at mantle Dot XYZ and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle all right here's a tweet from Delphi digital that I think sums this up pretty nicely over the past two weeks BlackRock files a Bitcoin ETF NASDAQ launches a crypto custody service Deutsche Bank seeks a crypto custody service soros's fund management says crypto's here to say and then Citadel Fidelity and Charles Schwab launch a crypto exchange finishing up with the institutions are here and so this has been the theme of the last two weeks I'd say starting with of course the BlackRock uh submission of the ishares uh paperwork for a spot Bitcoin ETF this was a rumors like oh BlackRock is rumored to be close to be submitting for a Bitcoin ETF and then about I don't know four to five hours later it was confirmed that they did indeed submit a proposal to the SEC for an ishares Bitcoin trust that I shares is just their branding for BlackRock and so BlackRock the world's world's largest it's either first or second after Vanguard over 10 trillion dollars I might have said billion trillion dollars in AUM uh and interestingly enough there are some some stats I want to pull out uh after the 10 trillion dollars in AUM BlackRock has a c received approval of 575 out of 576 ETF applications they have only ever been denied their ETF applications once and so they've done they've a done this a few times before uh in fact 575 times and they have gotten approval quite frequently except all except for once and so this is using some crypto service providers the custodian is going to be coinbase there is a kraken subsidiary company that is providing the exchange data and just everyone knows BlackRock plus Larry Fink the CEO has a lot of political power and so in combination with like finally we're getting a spot Bitcoin ETF not the Futures ETF that no one really liked earlier we also have the weight of BlackRock and to if you aren't familiar with BlackRock if in addition to all the contexts I just gave BlackRock is the closest thing to the government while also not being the government like they own half of the equities in the United States of America like that it is part of the it's an extension of the government itself this kind of a cynical nihilistic take about the relationship between governments and public and private markets uh but but that's my take Anthony anything you want to add to this mm-hmm yeah I think just on that note about the ETS that they've approved um or have had to prove then which ones have been denied I actually looked up the one that got denied so it was one in 2014 so quite a while ago now and it was denied because apparently it was just a blind trust so you'd buy it but you wouldn't actually know what was in it so you would be buying something you didn't know so obviously that's not something that that uh that people that you want to offer to to reach our customers especially um so that was a denied there and again that goes to that kind of stuff we were saying before about the wind change I I don't think we brought it up before but yeah that point around the BlackRock seems to only file for ETFs when they know with like 99.9 certainty that it's going to get approved it it has people speculating okay well there's a higher chance of this one getting approved this Bitcoin ETF getting approved than not this time right it's not like a it's a you know one percent chance it's maybe over 50 so that's what people are speculating on I think I think that's right yeah and there's just a lot of speculation going on so Frank Shapiro says BlackRock Fidelity Citadel they're all making big moves into crypto despite the Gensler Crackdown uh tree of alpha response to this and says you wrote despite instead of thanks to and so the people with a conspiracy hat on which I always love to put on are saying like Gary Gensler in the SEC and the powers that be we're just hammering the crypto native companies right the Winklevoss ETF denied right like all of the other crypto native ETF proposals denied and they're just the the claim the conspiracy is that they were just biting their time for some of the bigger players to come in and it's just interesting that Fidelity Citadel BlackRock all of these Trad institutions with trillions of dollars of AUM and strong political connections all seem to come into crypto at once right after the SEC and other Regulators start hammering cryptonative orgs and so just the timing on this is curious I don't know if I I think if I talk to somebody like uh Jake Stravinsky or somebody a little bit more measure they would just say yes it's curious but there's not really a there there but I think everyone in crypto was like yo what the f is up with this timing do you have any thoughts on that Anthony yeah I mean that the timing is what I think a lot of people are latching on to when it comes to putting their conspiracy hat on right but there is another a lens you can view this from you can basically view this as uh these tradify institutions had their hands forced by the SEC because the SEC went after you know coinbase the biggest crypto company in the US they went after a bunch of different tokens or had used those tokens as evidence against coinbase obviously they went after binance which isn't uh I mean binance us but obviously they're trying to extend that to binance Global as well um so I think that maybe these chatfire institutions were already interested in getting into crypto they just hadn't announced their plans yet and then because the SEC went after the you know coinbase especially they're like okay well we need to send the signal back now that we're actually wanting to play in this Arena and the SEC needs to calm down with whatever they're trying to do interesting okay so that's actually just like the pro crypto it's like they were they were always ready to pull this trigger but then they they decided to like hey let's publicly stand in support of crypto before Gary genzer destroys the industry that we want to generate fees from yeah pretty much and like I think not just gensla but all the high-ranking Democrats that have been anti-crypto these companies probably like well it's time to put a stop to that right it's time to if we want to be involved here and make money from it we can't have all these uh regulators and these politicians trying to kill crypto in the US and that's why I said it's a win change where it was like blowing in One Direction now it seems to be blowing in the complete opposite direction you know speaking of a wind change here's a meme that I thought kind of sums this up uh Larry Fink the CEO of BlackRock first initially said Bitcoin is an index of money laundering and then the meme is you know first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you and then they create a spot Bitcoin ETF yeah all these comments from like uh yeah Larry Fink and like Jamie dimon and and their change of tune over time I think you like a lot of times you can just chalk that up to they've been around a long time uh they've been around markets a long time they're very experienced there they've you know they've probably seen it all and a lot of these things that are these new things that come along end up failing right A lot of these new things people get excited we end up failing so I think for them crypto needed to you know exist for a long time and then it's become a much bigger asset class than it traditionally had been it needed to affect uh maybe the political sphere as well and and be conversation be conversational there for these Trad fire people these CEOs to actually be like okay well this thing's here to stay let's focus on it right because CEOs have a million things to think about and I doubt Jamie Diamond sitting there every day being like Oh crypto I'm gonna go look into what what's happening with Bitcoin mining what I'm going to look up into what's happening with ethereum l2s no they're not doing that right uh they've got their own things they need to focus on they need to run the business the existing business and their Innovation arms or whatever will look into it that's why Jamie down was saying these comments while uh JP Morgan was making uh I believe they were making an ethereum client or working on ethereum client or something got to do with the evm um so that's why I think these things happen so yeah I I don't think that uh these CEOs really um you know when they make those comments they're not making it from a position of being super involved with crypto being like a Believer they're more from the sidelines sure so yeah certainly certainly and of course this was not the only thing in the Trad World about the the crypto World Fidelity Charles Schwab and Citadel have launched a centralized exchange a non-custodial centralized exchange titled edx I don't know what edx stands for uh what what is with these acronym Base Exchange I don't know uh okay so edx is launching it's a non-custodial exchange non-custodial centralized exchange which I think is interesting to the crypto world but it actually is normal in the Trad world uh and so the edx the the quote from the CEO Jamil Nazar rally says edx's official launch allows our outstanding team to bring the crypto the same values and standards of competition transparency fairness and safety that investors in traditional assets expect and enjoy and so okay so why what's the big deal here uh RAM alawalia who we've had on the podcast before the non-custodial aspect of edx refers to its settlement process unlike traditional crypto exchanges like coinbase or Kraken that require customers to deposit assets into wallets controlled by the exchange edx just plans to use a third party bank or custodians to hold customer assets so you use a custodian a custodian service and this is how like the NASDAQ works this is how tradfy works there is a custodian or a bank and then there's just like API access and so the trading happens on paper by this brokerage by this trading service and then there's settlement after the fact whereas crypto exchanges coinbase Kraken Gemini anyway anyone where you submit your crypto assets and they are the custodian and then they also let you trade those things are co-mingled and the Trad World likes these things separated and so this is just following the old model of separation of exchange duties and custodian duties and so this is being a hyper compliant new form factor for an exchange and so the website is edxmarkets.com you can check it out but you actually can't trade on there it's not for you it's not for retail investors it's not like your coinbase or your Kraken it is meant to be like a software service for Trad custodians and then Trad custodians will allow you to trade so I would imagine if you uh are a customer of fidelity which you have Bitcoin or ether there that trading of of if you press a buy button or the sell button or I don't know the options button for ether or Bitcoin that information as an API gets routed to ET edx and then edx does the the trading and then there's final settlement between the custodians later and so this specifically is intended to avoid serving retail investors interestingly Paradigm is an etx edx investor and and also interestingly they only offer four tokens Bitcoin ether fine Litecoin and Bitcoin cash interesting um the Nazareth nazarari the CEO says we have a limited set of tokens because until there's more regulatory Clarity we don't want to trade something that is potentially a security so hyper compliance uh fitting the old form factors of Trad Phi meant to serve Trad Phi uh institutions backed by Fidelity Charles Schwab Citadel interestingly nazarali the CEO is a former Citadel employee uh Anthony does the summation of the details what's your take here yeah no I think that's a great uh great summary of everything um before I dive into my tech I just want to point out that the E uh on the logo there is the currency symbol for ether uh on edx uh I don't know if that's intentional or not but that's pretty cool pretty sure not intentional no probably not uh so the assets that you that you rolled off they're the ones that they're trading right uh you know as you said Bitcoin and ether no-brainer that's fine but Litecoin and Bitcoin cash I mean it's frustrating yeah yeah this so this is what's frustrating about the SEC not giving Clarity to anything because it means that these platforms are very limited into what they can trade and they literally will trade things that just are dead right that that no one really cares about right that are that are kind of old coins dinosaur coins or Dino coins as we call them in crypto um and they could trade all this other stuff if there was Clarity because what they could do is that they could literally register with the SEC to trade Securities so even if these crypto assets were secure Securities they would still be able to trade them but they can't do that because the SEC does not offer any way to actually do that and and contrary to what they've said around the promethium thing which in my eyes the Promethean thing is like uh an Sac plant to be honest I I think that whole thing is just absolutely wild um but like yeah the ex not even adx can probably register with the SEC to trade crypto asset Securities because there's just no guidance there so it really does speak to the fact the SEC as I said has overstepped completely and has just provided absolutely no guidance to anyone um and I I think that's super frustrating because it means that instead of actual crypto assets that people want to trade being on this platform you have Litecoin and Bitcoin cash which like no one cares about I mean maybe some people do but I think the majority don't right yeah it also just sends a bad signal to investors it puts Bitcoin cash and Litecoin shoulder to shoulder with Bitcoin and ethers like it's just the wrong signal like let's not legitimize Bitcoin cash when like it's more of a nuanced discussion but really there's just ever only going to be one Bitcoin and very clearly BTC has won that fight and Bitcoin cash has very clearly lost and so I don't think there's the investors who are clients of Charles Schwab are sufficiently informed about the Dynamics of what a hard Fork is and what like block space competition is uh and and so like they're like oh Bitcoin cash it's cheaper I'll buy it like they're gonna fall for that and so it's just like a it's a poor service at least in in my opinion uh and I will say like I thought I don't have ethereum Classic on there yeah it's the cheaper ethereum right right yeah and it's so like I know like neither you nor I are necessarily bullish on like Solana at least in comparison to Ether you and I are lean towards the ether camp but I will be way more bullish on Solana than Litecoin or Bitcoin cash and I'm sure that's a sentiment that's shared by almost anyone that's going to have an account with some of these Charles Schwab Fidelity types um one more comment from uh Nazareth the CEO of this new exchange left a comment for coindesk Regulators like the different approach this is talking about the separation of exchange function uh in the broiler dealer function investors want to trade through trusted intermediaries and that is especially true post FTX and so this is also just naturally a it's going to service a demand for the more conservative cautious Trad investor who doesn't like any of these crypto native companies even the great ones like Kraken and coinbase that we in the crypto World completely trust because they've been around but still like to to the Trad investor you put up coinbase and you put up FTX and people are like I can't tell the difference uh just because they just aren't informed uh any last comments before we move on no I mean I think that's right and then these other financial institutions have been around for a very long time but as well they're also like registered and regulated uh within the proper Frameworks and that's what crypto exchanges are trying to do in the US but they just have no path towards that but I would I will say that that coinbase and Kraken are particularly coinbase is viewed very very favorably by U.S tradify uh kind of people I mean as you said edx is using coinbase as a a custodian no sorry not edx um the the ETF uh the black they're using coinbase as a custodian and to use someone as a custodian is obviously a huge deal because they have all the assets right so you only want to be using companies that are completely legitimate that you trust uh and that and that have good practices around this and I would say that coinbase is custody practices are the best in the industry um I don't think they've ever actually had a hack um at all or an exploit not to say they obviously won't you can't ever say they won't but that that test of time that they've been around for a very long time and through you know from the youngest days of crypto to today is a huge uh kind of deal for these these more Trad fire kind of Institutions yeah that's a funny point where if like Trad investors are like I'm not really sure about these crypto exchanges I don't really know about coinbase I'm going to use BlackRock and blackrock's like well we're gonna use coinbase yeah exactly all right okay moving on to polygon news the other big news of the week there is a proposal submitted by polygon Labs two polygon governance uh titled polygon 2.0 polygon proof of stake to ZK Layer Two okay so a proposal was published to move the polygon proof of stake chain the big one with all of the trading activity the economic activity to a ZK evm validium so polygon already has their ZK evm so this is a new chain well say it's the same chain the polygon proof of stake chain they want to turn that into a zkevm validium which is a specific kind of ZK roll up so this is a a core part of their whole polygon 2.0 Vision where they everything ultimately just becomes a ZK layer 2. so the goal here is to upgrade the polygon proof of stake chain which is actually not not people will throw a flag at the calling it a roll-up because it's technically a proof of stake side chain so this turns it closer to being an actual roll-up and this proposal itself actually re-triggered the what is a true roll-up conversation on crypto Twitter because a validium is a roll up and there's but there's an asterisk there so like we're going to get into some of that nuances but first uh just like what is the big difference uh higher security for users compared to the proof of stake chain again in the proof of stake polygon chain is a side chain turning it into a ZK validium actually does produce more final settlement on the ethereum layer one itself there's better interoperability because of the ZK uh part of this component to the rest of the polygon 2.0 ecosystem all the applications on polygon should continue and fees should actually get much much much lower and so okay what is a validium I'm going to briefly answer this and Anthony you're going to help me help me to find this validium is a lower cost High through points throughput sibling of azk roll up so the pros are that it fully inherits security of ethereum except for transaction data which is kind of actually an important part so publishing transaction data to ethereum is expensive and it limits throughput so a validium it has similar security guarantees to a roll-up but the transaction data is made available off chain so that'll be made available by a proprietary polygon solution and so much much lower V's fees than a true ZK roll up a zkevm like scroll or ZK sync era it doesn't this doesn't consume ethereum gas to chore store transaction data so there's higher scalability but the cons are there is an external dependency the transaction data the data availability for transactions is secured outside of ethereum so there is an extra dependency there Anthony what would you add to my limited definition of a ZK validium uh no I think you covered it quite quite well there there is obviously a lot to unpack here um so I will offer a bit of just extra kind of context around this so validium was a term that was I think coined by Stark where back a while ago and it basically just describes a construction where the as you mentioned the transaction data is not stored on the same uh I guess like a layout that the ZK proof is uh so the ZK proof is in this case for the polygon ZK V and bolidium will be stored on ethereum L1 and that's the cheap component that is very cheap to store on ethereum L1 uh whereas the transaction data which is the expensive component will be stored on the existing polygon validators nodes so they're polygon validator set consists of around 100 validators um and there is obviously staking with thematic token um they've got a deposit system or a delegated proof of stake system so those validators will be the where the data is stored now what this does is that it enables uh cheaper fees because storing the day data on the with polygon validators is cheaper than storing it with the ethereum validators uh just by the virtue of how each of these um networks work here but in saying that there is no in a typical validium construction um there is no kind of limit to where you can store your data so you can store your data on anywhere basically you could store it locally if it allows you to do that right you could store it on another another L1 altogether or you could store it on a data available in network itself something like Celestia or a veil which actually spun out of polygon or potentially eigenlayer data availability layers if those things get spun up but it's all about the security guarantee right because what is the actual practical implication here of not storing your data on ethereum L1 but storing it elsewhere is what happens is that there could be a withholding of data so let's just say for example that the polygon validators all go offline right and and the data is gone like not gone but inaccessible right you you can't actually so if you want to withdraw your funds from the the ZK VM validium you wouldn't be able to do that because you don't have the data to allow for the cryptographic proof to basically say well you've got the proof right but you don't have the other part of it which is the data to say hey these you know this is my funds this is the state of my account please give me my funds on wherever ethereum L1 whatever else now that's the worst case scenario that they can't steal your funds they can freeze your funds but they cannot steal your funds because they do not have the proof that is tied to your your address um at least that's that's my understanding of it so that's the trade-off basically where you do get more security than the polygon POS chain but uh because the data is stored off chain you still rely on those validators in order to access your funds your funds would be Frozen in in that world now obviously that's not ideal but that's the trade-off for the cheaper fees in saying all of that post eip4844 which is Proto dang shiding which uh it basically creates a new transaction type for uh for Roll-Ups if the costs are low enough for polygon for what they want to achieve for their ZK VM what they could do is they could essentially just store the data on ethereum and still get the same fees that they would by storing it elsewhere and that would make it a full roll up so a full roll-up needs its data and it's uh its transaction and it's proof stored on the same kind of uh I guess like settlement layouts such as ethereum L1 here and another thing that they could do as well is that with the validium construction they can as I mentioned before allow users to store their data wherever they want so if you store your data yourself you pay for it yourself obviously if you want to store your data on ethereum L1 cool do that but you have to pay for it right and by doing that you actually now have the same guarantees you have the guarantees of a roll up on ethereum and if the their polygon validators go offline it doesn't matter for you because your data is actually on ethereum so you would still be able to get your funds out but you can store your data anywhere actually as well which is which is actually I think a really cool uh kind of um construction type here is where you could have it default stored on the polygon validators then give the users the choice to store it wherever they want but we'll have to see I I think that if um 4844 offers enough scalability for polygon I think that they could end up defaulting to ethereum L1 and then maybe in times of like high congestion they change over to the polygon validators so they're they're literally various different ways that this can be done which is actually what's really cool about this uh but but yeah that hopefully gives people extra context around around this itself but um just the last thing I'll say I know I'm I'm going on a little bit here but the last thing I'll say is that the reason why this is really bullish for polygon is because the POS chain has a huge Network effect right yes it's a side chain yes it's uh obviously less secure than than ethereum and everything uh it's not a roll-up or an L2 but it has a lot of activity has a lot of apps has a lot of users has a lot of network effects so converting this over to a ZK VM for lydium inherits all of that and keeps all of that and just gives it more security and if it's a full ZK roll up then you've literally just converted what is essentially a separate L1 into an L2 on ethereum and that right there I think is a playbook for other l1s to potentially follow not to say the other l1s have as much activity as the POS chain some you know but at the same time it shows that it can be done it shows that it is possible and it shows that it works because from my reading this is actually easy to do in in The Proposal the polygon said this is actually not difficult a difficult thing to do we can actually do this with relative ease um and then everyone and there's no need for users to do anything it's like the merge on ethereum the merger is obviously not an easy feat but um it's like the merge where essentially it happens and the users don't feel anything they just get the same experience so yeah overall I think very bullish uh even though obviously there's a lot of nuance to the construction itself but I think that once you understand the nuances there um you know you have a better understanding of of of all of it God I'm so glad I have you this week to explain this one that was so helpful uh you talked about the size of the the polygon roll up over two billion dollars of assets tens of thousands of dapps and an average of 2.5 million transactions per day that is in the current proof of stake polygon chain and so just to really drive this point home about like this DK validium the ZK part of a ZK validium the ZK part is the cryptographic proof that prevents The Operators of this roll-up from stealing your assets the trade-off is that you do not have the same assurances of having your data but at least they can't steal your assets they can only prevent you from retrieving your assets and so it's basically like what's left is a griefing attack is they can only prevent you from withdrawing so there's no incentive for them to do anything else because they can't steal it from you they can only prevent you from withdrawing and so there's a much significantly reduced attack surface area down to these circumstances of just like when a griefing attack by a layer 2 operator or set of operators would be would be viable uh which is just like that's much less incentive to be malicious than if they were actually able to steal your funds so the ZK part of the ZK validium prevents them from actually being able to steal your funds so what's left is just like they can withhold it from you for and be mean for some particular reason but the reasons for doing that are much much more reduced and then on top of that you also have the Matic staking as well which I'm assuming if they do this uh if anyone griefs or you know censors your withdraws then they have Matic at stake which can get slash which is an additional protection against this all of this is correct right Anthony I'm not sure I don't actually know if Matic has uh or the polygon POS chain validators have uh slashing mechanism um and I'm not sure if that will be implemented as part of this move um I have I don't actually know the details of of what they have there um but generally what you're talking about is is the data availability kind of problem right where the the the thing this is a huge problem in crypto generally and the way ethereum aims to solve it is by using um some some really fancy cryptography that is beyond my understanding ending that is part of the Dank shining road map but so with the with where the data is stored if it's still with the POs chain validators it I don't know if all of them are going to store all of the data or how long they're going to store it for because they could say okay I'm going to keep it for 30 days and then discard it because it's too expensive for me to you know to keep it right or our portion of them will only keep the data so maybe only like 30 of them will keep the data and the other 70 won't so if 30 percent of if they withhold the data it doesn't matter that the other 70 don't they don't have the data to withhold in the first place so there's been all this research and development over data availability guarantees and how to actually do it in a scalable way because storing data is expensive and serving it is expensive because you it's it's all Hardware at the end of the day right you're storing the data it's it's literally gigabytes or megabyte whatever storage you store on a computer it's the same concept but then you also have to serve that and that costs money to do right you need to serve it off of a good connection you need to be online so that it is available it's like running any kind of a node or validator or anything like that um so from that lens uh when you're talking about the cost of this the cost is always born by the people storing the data and if it becomes economically inefficient for them to do that they're either going to discard the data or they're just going to shut down their validators so that's where the problem of data availability comes from and how do you ensure that the data is always available even if only a subset of validators have it and that's where all the research that's going to dangshiding has come from uh which uses all the very fancy cryptography uh which obviously is Way Beyond my my knowledge there I'm not a cryptographer um but yeah I don't know exactly how polygon is going to construct this and which validators are going to keep it for how long um but that's why I think that they should make it so that the validium has that option to fall back to ethereum L1 for example if you want to to pay there because for example big players who don't care about fees they could use this chain and just post their data to L1 ethereum so they'll have no risk of their assets being frozen right whereas smaller players maybe they they don't they it's not worth it to them to do that so they can just have it stored somewhere else so again giving the the users choice I think is very important uh but yeah this is a huge design space when it comes to to research around this yeah the the last thing I want to pull out is that uh interestingly in this blog post uh they talked about like a polygon talked about why this is a good thing and so they say upgrading the polygon proof of say chain to a ZK validium would offer very high scalability and very low fees yes we know this it would be a great fit for applications that have high transaction volume and require low transaction fees for example web3 gaming social and micro D5 interestingly that they added the word micro because you wouldn't want to do a million dollar transaction with constrained settlement assurances so so even they are admitting that like hey this is great for micro micro transactions micro defy but for a for large-scale D5 Services you would want the full ZK evm which polygon also happens to have supplied to the market okay wrapping up the the polygon conversation thank you for helping me navigate through that one Anthony uh Zach xpt right at Twitter thread says it's unfortunate that I have to write this thread but I'm being sued by maki big brother for an article I published in June 2022 today Maki filed the defamation lawsuit the lawsuit is baseless and an attempt to chill a free speech I intend to fight back and defend free speech for bankless listeners who are not on crypto Twitter or not tapped into who Zack xbt is he's a I would call him a famous crypto sleuth he has done a massive job just like thankless job just crawling through etherscan tracing transactions uh watching crypto influencers talk a big game about crypto assets while secretly selling them on the other side and then exposing them on crypto Twitter and generating like massive threads of research and so I definitely call him a beloved member of the crypto Twitter Community the broader crypto Community Zach xbt was actually the one that exposed who was the the uh who is the quadranga ex founder that was also oh yeah I don't remember the name I don't remember the name but yeah that was the Canadian exchange right there the part of the Wonderland Seafood zero X sifu yeah part of the ones sifu who turned out to be this ex-gamer and Zach broke that story and so he has just done a number of number of just jobs exposing fraud in the crypto space uh and so uh he continues and says my understanding is that Maki is very wealthy I am not he is using his money to try and silence me I'm asking for your help so that this doesn't happen and the truth survives he also created a donation address to assist with legal costs uh basically the story is that Zach accused maki big brother whose name is Jeff Huang of launching over 10 failed pump and dumps in nft projects including treasury Management Services uh from Formosa Financial uh Formosa Financial co-founder George uh H withdrew 22 000 ether from the Project's treasury wallet in June of 28 teen and then this all of this data Based on blockchain data Zach xvd concluded that these were maki's addresses so Zac xvt blames Jeff Wang for draining of the funds as the eth inflows of private round funds into the multi-sig before the two eleven thousand uh ether withdrawals were made by both Jeff and George in June 22nd 2018. basically Zach traced a lot of fraud back to maki big brother uh and then monkey big brother has sued him for defamation uh and so I will say everyone gets their day in court uh maki big brother gets his day in court he is suing Zach because he would like to clear his name from the record and say that he is uh this is none of this has happened uh and what Zach xvt is not correct what was that is claiming is not correct uh and so he would like to have his name cleared because uh Zach is wrong uh and Zach who published this article uh is saying hey I I am right um I also need help defending myself in court and since Zach is so beloved by the broader crypto world over a million dollars has been sent to the Zac xbt donation address the last I checked it was over a million dollars and so crypto Twitter has absolutely risen to the occasion to defend Zach xbt uh from Maki and kind of judged Maki is guilty uh at least collectively uh just because Zach's um uh prowess in the crypto Twitter field is just so strong uh Anthony what's your what's your summation of all these events what's your take I mean I think you summarized it all uh very well there you gave all the relevant development background I will say that I consider Zach for those who don't know to be like kryptos Batman um but he's not a billionaire unfortunately so he he obviously had to set up this donation address and of and obviously uh crypto Twitter came out or crypto people came out and donated to him and stood behind him I am not going to you know obviously say that monkey big brother is guilty or not because I don't want to get sued um but what the the thing about this suit is that what happens is there's a period of Discovery and what that means is that everything's gonna come out into the open about what uh Maki wants to actually defend against and what Zach has accused monkey of now if Zach is right and and everything that he's accused machiave is is correct the monkey is just opening himself up to lawsuits from other people that will now have all this evidence to go after him with so I don't know if this lawsuit is actually going to continue for that long maybe he thought that Zach wouldn't be able to defend himself and Zach would just uh basically cave and apologize to Maki because Zach has actually issued a public apology before to ran new new I don't know how to say his last name right but he he's pretty big yeah yeah so he has actually issued an apology before because I believe crypto uh RAM man or whatever his name is was going to sue Zack but this time around uh Zach either wrongly or rightly feels he has a good enough uh defense and good enough kind of evidence here to to defend himself against uh against Maki so maybe monkey miscalculated here maybe he will withdraw the suit um but yeah it's great to see crypto Twitter come out with huge support for Zach and I think obviously if Zach needs more more money if he exhausts the existing funds people are going to come out and help him with it anyway because he has done a lot of great a good work for crypto unveiling scammers and grifters at Great personal risk because he's not really an Anon right people know who he is now he started off aing on but then he was traced down and obviously you can't put that um cupboard that back in the in the bottle once it's out so yeah he does this at Great personal risk uh and it's a thankless job as you said because yeah okay he's gotten some donations from people here and there but the risk that he takes on is is huge I can't even overstate like how big the risk is because if he goes after the wrong person um you know that he's probably a scammer but is a bit crazy they could physically harm him not just sue him right they could be physical kind of violence involved here for him or his family so so yeah it's great personal risk but it's it is a duty that needs to be done because there are so many scammers and Griffiths that just get away with things in crypto that we do need a Batman at the end of the day yeah 100 and and if you've been following Zach's Twitter account he has already published the death threats that he has gotten just from around the space and so this is this is not speculation this is a reality and I I will say that even even in the circumstance where Maki is correct and he uh was not doing the things that Zach believes that he was doing I think the still the public signaling from crypto Twitter of sending Zach over a million dollars to help pay for the suit is important because even if Zach gets this one wrong in that particular version of the universe we still want Zach to do the stuff she's doing because his track record is so strong uh and so like we still want Zach around I think we want to support him uh bankless we sent him 25 000 just to help support him and kind of wrote a thread to talk about like why we were doing this um and so like yeah even in the event that like Zach misses one or two every now and then like on net oh my gosh he's such a valuable resource for for the crypto world uh so again all of these links are in the show notes including the donation address for for Zach xvt if you feel compelled to donate to Zach's defense uh okay all right that was all of the big news of the week coming out next we got the three arrows Goose gets sold for how much I will tell you and then there's Nike's nft platform dot swoosh continues to grow even though no one in crypto Twitter seems to care metamask is going cross-chain uh we'll talk about that and more but first a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible metamask has something new

just using the wallet so if you want to get started with ampire all the links that you need are in the show notes is it a bull market is it a bear Market or is it a goose Market because apparently you like that one uh apparently you think it is a goose Market because the goose which is a ringer one of the more famous art block collections that famously three arrows capitals Starry Night fund bought at the absolute top of the nft market has been sold for 5.4 million dollars to and and Kyle suzu and Kyle Davies of course purchased the goose this ringer is known as the goose in August 2021 for 1800 ether about 5.8 million dollars uh and so I think they're the value of the goose and ether terms has almost tripled uh August 2021 ether was definitely around a high three to low four thousand dollars uh so 5.48 8 million dollars when they bought it sold just now for a 5.4 million dollar it was estimated to sell for 2.223 million dollars so basically double the estimation uh and it got uh oh it got sold to punk 6529 previous podcast guest and Famous nft Bowl uh Anthony what's your take on the story yeah I mean I don't follow the nft space too closely and I don't think I'm someone that gets it I mean I get Collectibles I get spending lots of money on things like this but I don't know it never really clicked me like I look at this and I don't really feel anything it doesn't say anything to me I mean I see the goose obviously but it doesn't say anything to me there's no kind of excitement for me about this it's not something that I would even buy for like ten dollars right um like that's just but that's just me because I have other things that obviously I'll you know I spend money on my my money on that that are important to me but I think what this says is really that nfts are here to stay given even though 99 of them uh just trash right and were created for for no reason for money grabs but the nfts that survive and that continue to thrive and continue to hold their value um it's just gonna really reflect the the Art Market and the Art Market has been existed for you know thousands of years are and it's gonna be a new cultural Zeitgeist I think but it's going to take a while to play out it's not something that's going to happen overnight DC investor talks about this a lot he's big into nfts he talks a lot about how this is like a multi-decade thing this is not something that's going to happen overnight and the things that survive for that long you know that's the typical thing with art if it retains its value and and stays in the cultural Zeitgeist for decades centuries then it is incredibly important and Incredibly valuable just because of that alone let alone all the other reasons why so I think that maybe ringers is that right maybe in 10 years this goose is selling for like 50 million dollars who knows right so I think that people are obviously speculating on which ones are going to survive and which ones are going to thrive and be culturally relevant going forward um but yeah me personally I'm uh it's not something it's not something for me it's not my my jam yeah I I agree with you I've I've never really felt compelled to buy the art blocks movement I mean I think they're cool but they're they're priced to interest a person that is just you know beyond me um but regardless I will say that like a a ringer the ringer this is now the ringer there's the ringer collection I think there's it's like a 10 000 art block collection there might be it might be a different number but it's like that this is the ringer and so like there's definitely a premium because it's the goose it actually looks like something there's also a a moose I think DC investor owns the Moose um uh but like there's like art blocks or these like ringers that look like animals and so they have a premium to them but the goose is famous because of thorough's capital like they bought it because it was the goose and then they got liquidated because they spent you know money at the top but so like this has like a legacy to it but having a ringer be bought at 5.4 million dollars in the middle of a bear Market I think absolutely cements art blocks and and things like this as valuable like these things aren't going to zero there's always going to be a market for these when the precedent is set that in a bear Market something will be bought for a 5.4 million dollars um that's the culture I was kind of talking about right that's the the story like the things that tell stories are usually things that are very valuable um but you know it depends on what store you resonate with uh you know what story resonates with a large crowd stuff like that so for for me for me personally you know I put value in things that obviously I personally experience than like trading cards for example that I collected as a kid they're very valuable to me or in-game items when I was playing uh online games things like that those things more valuable to me but other people who are into nfts want to own the cultural culturally relevant pieces and things with with interesting stories behind them then yeah I totally get why someone would go for some something like the Gucci but yeah just it speaks to I think the different kind of very different subjectivity there is in the nft kind of Market yeah the big agree yeah okay so moving on into uh dot swoosh three we covered this a little bit over a month ago maybe five or six months ago or weeks ago uh dot switches Nike's nft platform I think it's a playoff of dot eth but they have dot swoosh so the headline here is that fortnite and Nike have teamed up uh on nft gated drops and so users can link their epic games and nike.swish account to get achievement nfts that grant them access to First access to Future dot swoosh Air Max virtual collections uh and so definitely going to categorize this thing in nfts and things that are meant for specific people who really care about Nike and that whole like sneakers out of the world um but I think the interesting thing here is that fortnite is now being plugged into the DOT swoosh ecosystem and so achievements in the fortnite universe are tied to their dot swish profile cannot be traded sold or exchanged and so this is just a switch platform growing the dust switch platform has attracted a lot of users and these are all not anyone that you would find on crypto Twitter or inside of Discord or in your telegrams or talking about the goose these are completely adjacent communities that are I'm assuming enjoying their dot swoosh virtual collection achievement uh experience and the fact that this is like growing this is Nike and epic games are doing stuff with nfts and nft data drops they've created their own words that aren't nfts that are just like more suitable to them they're not using crypto transactions you can buy these things with your credit card but all of this is totally happening happening in a very crypto native way Anthony do you know what chain this is on I know nothing about this uh I think this is like my Peak Boomer moment because I'm looking at this and I'm like what's going on I mean obviously I know who Nike and epic games are I know about fortnite but I look at this and I'm like wow maybe 10 years ago this would have been a thing that I looked at but now I'm looking at it being like I understand obviously why a lot of people are excited about this and and why it appeals to a certain crowd but yeah I'm uh I'm Max Boomer when it comes to this well that's the point right like it doesn't have to be for us we are allowed to have exact products on our chains that are meant for other people non-crypto people but like I think this might be on the polygon POS check this is on polygon this is yeah the fact that crypto people don't know that is hilarious is on the same chain that we do all of our defy things on yeah yeah I mean it's it's bullish for adoption that's for sure and I've long said that there's going to be a lot of things happening in crypto that I'm gonna have no idea about and I'm not going to really be following closely but I'm going to bring in a lot of users okay moving on to back into the crypto native things metamask has integrated connects network uh and so here what is connects it's basically a cross roll up Bridge it's a bridging service between uh various Roll-Ups around the ethereum ecosystem so inside of metamask portfolio app uh and the metamask browser extension users can now Bridge uh so there's a bridge part of metamask uh connect enables trust minimized what does that mean one that doesn't rely on external validators so should be more secure trust minimize communication between chains and layer twos so eth main net polygon oh even BNB chain optimism and arbitrum and so the reasons why metamask chose connects they cited recent and regular audits of the deployed code contract battle tested with time and volume on multiple main Nets High liquidity and reliability robust handling of failure cases so this is a pretty cool Partnership metamask of course is a sponsor of bankless and also disclaimer both Ryan and I and I think also Anthony are all investors Angel Investors into connects Network Anthony what's your take here so connects obviously as you mentioned is like cross chain cross L2 bridge but I think what they want to do and want to want to evolve into and want to be more involved with is doing kind of like cross-chain native applications so basically applications that are made uh on are built with connects that allow for Native cross-chain things to happen so not just the bridge between change change but having apps that actually uh deployed and and kind of work on multiple chains and have that interoperability uh going on kind of between them so it's cool to see metamor supporting it because it means that any apps that get built using connects technology any cross chain apps that that is powered by it will also be available to metamask users and metamask as a wallet has more users than I think any wallet in the ecosystem still by far uh in the bull market they reported I think 20 million monthly active users uh which was which was pretty big yeah yeah right um so but I think that's obviously come down a lot recently with the with the bear Market but at the same time they have a huge market so getting connects integrated with that is obviously a huge win for connects and metamask already natively supports any evm chain that you want to connect to which is the majority of the ones that actually have anything happening on them so yeah it's it's a it's a partnership that I think is really really bullish yeah I remember during our episode with Olaf Carlson we from polychain uh a line that he said that stood out um to us was that it's all chains and bridges as in like even bridges are also chains themselves as in like they also have state and apps uh on them which I thought was an interesting perspective maybe State's not correct but the idea the idea remains that just like yo Bridges do very similar things to change themselves and so uh that is I think with the world that connects is stepping into uh let's see um do you have anything you want to say on that or do you want me to move on uh I mean I just kind of like generally agree but it's kind of remains to be seen how it's gonna play out I think that with the prevalence of all these new uh app specific l2s uh the cross L2 cross chain thing is going to become more prevalent but it remains to be seen if people actually want to use cross chain native apps or they just want to use their apps on the different chains and the different app chains and just bridge between them Bank of the station coming up next we got questions from the nation we got some questions I pulled out specifically to be more relevant for Anthony here so we're gonna we're gonna go back and forth on these questions then we got some hot takes from crypto Twitter and then of course we're gonna finish up with what David and Anthony are bullish on so we're gonna get to all of those things and more but first a moment

friction free and we're back with questions from the nation this one coming in from gleeman.if Anthony this one I've specifically picked out for you what alt layer ones are most likely to Pivot into being layer twos this is a question I thought of while making sad trombone noses noises at my algo and atom bags Anthony what's your perspective here so I have a lot of thoughts on this topic um I I will try not to rant on too much about it I think just at a high level a lot of these L ones they have Founders who are very egotistical and because of that they really want to make their L1 be this thing right they want to grow this L1 they want to grow this ecosystem to be this big thing they obviously want to grow it to be as big as something like ethereum and they have a lot of vested emotional interest in that happening now if they were to Pivot that L1 to an ethereum L2 what they're doing is admitting defeat right and I think you always have to to look at the human element here because this would be like someone who creates a company to compete with a big company right and then they get acquired by said company even though they stated all along the way that they wanted to compete with their company they wanted to kill that company they wanted to be bigger than that company and then in the end they're just like uh oh well uh we failed at that we'll just get acquired or we'll kind of just pivot to to being friendly with them or whatever it is right so I think that that's a huge disincentive and a huge uh Point against a lot of these alt l1s becoming l2s on ethereum another point is that these Old Tower ones most of them don't have much activity to begin with so them pivoting to becoming an L2 is probably not going to help with that um I I think it would actually be worse for them because I think it would just show a signal that they're weak or their weak ecosystems and they need to actually become an L2 on ethereum to even have a chance of growing an ecosystem and then they just have to compete with the existing l2s on ethereum which obviously have all the favor have all the network effect have a lot of um you know Goodwill within the community already there and on top of that as well they have their own native tokens where people believe that the value of these tokens for better or worse and this is not something I believe people believe this that the value of these L1 tokens comes from obviously it's used as a staking token but also it's used as a fee token so would they pivot to being in L2 and then still use that token to pay for fees or would they change to something like eth I think still using the token to pay for fees would hamper adoption because a lot of people don't want to buy those tokens just to interact with the chain and if they're coming in from eth they have sorry if they're coming from ethereum they have eth so you're going to have to accept each to be used as fees it is a better unit of account it's much more liquid it's a better a better money right so that's going to be the the asset that dominates your ecosystem so what what ends up happening to your token well you now have to Pivot that token to being something else maybe it's a governance token maybe it's a staking token for sequences to accrue value there but in saying all that I don't believe that most of the token's value comes from its uses like paying fees I believe most of the tokens value um especially when it gets to like Ethan btc's level comes from its money-ness and its store of value uh uh whereas a token can be equity-like where it will accrue dividends for example from like uh from fees being paid on the network and that fear of when you're going to token holders but that's very different from the token occurring value because it is a fee token in of itself so those are just some of the things as I said I don't want to go on too long about this but those are some of the things that I think May mean that pretty much like the majority vast majority of our ones will probably never become l2s themselves but they may get forked you know there is already a project working on a Solana a fork of Solana as an L2 on top of ethereum so maybe they get [ __ ] and and turned into l2s by other people but them actually pivoting themselves yeah it remains to be seen maybe one or two do it I'm not sure which which ones those would be um I don't think it's unfortunately I don't think it's going to be Cosmos because they have a pretty different ecosystem to other l1s where the cosmos thing is like the cosmos like Hub right and then you've got these spokes around so you would have to coordinate the spokes to also integrate with it it just wouldn't really work and algorand I mean admittedly I don't know that much about algorithm end but it doesn't strike me as one that would actually pivot to being an L2 either um so yeah those are some of the reasons why I think it for the vast majority it's not going to happen yeah I agree agree with most everything that you said and and I agree with in some circumstances with everything that you said and then there are other circumstances which I think the opposite is a worthy case to consider I I do agree with you that the ego and Primacy of some layer ones gets in the way of them becoming layer twos I think if you can name the founder of a layer one and you follow them on crypto Twitter and follow their tweets that Founder's not going to roll their thing into a layer two uh because there's there's like ego and audacity involved right like layer ones want to be layer ones they want to exist in of their own right so the major layer ones the mayor players right the major alt layer ones I don't think we would consider it I don't think we'll see those rolling up into layer twos because like like what you're saying it's animating defeat if you are a layer one your asset is competing in the world of money or at least trying to and if you become a layer two you are no longer competing in the world of money right you you are yeah you're waving the flag and saying like hey the ethereum ecosystem the Peloton of the ethereum ecosystem is going to outrace me and I and I totally understand that like a lot of layer one Founders the valuations depend on that not being true um they are now on the other side of things there are there are layer one chains that don't have that demand to or desire to be a layer one money and they and they are meant to do certain things that aren't necessarily be ethereum Killers right more more like chain specific more ecosystem you unique layer ones that like again the founders aren't so egotistical uh they are willing to work inside of a Peloton but perhaps going into and what is a Peloton a Peloton is like the line of bicyclists who are all in the line and they're all drafting off of each other That's my kind of vision for the layer 2 ecosystem and people that want to join the herd uh join the ecosystem I think uh and might be compelled by all of the economic activity they might be uh compelled to do that and I don't want to only make it an egotistical thing but also it's just like it is it is a tribal thing and so if you are a crypto tribe and your tribe is centered around a layer one that layer one pivoting into a layer two is like against a social contract of that one ecosystem like they don't want to violate that social contract that layer One Tribe wants to be a layer One Tribe uh and so making the choice to become a layer two is against kind of probably the will of the community and also just like yeah yeah I was just on that point the culture right and the reason why I bring up the egotistical Founders is because if you have a Founder that's egotistical that's the culture that's set right that's the culture that the community adopts that's that's the tribalism that they adopt and I think a good analogy here just to show what uh what we mean by and you know the how hard it would be for an L1 to Pivot to an L2 as well is can you imagine like let's use the analogy of of different nation states in on on earth right could you imagine China becoming an ally with the US right and then the U.S effectively uh not owning China but like China just admitting defeat to the US imagine the implications of that right and this is on obviously the extreme Grand scale Grand side of things but this is how to think about it where you have your own culture you have your own social contracts you have your own ecosystem your own Community your own tribe and then you basically say well okay we're not going to be our own thing anymore we're going to get we know we're gonna do it here um you know and and we've seen this play out in real life for tens of thousands of years but just by force where countries invade other countries they go there and they're like okay well you're on our part of our country but the integration is very hard because uh there's different cultures right and there's different uh there's the different people that have different belief systems and and different things like that and that's why you've seen all the problems in in the world uh around multiculturalism right and I'm all for multiculturalism I mean I live in Australia and we're very Multicultural here but a lot of problems stem from that because of that Clashing of cultures because of that Clashing of belief systems and social contracts and and and culture over thousands of years so when you take that as an analogy and apply it to crypto it's the same thing they're different communities and not at the same scale of course but different communities belief systems you know the Solana for example the Solana ecosystem has a very different belief system about what blockchain should be to what ethereum does it's the polar opposite Solana believes in the monolithic Vision ethereum believes in the modular Vision you can't you couldn't get Solana to integrate with you exactly exactly and if you try to and if you try to cross-pollinate it may work but it's not going to work at scale right there may be some people that can get along with each other but it's very different because you're going to have this tug of war going on constantly with the Solana Community being like no you know this is how it should be done you know this is the the monolithic approach we believe in this approach they can have the ethereum people being like no this is how it should be done so keeping those things separate is much better than putting them together and then progress being halted basically because could you imagine the ethereum governance process being weighed down by people who just don't align it all with ethereum values and what ethereum wants to be so yeah that's how I think about this thing and this is like level 10 crypto stuff whenever we talk about this stuff I always feel like I lose some people because it's such an intricate thing and such a nuanced thing but this is what powers blockchains at the end of the day this is what forms strong change this is why ethereum and Bitcoin you know given credit there are so strong because they have this they have these strong social layers they have these strong kind of things um and these other ecosystems they're always trying to grow they're always trying to break out they're always trying to form their own but it's very hard right it is very hard and most will fail yeah so going back to the original question from Glee man what alt layer ones are most likely to Pivot to being layer twos uh I think the answer is there are some that are more likely than others um there's the specifics you know impossible to tell I will say that I have a meeting on my calendar with a layer one leader call it that is interested in asking that question of like what does it mean and what does it take and what are the pros and cons of pivoting to a layer two so that conversation is not irrelevant like some layer ones are perhaps interested in joining the herd uh and I will leave all of that Alpha at that all right takes from crypto Twitter of course we're going to start with Eric Wall uh he says the switch of opinion from and layer two must be evm compatible or it's DOA Dead on Arrival to actually a layer two that doesn't take this chance to get far away from the evm is kind of missing an opportunity uh this is a kind of a hard tweet to read but he's saying that that take happened fast within me and no with no notice and I just woke up and felt uh one day felt different so let me just like re-encourage it reiterate this take again uh Eric Wallace saying that once upon a time he thought that all layer tubes must be evm compatible or else it's just not going to work and then he switched his opinion to actually a layer two does need to take the chance of getting away from the evm and if they don't it's missing an opportunity and that he switched his opinions very half very very fast uh with no notice he just woke up and one day felt different so Anthony again we were in like level eight nine or ten of of Twitter crypto Twitter terminology and conversation but what's your take here the conversation of like do Layer Two should they just be as evm equivalent as possible or should they take a chance and be very very different and I'll just add one a little bit more uh kind of context I would say things like Stark net are a layer two on ethereum that is extremely different and extremely specified and away from the evm also things like Aztec a very different very very unique and separated from the evm and then you have optimism which is like maximally evm equivalent arbitrum to polygon pretty similar and so there are there's a different strategy here so what's your take on these two uh perspectives so my take is actually Eric's next tweet where he said the correct take is probably let's try both and let the market decide this is what I have always said I've always said that the evm compatible stuff is fine it is obviously it obviously makes a lot of sense for teams to do this because the evm has a very strong Network effect and it's very easy to integrate with all the existing uh infrastructure that exists such as wallets and and stuff like that but at the same time there is an opportunity with and with l2s to do non-evm stuff because you do not need to follow the rules of the ethereum layer 1 protocol you only need to follow those rules to post your proofs and data down to it but anything else you can do whatever you want right you can build whatever construction you want and start as you said stock net is is doing stockway is doing this with starknet Aztec is doing this with their new um your privacy first roll-up which they've said and stated numerous times that they couldn't actually do what they wanted to do using the evm they have to build it from scratch so I am all in favor of trying both and letting the market decide side and in saying that I think the market so far has decided that the evm stuff is very valuable right it's very valuable and not just within the L2 space but within the L1 space as well because the alt l1s that actually had any kind of economic activity um most of them were evm compatible right like your Avalanche sub chain that was even compatible with your Phantom a few other things I think Solana during the bull market at least was not evm and had a bit of activity there for it for a little bit but hasn't really kept that but neither have any of the other l1's to be fair uh whereas the L2 EVMS have gotten you know pretty much most of the activity stock Nets growing you know it's going slower because it doesn't have that existing Network effect it needs to build it and then obviously Aztec will will have that that same kind of issue there but at the end of the day we're still very early in the game there's still millions and tens of millions hundreds millions of people to onboard so let's you know build these things let's see what people want to use what what what they find to be most user friendly where they find to be the most value and let's not dictate things and I'd be be probably like a little bit bearish on l2s if it was just evm stuff I would I would kind of be like oh this is a missed opportunity here we need to do more than that um and you know it's not just uh stockware and um and uh Aztec doing it either it's arbitrim actually doing it as well with their stylus thing where essentially you can uh code up smart contracts in uh non-solidity languages so basically any language that you want to use so that's another part of it as well that plays into this not limiting people to solidity but letting them code their smart contracts in other languages so yeah I mean as I said let's let the market decide at the end of the day yeah and it's also not just completely a binary choice of being evm equivalent or very very differentiated I think ZK sync is mostly evm compatible but there are like differences that actually do separate it and so it's nowhere near the specific specified end of the spectrum like Aztec or starknet but it's also not evm equivalent like arbitrary or optimism it's mostly evm compatible except for a few small nuances and then the zika k-sync Gambit is that those small changes produced outside outsized benefits with what can they can do on their chain like account abstraction for example account abstraction not evm equivalent immense benefits right and so that's why uh platforms like ZK sync and other ZK Roll-Ups begin with account abstraction out of the gate because people have elected that that choice is just a smart choice all right next take this is from nixo.eth and so this is a retweeting a picture coming from the e-staker subreddit and the title of this post on Reddit is had enough exited my validator and then continues and says sorry the apy is way too low Eve continually continually declining in price and exchanges are being shut down or charging a fortune in fees at this rate crypto will be a back alley A Relic I'd rather put the money into assets that appreciate and generate a decent return we'd all love that when crypto is with this difficult to use it will never see wide adoption and regardless the API is incredibly low for the effort and risk required see ya so X evaluators exiting the service and then nixo retweets this picture and says this is healthy and working as intended the ethereum proof of say consensus mechanism doesn't overpay for security like proof of work did if there are more than enough validators low yield encourages you to put your assets elsewhere validators are in service of ethereum not the other way around Anthony help me interpret this yeah so I I gave a pretty long kind of uh take on this on on the refuel the other day but I can kind of I condense it down a little bit uh just to give people the high level here so firstly the post that Nick so has shared there's a lot going on in that post it just seems like a very angry uh person um they're not just angry about you know eat staking they're angry about other things and it's funny because I think this was posted like at the bottom before we pumped or something or the local button before we pumped so another another funny thing but generally I guess the point here is that the issuance uh curve and the APR on of each staking is is variable right there's two sets of rewards there's consensus layer Awards and there's execution layer rewards they're both variable more validators come online less consensus layer rewards for for everyone uh unless uh execution layer rewards for everyone assuming the same demand now execution layer rewards are all are incredibly variable because they rely on tips and Mev Revenue so if gas is at 100 way you're going to be making a lot more as a validator than if gas is at 20K right but assuming same demand of 20 gray um then as more validators come online that APR is going to drop as well because it needs to be spread out among those validators so it remains to be seen at what point uh or what kind of I guess yield percentage people stop kind of crowding into each staking like is it three percent is it four percent right I think if you do like a backward looking APR over 30 days it's still like five and a half percent taking daily and weekly API is kind of useless even monthly is not great so you know because it's a yearly thing right you're extrapolating out a yearly kind of APR based on just like a day which I don't think is very very accurate um but it remains to be seen where people are going to to stop kind of plowing into staking because it just doesn't become worth it but that's the thing if they leave if people say oh crap the yield's so low I'm going to leave well okay then it'll reach up equilibrium where people will be like well okay uh I don't I'm not going to leave because the yield's actually good now because the yield goes up for everyone assuming same execution layer rewards um because the consensus layer Awards have to pay to less people and and obviously the yield grows up for everyone so it's a balancing act it it's designed to naturally reach an equilibrium based on supply and demand Dynamics and based on obviously preferences where there is a bit of a wrench that gets thrown into this is the extra yield you can get on things like lsts so for example people have been talking about eigenlayer and saying that okay well if the vanilla yield you're getting from the beacon chain is one percent right but then you restake and eigenlayer and they're paying four percent then your yield is like five percent right it remains to be seen if that yield is ethanominated but let's assume it is then you'll you've gotten five percent but you're only getting one percent from the beacon chain so that throws a wrench in things and that might be something to worry about later down the line when it comes to to ethereum's consensus and this is actually the main concern people bring up around eigenlayer but generally it's a balancing act as I said it's it's designed to reach an equilibrium all right coming up last take of the week this one's a short one this is crispronisky retweeting one of his own tweets and uh he goes for his initial tweet is when it feels like it'll never end it ends and I'm pretty sure he's talking about the regulatory fund which just felt like an onslaught for like almost a month straight then he retweets it and goes And So It Begins I think Chris is just calling for a pivot in sentiment which I definitely felt this week now it's only one week old uh maybe Gary gensler's got another shoe to drop or something but I think what Chris is really just saying here is man the storm felt really dark but the night is darkest before the dawn and all of a sudden you just need one or a few reasons to be bullish and all of a sudden it begins and he takes here I mean it's amazing how fast crypto sentiment changes just generally right and I think that because of the speed at which it can change it catches a lot of people off guard so I don't think that the sentiment change of the last week is going to lead us to a new kind of bull market anytime soon I still think it's going to take a little while for us to get to a full-blown crypto bull market from here but at the same time everyone's now like okay well was that it for the regulatory stuff are we actually entering an era of positive uh outside or external crypto institutions and people uh you know being positive on on crypto that's a speculation right now I think we might be as I said I did put out my own tweet where I said the it felt like the regulatory fad the bottom was in because uh it felt like they're overstepped but it remains to be seen I I don't like taking short-term things and extrapolating them out to the long term I don't like looking at like one week's worth of data and saying oh okay well that means the next year is going to be amazing because that's how you very quickly especially in in markets and investing get yourself wrecked so I of course just optimistic I say this I'm like okay this is a positive change this does feel like a wind change but let's see if it actually continues let's see if it's not just something that happened and that's going to be short-lived and then we just straight back to the you know what we were at before let's wait and see and then and then you know we are we'll see how it all plays out but this is also in when it comes to investing this is where the maximum Alpha comes from if you can accurately predict the win change or the sentiment change and accurately predict the timing of it you can make a lot of money because you place your bets at the right time but most people don't do that they wait for confirmation just like I was saying you know you wait for confirmation but the point of confirmation you might be buying an asset two or three times what it was at the point of a win change so it's like the risk reward curve just gets you know better and better as you go up but the sorry the sorry the risk gets lower and lower the reward gets lower and lower as you get closer to the win you know to confirming that win change rather than uh betting on it when the risk is still high right all right so closing out this weekly roll up and once again thank you so much for for coming in and substitute teaching last question for you where do you bullish on oh man like eighth of course obviously um like that's not even a question but there's generally I am uh but lately becoming uh very bullish on like just the app specific l2s just because they're finally becoming a thing right uh we didn't talk about it but Zora chain uh launched uh I think today I was on the agenda what's up with that well yeah we did an entire podcast with that with Jacob from Zora so sorry yeah uh news of the week uh Zora launches sorry for not including that in the weekly Roll-Up yeah yeah so so zorochain um Avo which is an options trained built and op stack has been getting a lot of traction lately so just these kind of app l2s I'm getting more and more bullish on um uh because they're actually getting traction they're actually going live so that yeah and and I think that that's going to be a trend over the over the next few months at least uh but then the pendulum might swing back to generalized l2s once once base launches because that's obviously going to be a huge launch and going to bring in a ton of new people so yeah that's that's kind of what I'm bullish on but what about you what are you bullish on oh I love that you've learned that that's what you're asked can you roll up you've done this enough times uh I'm kind of back to the conversation we were just having which is that sometimes bullish sentiment begets bullish sentiment which is what you were saying sometimes the wins just change uh and I remember going through the 2018 to 2020 bear Market thinking like man what is it gonna take to get us out of this we are so deep in this hole and all of a sudden crypto Twitter just woke up bullish one day and I know you always tweet but got bullish one day the entire industry just decides to be bullish like we're just done being bearish and all of a sudden the the I don't know call it the bear colored glasses turns into Bowl colored glasses and uh you see that like okay we dumped off of the SEC news but then we just rallied after uh rallied right after it right and so like what is how is news impacting markets like well we saw a 15 rise in Bitcoin in the last week or so and so we have capacity to go up and I think as soon as the wins change as soon as a bullish sentiment comes we can look back at the last year of innovation all of the progress of layer twos including the layer twos that don't have tokens you know cough Zora Network the brand new one and we can look back at all the things that we've built and be like I'm not taking crazy pills all of that is really bullish I would like to get exposure to that before like before anyone else and all of a sudden like the desperation turns into hunger and like good hunger right bullish hunger uh and so uh I don't know if this is that like you said like no one really knows when the winds change we could be back to being bearish next week but I do think that the time is running out of there's like there I had oh my gosh and I know you had this too I had so much bullish fatigue at the end of 2021 I was like I'm just done being bullish I'm just so tired of this like the we're talking about the next like web3 gaming Ponzi and nft like I'm done and I feel like we're I don't know if we're at that point now but I'm kind of done being bearish like right like I'm I'm fatigued of being bearish and I think that works both ways and so what am I bullish on is I'm bullish on the Sparks this Embers of bullish sentiment be getting further bullish sentiment and so that's that's what I was John mm-hmm yeah I mean I agree with all of that I think that uh yeah I I like that sentiment of being sick of the bull market especially for us multi-cyclers and being like we want to break from this you know bear Market would be welcomed even though we we kind of forget I think it's for yeah we definitely forget how painful they are but at the same time they're a necessary thing they're a cleansing of the ecosystem uh and just like the bear markets are necessary so are the bull markets so yeah even if this wind change takes another 12 months to actually play out and to get us into a new bull market uh if we look back on this in 12 months and we can say okay well that was when it changed you know that's when the winds change that's when the sentiment changed and that's what led to where we are today who knows maybe we will maybe we won't I'm looking forward to it yeah and maybe one last piece of clarity on this or just commentary the wins changed very clearly during the last bear Market when compound released uh their governance token it was the first utterance of governance token that we've ever had and liquidity mining was a thing which created field farming and that was a very clear moment it's like yo the winds have changed there are things to be polish on is also went to Nash asset was issued like hey we have a reason to issue tokens uh and that was an endogenous Factor whereas this BlackRock ETF and Trad five bullishness on crypto is more of an exogenous factor I do think we need an exogenous factor to truly spark a bull market because what every single bar Market that cryptos ever had has become has come from an appetite for tokens an appetite for minting new assets I don't know if we have that yet I'm not sure about that um I've don't think we have that yet but I have been saying over the past two weeks especially that I think that we could potentially be gearing up for a layer two summer in the next six to five months where that brings that back cheap yes you know places for people to play with tokens will be launched base will go live being a lot of new users so yeah I I really do think that we could get a repeat of D5 summer if the timing's right I think the timing will probably be right yeah it just yeah maybe just a little bit more commentary in Alpha here I do know of at least two startups um that definitely was planning on releasing a token last bull market and then the bear Market hit and they were like we're gonna sit on our hands and release our token later so there is pent-up airdrops that people are just waiting for bullish sentiment to re-emerge so that they can release their airdrop and so not only is there like okay once we have a bullish Catalyst we have all these layer twos that can issue tokens but there were other tokens that were going to be issued a couple years ago that have not yet been in issued because people were like okay the founders were like the this the Market's not right we'll we'll release it in a bull market and so you you know that there's some kindling ready to light a fire when the sentiment uh when bullish sentiment begets bullish sentiment mm-hmm yeah exactly okay Anthony cesano thank you so much for tapping in once again of course uh the daily guay is where you can get your daily dose of Anthony cesano 30 minutes every single day is where I get my news it's where so many others in the ethereum ecosystem get their news uh you can go to YouTube and type in Daily guay uh I get it on my podcast uh the finding the podcast feed for the daily quiz a little bit hard so at me on Twitter I can send it to you uh Anthony any last words about the daily grade before we sign off here I think you covered it quite well yeah if anyone wants to hear me rant about ethereum every every weekday for 30 minutes then the other ways where you'll find me yeah and you'll also find him actually on the weekly roll up twice in July this time with Ryan because I am taking my first ever vacation ever from I think I need one of those yeah I think we need one of those well if we're if we're talking about a bull market starting like I need to take a vacation before that starts uh because I'm not ready for that uh anyways so more of Anthony coming uh but if you can't wait for uh Anthony and RSA to have their first ever weekly roll-up debut you can go to YouTube and type in the daily way risks and disclaimers bankless Nation you know the deal crypto is risky Defy is risky you can lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot foreign [Music]
