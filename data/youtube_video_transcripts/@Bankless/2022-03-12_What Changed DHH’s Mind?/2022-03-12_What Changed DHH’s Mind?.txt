i was interested to learn that you've actually been skeptical about crypto yeah it rang like i was faced with a cult because it would be a set of of theses of talking points that were just repeated ad nauseam over and over again by people who dressed a certain way and looked a certain way and usually with the laser eyes right it was felt like a bunch of people talking their own book hey i bought some coins five minutes ago i'd like them to go up please so shut the hell up if you have any criticism that might make them go down it had some of these religious whiffs to it that it wasn't necessarily so much about practical applicability today where i was wrong was a little bit on that time horizon yeah a lot of things aren't ready that doesn't mean it couldn't be in five years or two or in ten some things does take a long time you look at virtual reality for example i remember watching the lawnmower man in 95 thinking holy we're all gonna live in the metaverse in about two years from now and what happened nothing that's what happened for about 20 years
