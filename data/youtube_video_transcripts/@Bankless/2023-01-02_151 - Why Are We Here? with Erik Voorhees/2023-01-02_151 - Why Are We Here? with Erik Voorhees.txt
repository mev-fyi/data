the reason I'm here the reason I'm doing this crypto thing and have been for 11 years is because I want to separate money and State I think money is one of the most important Technologies in society it's something we interact with every day the flows of money direct and govern human action everywhere at every scale and something so important needs to not be under a monopoly provider period so I'm here to separate money and state and every technology every blockchain every app that helps further that is something that I'm going to be supporting so that's that's why I'm here certainly some people are here to just like make a bunch of money but I'm here for the principle of decentralizing money away from the hands of the state welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance the SE is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys first bankless episode of 2023. are you ready this is Eric Voorhees and he doesn't waste a word in this episode he never does we talk about SBF we talk Cycles we talk crypto values we talk about what matters and why we're really here as the point as we get into this a few takeaways for you number one a discussion on his legendary debate with SBF that happened in November of last year 11 days before everything with SBF went crazy and this is the first time we've caught up with him what are his Reflections now we talk about that also we talk about the macro cycle the bull bear case has it been the same as the previous ones was 2022 the same or different if if it was different what was different what are the lessons that we can learn moving into the next cycle and most importantly we talk about crypto values and why we're all here David we got a lot to discuss during the debrief what's on your mind I I think I really want to take uh this moment in the debrief to kind of go back and talk about a lot of the core Theses that bank list stands upon and Ryan we did a I think a really good job in the early days of this episode of this podcast laying out some of the core principles uh that that we really think power this industry uh and then uh I mean we kind of assumed that everyone knew them and then we moved on to other things but it's been a while since we talked about the protocol sync thesis for example and so since we were having Eric on and since Eric is such a first principally managed person a person who thinks very deeply I want to go back and

one of the greatest Advocates of open and permissionless systems that we have in the space certainly an important voice and has been very recently he's likely also soon to be featured in the upcoming documentary series about the downfall of SBF I gotta think that's coming pretty soon because the last time we had you on Eric uh was to run this whole SPF debacle and you were actually you had a debate with SBF about 12 days I think before all of this went down we'll get to that and more but Eric first of all how you doing I'm good um I'm good it's good to see you guys thanks for having me back that was quite a bomb that dropped the last month and a half um so I have all my appendages still looks like you guys do as well and we'll just keep rolling yeah I um this is part of the reason why we wanted to have you on the podcast is I feel like at this point in crypto you're pretty bomb proof and uh we want to ask a little bit later about the magnitude of this specific bomb and how it's measured against the other bombs that we've seen before but can you help us with the high level question because coming out of 2020 too of course um the headline is some things went wrong in crypto we were talking to some folks outside of the space and media and others and we're like hey how does crypto look from the outside and I remember Sagar came on the podcast from from uh breaking points and he was like this he was like I'm not gonna lie to you it's looking pretty bad uh that is the impression outside of the crypto space and I want to ask you uh this question where do you think we went wrong in 2022 or maybe it was the months leading up to it where did we go wrong as a community as an industry I think my response to that is is to cringe a little bit at the collective uh use of we here right like um crypto is this diverse tapestry of individual people and uh many of those people are quite unsavory many of them are absolute Heroes and lots of people in between so where did we go wrong I don't know I feel like this was a good year for me um I made a lot of good decisions uh I think you guys have done a beautiful job with your show it's become you know one of the most important in the space and I really value it at the same time you know SPF um where he went wrong was stealing 10 billion dollars of customer money so that much is simple uh I I think it's important that like we don't describe ourselves as a collective to the outside world um people have different goals and views of what crypto should be the culture is between these different chains are different and I think that's actually part of our strength is that we're not this like monolithic group that I'll think and act the same way um so yeah that's where I'd leave it so Eric um we're just having a conversation uh in some a similar vein with a vitalik and he was talking about like kind of terms we use and this one specific blog post he he chose to use the word ethereum in the title the ethereum ecosystem talk about ethereum rather than crypto and there is an element any study was still playing kind of playing around with with that but there is an element of like um there are some group labels here right and how do we um how do we represent ourselves to mainstream so for example if I say I am in crypto right now at this point in time that feels a little embarrassing now I can explain what I actually mean and I'm like oh I'm one of these crypto people and I'm not one of those crypto people but how do we come up with labels for this sort of thing or organic labels I'm like I'm part of the decentralization crypto side of things not part of the fintech Bros side of things I what what is that I I don't quite have the words to sort of describe this and um unfair though it might be a lot of us have been operating under this group label of of crypto how do we get out of that trap well I still proudly wear that label I think crypto is where an incredible Revolution is happening and um so I don't shy away from that at all I think uh things like labels and the words we use for some of this stuff are are somewhat superficial and The Superficial Observer will get tricked into into thinking things that they read in headlines and if we play that if we play that game it's just going to be unfulfilling and probably a losing proposition the reason crypto is cool is because of what we're building and so the the constant focus on the building on the software on the technology uh on the principles that is what we should care about and people will assign labels to us and and that's all fine but it washes away with the latest trends so um I wouldn't worry too much about that and and all also whenever a crypto is in a bear Market the reputation from the outside is just trash um and then these same people who don't care to look into what this actually is or what it's about get totally blindsided when the when the next rally happens and then they a bin at the top and um you know those aren't the kind of people that we should care to um to court you know we should be we should be courting people that build quality software and um and that's really it with regards to the point that crypto is a diverse cohort of people that have many different attitudes and some people are fraudulent scammers who steal 10 billions of dollars and other people are public good maximalists and want to build public systems like obviously very different collection of people that come to the space uh cryptos got something for everyone no matter who you are that's kind of the the one of the big selling points of what this industry can provide and when you say that um we can't blanket all of crypto into one like label um that I if I definitely think is the goal of this industry we want crypto to be as large as the internet itself and no one would ever dare to say that like the internet population is this one ongoing community of Internet goers it's diverse but um to to take the other side of this conversation I'll say that crypto is actually really small and sometimes and especially during bear markets it kind of feels like we're all in the same room together we are like all one degree of separation from everyone else in this industry it doesn't go that far and so like who are who are and I'll take some responsibility here and this has been a theme on the bankless podcast lately uh with some of the episodes that we've recorded is like responsibility right and when somebody in my industry steals 10 billion dollars or somebody in my industry destroys an algorithmic stable coin even though I would did not take part in that whatsoever I still feel responsible because that's my industry that's the thing that I represent uh and and so this has been something I've hopefully trying to reflect on and move forward into next cycle as in like you know SPF he he like really rubbed a lot of the ethereum community the wrong way but we didn't we didn't speak out against him enough dokwon definitely rubbed us the wrong way but we really didn't come hard on him and so like to some degree I just want your perspective on this to some degree I do feel responsible for some of the bad things that happened in this industry in 2022 because it's my industry uh what would you say to that Eric it's an interesting perspective I don't think you should feel any responsibility for the sins of other people period um yeah that's not on you guys you guys are individuals bankless is its own projects and you should be very proud of what you're building it's not it's not our um it's not our responsibility to find every sin that others are committing and indeed there are so many in the ecosystem that that would be a Fool's errand anyway you know um there's a lot of noise in crypto and to call out all the noise is uh not that useful because there's so much of it calling out the virtue where you see it I think is the goal when you see profoundly important projects built soundly and with good principle highlight those um but don't don't beat yourself up just because like you missed one of the many sinners well Eric let me ask you then this is uh so just your practical thoughts so uh we had SPF on the bankless podcast I know you were there for one of those episodes but we did a previous episode with SBF in March I think it was March David of last year and so this was an interesting episode we had done an episode with Brian Armstrong from coinbase uh we were scheduled to do one with CZ from binance we kind of want to get we think it's important for the crypto Community to get in the head of all of the biggest exchange leads right I mean Jesse Powell's important voice in this uh to hear how they think and when we had Brian on the part podcast he was like very much uh talking about values and talking about um you know building and our impression going to our episode with SBF was uh in coming out of that was different right that he had built this exchange was a fast mover really didn't care about the values of our industry but even if he doesn't care about the the values it appeared at the time like the FDX exchange was successful and and you know we have this Mantra on bankless if they adopt crypto protocols they adopt crypto values so even if he doesn't believe it as long as he's building on top of crypto systems that could be a good thing a lot of people in the aftermath of all of this have said why did you bring that scammer on the bankless podcast in March why did you give him a voice you have an important platform in the space you gave him a voice um what do you think about that like is there an element of we should we should hold ourselves again like obviously we didn't know at the time no one did that he was stealing depositor funds okay um that would be a different story had we known this but like what what do we do like I'm kind of like leaving 2022. you absolutely should do that bring people on okay who are important in the industry unequivocally Sam was important unequivocally like he built something um big and meaningful and at the time we didn't know that meaningful meant horrible or fraudulent but part of what you guys do you know as media in this space is like um pulling these voices up for the community to see and and people can make their own judgments it doesn't serve anyone to just let people you know wander around in the Darkness so the those people who um who are getting mad at you weren't weren't out there saying you know Sam's been stealing customer money back in March so um I just I think they're they're like the the men that are not in the arena you know and they're gonna Lobby insults after things happen and that's just part of the noise you know see through it and um bring people on and vet them and ask good questions and promote the principles that matter like another um I guess another comment on this is the focus on individual people is somewhat of a trap you know like uh if you bring 10 people on and focus on them as individuals that that can be useful and important but what's more important is like what did they build and how is it structured and why is one structure better than another right so like if you bring on Hayden from uniswap and you bring on Brian from coinbase it's interesting to learn about both of those people as people but it's more important to learn about why uniswap and coinbase are different right um and those those principles of what they've built I think are what we should be focusing on especially because we're never going to know um before it happens who the evil people are but we can know how things are designed and uh that's part of the whole premise of cryptocurrencies that you can know how things are designed without having to trust the people and without having to get behind their reputation well uh Thanks for opening this up and I guess it turned into a little bit of a therapy session for uh for David myself but uh I really appreciate your your guidance and thoughts on this um David I think you've got a a question about the aftermath of the whole SBF FDX thing for Eric because he was a a player in that uh I'm not gonna say Eric that you were the cause of that necessarily but it sort of led into a very interesting chain of events yeah so Eric we had our conversation you had your debate with Eric or excuse me with SPF on October 28th uh FTX pause withdrawals on November 6th uh and then filed for bankruptcy on November 11th very quickly uh after you had your your public debate with SPF while you were watching these events unfold just put us into the to the mind of Eric Voorhees what was that like for you uh watching all of this Fallout happen just so recently after you had this debate with with SPF yeah I think of all the calamities I've seen this was the biggest Calamity that has ever befallen crypto um not on all metrics like Mount gox was more existentially dangerous but the in terms of the the speed with which this unfolded and um just the just the story of hubris and like that character Arc of Sam and how quickly it it changed was really really profound and I certainly had no suspicion that anything untoward was going on with that Exchange and during that debate you know one of the things I was trying to do is like give you know I I was going to try to tear Sam apart on the principles but I wanted to give him the credit of being like a successful entrepreneur and building something really important and I think I said that multiple times in that debate um and then to learn just like a week later that not only is he trying to bring down all this horrible regulation on the industry but is actually the one causing the biggest fraud ever was yeah it was surreal I just watched the debate again a few days ago and the whole thing was was really surreal um I wonder how I wonder how threatened or uncomfortable he was from from those from the fraud that was going on during the debate because he definitely seemed off yeah and during the debate I was like man I'm really getting him you know like I've made him so uncomfortable um and I was taking a little bit of pleasure in that but I guess I guess a lot of it might have been because he was sitting on a 10 billion dollar fraud right um the the way I think about this uh conversation uh because SBF was talking most of the time he would he had the microphone like maybe like 90 of the time of that debate and you were only saying one or two or three very sharp sentences it felt like watching a soccer game where one team had the possession of the ball for for 90 minutes uh for like 90 of the time but the team that had the possession of the ball for 10 minutes scored like eight goals yeah well that that's like how you get a good message across has to do with the message and in how few words you can do it and he was just like all over the place and um he I think he was struggling because he didn't have like any foundation of principle on which he was arguing for these things yes that's something that I'm really taking away from this is that he was flustered he was confused he was erratic and chaotic and very agitated right and you were like stoic and poignant and just so sharp uh and it's like looking back in hindsight this is one of the big years of 2020 where like hindsight is really playing out like in hindsight Sam bankman freed was spraying millions of dollars into Political day Nations uh real estate in the Bahamas uh an arena like an attempted Taylor Swift sponsorship and in hindsight I think if anyone just like added those numbers up you could probably come to some reasonable conclusion that something's not great uh over on on the other side of of FTX because the numbers were so high but then and then when you add that up with like the agitation like every like the puzzle pieces are all there we just like took the actual fraud to for us to put them together yeah I don't know I think that might be um backfitting the story a little bit like he had raised tons of money and FTX was a wildly successful and profitable Exchange um most of the most of the really visible things that he did in terms of sponsorship in PR absolutely were compatible with a legitimate business you know one that is spending a ton on PR but um that stuff itself wasn't that stuff itself wasn't caused or enabled by him stealing customer money like the or put put differently the big expense that his whole Enterprise Empire suffered wasn't the FTX Arena it was that Alameda lost billions of dollars trading poorly that that dwarfs any of the outward symbols that that we saw so if you focus I think even too much on things like the arena you still are missing that what the the crime here went on behind the scenes and um wouldn't have been known unless you were in in the books that these private companies watching it yeah I do agree going to that episode um very much my impression was of Sam bagman freed and I think the you know industry impression was like this is a success very successful exchange operator who has just moved fast um out competed some of his peers uh to get ahead but the difference in my mind if you abstract values between a um an SPF and a CZ or something like this from binance or like a you know some of the other large exchanges was not a stark I mean like for all appearances it was just kind of like uh you could be the same thing I guess one thing that I can't resolve and um after this episode it um you know surreal was a word used because it was surreal when all of this stuff came at first I didn't believe it then it would be it started to become obvious I just started thinking back to this episode and uh trying to get into the Mind space of SBF so he knows he's short like first of all my first mind was like like that really happened right like genuinely this was a question for me and I know the two of you were there and it really happened like this is kind of uh you know I'm not going down a simulation Theory Ali but like that was that was a seriously a moment for me uh but then after that acknowledging that it really happened what was the um mind space of SBF in to actually number one engage with engage with regulators and put out a post uh that is clearly going to be seen as a complete betrayal of crypto values when you start talking about D5 front ends having to kind of register with uh nation state governments all over the world clearly a betrayal clearly we would have a problem with that if you've paid any attention to crypto for any monochrome of time you know that we're gonna have a problem with that and uh then the getting the headspace to actually come on and have a debate so um you know Sam is open to you to coming on the podcast when we scheduled it at the time and then we said you know it would be great to actually talk to you about this Sam after you put your post out in response to him is Eric Voorhees are you willing to do a debate with him and he said yes and then he came into that conversation in my mind completely unprepared to to take a reasoned approach against your post which he had to have read in advance which was a principled uh take on on on crypto and D5 and then came into that so utterly unprepared why would you do this like this is what does it still doesn't make sense to me and it and it dovetails with I guess kind of the media tour after like before he now he's in jail before he uh was actually wrestling Good morning America this media tour why would you go and have a very public debate on crypto values when you yourself are 10 billion dollars plus short and like I just I don't understand the Mind space of it and I'm not asking for like a psychology you know you know expose but like does that strike you as weird have you been able to make any sense of this Eric what what has certainly been weird was his media tour following the collapse very weird um but I think when we have the debate I don't know that he was feeling like everything was falling apart I think he was probably stressed that like the situation was a little tenuous but um I think even for a week after that I mean until until the CZ tweet about selling the ftt token until that I think Sam thought it was all under control and um it kind of it it makes more sense when you think of it like that and if you read his own messages leading up and immediately after cz's tweet they sound like someone who doesn't really feel like it's going to fall apart you know like he because he said things that if if you knew things were falling apart you wouldn't say so I think he had you know Supreme hubris up until up until that morning when it was announced that he was selling FTX to CZ you know that was like the capitulation of okay now now he knows horrible things have happened though he didn't know how bad it was at the time that makes sense but like what was that delusion was that no if you think about it differently so like from what I understand the ftt token was collateral backing the loan of customer funds to Alameda if in a different world we had hit a bull market you know back then and ftt doubled or tripled over a few months um the problem of that customer money not being there it gets less and less right it only becomes a problem if a bank run starts and if the price of cryptos are falling generally especially the ftt token um but he didn't know that that was that was going to happen so he he certainly justified in his head that like there's a a very plausible and maybe likely chance that all this is fine he did not appreciate what a true bear Market in crypto is you know this is one problem with being a tourist is that like you've never actually been through that um so he did not have a an emotional appreciation for what many of us have dealt with and he just had that hubris that that leads so many people astray all right so uh in an alternate reality you're saying Eric maybe this did this didn't happen it did it didn't have to play out like this anyway managed to skirt by and like continue and everything on paper at least is is still sort of solvent even though you're operating some sort of fractional Reserve scheme of some sort there's a world out there where all of this he gets past this bump and he gets through it and he's absolutely fine uh can you talk about that world So like um that's also scary to me that such an individual would be able to accrue maybe more power in that alternate World be able to um skirt by and you'll make it through this um it's very Touch and Go situation and continue to do the sort of things that he was doing um that was another reflection post that that surreal ordeal as well do you have any thoughts on on that Eric is it like are you glad that the um the cancer not of the individual but like the cancer of this corruption has been cut out of crypto what would happen if that tumor was allowed to grow yeah so one one possible path is that if the market had really rallied Sam would have resolved all the all the issues with some time and then like gone on the up and up that's probably very unlikely right especially someone someone who's first of all willing to commit that kind of atrocity and then gets away with it is probably not going to have a come to Jesus moment and change their beliefs um so it's very possible that if that happened he would have just you know doubled down and continued risking customer money in a bigger and bigger way and it could have been a blow up of you know 5x the size a year later so it's good that it was rooted out for sure um but yeah he probably thought he had a path to to making this all work out and certainly if that token had gone 10x over the next year there's numerous ways he could have um been solvent and and no one would have been the wiser what do you think of the other sort of soft power he appeared to be accruing in DC as well um so this interfacing working on legislation with with lawmakers and that was a repeated articulation um you know that I remember from from the debate was was um this comment that like Sam if you're gonna be at the table like you have to represent crypto values like please please do this and the fact that he was engaged at this level what what does this tell you where there's this line in the debate where you talked about um going to the the land of Mordor you're talking about DC at the time but like that's who was representing crypto in the land of Mordor um what are your Reflections on that well for many many years I've lamented that people seek protection from the state in principle like I think this is a sickness in society it's it's like a new form of of religion in which people see problems that are real and they have this appeal to this thing called you know democracy or government um and kind of everyone knows that politicians are slimy no one's happy with how Congress actually acts and yet they continue giving them larger and larger and larger budgets and continue thinking that like at the next election we'll just get the right people in and if we just make a new bill and a new law like that will be the one that cures it it's some kind of like psychological sickness and um so this was such an incredible example of an advocate of that world who used the slogan you know the safe and regulated exchange or the safe and regulated way to buy Bitcoin that was ftx's slogan um and he's going to to get new rules written for the industry and an observer before all this happened you know from the outside if they saw like who I am and what I advocate and who Sam is and what he advocates I would be the villain right because I'm here advocating that like markets handle the problems of the world better than coercive governments do but that's a very minority position um most people looking at this would have praised Sam said he's working within the system he's he's the upstanding citizen here and Eric is just like this radical extremist who you know no one should take him seriously can I can I say Eric that was actually the reaction on Capitol Hill we heard of course some people who are plugged in that um yeah Eric had some good points but Sam overall won the debate in Capitol Hill to to watch and and I'm biased here right because I want people to think I won the debate but if I put on my most um dispassionate objective hat and watch that debate from a pure debate and ideas discussion perspective it is impossible to say that I lost that debate I think you could just be a non-english speaker and just listen to the debate and the tone and be like yeah Sam did not win that yeah regardless of political ideology just like as a debate um that's an absurd statement but uh it certainly shouldn't surprise anyone that people in DC want DC to have more power like that's why they're there that's what they do um it's on us in the crypto world to push back against that and to stop making these appeals to regulation one thing that has dismayed me since this whole Fallout is you know like after this occurred on various podcasts many companies changed their marketing pitch um to be more about how how they're really safe and so many of them went to the appeal of how many licenses they have and how regulated they are and and all this stuff and it's just like the same mistakes over and over again like our Salvation is in open source immutable code period it is not in any kind of blessing or anointment from DC Eric I want to start to zoom out a little bit because one of the main reasons why we wanted to talk to you today is just to kind of get out of the bull market tunnel vision look because now we're definitely out of the bull market for sure uh and kind of just want to zoom out uh and help go from focusing on 2020 to 2022 and start focusing on the whole crypto project as a whole um and in order to start that conversation I kind of want to ask you as someone who's been through every single Market cycle in this industry 2013 to 2017 to 2021 the all the Peaks before 2011 that was the most painful of all well okay I'll I'll I didn't actually think that there was a cycle there but again that's just my my naive 2017 cycler before the birth of the universe it's like dark to me I didn't even know that time the middle of the Big Bang Yeah Yeah was this cycle exceptional in any way was this cycle unique or was this just a logical extrapolation of the craziness of the the Peaks and the depression of the troughs like was this cycle unique in any way it was unique in the shape of the curve there there wasn't a blow off top this time like the prior bubbles all had like a very traditional speculative bubble that built up and then turned into like an absurd blow off top um this one didn't like it had kind of a muted bull market that took Bitcoin up around 60k and then we had like a recession for six months and then it kind of got back up to that level and then fell again um so that was a that was a little weird that caught me off guard um but in general the same phenomenon is is there people get excited about things um and it gets a little ahead of itself and then when it falls apart everyone like you know walks away and thinks the whole thing's dead so that's all very normal and traditional in 2022 we saw the destruction of uh a set of individuals that all kind of carry the same common denominators behind them uh dokwon the three areas Capital Squad uh SPF were all they all had their egos about them some some more than others but there was just a common denominator of hubris behind so many of the stories of destruction of 2022 um which led to so much of the contagion right um it was it was this also true in other Cycles I don't really necessarily remember this happening in 2017 but like how what has been the story of personalities in hubris as as bull markets go on this one was definitely more focused on some specific people um and their failures uh and certainly like as numbers get larger you tend to get more hubris um there was no Hubris in the 2011 bubble because the whole thing was just so small and like you know the wealthiest person in crypto had fifteen thousand dollars um but but now things are getting big and we're talking about billions of dollars and especially when people make money very quickly and very you know it just arrives fast and if their moral character is not great going into it um they'll get carried away and the the hubris sets in very quickly like of all the hard things there is to do in a good life or to build a company or to navigate the crypto Waters one of the easiest things to do is just not be a dick right like just it's a slow hanging fruit just low hanging fruit it's a low bar like just just realize you know all your own flaws that that some good portion of anything good you've done has been due to Locker circumstance and that probably the good things you've done have been because other people were helping you and you're working with them and to just like be humble um it's important like it's needed for the industry we're our ambition is to take over how the entire Financial system works like our ambition speaks for itself and as we succeed in that um if it's if it's paired with an ego or hubris at best it just doesn't look good and speaks poorly of our character but at worst um leads people astray and causes these kind of catastrophes hubris and ego is definitely like a theme of 2022 for sure um what other what other lessons for the bull markets and bear markets that many of us missed are there any other lessons that stand out in historical uh historical Market Cycles I mean this lesson that people keep needing to learn is the dangers of custodial exchanges Studio wallets this is not a new lesson um that's that's the one that we need to keep teaching and I don't expect that like brand new people to crypto are going to hop right over to self-custody but certainly anyone who's in the industry for a little while and learns about some of this stuff needs to understand how to use basic self-custody metamask I feel has actually done the most to help people into self-custody of anyone um you know and they do it without talking about self-custody they just made a great product and and got millions of users into self-hosted wallets that's that's fantastic but that lesson is really the one because if um if people if the majority of crypto funds and crypto wealth reside with intermediaries a we will never escape the regulation that this stuff is meant to escape and B we will never escape the need to trust humans and like if we look back at even the Bitcoin white paper and satoshi's writings you know not that he's a God or anything but he made a very important point which is that the the problem with traditional Finance is all the trust that's required to make it work um Bitcoin removed trust from money itself and that principle is is so core is so um so relevant that for all the technology that we're building for every every blockchain and that message above all needs to continue to be repeated is there an element Eric that from what you've seen is that every generation that enters crypto actually has to learn this lesson and the only way that they learn this lesson like learn it really learn it is by going through something like this I mean part of me wonders if there's going to be uh we'll remember this for the next five years maybe maybe that's generous but class of 2027 2028 is going to go repeat the same mistakes that you know the mount gox clock class did or that the class of 2022 and the FDX um debacle did and just it will keep happening to the same population uh yeah what's your take on that given everything you've seen I think the risk of that is very real that's what's happened thus far ironically one of the best elements that might push against that is that governments make these regulated entities so shitty they put up so much friction and they harm the user experience to such a degree that as the defy apps get better and better in their ux a lot of people are just going to flow to to defy and self-custody through ux alone um and it won't be based on principle it won't be based on learning the lessons of FTX or Mount Cox it'll be just because the ux of one is like this Wide Open Meadow of Beauty and the other is this like decrepit prison that no one wants to be in um that's also my hope for like the the best antidote against cbdc's is that if you experience using a free and open and permissionless blockchain versus a cbdc and all the horrible restrictions that will be there regardless of your ideology you'll move to the former simply because it's the path of least resistance and that's where Capital likes to flow yeah I completely agree with that take people people forget that the ux of banks is absolutely terrible and by the way terrible hasn't changed in like 30 years like I still have checkbooks and occasionally I will have to write a check for some things I still have to show up show my ID in order to to wire fun don't get me started on this Eric Banks suck and and what's happening in contrast like Defy is like um getting so much better at an exponential rate because it's open like the internet and I don't know if anyone listening remembers the days of like wild garden AOL type experience for the internet where you have a separate you have a set of AOL apps when you broke out of the AOL Walt Garden you went to the like the real internet it felt so organic and natural Sean is improving all of the time and it pays that AOL couldn't felt chaotic it felt free it felt good uh that's kind of the difference that we're talking about here so a great analogy no no I have no doubt that defy and the open permissionless ecosystem is gonna beat the hell out of anything the banks can produce cbdc or otherwise let me ask you another question though this is more of like maybe a kind of a philosophical question um crypto didn't get a bailout FTX didn't get a bailout um people lost money not just big names and VCS with SPF but average retail everyday investors some of these investors sorry retail not investors but just depositors even some of these depositors had their funds in companies that were disconnected from FTX everybody in Block fi for example completely wiped out not necessarily block fi's direct fault but because they were linked into the whole FTX risk pool uh Gemini Gemini earned status unknown when are you going to be able to withdraw unknown TBD it's all Frozen um if if I were to take the position right now to say that this is healthy this is good it help this is how we learn through the pain I think people listening to that statement those statements would say yeah Ryan you're a psychopath and a status because a lot of retail lost a lot of money this year and it's cool for you that you didn't or you can afford it or whatever else but like we can't have this kind of pain this volatility is not good and um this is the reason we need more government regulation and oversight so there's these Contracting contrasting ideas one says that hey pain is necessary that's how we learn the other idea says but do does it have to be this painful can we like make it less painful can like uh we make sure that grandma doesn't get scammed in this crypto ecosystem is that a possibility what's your take on this great question so yeah I would never say that it's like good when something like this happens um and I have I have heartfelt Sympathy for the people that lost money like they're a million victims something in that order um and that emotional human side of it needs to be kept in mind there's a million stories there of despair and we should not forget that and we shouldn't say it's good just because you know one more centralized intermediary got wiped out um so that's all true also true is that like if you look in nature at how things improve it's a very violent and difficult process to evolve like the the reason that humans exist that we evolved out of whatever animals came before us and that those evolved out of what came before them is just like violence and Carnage and blood and like the tearing of Flesh over hundreds of thousands and millions of years and um and yet through that process we see life that has become more diverse more advanced we're sitting here with all this technology having this call because of that you know miserable for the individual creatures that came before us that process um that's a little bit of like a Zen way of looking at it but in a market you have a similar a similar process those things which make bad decisions we'll get weeded out over time and what remains are stronger heartier more fit for purpose more fit to the environment and that we don't have to see the misery as good but we can see that process as leading to better and better things and we can Embrace we can Embrace that um yeah is that is that a little Bleak or does that help it helps I think it's reality the question is can we have a little bit can we have both or do you really have to make this decision how do we optimize well yeah I mean there's always going to be this pain but all every every entrepreneur in this industry is trying to overcome that pain right he's trying to build something that protects people that was the whole point of shapeshift when I built it was let's minimize this pain let's stop having exchanges that are holding customer funds and we'll build something better so any individual actor or company should absolutely be trying to solve this problem that's how we that's how we get better with it um will government regulation make any of this stuff better of course I'm going to say no to that I mean government regulation causes complacency and causes stagnation and we only need to look at the banking industry itself to see that no innovation in the banking industry in certainly my lifetime or decades prior um they're all heavily regulated right they just become complacent and static and in the way they they have already died um let's never let crypto lose that kind of fire and that passion and let's never let it become this highly regulated you know Quagmire of mediocrity this is the uh the first principles Eric that we all know and love and something I want to get get more into here next I I want to just like start fresh as a listener and as a with this question uh as if somebody might be coming into this industry and this might be the first question that they that they hear why is it important to empower individuals more than anyone else why why is individual empowerment uh correct so I think there's several answers to that um if you look at a system in which the power is concentrated you'll tend to see that it gets abused and that it becomes brittle you can see this in nature you can see it in markets as they get co-opted by governments if you are able to to decentralize power you get a much more Dynamic world you get individuals that are free to make their own decisions which is more fulfilling as humans and you get a system that is more adaptive and when errors inevitably happen they happen on a smaller scale so like uh you know the great example of the danger of government everyone appeals to government for protection from the robber down the street and we end up with these entities that are so large that they cause World War II where like literally millions of people are slaughtering each other on open battlefields um for no good reason and that only is able to be done at that scale and that level of murder because of the centralization of power so just as a principle for like civilizational governance the degree to which you can keep power small local decentralized is a really good one and absolutely true in the realm of money so how does the the idea of a social structure fit in and so like um government uh is a social structure that helps coordinate us um we are also looking to some of our generous a generous euphemism for forcing people at gunpoint to do things sure sure we also have our crypto protocols however where uh you know ethereum Bitcoin humans can coordinate around these social structures um religion for example is a social structure that like is a story that people can adhere to and coordinate by and that creates those these things creates a collective right and so how do we balance uh the freedom and autonomy of the individual to be the best version of themselves while also having this like social structure that we must all be coordinated by like how do we how should we think about the balance between these two things yeah coordination and Order are very important right like we we want hierarchies we want order we want coordination we want um collaboration I think all that stuff ends when you bring a gun into it and force someone to do something or else you'll shoot them or throw them in a cage um like that's that's the line that I draw in terms of what's permissible Behavior as a as a person um as soon as you've left the boundaries of collaboration and you've turned to violence um you've broken something important and so uh the goal should be to Advocate systems which avoid that kind of violence and avoid that kind of coercion do you you mentioned hierarchy in that in that uh as like a hierarchy is important like structure is important hierarchy is centralization so what you're saying is like we're allowed to have some sort of like hierarchical systems but you're saying that these hierarchical systems need to um maintain their products Market fit if you will without uh forcing product Market fit through violence is that another way to say what you said yeah so like the extremes of centralization and decentralization are both bad so the the extreme of centralization is um you know like one world government that has all power and I I probably don't need to get into why that would be horrible the opposite end is um extreme decentralization which first of all is impossible and and very unnatural but if you take it to the extreme it means like even the organization of the cells in your body um is invalid and that you should just like go out into space and explode into a gazillion pieces to decentralize your matter Across the Universe right so like the structure of of planets the structure of individual animals and plants that is all hierarchy that is all order that is all centralization to a certain degree um and that's all good you know but but there's this tendency in human society to continue seeking higher and higher centralization with this appeal to coercive government that's like a bias in human society um and you can see it like in America where the this country was created you know the most free that had ever happened at scale um with a whole bunch of really good and valuable founding principles and a culture of individualism and yet only two or three hundred years go by and you see that it has now turned into this Empire with the government so vastly more powerful than what the founders would have ever envisioned that um it's kind of sickening and yet people continue clamoring for more government every year the budget gets bigger right it doesn't matter what party's in charge um more regulations come out not not fewer if you were to count the number of pages of active laws on any given year it only goes up it's like this ratcheting function because people keep appealing to this coercive entity and the only way that process resolves is in some kind of horrible Revolution that's been the the history of of humanity and so I guess first step in fixing that is just recognizing that bias and trying to fight against it yeah I think this is a moment to actually connect this back to to 2021 and 2022. I can't remember who said this quote but it's something along the lines of the people that seek power to seek to grow their power and law and ultimately find themselves in position of in positions of power because of how they seek it are not the people that you want to be in power uh in in contrast there are people who are humble and rational and and uh you know operate on first principles and are good and those people tend to not seek power they tend to not centralize power around themselves and when you say there's this bias towards power um I think of uh Sam bankman freed trying to take in as many customer deposits as possible trying to raise as much money as possible by like bailing out um uh blockfi to get Block fi to dump their yield into FTX and one of the the lessons that I learned through throughout 2021 and 2022 is like how Central realizing the concept of yield actually is because yield tends to actually like centralize over time and really the bull market that we all went through was a bull market in yield it started off with compound governance yield farming liquidity mining which was good perhaps we also had the the yield Arbitrage out of gbtc uh and then Genesis kind of let that scale out beyond that three hours Capital took advantage all of this yield over time we had all these pool ones and pool twos from defy Farms all of this yield started to like coordinate and centralize and then it was Sam bankman freed like the most egotistical Maniac of them all who managed to capture all of the collecting pools of capital that were growing growing and growing under his FTX Black Box uh and so as far as like yeah go ahead I think this term power needs to actually be two different terms that we just don't have in English language um there's two very clear distinct types of power one is one is like the voluntary power or influence that you have in your Social Circles like you know when I was running shapeshift I have power to fire someone right that is a certain degree of power um but it's not coercive power coercive power is something else course of power is where there's not like some some voluntary Accord being followed but you're forcing someone or defrauding someone or lying in some way where you've actually coerced behavior um these are very different things and a lot of people look at like big government and big corporations is the same there's like two sides of the same evil coin where they're both just examples of centralized power um but amazon.com has never thrown anyone in prison right like amazon.com has never bombed people and like blew their limbs off um to me that's a distinct difference between even the most powerful company in the world and what even a small Central coercive government will do and in Sam's case his sins weren't sins of trying to centralize non-course of power there's nothing wrong with trying to build a big company and get lots of influence and get lots of money that's all fine his sin was in the fraud was in brit like Crossing that line into coercion stealing billions of dollars of customer money that that was the sin and it's so I don't know what what words to use here but these two types of power are important to keep distinct kind of zooming back out to talk about the the first principles of crypto and when we talk about um trying to find the optimum balance between centralization and decentralization right where extreme centralization if you want to keep on going with like the uh the uh the space and stars analogy extreme centralization is like the center of a black hole and it just crushes you uh and then the opposite is like the microwave cosmic background where it's so incredibly decentralized that you are dust and you can't even think because you know so boring I mean yeah uh and we're trying to find this up to the middle ground where there's like biodiversity in life and culture and expressiveness and all this great things how do you see crypto protocols as um supporting structures to help create the biodiversity that we see here on Earth on the planet that we live on great question uh so first it's important to just realize like how complex this point is uh the there's not like an ideal degree of centralization across everything right it's not like it's 50 centralization is appropriate for everything some systems and structures can be very decentralized and some need to be very centralized depends on the scale it depends on what they're trying to do um so people shouldn't worry too much about that but just to to understand that the scale exists and to always trying to be seek always trying to be seeking out that optimal point for it for you and your and your projects is what people should focus on like anyone who's running a company deals with this every day trying to figure out you know how much power to leave in the hands of the executive team versus how much to try to distribute out to the employees and that's different in different companies and and Depends a lot on what they're trying to do but just thinking in that way I think is important not that there's some ideal that's Universal Eric I want to ask a question that might seem like it's coming out of left field but I think relates what do you think of the Constitution the U.S Constitution I'm talking about institution think about that what my kind of frame of references earlier in the conversation we were talking about this idea of having your cake and eating it too being able to do the the getting the benefit of ux centralization type stuff all of that benefit while also getting the benefit of of decentralization and um when I look at the Constitution I've always thought of that as a a protocol if you will it's a set of rules right it's kind of like analog version of of code it was in legal code um and we look at you know some might say the Constitution if you're probably you know on Extreme uh maybe libertarian side of things you might say well any government is just too much structure for me that's too much structure the interesting thing about the Constitution to me is that that went from uh a monarchy which is complete centralization we had a monarchy and you had Lords you had a court too and it took a rebellion for this to happen to Outsourcing some of that power to something that was more decentralized and better and we set up this protocol called the constitution in the United States that guaranteed some some freedoms now there is still coercion in there of course but um then you had kind of like all of these amendments which which protect individuals rights and I would certainly argue with that that that is a massive improvement from the system that that we left but the secret here is we were still able to get the coordination potential of a nation-state but we didn't have to sacrifice and uh you know make trade-offs and um have the Cur have the the centralization and potential Corruption of a monarchy and I see some of these same principles being applied in crypto where to the extent that we can design better protocols we're talking about the when the way out and give our power to those protocols instead and that keeps it decentralized that really is the way out that's how we can get the collaboration the organization without falling prey to sort of the the nation-state coercion or the the traps and The Perils of centralization that's what I see Bitcoin as right it's it's kind of a way to do that with um with with money using this asset system that's what I see ethereum as it's non-coership of technology that still allows us to coordinate so so what do you think about that idea what do you think of the Constitution Eric is this part of the way out where we can get the the trade-off right yeah so the Constitution was an amazing development in that it was like a an affirmative declarative attempt at institutionalizing decentralization right so it was coming out of a world of kings and basically saying those problems we don't want to keep perpetuating so we're going to decentralize power and we're going to State lots of things that the government cannot do like the that's that's the whole goal is to put limits on the centralization of power um and it it was reasonably effective so as a as a historical document and project you know huge respect to it at the same time we see that even when done so well it has still been degraded almost to the point of meaninglessness over two or three hundred years um and this gets to to why like laws that are made by men are always kind of squishy right they're they're written in in language which itself is squishy people's culture changes over time and this desperate desire to have the government do more things has overridden any protections that the constitution has or many of them so um you know hopefully we are moving now into a world where we don't need to rely on the written laws of men as much and we're at this new age where we actually have immutable code that cannot be degraded with time right like an ethereum smart contract will operate according to its rules forever as long as the blockchain is operating there's no interpretation because it's written in code it is objective and we now have these powerful systems that can operate over the long term without that kind of interpretation or degradation and that's what we should be embracing so like written laws were a cool technology for a few hundred years um open source and mutable code is our cool technology for the next while and we should really see it as an improvement over man-made law rather than something that still needs to be subordinate to it arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is

think there are limitations to what we can do with with the code that we'll never be able to kind of solve on the the squishy legal human layer of things yeah um yeah code code enforces things that happen digitally it can't enforce things that happen in the analog world so that's a huge that's a huge point um code can't really govern like human relationships with each other so it's not like smart contracts should suddenly be looked at as the um provider of all order in society especially in Meet space but where it really shines is anything digital and all of cryptocurrency is a digital scarce good and so that is the perfect realm in which to realize that the power of uh code AS law or as better than law where that can be realized so Eric sum this up for us why are we here why are we doing this crypto thing so each person's different right and again this is a diverse industry and not everyone agrees with this point I'm going to make but the reason I'm here the reason I'm doing this crypto thing and have been for 11 years is because I want to separate money and State I think money is one of the most important Technologies in society it's something we interact with every day the flows of money direct and govern human action everywhere at every scale and something so important needs to not be under a monopoly provider period um if if you believe in markets and yet you let the money of markets be a non-market phenomenon that is created and managed by a central government uh you're living at odds with the principles of what the markets can do and arguably the most important good of all to be handled by the market is money because it's the most important good in an economy so I'm here to separate money and state and every technology every blockchain every app that helps further that is something that I'm going to be supporting this is why I didn't stick around with only Bitcoin and you know remain a Bitcoin maximalist because there's amazing other Technologies outside of Bitcoin that are helping those same principles be moved forward so that's that's why I'm here certainly some people are here to just like make a bunch of money um but I'm here for the principle of decentralizing money away from the hands of the state you said that um again you're really emphasizing the point that we're all here or a diverse group of people we're all here for different reasons and the reason why you're here is because you want to see the separation of money and state but don't you also think that um a lot of the protocols that we coordinate around Bitcoin especially on this regard but also ethereum uh and maybe blockchains as a whole as a technology as a whole have this value baked into them as in I'm not sure it's actually possible to be in crypto without uh believing in the separation of money and state and and then the whole point of like um expressive smart contract layers is you also want to separate Finance and State I I do you agree that there are some principles some values that are actually baked into this industry at their very core and actually like aren't negotiable you can't really strip there is no blockchain without there's no crypto without the separation of money in the state do you agree with this not quite like the blockchains themselves don't have values right the values are human subjectivity principles that we decide are important the blockchains don't care at all about our values um the blockchains are tools they're machines architected in certain ways that have certain effects and can do certain things and if we have principles we might see certain blockchains that help Express or Advance those principles but the blockchains themselves don't it is always curious to me when I meet like a an absolute statist who's also a big fan of crypto you know like I want to ask him do you realize where this is going like wait those exist yeah I mean certainly the radical libertarian types are a minority of crypto holders you know in 2011 it was most of them but today I'm I'm the minority um lots of people really love government you know and they really want it to be powerful and do all the right things and they'll vote in the right people next next election and still many of those people like Bitcoin like D5 so like my take on it so I I wouldn't call myself or label myself a radical libertarian I mean we don't talk a lot about um you know politics uh on on bankless uh in general except we always talk about politics on Bank lists in every single episode because this is a movement that is not necessarily left or right but it's certainly anti-authoritarian it's certainly more decentralization back to the people and so yeah there there is an element where isn't some of this baked into our like very protocols I I get that there's a social contract that we're all kind of implicitly signing by opting into these systems um but at the same time aren't some of these protocols like shaping are are shaping our values like I would broaden it I I definitely believe in kind of the separation of money and state and I would even broaden it to say well we're also separating the property rights layer uh from the state too and that's an interesting uh thing that that we've not done yet and that sort of even expands if you think of money as one aspect of property but not the only digital property we might have that's even more expansive but I guess my my overarching overarching question is um maybe as we go into 2023 and Beyond how do we preserve some of the core crypto values that make this industry what it is and so important how do we not f up this whole thing along the way of inviting more and more people to the table because I do want this thing to be for the world I do want everybody to come in the same way that they're into the internet and yet what I saw last cycle Eric was like as a result of that we um lost we diluted some of the core values that make this this industry so important and uh how do we prevent that moving forward while inviting everyone in so we keep talking about it like we keep talking about the principles over and over and over and over and it becomes part of the culture that's something that's like an active thing that you have to continue on just like if you build a company you can't just declare the culture in the beginning and then it will forever be that it requires active management and active influence um there's also just a recognition that a lot of people won't share those values and that's okay like we we don't one of the reasons I was so in love with Bitcoin was because I realized it was going to work without convincing everyone that like a world of small government is a is a better one like I don't have to have that debate with anyone right I've become less political post Bitcoin because I don't have to care about convincing people of anything um I can simply help encourage this technology to take over the world and through that will be more effective than like any any set of voting so there's part of me that like doesn't quite care what people's values are and a recognition after you know Decades of trying to convince people of certain ideological principles that I don't need to convince anyone of anything there's this Bitcoin tool that works and as it grows it will separate money from State regardless of anyone's intentions that's why it's so powerful that's why it's so exciting and we can focus on on the building and enabling of that technology instead of having you know debates with people who are just gonna dig in their heels and um we don't need to do that anymore I'm reminded of a fantastic quote from my co-host of mine when you adopt crypto protocols you adopt crypto values and it's it's kind of nice just to we didn't I think all three of us here have a pretty good level of confidence that eventually Society will ultimately become coordinated around crypto protocols and uh eventually uh that future state of the world will align with the values that I see embedded into these things embedded into the particular constructions of these crypto protocols that that we are creating so it's a little bit of just like a a waiting game uh for you know adoption to slowly slowly went out and the nice thing David is because it's opt-in we only get that adoption if we deserve it yeah right people have to choose crypto and that that's important we can't lose sight of that yeah yep like that that's what makes this a noble cause right is that none of it is based on coercion right no one holds Bitcoin who doesn't want to hold Bitcoin it is not forced on any person they opt into it and they can opt out just as easily at any time if it if it doesn't further their interest they can leave and and it's fine um that's what that's what's so cool about it and that's what puts it in stark contrast to Fiat right like if you're if your idea or your technology or your product is so good that you have to force people to use it um that might be an indication that it's not that great and crypto never has that it has to win every single user Eric you said that um you label yourself as a as like radical right like you put yourself in the radical libertarian camp but when I talk to you I'm I'm talking to a very rational uh like grounded seemingly I'm getting I get the vibe that you don't get angry often do you feel radical like why did you use that word right I think rationality is a radical thing these days sadly so it's Society that's radical yeah yeah nothing's wrong with me it's all Society yeah I mean it is funny because like um objectively I am radical in my beliefs uh but all I believe is that like people should be peaceful with one another that's really my fundamental belief and everything is simply a like a logical or rational extension of that principle um in my Twitter profile like it says toward peace as the first the first snippet because that's that's the point it is really sad and telling that holding that is my fundamental moral principle makes me a radical you know like that that to me indicates something is really really sick with Society generally um or at least is unexamined you know because most people if you ask them if they're pro-piece would say yes but they haven't really gone through the exercise of thinking logically about what that means how do they Define that how is that applied because they'll say that in one sentence in the very next sentence they'll advocate for taxation which is a breach of peace right it's it's a taking of property from from one person by force so um they hold these kind of views that are in at odds with each other um and I think that's why like a lot of people maybe like Sam in that debate just had no um no structured logical consistent framework to think about the rules that should be borne down on society I think the way he thinks about it is what is expedient or what is helpful for FTX or what some Senator advocated but they're not there's no unified sort of theory of how humans should be um and that's what really caught him up when confronted with just a a rational clear Foundation and do you see crypto protocols as tools to help scale out uh towards peace do crypto protocols help move us as Society towards peace yes because they provide an alternative from monies that are not based on peace so fiat currency is not based on peace people are forced or legally benefited in in using it in certain ways and some people are legally permitted to do things with it that others are not so it's it's a system based on coercion and um crypto is that alternative it's a peaceful purely market-based money and that's a that's a beautiful thing and for every person out there that gets distracted by the Lambos you know what they're actually helping to further when they talk about crypto is a machine of of economic peace like that's ultimately what we're building and I think that's a really profound and important cause Kevin owaki's line from degen's into Regens comes to mind so I'll give him a little shot Kevin's Kevin's great Kevin is someone who like um him and I agree on a lot of stuff but he's he's also like a dirty statist and so we have good good debates about about that but I very much respect him and um he's a good dude I I love your back and forth by the way but it's just this idea of radical to me is just like um so so David I think that some people would think that you are radical and that I am radical why because we believe in on-chain privacy you think that it shouldn't be illegal for a U.S citizen uh to use tornado cash privacy mixer right you think that yes I personally like to use that again because it's against uh consensus of you I would expect and the thing that that caught me from the the debate with uh Eric and SBF is Eric was talking about you know 85 million Iranians they should have access to an open Financial system shouldn't they well that doesn't necessarily play very well in Capitol Hill does it but when you go back to base principles and you're talking about an open um you know permissionless system to help All Peoples across geographies all over the world why shouldn't it I guess that's a radical idea as well but it's not if you're grounding these things on base principles and you're starting from the bottom up um Eric we've talked a lot about like why we're here you know the principles what we lost sight of not we maybe I'll I'll edit that word but some in crypto loss side of in 2022 and how can we can get back to that um let me ask you this question though so every time at this point in the cycle I can't say every time because I haven't been in all the Cycles but I can imagine and I've been through enough to to know that at this point in the cycle everyone people go back to even if they're in crypto it's sort of a okay crypto's not dead all right previous Cycles people say crypto's not dead I'll submit to you that crypto's not dead this cycle Eric but give me a reason it shouldn't expand beyond the small little niche of core Believers in this weird little podcast called bankless in some corner of the internet um it'll forever remain a niche kind of like the gold bugs are kind of like you know other technologies that didn't really take off in the past uh what do you think about this Eric do you think that that will get another Bull Run that will get another adoption wave or those days behind us is crypto kind of is there a possibility that crypto is just uh forever doomed to this niche of of Hardcore Believers and doesn't ever go mainstream the way the internet has yeah well first response is that it's funny to keep hearing that because that's the same allegation that was levied at us in 2011. like this this will never take off it'll never be meaningful it's just this like niche of these you know radical anarchists and um it has no place in the normal world uh and some of us dreamers would be like you know what someday like a real Corporation is going to accept this stuff man and um lo and behold you know here we are only a decade later and um many companies accept it you know it it is a major financial asset like one it's actually one of the most Bitcoins one of the most liquid Financial Assets in the world objectively and so um it's working but people keep people keep wondering during the entire adoption curve if it'll step any further on that adoption curve and like when I ask myself this question the the proper answer to it is is always to look at the fundamental economic mechanisms behind it the the reason that crypto will take over the world is because it is a it is a more fertile ground for Capital Capital flows to where it does not get destroyed it does not get infringed Capital flows to where it can be built into more Capital this is like a an economic law and so while it doesn't happen in a straight line over time more and more value will be held in these transparent open immutable forms of value instead of these analog ones that decay you know by two to ten percent every year that people are used to holding and which have all sorts of restrictions and borders on them to go back to your AOL analogy right like hap the the internet obliterated AOL which was this this you know walls Garden because creativity and communication and economics doesn't like walls right it expands markets expand and they expand in the paths of least resistance um crypto is that path of least resistance so I have I have no worry that like value doesn't flow into these systems it doesn't mean I know which system will benefit the most but those that are frictionless and useful to people will be the benefactors so that's kind of like a first principle's thinking on just why this actually takes over the world and just to add one more um uh comment on that uh capital is highly interested in not decaying as in that is a very good carrot for people to not lose their money and so while the internet absolutely obliterated AOL it did that without the incentive of money behind it as well uh it's always got the extra little power the parallel is that like money information wants to be free right information doesn't like walls and really money and information are not so different from each other money is like a specific form of information and um these things like to spread and they will spread and they and like a liquid you know they find their way through every crack and they overcome Every Mountain and we don't know how long it takes but that's that's the inevitable phenomenon that you can count on poetic love it love it uh Eric my last question for you uh we started to touch on on some of these answers like the commonalities behind all the bull markets but um when you look forward uh I know I know the 2011 to 2013 was only two years but you know every four years since then 2013 2017 2021 always seemed to be some sort of peak so perhaps 2025 no guarantees but during the next bull market during the next Bull Run uh what are the common denominate denominators that you've seen every single bull market every single Bull Run in every single bear Market too um that we should be prepared for like what have you seen almost every single time as the machinations of the crypto Cycles move forward they're largely lessons that you see in any kind of speculative cycle so it's not unique to crypto but these are lessons like when the bullishness is happening people's skepticism and judgment Falls way too low they're willing to accept anything right and all the stupid ideas get just as much money as the good ones there's no discretion um and everyone's making money doing everything so during the bull market remembering to stay sane means ask yourself if this thing is actually useful or if it's just stupid and if if your mind says it's just stupid it might actually just be stupid and so don't follow the crowd because they'll they'll go into everything and then the the inverse is that in the bear Market um people are far too bearish and they dismiss the whole thing like your your earlier question is like you know the sentiment that oh well crypto ever even turn into a real thing or is it just constrained to the niche you know that that is bear Market thinking right that is like this technology which didn't change in the last two years the blockchains didn't change from the bear to the bull if if it was going to work during the bull market it's just as likely to work during the bear Market because the technology itself the machines haven't changed um and so during the bear Market to realize that you're probably too negative on stuff and that things which you feel like aren't a great idea actually might become really important and useful and to just check yourself in both both of those extremes when you're feeling really great about everything try to add a little more skepticism and when you're feeling horrible about everything you know go go touch some grass and realize that we're actually building profound systems here and and to be proud of that so so what should we do during the the bear Market that's uh ahead of us however long it lasts is it is it really that simple buy and build those are the two bees during the bear Market yeah and and also just remember to live your lives right you know Crypt is not everything spend time build relationships with people stay healthy um stay sane get outside as much as you can all these kind of good human um human advice is is totally relevant and and then just like step back and be proud of what you're part of and they're like no no Revolution that worked during that Revolution where all the people confident that it would work right like you you step forward through uncertainty the entire time and then one day you you might wake up and realize like oh it worked but I missed it all because I was so worried that it wasn't happening so just recognize it like you're in the middle of the Revolution right now bull or bear Market um you're in the middle of that and a decade two decades three decades from now like when you're talking with your children or your grandchildren and they ask you about this time um you'll realize that you you were there and so while you're here don't don't let it go by without that recognition and Eric if you did have to guess on when the market will start to turn around and when we'll see another another bull market of some sort uh breaching all-time highs what would your guess be I mean do we have to wait 10 years or does this happen every four years it won't be ten years and I and I I wish I could pretend that me and my like crypto OG friends don't talk about like when the bull market will return but we do you know we have our barbecues and we talk about you know and what do you think what are they saying we're just always wrong um it's so hard it's it won't be 10 years like if it takes 10 years for the bull market to happen probably the whole thing failed um so I'm happy bounding it in that way um yeah I would guess that sometime in the next like you know six to three six months to three years you know I think that's that's generally how long it takes people's minds to start changing and speculative Cycles to return it also has a lot to do with the macro environment right so as long as interest rates are held high monetary conditions are tighter it's going to be a headwind but I think we may you know that'll start changing in early to mid next year um so I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin was at like 40K in by by the summer that wouldn't surprise me at all and that's like two and a half X from here so it's a great return there you have it guys uh some thoughts from Eric for he's near the end uh even got some price predictions on a podcast that was not at all about price predictions anything else I said today it can be like debated but I said everything else yeah time tested except for that last piece but uh yeah you heard it here guaranteed by 2026 we'll have a full steam ahead bull market Eric Voorhees uh just
