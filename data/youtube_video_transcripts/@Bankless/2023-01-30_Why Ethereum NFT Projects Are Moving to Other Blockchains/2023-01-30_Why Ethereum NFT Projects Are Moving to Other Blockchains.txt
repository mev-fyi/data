what's the tldr of why Doodles is moving to flow they think that they can get better user onboarding using the flow blockchain yeah of course things like flow are more like web2 and therefore easier for new users because they are web 2 because it's centralized you kind of wonder if other nft projects are going to migrate as an ethereum person we should take this as a signal that our layer twos are not ready to do the things that they will eventually be able to do other systems ones that are more centralized and have compromised have been able to adopt protocols like this because they can just have better onboarding experience
