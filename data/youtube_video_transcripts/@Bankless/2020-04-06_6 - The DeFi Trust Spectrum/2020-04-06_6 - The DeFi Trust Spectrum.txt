[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we have an excellent episode today i'm super excited about it the defy trust spectrum give us a tease of what we're going to talk about today ethereum is an agnostic platform that allows anyone to come and build anything on it depending on how you build that thing you can place it on a different part of the trustless spectrum so some applications on ethereum are very trustless and some applications on ethereum are completely trusted the trustlessness or trustedness of an application on ethereum is a way of illustrating how much human responsibility there is in the operation of the application why bitcoin is so powerful is because of how it is a very human free application on the internet it is this thing that is internet native and does not need humans really to maintain it the the power of bitcoin is its lack of human maintainers of the system it the system perpetuates and so therefore bitcoin is a very trustless system because its operation is entirely computer run and that same illustration is found on ethereum applications ethereum applications can be completely trustless and completely unmaintained by humans ethereum itself is unmaintained by humans however some applications can be trusted or human maintained and that means that when you use these things that you are trusting the people that maintain the each application to some degree and so that's why you can lay these things out in a spectrum of trustlessness where where some applications are more trusted than others and sometimes you can actually get completely trustless applications and so for example uniswap is the example that everyone uses to talk about the most trustless application on ethereum it's maximally simple and it requires no human uh coordination or input it's humans at the end edges and code in the center and this is kind of like different websites around the internet 2.0 where some websites you can go to like wikipedia and access you know basically the entire website and other websites other ip addresses you go to and then you are asked for an admin like login and login credentials you know some applications are open to everyone and completely trustless and some applications are closed and like realty for example my company we have white listed tokens you need to sign up with us et cetera and so we talk about that spectrum what it's like to be on either end of the spectrum what it's like to be in the middle a really fascinating topic there is so many other lines of conversation that spawn out of this for example at the trustless end of the spectrum i i believe and i and i think you agree with me ryan that things gravitate towards that end of the spectrum the more applications we have on the trustless end of the spectrum the easier it is to build further applications there and so in the long term you know 10 20 50 year time horizon of ethereum i expect all the applications to be kind of grouped up there and bundled there in the trustless end we've been wanting to talk about this for a long time and there's three kind of takeaways or concepts that we're going to touch on the first is what you're talking about is the machine versus man on ethereum what that what that looks like some are more machine robots some are more human-oriented people the fact that in many cases the machines will win out they will become the base layer and what happens to eth when all of this is going on when all of these trusted and trustless tokens start appearing and money protocols start appearing on ethereum uh how does eth win does it win we're gonna talk about all of that but let's dive into some housekeeping first um you had some thoughts i know you mentioned me david after thinking about our previous episode on memes uh what have you been thinking about what what have been the reflections after we did that last episode episode number five yeah so far every episode we've recorded the next week i'm thinking about it and i'm like i should have said that should have brought up that and so this housekeeping section i think we're going to test out to see if whether people like it but just kind of go over our thoughts over the last episode and and the conversations from the community that have given us feedback uh so memes we talked about memes as a communication mechanism a communication vehicle across time and across generations right so good memes last throughout generations memes travel from brain to brain and they can latch on and live across time and that's really why memes are so powerful and money is a meme right so the the paper bill that you have in your pocket it's a meme that we all accept as as money except the way that if you go back to i think our very first episode we talked about how uh money is created or one way that money is created where there is a farmer uh toiling in his field he collects a bunch of wheat he goes to the granary and he deposits it and he is returned to receipt that a paper receipt and that paper receipt is a credit on whatever is in the granary or you could also call it a bank and then that that farmer can go and take that paper receipt and take it to a local store a local whatever blacksmith uh and and redeem an equal amount of value for what he needs and so that's how that's how money is created and that money when that money is handed from person a to person b it the person b can then hand it to person c d e f you know and then this gets carried out throughout time and so money in the same way that memes are communication vehicles through from our ancestors it is our ancestors telling us our stories one of the one of the lines that i gave in that episode was that the bible is a collection of memes that our ancestors have learned to pass on money and the money in the bank and the money of the world is this collection of our ancestors blood sweat and tears as they worked and as they produced value so that receipt that the farmer got for depositing his wheat is a receipt of his work it's his energy that he put into creating value and the way that we transcend we pass on value throughout generations is money and i think that when we are talking about hyperinflation or argentina or venezuela hyperinflating the value of their currency away it's a lot more impactful when we think of it as they are deleting the value of our ancestors because that is what's happening that is the the value and work of our ancestors is being uh forgotten it's being washed away and that's why uh bitcoin and bitcoiners from their perspective is so important as a hard asset that cannot be inflated away or printed because it retains the work of our ancestors across time so that's just something i thought about in the last week since we released that episode one thing i was reading this week was actually about the the birth of the greenback so that is the the us dollar was called the greenback and um lincoln actually created this uh during the civil war in an effort to win the civil war he knew in fighting the confederacy that it was also an economic war and he would need lots of money in order to do this and so it was proposed internally and and he accepted the idea that they would actually have to create a fiat that wasn't really backed by gold it was somewhat through um a couple of steps removed redeemable by gold eventually basically it was it was sort of a non-backed new money that was being used to finance uh the war so financing security through issuance which is which is pretty interesting and it was laughed at at first i mean you know the idea that um a government that the u.s would create its own non-backed currency the inflation rates during during the civil war um the the greenback uh rose in in terms of its its price relative to gold quite high when the union was losing uh and started to do better when when they were winning um it's just a really fascinating history and i think we are like what five six generations removed from that but we forget that our ancestors worked very hard to establish money memes um and at the very beginning they weren't very established at all um you know they had to bootstrap their meme off of off of things like gold by putting imprints on the dollar like in god we trust or this is redeemable for for gold at the federal reserve uh they put a lot of work into establishing those memes when we do inflate them away when our government sort of issues more and we we see hyperinflation were kind of destroying all of that previous work a super interesting perspective it maybe makes the uh the reason why no one should have the ability to print money uh it makes that a little bit more tangible in my opinion yeah um absolutely there's also some other cool stuff going on we published a post on on bank list this week about ethereum on bloomberg terminals did you get a second to check that out david yeah i did i thought it was great so something that cool that's going on is that we are starting to see some of the real world assets this is a restaurant company they own about 400 restaurants called fat brands and they're publicly traded nasdaq company and they have actually issued uh through a third party a bond on ethereum and so you can log into uh bloomberg terminal and bloomberg terminals those are the user interfaces of wall street of traditional finance you can now log into a bloomberg terminal and actually see this bond being settled on ethereum to an eth address and the payments from this bond are being paid to eth addresses too in stable coins um yeah i saw this about a month ago that this was happening and it kind of blew my mind that we're already getting to the place where wall street is starting to settle transactions on ethereum and kind of a thesis that what's going to happen is over time ethereum and networks like ethereum will become the base settlement layer for bloomberg terminals for wall street and it's simply because closed permission systems can't compete against open neutral systems it's like closed source software competing against open source software it's like microsoft trying to compete against the internet in the 1990s open generally wins permissionless generally wins um you know 500 bankers ruling the world really can't compete against millions of of developers and folks who are building on the ecosystem and it's it's exciting to start to see uh some of those early seeds of what's going on there too so if you get a chance uh check out that article see what's going on in the ethereum bloomberg terminal space where wall street is starting to settle on this open permissionless network looking at the image in your article i think it's so funny because it's just a normal bloomberg terminal image with all the normal things that you would see there and then in the bottom right corner there's a notes section with an ethereum address labeled ethereum contract they just didn't have any any like field or place to put the relevant information there so they just had to manually put it in the notes section like oh yeah by the way this is on ethereum yeah and in the future hopefully that you know that that's like a link out to ether scan where you can see it where you can see the address in real time one other thing that um uh we were talking about as an open thread this week on bankless is about the price that you'd sell your crypto so you know the question is i'm not selling my crypto until what happens do you have like a date or a timeline or an event that needs to happen for you to sell your crypto david uh no not at all um and that's because i think that that is a silly question uh because every person has their own time horizon and their own personal demands to sell their money for the things that they want and so i am planning on holding my ether because that's my savings that's my that's my money right and so i'll sell my savings when i need to buy something like perhaps a house but as far as a date goes or a time i don't think that i i don't i don't think in those terms i think that i'm just going to stack my way and at some point in time when it feels right for me because i want to buy something i'll dip into my savings and sell it so you're not waiting for like you're not you don't have like a 10-year time horizon you don't have like a if ether hits a thousand or ten that you're you're gonna sell a portion and dollar cost average out nothing like that well i think if ether hits like a really high number like 10 000 it'll be because ether is being used as money for the world and so what when you ask me if i'm going to win i'm going to sell it or what i'm what i'm going to sell it for that my question is what am i going to sell it into what selling it implies that i'm exchanging it for something else am i going to be selling it back to a dollar well if ether is ten thousand dollars per ether what what is the role of the us dollar in the world if ether is like ten thousand dollars it's probably because there's a whole bunch of economic activity on ethereum so like why would i sell my ether when i just might when all of my economic activity might be on ethereum like that's where i go to buy all the things like i'm moving my my money elsewhere and it might be less useful there and so i'm what i'm questioning is what do i what am i actually selling that ether for and what is that ether good for that like do i want whatever i'm selling it for yeah that's a really good point whenever you are selling bitcoin or selling ether you know you're you're also buying something else right so to sell ether is also to buy us dollars if you're exchanging it for that and that's the question is is you know do you want to hold us dollars at this point in time yeah that's a super interesting perspective i'd be interested to hear from other bankless podcast listeners what they think um you know are they waiting for a specific date like eth2 to come out or proof of stake or are they waiting for bitcoin to hit uh 100k before they're selling or are they like you are they just like going to hold until they don't really have to sell until this thing becomes money um i'm probably a bit more in that camp too uh but um but yeah it'll be uh it's interesting to to hear the the time horizons from different folks in the community i'm reminded of this uh very old meme that i've seen in the crypto space where it's the neo talking to morpheus meme and neo asks what are you trying to tell me that i can trade my bitcoins for millions someday and then morpheus replies no neo i'm trying to tell you that when you are ready you won't have to that's a great meme it i think it's act there's there's a lot of truth to that for sure i mean as as these crypto money assets become financialized the question is why sell uh maybe you can lend instead right so you don't have to sell you can lend a portion and start receiving interest maybe you can stake eth instead of selling and receive interest maybe you don't want to sell for an inferior money like euros or yen or us dollars because the world essentially has come to crypto um and and and you no longer need to sell that is the banking system um that's kind of the bankless vision uh so we'll uh we'll see how that plays out we should jump into our sponsors so let's start with rocket dollar rocket dollar was actually the very first tactic that was released on bank lessons part of the reason i started bank list honestly saw this amazing opportunity for a self-directed irs that basically no one was talking about and i wrote a bit about self-directed iras and rocket dollars so if you're in the u.s you don't have to be jailed inside of your brokerage and you know buy the stocks that they list you can break your ira or 401k out of brokerage jail you can buy crypto on an exchange like gemini and coinbase you have to create what's called a self-directed ira rocket dollar can help with that they can help you with all the paperwork break your retirement account out of jail if you go to rocketdollar.com right now you can use the code bankless and get 50 off it's a fantastic deal it's a good time to start thinking about your future and start thinking about your crypto retirement if you are looking for a solid footing in the d5 world you need to go to xerion.io xerion is defy made easy it's way better than your bank and it is the gateway to the world of decentralized finance if you are used to logging into your bank accounts front page in order to access your personal finance services xerion is the uh the defy alternative for that sirion is the place where you can go and get a summary of your d5 portfolio all in one space and access all of the device financial services that defy has to offer you can go to xerion at all of your wallets get a summary of your portfolio and the assets that you hold as well as all of your borrowing and lending positions you can also exchange assets through uniswap and you can also pull out a loan from maker all in the same spot so if you are tired of going to all these different d5 protocol urls like uniswap.exchange compound.finance etc and you just want everything all in one spot in a slick and easy ui and ux go to xerion.io that's z-e-r-i-o-n-i-o all right let's dig into the subject today this is the d5 trust spectrum that's what we're going to be talking about you know i think this is a super important subject because a lot of people make the quip you know d5 isn't really decentralized they'll talk about a protocol like compound maybe having some ability to access the contract and and edit the contract or they'll talk about a protocol like um like set which has some administrative rights as well um but i'm looking right now david at a spectrum diagram that you came up with which i i think is really good and i'll just describe describe this for listeners so on the far left there's this picture of just a human right normal guy on the left side of the spectrum on the far right side of the spectrum there's this terminator style machine and in the middle there's a cyborg and what you have below the spectrum are various defy protocols money protocols that range from human to cyborg all the way to full machine it's really a spectrum of protocols that are run by humans the man protocols and all the way to the other end of the protocols run by machine the machine protocols and there are a few on the left that are real like realty like god's unchained and there are many on on the right that are more full machine like uniswap um can you kind of talk about the the concept behind that david like why why'd you put together that image and why is it relevant the d5 trustless spectrum is something that we should all have in the back of our heads and and that's why i put that spectrum together uh it's supposed to be a visual representation of what and where these defy applications are in relation to each other in relation to uh their trustlessness and so it's it's hopefully a quick like cheat sheet for you to go and be able to review where on the spectrum of trust do these things lie when you use these applications how much trust are you putting on the operators of the system right so if you go to uniswap there is no trust it is completely trustless if you go to realty and buy property there is trust humans are at the helm of realty and you are trusting that they are steering that ship in the right direction unit swap you don't have to have that trust and it's important to understand where trust comes in at each of these protocols and so that's kind of what this article was about it's an article i published forever ago it's called the two faces of ethereum i definitely recommend it as a read there's a video of me on the bank list youtube reading it to you if you prefer that instead and it kind of illustrates what what different behaviors and applications are found on different ends of the spectrum so we're saying ethereum as a network right and and remember we've talked about this before in previous episodes there's the difference between ether the asset and ethereum the network what we're saying is ethereum the network it it is a permissionless platform that can host really any money application any d5 protocol that ranges they don't all have to be completely trustless but they can be trustless as uniswap is um but but but some can be still trusted uh can we talk about what we mean by trust a little bit more so like what are we actually trusting when you say something like uh realty and for those that don't know maybe you should describe what realty is um but can can you talk about why what we're trusting what systems or what sort of people we're trusting in realty versus something like uniswap where we've said that's trustless and how they've removed the humans from the equation and this is different for every single application on ethereum right like each application has its own vectors or surfaces of trust or trustlessness so with something like realty where we tokenize real world assets real estate and put them on ethereum as erc20s you are trusting a number of things first off you're trusting that the legal structure actually links the the token that we put on ethereum to the property now you can go and look at the documents that we send you when you purchase and you can say yep these documents link the ownership to the token but then you're just trusting the legal system to actually honor that commitment right so then you're then you're just trusting the united states legal system which is a decent thing to trust but it's a trust nonetheless uh and then you're also trusting us to appropriately collect the rent from the tenants turn it into dye and send it into your address you're trusting us to do all of those things now with uniswap uniswap has done gone in the furthest opposite direction where there is absolutely no trust and that is enabled specifically by the way that uniswap is architected there are no humans at the center of uniswap for its operation there is only code at the center and the definition of a dao in my opinion is something that is code in the middle and humans on the fringes and so the dao the decentralized autonomous organization things that we're used to calling uh maker dao or molok dao in my opinion aren't actually daos because there are humans at the center uniswap is a really good example of the og definition of a dao because there are no humans at the center for the operation there's no place for a human to you know mistype a number there's no place for a human to uh route a trade wrong it's only computers it's only code uh and so uniswap there is no vector of trust whereas realty there's a lot of vectors of trust so maybe i'm kind of picking out three things from from what you said which which you know range the spectrum of of trustlessness so the first is settlement so with something like realty settlement occurs in meat space it's settlement on the legal system right so it's not settlement in this alternate crypto universe that's the first thing the second is issuance right with realty we have to trust an issuer right so the company behind this tokenized security issues and set supply and and the third is the mechanism itself can either be code or sort of human run so we've got settlement we've got issuance and we've got mechanism and what you're saying is with uniswap all three of those things are code right so settlement that occurs purely on ethereum there's no legal system uh involved at all it doesn't rely on the us legal system and uh issuance as well well that that occurs uh native to uniswap the the acid itself i suppose so there's no acid in in uniswap it's it's more mechanism but many of the assets inside of it like ethereum or like die their issuance happens in crypto as well and then the the mechanism so the the rules of engagement the rules of exchange and trade that's all happening in code as well and that code is entirely present on the ethereum chain so it can essentially exist if some of the developers behind uniswap go away it continues it continues moving it continues humming it can exist if um you know the the us legal system uh falls apart god forbid um it can exist as long as ethereum exists and as long as the internet itself exists so that is kind of the definition of of trustlessness it seems unstoppability uncensorability like no reliance on humans just pure machine just pure code yeah that's totally right and to go back to your your uh part about settlement realty with our tokens we can burn tokens right and so by definition it does not completely settle on ethereum because we have the ability to arbitrary change ownership values now we would never ever do this in a way that is malicious to our customers right because you know our customers are you know the whole point of realty but at the end of the day if something quote unquote goes wrong and doesn't line up with the outside settlement the legal system settlement we can burn tokens in order to make sure that things do line up and that's not something having that guarantee of ownership asset ownership is only possible with completely decentralized trustless assets like dye or ether right so the the real estate tokens that are erc20 tokens are not the same as dye which dye doesn't under does die doesn't know who owns it or how it's being used it just goes with it but real tokens we we do it does uh know that it does know who is being uh tr who is transacting in real tokens and and making sure that everyone is kyc at the same time so you know completely trusted yeah so there's actually white lists attached to uh tokenized securities like like realty right where um you have to have your etherdress kyc'd or it actually can't buy or sell one of these tokens on uniswap like the transaction literally doesn't go through um so that is if that is trusted um it's a trusted asset like a traditional financial asset only it exists on this ethereum open finance layer so you know we've talked about maybe the the far left which is uh pure pure like you know man right pure pure human trust which is a lot like the existing system so we'd see tokenized real estate tokenized securities the bloomberg example um terminal example where we had this tokenized bond in a bloomberg terminal we talked about that in uh in the intro that would be on the far left side this very human trusted thing on the far right side pure machine we've got things like uniswap and that might be the most trustless protocol that the ethereum defy ecosystem has ever created but there's lots of space in between too right maybe we should talk about some of the projects that fall somewhere in between those ranks let's start with maker yeah maker is a really important example because maker itself has parts of it that are completely trustless and then it also has parts that are trusted so when you combine all these things you you end up in the middle of the spectrum but i i think it's also important to differentiate between the parts of maker that are completely trustless and completely code driven and then the parts of maker that are are human driven right so cdps or vaults or loans or whatever however whichever work terminology we're using these days though that part is completely trustless so you can deposit your ether you can get a die loan you can go and do whatever you want with that die there's no kyc involved there's no permissioning involved you don't have to apply and you get to do whatever you want with that die and then you pay it back later and all that all of that um financial activity is completely trustless is completely automated completely managed by computers yeah great great point david so like these these vaults these are are these cdps these are actually loans so for people who haven't used maker you you actually what you do is you go to the maker website you don't need a bank you don't need any intermediary you just need an etherdress and and some ether what you can do is you can deposit that ether into a smart contract so again into a machine like david's talking about there's no human in the middle there's no trusting maker for custody it's all in code and then you can mint die that's a stable coin against the ether that you've put in the contract so effectively what that is is it's like a collateralized loan almost like a a mortgage where you have an asset like a house and you're able to get um a loan based on the value of that asset that's what you're doing only with with ether so you're putting ether in and you're getting a loan that's based not in us dollars but based in this stable coin that's pegged one to one with the us dollar called die and you could do that purely with a machine nothing in between and you can do that completely autonomously so there's there's no need to trust any individual uh you're just trusting a protocol and just trusting a system and you know you mentioned kyc just just in case folks aren't familiar that means know your customers so these are basically laws that are required by the financial system in the u.s um to identify everybody who's transacting with money so it's basically like tying your government public identity to a financial transaction and that's how the existing traditional system operates everything has to be kyc'd as we say and with this trustless system you don't have to do any of that and then there is the trusted side of maker dao and trusted it's not 100 trusted being trusted is its own spectrum right it there's a measure of how trusted these things actually are so it's a difficult thing to talk about when we actually want to talk about how to to what degree something is trusted or not but with maker dao there are human required elements to keep the system running the maker dial system has levers and dials that need to be adjusted and tinkered with in order to keep the maker down system up and running and so that's things like the stability fee the die ceiling the die debt ceiling how much dye can be issued uh what collateral types to accept as a collateral in maker dao right now there's just ether and basic attention token basic attention token has a much lower debt ceiling and the ether has a much higher debt ceiling and these parameters are decided by humans humans that own the mkr token which is the token the governance token the voting token come to the maker dow governance system and vote on what they think the parameters of the maker dow system should be and when these people vote correctly and choose the correct parameters then the trustless side of maker dao is enabled to continue to operate right so it's all about enabling the products and services of maker dow to be maximally successful maximally used increasing die adoption and the the way that they do that is that the maker dow governance hold the people that hold the mkr token come to the maker dial system and vote on what the parameters should be in order to keep the the vaults and die and all of the the products of maker dial up and running and so this this voting system is very much a human-centered system uh and now that can even itself be split into trustless and trusted the the idea is that mkr voting is a trustless phenomenon because there are so many voters voicing so many opinions with all the different mkr out there that you as a mass incentive system they automatically come as a wisdom of the crowd's effect come to the right decision in order to choose the right parameters and so that itself is also supposed to be this automated thing that happens but it's very different than you know uniswap where it just goes and goes and goes it does require human input at some point in time to choose the correct parameters so you've got this set of decisions that are completely trustless made by machine you've got this other set of decisions in maker that are still made by humans who act essentially as a as a currency board of sorts adjusting interest rates and that sort of thing and those decisions made by humans are essentially made by vote and this is vote of maker holders so in a lot of ways this kind of represents and resembles a shareholder governance at least to me where you've got a bunch of folks with with capital um and the capital votes on whether they want to support a decision or not but there are some other pieces of centralization in maker too so there is the the foundation that maybe we should talk about there are the physical offices of of maker there is the website ui which is also partially centralized even though you can access the back end of maker the part of the ui itself is centralized right now there are some of the leaders like roon for instance you know what are some how should we think about some of these other pieces of centralization no project just starts decentralized that can't happen uh bitcoin at one point in time was running on only one person's computer before it spun out and was adopted by more computers and then more computers and and maker dial follows that same path it every project starts centralized and that's and the maker dial is no exception the maker dao foundation is this uh this group of people that are responsible for spinning out maker into this self-sustaining platform the self-sustaining protocol but it's not there yet because of the demands and complications of maker dao we need to create the infrastructure before we let it go and be completely humanless we need to make sure that we are setting it up for success and that's what the maker dow foundation does the maker dow foundation is funded by the sale of the mkr governance token because when the mkr governance token was minted it was minted in the same wallet it was minted and controlled by the same small group of people and they've used the sale from the mkr token to fund out the development of maker which is good which is what we want from the protocol perspective but it does give some people more control than others um for example like you said the the website of maker where people come to vote in governance protocols i don't know about you ryan but i am not very technical i can't code and so if i wanted to voice my opinion as to what the stability fee should be i would need somebody to make it really easy on me i couldn't go and take my mkr and vote directly on the blockchain even though that is possible because the protocol at the end of the day is trustless in that way where if you have mkr you get to vote the ui on the website for submitting votes and submitting proposals that is centralized that is managed by the foundation and so that is one of the big obstacles that they are trying to overcome so that it reduces dependence on the foundation there are physical offices for the foundation there's new york offices there's copenhagen offices they're all over the world but at the end of the day there are a central group of people that are helping um build out the protocol into existence into the future and so this has created the maker dao protocol versus the maker foundation the dao versus the foundation the decentralized part of maker versus the centralized group of people that are helping spin it out and this centralized group of people represents some degree of trust we are trusting that the foundation has the best interest of maker at his heart and is doing the right things to help both dye and mkr grow into fruitful long living protocols there are probably two other pieces that uh make maker a bit more centralized uh the first is the oracle so the the way debt is liquidated um in the mechanics of the system are based on a price feed oracle so these are managed by um 10 to 20 or so different entities some of these are known some of these are unknown but having an external price feed in an oracle is not a purely decentralized solution that is potentially a centralization vector and potentially a a point of failure and something that they are working to continue to decentralize so there's that there's also the assets that are put inside of maker itself so some of these assets are what we've called what we called an episode for trustless economic bandwidth like ether and some of these assets are are more trusted so the basic attention token is a more trusted asset than ether is it you know has an issuer that issuer can potentially change things it's certainly not as liquid doesn't have as much economic bandwidth maker has also recently added a stablecoin token called usdc so a portion of all dye is mostly ether partly basic attention token and now also usdc which is a much more trusted bank issued stablecoin it's it's issued by by coinbase and and circle and so some of the assets inside of maker can make maker itself and die itself less trustless so less settled completely on aetherium on chain and a bit more settled in the legal system so all of these things you know show where maker really is on that spectrum of trust uh and they're they're certainly not as far to the to the right as uniswap but they're not they're certainly not as far to the left as uh tokenized securities might be they're somewhere in the middle they're almost like a a new crypto specific uh bank not pure protocol but not pure bank something in the middle and i i think there's absolutely room in the ethereum open finance ecosystem for applications like these and makers is still an extremely exciting project but but it does make me wonder i don't know if you've thought this david but it does make me wonder if there is room for potentially a more decentralized and completely trustless stable coin system that maybe is only purely backed by eth or something like that have you given that thought yeah that's a really hard problem and the reason for that is because stability is a reference if we want a stable erc20 token we need to define what we are being stable against and die just takes the quick and easy route in saying all right we're going to be stable with the dollar while there could be there are other ways of having stability it's simply changing that price feed to something else but no matter what stability comes from outside of ethereum not from inside of ethereum so we need to get data from outside of the ethereum onto the chain and that requires some level of human coordination so it's it's very very difficult to have stability with without sacrificing some sort of trustlessness or decentralization because they're getting data from off of the chain to on the chain requires human input that's not really something that we have really solved uh when it comes to being fully computerized code now you talked about the different collaterals inside of of maker and how that kind of taints dye if you will because usdc could be burned from the maker vault so that's a risk vector the brave foundation could say that they're abandoning bats so that's a risk vector however i think this is a really good illustration as to why ether is so powerful because of what it is ether itself is a permissionless asset and because it is the main permissionless asset of ethereum it will always have characteristics and qualities about itself that make it better collateral than any trusted collateral right so um at realty we're working on getting our tokens into maker dow but it real tokens and you know real estate is our is great collateral but there's centralization risk and there's also liquidity risk right because we both it's not native to ethereum and so that is qualities that ether does have being native to ethereum being inherently trustless and being inherently liquid i think will make ether the the leading collateral and maker dao forever ether is the first class citizen of ethereum and anytime companies like realty that bring off chain assets that could be good collateral to ethereum they make ethereum and therefore ether more valuable which increases its value which increases its liquidity ether will always be more liquid than any off-chain asset on ethereum and so i think on the spectrum at the very beginning of this episode i talked about how things gravitate over time towards the trustless end of the spectrum and this is one illustration of of why that is because it's hard to compete with ether because of its trustlessness as collateral yeah i think that's a that's a really great point you know the fact of the matter is credibly neutral trustless protocols tend to be the ones that the world builds on top of have you ever run one of those uh experiments david where you put like um different density liquids in a glass and sort of you know see where they see where they end up you might put a corn syrup or a honey some kind of a an oil and water inside of a glass and you pour them in sort of one by one and what what tends to happen yeah they stratify right so the dense stuff falls to the bottom and the light stuff rises to the top and then you can even drop in physical objects in there right so you can drop in like a metal metal ball ball bearing it'll fall to the bottom or you could drop in you know something else and it will find itself find its balance between those two layers uh but what are you getting at yeah that's what that experiment teaches us is that you know dense materials sink it's like you know the center of the earth is is uh iron because in the early formation of the earth the dense material sank to the bottom and that same effect happens i think with with protocols we've called this the the great protocol sink of uh to kind of describe it the the credibly neutral the more machine-like protocols tend to sink to the bottom of the money stack so they tend to be the base layer that everything else builds on top of why because they're the most dense and here's what i mean by that so let's say um you know china released its blockchain uh this you know and they're working on a central bank digital currency right now we don't know what that's going to look like it'll probably have some blockchain type characteristics would the u.s ever build on china's blockchain on its settlement layer of course not they never would i mean the u.s would lose its sovereignty by doing that um you could see it at a more minor scale binance has a chain the binance blockchain binance for those who don't know is a large crypto exchange one of their main competitors coinbase would never issue assets to the binance chain why because it gives binance the power and coinbase loses sovereignty in the process what would both of these countries and both of these exchanges do well both of them would be fine with issuing on a credibly neutral platform that neither of them control that's fine because they don't have to trust their adversary that's generally how the game theory around these things work out is if there are a lot of different options and some of those options are controlled by by individuals or countries or groups and others of those other options are not controlled they're credibly neutral well everyone's going to build on the most credibly neutral foundation and protocol and platform that's why the world adopted gold you can think of money as a platform gold wasn't issued by a nation-state by a king by an emperor so nations built on top of it as their money system and that's why the i think what's going to happen is the more machine-like protocols on ethereum will become the the base layer so it's very safe to build your liquidity exchange on top of uniswap right now why because no one controls uniswap because the rules of the uniswap game are completely embedded in code and everyone knows what those rules are in advance and everyone knows that no one can edit those rules without essentially forking the project and and starting over so it's very safe for other money protocols to build on top of uniswap it's not as safe to build on top of a crypto bank and so i think what we might see is that crypto banks and exchanges like coinbase and binances binance right now they are kind of the for a lot of money applications they are sort of the base layer if you want to lend if you want to borrow if you want to exchange you can you could do all of those things inside of these crypto banks but what i think is going to happen is these money protocols these higher density neutral credibly neutral protocols will sort of tend to sink to the bottom and they will essentially become the base layer even of exchanges so ways we might see this practically happen i expect in the next year or so for an exchange like coinbase to start picking up the die savings rate so that means they will include an option maybe a button that says click here and deposit your die in the die savings rate and the die savings rate of course once die is deposited there it it allows the depositor to receive some interest on that deposit and so they will exchange will start to incorporate these more credibly neutral protocols uh instead of competing with them and effectively they'll start building on top of them does that make sense 100 and i run i resonate with that so much and i know there's two different subject matters that are related that i want to bring up one you talked about fairness and the other you talked about uh dependability uh people humans we have in our brains a very strong fairness detector kids at a very young age as they are growing up learn what fairness is and what is fair at a very very early age we have this built into the way that we are with the way that we are wired and you can see this in other species as well there's this experiment that i love where uh two monkeys are being fed by someone and one monkey is they're both fed cucumbers which are are okay treats and then one monkey is starting to be fed a grape while the other monkey is fed another cucumber and grapes are way better treats than cucumbers now in these experiments that have gone on the the monkey that is on the raw end of this deal the one that is still getting the cucumber while the other monkey is getting the grape uh doesn't eat the cucumber it throws it back at the at the uh the experimenter saying that this isn't fair like he's getting a cucumber and i'm getting a or he's getting a grape and i'm getting a cucumber this fairness meter is built into us and that's why it makes so much more sense for people to like a to to go back to money to like a money that is completely fair that's why money and fairness are really really important to have together and that's why we're probably going to build on a credibly neutral platform like ethereum rather than a a company chain like binance when you say david if a money loses its fairness that's when it tends to hyperinflate and that's when it tends to lose its meme status as the money inflation is unfairness uh instantiated in money right and so that's that's again why it's so important to have money that no one can print that no one has its hands on the lever uh and so the other topic you talked about was dependability uh at realty we use uniswap for our liquidity and we do that because of the assurances that uniswap offer us because we understand that it's going to be it's going to exist into the future uh uniswap is a durable platform there's nothing about it that from what you can see from the code indicates that it's going to go away at any point in time and this assurance for us as a company this assurance that we get from uniswap is really really valuable we can use uniswap as we see fit and it will always be there for us into the future and so going uh and you talked about you know coinbase using the dsr the way that these things work and going back to your your density topic for the the systems and applications that are completely computer run are dependable you can depend on them being there for you into the future and that's why humans stack on top of computers not the other way around computers are always at the bottom end of the stack they don't mess anything up they run exactly as programmed and they they can be coded to be inherently fair they can be coded to be inherently neutral and and so that for that reason i think we're always going to see computers being relied on rather than humans because that's what ethereum is for that's what the blockchain is that's its main purpose as a blockchain is to enable financial activity that's managed by computers it's the permissionless aspect too right like so you didn't have to in order for realty to issue property tokens on uh unit swap and put them inside liquidity pool pools rather you didn't have to ask any permission it's a completely neutral protocol in terms of what assets it accepts and what it denies no no one can gatekeep you no one can finance charges a quarter million dollars for a listing fee right and what do you think binance would would ever allow coinbase uh to to list some asset on on binance that it didn't want of course not i mean it's not going to allow its chief competitor uh to do that sort of thing so it makes binance chain a no-go from the beginning it's not credibly neutral it has a gatekeeper it's permissioned it is let low density it's at the top of the glass rather than the bottom of the glass that's what we mean by the great protocol sync we should talk about our sponsors talking about excellent protocols and fantastic vertical sinks there's a protocol called ave that you absolutely have to check out this is a much more trustless protocol on the spectrum it's probably somewhere in the middle more towards the uniswap side of things it's a lending and borrowing protocol on ethereum so what does that mean it means you can put dye inside of it and it will magically transform that dye into an interest bearing die token you can look at the interest rates on ave.com you can also borrow against it so you could deposit eth inside of it and then actually take out assets against that eth the blending that you do can be fixed rate rather than variable so you know exactly what you're going to pay in advance developers you've got to check out their flash loans this is a powerful protocol that's going to be the basis of a lot of cool things in d5 deposit crypto start earning and borrowing check out their flash loans go to ave.com and try it out that's aave.com to try it out talking about how ethereum is replacing trusted systems with non-trusted systems check out monolith who uses ethereum as its back end for dye management so you can use your monolith visa card to spend your die everywhere in the world and instead of using your bank account to hold your money you can trust ethereum and monolith to hold your die and you can see it on chain this is a great example of how computers are always going to be better trusted than humans and so if you want to have a little bit of ethereum in your pocket go to monolith.xyz and sign up and get the the defy card that allows you to spend your die anywhere in the world anywhere where visa is accepted okay so we've we've talked about the trust spectrum a lot we've talked a bit about the great protocol sync low density protocol sinking to the bottom let's talk about another subject that i think has been on the minds of of d5 folks for a while and that is the subject of of backdoors so some of these protocols um not a uniswap on the far right but some of them more towards the middle actually have the ability that their developers have the ability to edit contracts is that right yeah and each protocol is different uh while what you can say that you know protocol x has a back door that doesn't actually answer many questions you need to ask the question well what does that back door enable them to do so for example dui dx a favorite protocol of mine has a back door but that back door doesn't allow them to steal my tokens steal my assets and so it does enable them to change other things like oracles and and matching engines i believe uh and for other protocols like a compound i believe the admin keys the backdoor for compound does allow the team to take your assets and run however i would never expect them to do this because that would be theft and they are a centralized company that ultimately must answer to some legal system somewhere also they would be sabotaging their own business however it is important to know what protocols have back doors and what those back doors can can do now back doors aren't inherently evil most protocols i would say that have a back door i i prefer them to have that back door rather than just to rush to plug it up just in the name of trustlessness or decentralization backdoors are really useful teams that are building applications on ethereum they aren't done as soon as they deploy it to ethereum that is just the first step it needs to be iterated expanded developed improved and that's what the back door allows them to do if they plug that back door too soon they would be fixing their application the way that it was without any further development and upgrade and so while backdoors do represent centralization and trust they also represent a commitment to improve and iterate and make a better product i i believe that most ethereum teams that have applications on ethereum that are building in the d5 space have a inherent social contract that they are they are trying to make everything trustless as possible and perhaps in that same social contract is a commitment to plug that back door when the time is right however every single application is different and every team has their own vision and so everyone should be doing their own research as to what defy applications they use what that back door does and what that back door uh enables the team to do yeah it's certainly a trade-off isn't it so you know you mentioned compound i believe they've recently implemented a a time delay so that any admin access to their contracts and again these are these are contracts that are deployed on ethereum that some set of developers has the ability to edit them or change them around and have specific functions compound has implemented a 24-hour delay so any changes that they put in place 24 hours has to occur before those changes take into effect and all of that is is highly visible that's one way to manage it maker has done something similar but at the same time that's also a trade-off because if there is a a bug an emergency situation that requires a developer team to get in there and make some changes and save the system potentially well they can't do that right away it takes some time it takes there's a 24-hour delay in place that 24-hour delay also however protects against the five dollar wrench attack so if you are known to be the operator of a backdoor of the admin keys you might be success susceptible to the five dollar wrench attack what's the five dollar wrench attack the five dollar wrench attack is where someone comes uh to your door and beats down your door with a five dollar wrench that they bought in a hardware shop and so they don't need uh you know thousands and thousands of dollars of collateral or hacking skills or anything they can just come to your house and uh hold a five dollar wrench to your head and make you do something with your admin keys so the mere existence of admin keys makes the five dollar wrench attack a possible attack but that 24-hour delay can help mitigate the five dollar wrench attack yeah absolutely and you know i i hear a lot of criticism about uh these back doors the ability for teams behind some of these protocols to upgrade the protocol to edit it um some folks say well that means defy is not really decentralized right and to into which we would say well of course it's not all completely decentralized this is an open permissionless financial system there are organizations that are going to build more centralized protocols on top of it and some that are going to build pure machine protocols on top of it so it's important to understand that there is a a spectrum of these things the second thing i would say is is this is um when people complain about d5 protocols not being as decentralized as as their ideals they often don't compare them to exchanges in crypto banks you could pull off a five dollar wrench attack against uh coinbase potentially if you knew who held the multi-sigs of all of the contracts coinbase itself with a shareholder vote uh they might be in some legal trouble if they did this but with a shareholder vote or with the leaders of the protocol could find a way into their own vaults and and steal the funds so at some level it it kind of annoys me when we compare uh you know d5 to this perfect end state vision rather than compare it to the systems that we have like cryptobanks and like the traditional system where we don't even have the option to be non-custodial and to have any degree of trustlessness yeah it riles me up so much i get i get so angry when people forget to make this this accurate comparison it's simply a choice of what you are using as your reference point to compare to what is defy or not uh i so somehow people have decided that bitcoin is the ultimate version of defy and all other you know teams that are building on uh projects like ethereum crypto economic protocols like ethereum they are comparing it to bitcoin and saying well if you're not like if you're not to bitcoin's degree of trustlessness then you're not defy but you the more much more helpful and accurate and realistic anchor to compare it to is all the centralized counterparts of the the centralized finance world so when it comes to compound finance how not let's not compare it to bitcoin but let's compare it to sofi or some other borrowing and lending platform from from silicon valley that is completely defy and so instead of comparing it to the the maximal possible version of decentralized finance which isn't even an anchor point that we have available to us bitcoin is not the ultimate representation of decentralized and trustless it's there's there's further areas of trustlessness and decentralization that you can go beyond bitcoin bitcoin is just the thing that we know about it's really just far more helpful to compare it to the other end of the spectrum and to compare d5 applications to their legacy counterparts and in that sense realty is defy because if in a world where realty uh real token assets real estate are on ethereum you can and you can go to different d5 protocols and use real estate in them like maker dow or compound you are permissionlessly getting a loan from maker dow or borrowing and lending with compound with real estate and you are doing that without permission now you kyc with realty to get your real tokens but that line of credit that you got through maker dow was totally defy and so i think even companies like realty are d5 companies even though there is significant amounts of trust there because we are built on this defy universe with d5 financial services available to you yeah if you go back to the memes episode too i mean we prefer to call uh this whole thing this whole experiment open finance or permissionless finance because that better encapsulates the spectrum but i think what we're saying to bankless listeners here is don't be a binary thinker guys like like you know it's not just black or white there is a full spectrum of shades and colors of things that can be created on top of the base layer decentralized uh protocol here the core protocol ethereum itself the base money system that is the thing that we want to preserve the decentralization in and above that we'll have applications across the spectrum and what will inevitably happen is the protocols that have higher trustlessness that are more credibly neutral that hit product market fit those will sink to the bottom those will become the foundation of this system and that will happen organically and naturally now one last question i think david that we should answer before we wrap up so we've kind of painted this world of of variation that also means variation in terms of the assets that are deployed on ethereum so some will be tokenized securities that are completely trusted others will be more like die that have a mix of of trustlessness and entrusted aspects to them but if ethereum sucks in all of these assets these traditional world assets these trusted assets into its gravity well what does that mean for the role of ether in this world does ether not matter does it become a lesser collateral do we essentially replace every you know loan in in a system like maker with usdc as collateral rather than eth what's your take this is a discussion that we will spend multiple episodes on because it's it's such a long story and and there's so many different things to to talk about uh in a summary all things all roads lead to ether at the end of the day it's it's pretty impossible to build something on ethereum without positively impacting the value of ether as a result and so even if you are on ethereum and you are doing things in the most limited ways you are still positively impacting the price of ether if if all you are doing is buying block space if whatever you have on ethereum whatever piece of economic infrastructure you have is only doing one thing which is buying a small amount of block space well then you're still paying fees to ether and ether holders and ether stakers and i think we're starting to tease what might be next week's episode which is going to be an episode that talks about ether value accrual mechanisms but at the very least the bare minimum of putting economic activity of any kind onto ethereum pays fees to ether and to whatever degree that ethereum runs on trustless assets that weight of that that percentage of the ethereum economy always converges on ether and so this is a very long conversation that i think we're going to peel back the layers of in future episodes absolutely i do think this black hole analogy is is right because as a black hole sucks in matter other financial assets in this case it gets bigger it gets more massive and it has the ability to suck in even more matter and ether certainly has that value accrual mechanism both in terms of it being required to do run any transaction on ethereum a burning mechanism that we're going to talk about in the next episode it's called eip1559 where a portion is of ether is actually burned in the future for every transaction that takes place staking which means a lot of these transaction fees also go to the holders of eth and then just the fact that as people start to embrace these systems more and more as people start to use even tokenized assets like usdc or tokenized securities that will bring them further into the bankless crypto financial system and some of them in the sales funnel are going to purchase some of the crypto native assets like ether and like bitcoin as part of that and that might be the the primary value accrual mechanism that we see but we're going to talk about some of those things in the next episode which we're super excited about just a quick recap of today we talked about the the two faces of ethereum on the far left the human protocols on the far right the machine protocols we talked about how the machines will win the the protocols that have the highest density the highest credible neutrality will sink to the bottom we talked a little bit about how eth can win in that scenario as well not just ethereum the network but eth the asset so guys here's what we want you to do this has been a action-packed episode we want you to take some actions home with you as well subscribe to the podcast i know you've done that already we also need five-star reviews right david why do we need those five stars we need those five stars so that everyone can listen to us uh the the more five stars that we have the higher we show up in generic term search rankings such as crypto or bitcoin or ethereum uh if you type in bank list we show up but if you type in generic crypto words we don't there are some podcasts that show up ahead of us that in my opinion don't deserve to be there especially when they haven't released an episode in nine months and so if you could help us out by giving us a five star review in itunes it would be extremely helpful for spreading the bankless message yeah guys let's get bankless to the top of the charts that's how we take on this revolution last thing check out the show notes so we'll include some of the articles that we mentioned here today bankless is not only an audio format there's also some great supporting reading material that you should absolutely check out risks and disclaimers guys eat this risky crypto is risky in general d5 all the protocols we talked about today maker compound unit swap these things are risky if you put money into them understand what you're going into this is the wild west this is the frontier it's not for everybody make sure you know the risks going in this has been the d5 trust spectrum episode 6. thanks for listening thanks everyone
