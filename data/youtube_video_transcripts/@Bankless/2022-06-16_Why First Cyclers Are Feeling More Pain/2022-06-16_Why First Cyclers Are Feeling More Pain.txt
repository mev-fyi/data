there's two reasons why first cyclers are feeling more pain than the veterans one is because they bought the assets at a higher price so like it's obvious that they're feeling more pain they bought ether at two thousand dollars or higher whereas the veterans bought it at like in between eighty and five 500 the other reason is because the veterans have felt it before and so like the veterans are more emotionally prepared to say we have been here before and like this is just how it goes where the fur cyclers are like the sky is crashing and yet at the same time that's time is different because of the goddamn interest rates ryan is the interest rates that rugged us in 2018 when ether went from fourteen hundred dollars down to eighty bitcoin went from twenty thousand dollars down to three thousand dollars there were no interest rates and so like even the veterans have gotten blindsided by the speed of the macro markets and so like that actually is like if you want to blame anything blame the fed they printed a bunch of money they sent us all to the moon and then they and then they rugged us by raising interest rates which should be expected in hindsight it's obvious but also like yeah i kind of feel like the fed should take some blame here
