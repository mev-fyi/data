Fiat money is pretty dumb he knows how to add and it knows how to subtract and so the result of that is you have to set up this other data layer on top of it in these Excel sheets that allows you to try to like take transactions right and like maybe you set up the incentive to write initially maybe you didn't but try to like do that accounting afterwards and by using computable money we can actually build that data layer into the transactions themselves we can really build something that is a difference in kind from the sorts of computational structures where people were trying to use Fiat money to like kind of you know build incentives but then because Fiat money is a computationally insufficient substrate for modeling environmental externalities right you can't like take a forest and all of the biodiversity benefits of a forest and like easily price them in a way that's visible to the market we can actually start to like build these systems in a way where the incentives could actually work and improve over time
