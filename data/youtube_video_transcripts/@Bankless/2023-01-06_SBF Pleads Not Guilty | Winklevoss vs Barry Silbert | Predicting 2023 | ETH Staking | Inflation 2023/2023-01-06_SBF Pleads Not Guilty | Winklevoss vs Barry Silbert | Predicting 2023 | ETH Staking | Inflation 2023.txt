SBF pleads not guilty bold strategy we'll see how that plays out thankless Nation welcome to the first roll-up of 2023. David you ready for this 52 more weekly Roll-Ups to go in 2023 how is that intimidating Ryan do you think we can do it oh I think we can do it I've got the stamina I'm coming into uh this year fully energized actually that break was uh really good for me and some time to reflect and I was feeling kind of burnt out by the end of the year but no longer I'm ready for 2023 I'm excited about it how are your holidays Dave did you get any uh special Christmas gifts anything cool we only uh do stocking stuffers in my family and I got dry bags which I think is just great because dry bags are what you or bags you put stuff into when you put into your mountaineering like backpack so you can like go walk through snow and rain and not get your stuff wet so yeah your boy is going to be having a dry sleeping bag while he climbs some mountains this year just dry bagging it yeah it's like a disease it doesn't sound it doesn't sound like a sexy present let me tell you no dry bags but awesome man you I know you're doing some mountains this year so not come in handy for sure right yeah I also noticed by the way when you're setting up for this episode that you've got a little portrait behind you that I don't know if people can see okay so maybe our editors can kind of cut this in or Dave is going to try a zoom in on the portrait it almost looks like it's actually there yeah but at the top of it is I think a Memento from 2022. that will be a long time Memento to help us remember that year which is a uh picture of you uh tearing up during during a roll up this was a a roll-up where we were talking about how bad everything was and all of the scammers in the space and I think it like kind of hit you yeah uh and it became a meme all right like I saw twitch streamers talking about this yeah and somebody normally twin streamers yeah somebody turned it into an nft in like an art piece and it's just fantastic like crying crypto bro is probably what mainstream might might tag this no that's exactly that's exactly why it got caught traction and like the gamer twitch sphere the person that painted this acts really phenomenal like piece of artwork I'm going to zoom in on it again is actually a hexagon that was a hex Community member that I bought people that familiar that's just somebody from the hex Community right yes exactly that's what they think that's what they call them hexagons yeah it's like a really good like watercolor and I paid them 100 usdc uh and they shipped it to me yeah that's awesome I love that I also think that so far uh that uh is marks the bottom that's the bottom I think you think okay well so part of the topics for this week guys we'll get in the topics but one of them is our 2023 predictions yeah and you may have already heard a tease David sounds like he's calling a bottom yeah I might check you on that we'll see we'll see when we get to the predictions also we've got SPF pleading not guilty I didn't do it he says in court we're gonna talk about that what else are we covering today uh the Winklevoss have picked a fight with Barry silbert on Twitter the Winklevoss of course are operating the Gemini exchange which the Gemini earned program has money stuck inside of Genesis which is part of Barry silbert's digital currency group and it's both twins right you can mess with one you mess with the other exactly yeah exactly yeah uh and so we're gonna pick apart that fight uh and also some bad news on the Celsius Court proceedings Ryan I'm sad to say that you are uh not a customer of Celsius you actually are just a investor depositor creditor just like the rest of them just a sucker just another sucker yeah okay cool thank you my private keys to Alex machinsky that's exactly what happened yes uh and yes that's exactly right uh and then of course we have to talk about 2023 predictions hours we're also going to rate some of our 2022 predictions uh and also talk about some other very awesome predictions that we've seen throughout the space uh Eric Walla in particular I think we're gonna go through his uh but first in the market section we got to talk about all the things going on in the liquid staking derivatives ecosystem because that's a very hot topic leading into 2023 this week so all of these topics and more coming throughout the show guys we're gonna get right into it before we do what we want to tell you about our friends and sponsors over at osmosis David one of my New Year's resolutions going to 2023 was to do more defy stuff I felt like 2022 last year was all about just keeping my head above water and just talking about all the [ __ ] all the craziness that was going on this year I've made a considered effort to go use more things one of those things I've started using is osmosis on the cosmos chain this is really cool if you want to explore the cosmos ecosystem particularly defied Cosmos osmosis is the place to start the way you do it is you spin up this wallet it's called the Kepler wallet you're from the ethereum ecosystem it's kind of like metamask only for Cosmos and you go to app.osmosis.zone there's a link in the show notes you can deposit atoms to this chain you can Bridge across usdc and weth a small amounts to start that's that's all I would advise but it's a great opportunity to start this chain and David I started on this chain and David I was surprised at how easy and how good the ux was it'd probably been like two or three years since I went down the cosmos Rabbit Hole I hadn't been here in a long time and the ux has just like 10x improved on osmosis you can not only trade it's kind of like a uniswap type app but you can also stake you can also view all of your assets so it's almost got kind of like a zerion zapper type flavor to it too uh really cool thing to try in 2023 if you're looking to explore the frontier of crypto yeah and bankless listeners who listen to our episode about why uni chain is inevitable within Elite sir uh This is highly synonymous with that whole thesis osmosis is basically kind of uniswapa as an app chain in the uh Cosmos ecosystem so just wanted to connect that dot there Ryan you said you uh you one of your New Year's resolutions is to be more of a defy power user uh because and I think uh I want you to draw your attention to the suite if we could actually just derail this conversation oh sure go ahead I stopped I stopped being a defy like super heavy power user and just have it having like latent positions that I would hold open on like the uh the blue chips like Ave maker and that's because in 2022 a lot of the defy stuff you and I didn't really Vibe with and so the tweet that I want to call attention to if you can pull the pull that up I just send it to you in Zoom chat oh yeah this is one year ago to the day when we got into a fight with Daniel sesta uh by the way so this is just a one year anniversary of our first of many fights throughout 2023 starting with Daniel sesta when he came in super hot in my DMs after I said maker is the most unsustainably valued most sustained unfairly valued asset this industry has ever produced and then Daniel sassa who I didn't know who he was at the time I knew what Wonderland was I knew what like time and spell and all that stuff was I just didn't know Daniel cessed his name uh and so you know he was a D5 developer doing right Degen he's like a D5 Wonder kid kind of person right exactly yeah right and like a big populist leader with big populist tweets uh and this was like the after the time token and all of these like Danny tokens were like at their all-time highs so he follows up and says this is why I'm not surprised you've never invited us to your D5 show fair to protect your bags yeah and your suit friends I have never ever been charged with having suit friends before so that was a first I was like who the hell is this guy yeah bit boy did that same thing to me he called me a suit like right so it's the same people like going for after popular tactics right yeah I just thought this is you know January 4th 2022 is it dark times yeah I I'm feeling so much better than I was at that point in time like I was just getting sick of it and this like where where's where is Danny Sessa now you've been kind of Washington projects yeah destroyed um turned into kind of like just a short-term pump and dumper right uh that's what it was and it was revealed only like what six six weeks later six weeks later yeah and then we got in a fight with dokwan and about six weeks later after that that fell down and then and then we did it again and then we that was the story of 2022 and that's getting in fights with people and then blowing them then blowing well that's another thing so I want to be more of a D5 user I have time for that rather than kind of chasing all this you know speculation all the craziness going on right I have more time for that too another thing is uh I don't intend to pick any fights yeah I mean I don't want to say it's only the good people left I mean like we could go uh fight Richard Hart right now if we wanted to yeah but like yeah so uh anyway it's it's a refreshing way to start the year and speaking of which let's talk about markets David right because we got to get to the where are we starting uh in the market section let's talk about Bitcoin and uh we should get get cracking on that right now thanks to Kraken for showing us these prices uh what is bitcoin looking like on the week uh Bitcoin start of the week at 16 600 it is up about 1.2 percent to 16 834 where we currently are by the way Ryan since we're level setting because it's 2023 we are about a little bit more than one year away from the next Bitcoin happening early in 2024 is when the next Bitcoin happening is scheduled I feel like no one's talking about it David well having's not priced in it's only your way so it's all more than a year away but still I mean I remember like previous happenings the 2020 happening I mean they're such fervor like even 18 months from The Happening 18 months out from the how many Bitcoin communities talking about it but it's it's actually becoming less and less impactful over time yeah I mean and that checks out right because every happening has like 50 less magnitude um than the happening prior it's like an asymptote right uh but also just like Bitcoin isn't as a center point of this industry as it was four years ago let's look at the ear for Bitcoin uh down on the year huh big down on the Year big up yeah big down on the air down 60 on the year 40 000 all the way down um how about eth what's that looking like eth up 3.9 on the week uh going up from twelve hundred dollars up to twelve hundred and fifty dollars and seven days great yeah this is like on January 3rd there's a pump we had a you know three to four percent rise in one day yeah yeah exactly and people are pointing at the BTC ratio for they were just of ta about convergence on the eth BTC ratio that was either going to break up or break down people were placing their bets and turns out it broke up it broke to the upside which leads us to the eth BTC ratio which is up 2.8 percent on the week 0.072 up to 0.074 where we are today uh and so yeah that's that's the state of the markets with uh ether and Bitcoin and the ratio well uh let's talk about some other metrics and we'll do a yearly recap here so how about the total crypto market cap where are we under a billion oh yeah under a billion 850 billion on the total crypto market cap how does this compare on a year over year so when we look at the performance of 2022 some numbers coming in so the S P 500 David was down so this is stocks down about 18 last year uh NASDAQ so this is like tech stocks remember growth stocks which boomed like crazy in 2020 2021 um down 33 so stocks down bad ish but not compared to crypto let's take a look at some of those numbers total crypto market cap David down 65 percent for 2022. now now that includes the stable coin market cap so there's some some bad uh just bad measurement there because a bunch of that market cap is just went flat and so the actual crypto asset market cap is down worse than that I see in in terms of investable assets the pain that people feel right yeah that's a good good note uh Bitcoin down 65 during 2022. uh eth down 68 2022. Seoul Salata tokens down 94 other alt layer ones similar DPI this is the D5 pulse index so these are the top defy tokens down 80 percent which doesn't sound so bad but I'll remind you that it was down 80 the year prior to that too oh okay back to back down 80 so uh prediction this is a comeback year right can't get anywhere yeah right like that's got it there D5 isn't about been in a bear Market they're like hey welcome guys for a year yeah we've already been down in the eighth circle of hell uh nft Blue Chip this is the top 10 nfts this is a metric coming from nanson which is interesting only down 15 percent yeah I guess the way to measure your entities is an eth that's correct so yeah that's that's all right is that how you measure it I don't think I don't know that's not how mainstream measures it's all dollars like you bought a million dollar Punk you're not going you're down in each to them somebody will talk about this well somebody bought a punk uh for a certain dollar price that's about the same dollar price that it was sold so it was a wash in dollar terms but they were up about 3x in East terms was that a victory or was that not a victory well you you and I know the answer that was a huge Victory almost 3x Victory because it is money and it's the money you want to hold uh stablecoin market cap so to your point this is the total volume value excuse me of all stable coins out there down 17 so we had some um exit from stable coins defy total value locked this is like assets under management down 76 uh layer 2 total locked value is also down actually on the year in dollar terms down 28 yes that's a win tell me but tell me the Silver Lining because if you denominate it in eth what is it yes a layer two tvl denominated in eth is up a hundred and eighteen percent that so that in the grand scheme of things that's what a bull market looks like in 2022 you are only down 28.7 percent and your East denominated tvl is up a hundred and twenty percent the l2s are currently in a bull market despite the rest of crypto being down an average of 65 if you are only down 28 in in US dollar terms that's a win that's a huge win if you're down lease you're winning in this market l2's had a good year so that's how we rap 2022 that's what went on we'll talk a little bit more about what we can expect in 2023 later in the episode but of course uh crypto spot volume on exchanges down as well so you can see the peak here like the peak was around May of 2021 yep in terms of volume on volume on exchanges what is FTX where's FTX here do you see out on the on the on the right I don't see it huh stripped FTX from these charts but legitimate well I think they're not counting that as no longer legitimate yes all right well take us to some traditional Finance uh metrics as well give us some context for the SMP Market that were in the stock market that we're in and this decline versus others yeah so we're looking at a graph on on the screen here that basically has every single negative 20 or more decline from all-time high of the S P 500 and there's a bunch on screen there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve different uh 20 declines from all-time high since World War II and so you can see 2022 in red it's kind of hard to see because at the very beginning they're overlapping but I'm highlighting it here with my arrow here Ryan can't see that uh in red we have a 2022 and I would say it's among the herd it's definitely on the lower end of the herd as in it has dropped faster than the herd of these many many many different declines uh but I would say mostly par for the course slightly worse but also like we're in the middle of it it could continue over necessarily kind of looks a little bit at this point like the way 2007 looked right and so we are declining at about the right the same Pace that 2007 was except we are not at that point of 2007 where it was declining as much as we were and then it went down e like two to two and a half times more uh yeah so that's interesting here for you guys well so so if uh we get a 2023 that matches the stock market 2007 then we're down another 30 from here basically we're we got it we got way more to go yeah and that could take another what you know nine months to play out something like this yeah exactly that's that's like worst case scenario for sure we also had this 8.3 trillion was wiped out of the stock market in 2022 if uh that's a headline number for you as well um what does Michael burry's take on inflation I thought that was interesting as we entered this year as well yeah Michael Berry is calling for the peak of inflation he says inflation peaked but it is not the last peak of this cycle we will are likely to see lower CPI possibly negative in what's 2H 23 second half the second half of 2023 and the U.S in recession by any definition the FED will cut and government will stimulate and we will have another inflation spike is not hard so that's what he's saying are we've currently uh spiked but it's not going to be the last Spike that we will see but we're going to come down for it and then we'll Spike again and then he's probably saying we're going to come down from that Spike and then I'll Spike again thereafter I think that's what he's calling for this is kind of when we talk to some of the macro experts who we like and respect in Alden for instance in the summer this is kind of what she was predicting basically that we would be able to slay the beast but then it would return and it would just be basically chop from inflation from here on out um we're gonna just trade blows between inflation and our insurmountable debt problem and so we're gonna be like oh inflation it's too high we need to we need to raise interest rates and then we'll raise interest rates and like oh interest payments they're too high and then we'll go back and we'll just bounce back between those two things a bright spot in the crypto markets recently crypto asset markets have been um LSD LSD what is it what is LSD David explain what those are and show us some numbers here so lsds are liquid staking derivatives uh not the compound made by Albert Hoffman in 1947. uh odd amount about that yeah let me tell you Albert Hoffman yeah two ends on his name uh okay so uh to to lead the pack we have uh Lido rocket pool and suise out of the LSD sector uh Lido is up 45 which is a big deal because it's a pretty high market cap it's currently clocking in at 1.3 billion dollars in fully diluted values would a liquid staking derivatives do yes basically or this is like these are eth um like staking Services exactly yes and so the idea is that you can stake your eighth with one of these systems Lido rocket pulse wise there's also a few others and they will return you a staked eth token as a result and so that stake teeth token is ether plus the staking rewards that that ether is also getting so the rewards are built into the token so Lido has staked eth rocketpool has r e s wise has some I don't know I can't remember the name of it but it's got something similar uh and so then what we're talking about are the tokens associated with that protocol right so ldo is the Lido Dow token which is up 45 at a full fully diluted valuation of 1.3 billion dollars that's a big move 45 and these are over two week time Horizons by the way so 45 in two weeks a big move for for a 1.3 billion dollar valuation project rocket pool up 15 to 420 million dollars fully diluted and then swies as the smallest of the bunch up a whopping 61 percent uh for a 125 million dollar valuation uh Ryan did you know that uh we had exposure to Swayze and the bank was fund I died do you know that and yeah well done Ben okay David you mentioned the bank was fund what is this bank is fun thing uh yeah so we've got a Super Chat analyst Ben gov uh on the bank list team uh he's also highly active in the Inner Circle and he also does a ton of analyst research for the bankless newsletter uh which ends up turning into the bankless token report and also the token Bible so if you want some of this research you can go get that if you are a premium subscriber and using some of that research him and me and Ryan are in a little Discord room in the HQ chat and we talk about what we want to invest in uh based off of the research that he is doing for the token Bible for the and the token course and so if you want access to some of Ben's research and what we are thinking about when we invest in the bankless fund you can subscribe to bankless and get some of that research so uh swise was in there RPL was in there I do not believe we have Lido exposure no yes and of course all of our disclosures are posted at all times at banklesshq.com disclosures where you can see the composition of all things Bank list everything we hold um all right David let's uh let's talk about each staking because that number has gone up as well um this is we're looking at total eat deposited 16 million or so eth I know what percent that is about 13 maybe close to 14 of all you supply is now staked that's a big deal of course it only goes up into the right because withdrawals are not enabled but this yeah this thing has never not gone up into the right that thing is just an absolute rocket ship so 16 million ether State wow like not too far away from 20 million a big event Catalyst I think this quarter is the question of will we actually get withdrawals enabled maybe this quarter or shortly after into the next quarter and what will what will happen to this number once withdrawals are enabled um I think Dave and I have said before we don't think it'll go down that much others are a bit more bearish on this Say it'll uh decrease dramatically and that will be a net negative for ether um you know I'm still keeping the bull position on that I don't think this number goes down very far even post uh withdrawals when withdrawals are enabled I still think it creeps up and we definitely finish the year higher than when we started but what's your take on this oh I think that's exactly right uh I think that it'll there'll definitely be a short-term decrease because people will withdraw there will be more churn than there is a decrease as in people will be able to finally withdraw from Lido and this is kind of the meta that's going on right now with the with the LSD derivative like meta is like all right like a lot of stuff stuff is locked when there's finally churn that's enabled like who's going to try and capture lydo's market share is Lido going to even lose market share but like you know the fish are hungry and they're trying to capture some of that churn I think there's gonna be way more yeah the speaking of the snow globe yes exactly yeah and so this uh and because of withdrawals as a conversation people are just saying thinking that just like the attention is going to be on the LSD meta and so that's why we're talking about this right now the the trade the LLC trade has definitely shown up in the charts you can see it uh and uh whether I think the staking Supply will go down I bet you in the quarter in the three month period it will be net up so I bet you it could be down for a month maybe a sound for two months by around three months I'm pretty confident that whatever withdrawal the net withdrawals happen will have already happened and we'll be up into the right once again so LSD doing well uh so is arbitrum had a big year this is size Chad saying um arbitrim size is side by the way I'm at size chat in person permission do you know there's a picture out there somewhere I've never been able to find it of me uh size chatting Cooper Turley all like standing next to each other and I'm in the middle I have not seen that no it basically it looks like I'm like Frodo and there's like Aragorn in like you know more or something like I look like a child I'm a child sized compared to these people anyway uh what's what's the size Chad of uh arbitrim what's this uh graph we're looking at uh so on the left we have the deposit of eth into arbitrum one which is totaling a little bit over 800 000 and on the right we have deposits in eth to literally every single other Layer Two which is coming up to 700 000. now this isn't tvl this is to be this is e this is bridged eth which is in my mind the best kind of tvl but but you're right not all tvl and so arbitrom is literally the size Chad of layer twos so congrats to the arbitrum ecosystem and one thing I've definitely noticed on Twitter is that the arbitrum community has started to um delineate into sub communities and so you're seeing that same sort of thing that we saw on ethereum over 2020 to 2022 of ethereum developing into its own sub communities communities you're seeing that in arbitrum as well so the Arbitron like ecosystem is really strong yeah uh and we'll see this is another snow globe where this is just getting started this competition for l2s is just getting started and so uh I'd love to see this number at the end of 2023. David what do we got coming up next SBF pleads not guilty bold strategy we'll see how that plays out uh the winklevi of twins pick a fight with Barry Silber of dcg and Genesis on Twitter and again

and provides a wealth of knowledge and support on your journey West I'll see you in the Discord David I hope we left SBF in 2022 but he's back this time he's saying he's not guilty but before that he also said it wasn't me what is he talking about here this tweet none of these are me I'm not and couldn't be moving any of these funds I don't have access to them anymore what funds is he talking about people think he moved some money yeah so uh on crypto Twitter this conversation happened as soon as this one wallet which was known to be sbf's wallet started moving hundreds of thousands of dollars from one wallet a to wallet B and as and then SPF retweeted a coin Telegraph article talking about this saying none of these are me I couldn't be doing this because I don't have access to them anymore uh and then crypto Twitter replies like this is an address that you stated was yours like SBF frequently like previously identified this address that money is coming out to as my address as spf's address it's been noted by other people that it is spf's address and now SPF is saying it's not me uh and I don't know maybe it's not him but can you really trust him anymore like damn that was my comment I was just basically yeah but what if you're lying like I mean which at this point there's no difference yeah but remember last we left him before at least I broke for the holidays uh he was out on bail so he's still out um you know maybe in a house arrest I don't know if that's the case anymore but clearly he has access to Twitter now yeah so uh not in jail any longer uh we'll see if that changes this year and I think this meme really just summarizes everything it's the uh they don't know Meme of course but this time it has the curly hair of SPF as the guy in the corner and the curly hair SPF guy in the corner says they don't know it's not me moving the funds and then the people dancing are like you dox the address you dumb mfer so yeah summarizes uh he's also pleading not guilty okay to criminal Charlie so he's had his day in court so far and when the judge asked what do you plead Sam bankman freed he said not guilty I'm innocent of all the charges why do you think so I know there's been some conspiracy about this that again this idea that maybe he has some get out of jail free card he has some politician maybe the Wes involved um somebody's involved like the global Elites to to get him off the hook what do you think about this yeah so there I think there's the very simple take and I think then there's the more Nuance let's read into this take and I'll let you take that conversation the first one is that the plea deal that he got was so bad that he was like he it was wasn't a good plea deal at all so he's like damn it I'll just fight this right because he is so incredibly guilty that they basically gave him zero compromises on his plea deal and so he decided that uh because the plea deal was so bad I'll just I'll just fight it because that's a lose-lose scenario uh I think that is a pretty simple explanation but I know that there's another explanation that you've got that you want to talk about well this is an interesting opinion piece that I read in uh coindesk but basically the idea that um maybe Sam begman freed actually is so deluded that he thinks he's innocent he he thinks that he is the victim you know it's often said that nobody ever sees themselves as the villain yeah and I think that's the case with Sam bankman freed I mean he might legitimately think that um he is innocent of at least some of these charges I don't know what kind of moral framework he operates under it's been incredibly confusing uh for me to see over the last six months to you know or longer but um he may be really deluded enough to think that he's got a chance to fight this and that would be consistent with all of his interviews and the press to where he was going on before he actually got put in jail still though David I would have thought uh some nights in prison in the Bahamas would have woken him up to the reality that like he's in deep right and he's not going to get out of this with an interview and an aw shucks and saying I'm sorry 10 more times that these are serious charges laid against him and he doesn't really have a way out there's mounting evidence I mean his two uh Partners in this uh Caroline and and who's the other but they've effectively um you know routed him out they are effective really uh you know telling everything and divulging everything uh and I would imagine behind closed doors blaming him so I don't know if he gets out of this but he might just be deluded enough to think he can try yeah I mean I'm always happy to try and put on armchair psychologist David but like some sort of Prince syndrome might be in effect here by his like Harvard Highly Educated Elite parents treating him like a prince and telling him and this is a quote from the article Sam Baker's freed self-image in other words is both of a gifted and good person we are watching that clash with the reality of his behavior that of a conniving stimulant addicted screw-up and they also talk about the disposition of his parents we saw signs during the hearings in the in the Bahamas that his parents are struggling in similar ways to reconcile their idea of their son with the reality of his actions Barbara freed Sam's mother was seen laughing at descriptions of her son as a criminal wow yeah that is delusional I don't know what to make of that again we'll have to see how this turns out but uh what's the probability that Sam goes to jail this year do you think that's a that's a slam back I would bet my I think it would be rational to bet my net worth yeah your network yeah it would not be rational because there's no upside David you don't have to do that what do you mean I guess well I bet it like if I'm right yeah it's a double or nothing yeah if I write my net worth doubles yes I don't know I wouldn't do that you wouldn't do that I definitely wouldn't do that I think that's a rational bet I think so well uh I would say I'm I'm 90 certain is how I'd phrase it then okay so will you put 90 no I'm not gonna put any money this is like betting on Ripple or doing something like this like uh I don't do that either down or up I don't bet against it um who knows what could happen the world is a very strange Place uh let's talk about the winklevosses versus Barry silbert talking about a strange place that we're in they uh put out an open letter on Twitter this week what does this say from Cameron Winklevoss yeah it's basically a a damnation of Barry Silber in digital currency group and how uh it is up to Barry to make things right again that Barry has the power to make things right again and he's not doing that and so I'll read one specific paragraph uh the idea in your head that you can quietly hide in your ivory Tower and that this was all just will just magically go away or that this is someone else's problem it's pure fantasy to be clear this mess is entirely of your own making this is Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss two Barry Silver digital currency group of which you are the founder and CEO owes Genesis 1.67 billion dollars that is the money that Genesis owns to Gemini earned customers and other creditors you took this money the money of school teachers to fuel Rudy yeah right to fuel grooty greedy share BuyBacks illiquid Venture investments in Kamikaze grayscale net asset value trades that balloon the fee generating AUM of your trust all at the expense of creditors and all for your own personal gain it's now time for you to take the responsibility and for do to do the right thing wow pretty pretty damning and that actually kind of paints a picture that is pretty similar to what was going on with FTX right like taking in customer deposits doing a liquid Venture Capital bets and and like share BuyBacks and all that's kind of what that's uh SBF did uh perhaps in a much more above board fashion but this is what the Gemini twins are charging very silbert with Barry silbert who's been very quiet on Twitter lately uh woke up from from his hibernation if you will and responded and said dcg did not borrow 1.67 billion dollars from Genesis dcg has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all of its loans outstanding dcg delivered to Genesis and your advisors a proposal on December 9th and has not received any response and then Cameron winklevost responds on Twitter there you go again stop trying to pretend that you and dcg are innocent bystanders and have nothing to do with creating this mess is completely disingenuous uh and basically the fight that's basically the fight yeah sparring back and forth right and this is this is Cameron Winklevoss really turning up the heat on Berry and making this public and disparaging him quite openly so I don't know what this is negotiation tactic they're obviously talking behind closed doors as well at least their legal arms are but this still doesn't look like it's close to getting resolved um and I do feel for everyone who has money in earn accounts right it's um you know I I don't know that we're any closer to uh to seeing those those deposits you know freed up uh with this ongoing dispute it's uh crazy to me that all this takes place publicly too over Twitter like what a what a weird time we're living in at least we get to talk about it in the last update on the dcg Genesis case that we have actually happened right before we started recording so we are still waiting for further details but a tweet out that seems to be corroborated and accepted uh update dcg Genesis is under active investigation by the SEC sources confirm that there are multiple whistleblowers that have come forward so this is just breaking as we are recording this we're probably going to hear about this in further detail perhaps Friday and throughout all of next week and I guess we'll have to recover that on the next weekly roll up this is still some mess a carryover from last year spilling into 2023 so hopefully this gets taken care of soon um David there's some bad news though for Celsius depositors why don't you break it to us yes so in the Celsius Bankruptcy Court proceedings it has been ruled that if you are a customer who deposited money into Celsius that is not your money and it belongs to Celsius at the moment of deposit and so you are a creditor not a customer and so that you have to as a former customer of Celsius line up in bank so in bankruptcy court just like everyone else your last in line behind other creditors as well unfortunately right yeah exactly so this is another Stark reminder that not your keys not your crypto if you have to read the fine print in order to understand if you are an owner of your own deposits or not you should probably consider yourself not the owner of your deposits this is from Martin Glenn who is the uh bankruptcy judge here he said as explained below the court concludes based on celsius's unambiguous terms of service did you read those and subject to any reserve Reserve defenses that when cryptocurrency assets were deposited in earned accounts the cryptocurrency assets became celsius's property David once people hit that deposit button it was no longer their money according to terms of service yes according to the terms of service they gave it to Alex they entrusted Alex machinski with it and of course he was off gambling with it in all sorts of uh ways and so how brutal is that and remember of course Alex is a warning to us all on his t-shirts if we could put that image up a Luke on the screen uh banks are not your friend thank you Alex for letting us know sorry brother um well what is the uh Attorney General of New York hearing about it yeah this also came out just a few hours ago so New York attorney general a tweets out I'm suing the former CEO of cryptocurrency platform Celsius Network for defrauding investors out of billions of dollars Alex machinski lied to people about the risk of investing in Celsius hit it from deteriorating Financial condition and failed to register in New York so the nyag going after Alex machinski which I definitely think is like probably the villains yeah please prosecute him I'm worried about uh overreach and overflow into the crypto world so it's like hey uh let's regulate crypto as a result of this like just nice let's play some places on the table we should regulate and and criminalize fraudsters who do bad things and if they happen to use crypto to do that that is an adjacent fact not it's not crypto that is about this I would like to place that on the table yeah look I agree I'm glad that um Attorney General James is taking this action it's fantastic but I do get worried when um the last line of her her tweet is uh we will continue to protect people from the risks of investing in cryptocurrency Brian the risks of investing in cryptocurrency or why I'm here yes and you also can't like protect people from them without like uh how do you do that yeah so I'm just worried about that last line um what it should say ideally is continue to protect people from the risks of centralized Banks Banks providing cryptocurrency Services trust where we need protection yes in that in that area where we don't have public information that area where we give up our private Keys we need protection there if there's small print we need protection if there's a terms of service we need some help um yeah all right exactly right so what do we got coming up next David I think we're getting into prediction Zone huh yeah this is gonna be super fun we're going to talk about our predictions for 2023 we're going to talk about other people's predictions for 2023 and of course the rest of the news as well a Bitcoin core dev has all of their Bitcoins stolen in a self-custodial fumble I'll have to talk about that as well as the rest of the news some Cuba news some nft news as zombie punk got stolen and a bunch of other cool stuff so all of this and more right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go

got the first one from Eric Wall he's got a bunch of them here number one binance and tether survives I agree uh that's they've already survived all these years they're gonna survive again yo what's up I also agree yeah uh number I agree with that number two is Sam bankman freed goes to prison for 10 plus years I yes we already said I agree with that that's my net worth yeah um he's really good for that one what's number three I'm now susceptible to a huge Flight Risk from Sam bakeman freed uh number three Bitcoins fifteen point four thousand dollars was the bottom agree you agree wow you guys call in a bottom yes come on Ryan I'm not gonna agree with you oh you won I could use that dirty all right Ryan's out for that one number four I'm not gonna bet my net worth David number four Noster interest Fizzles out Elon resigns what's Noster I don't know what no sir I don't know okay skip that one resigns though do you think that will happen it resigns from what Twitter I guess so yeah wait he was unclear so he's got three shots at it I don't know what's going on how many companies in Elon okay uh ethereum enables withdrawals that's a big big what's happening big yes big yes you're right Eric go six you should like the ones that you agree with number six the most interesting thing in crypto continues to be AI llm's GPT and stable diffusion so Eric's saying that crypto's gonna be super boring and we're all gonna be talking about AI stuff throughout 2023. I don't know actually man AI is pretty interesting we're going to be talking about a crypto it's not going to be the most interesting thing in crypto come on that would be a super boring year I totally I'm not I'm not a slam dunk no on that one uh or yes on that one uh okay moving on I will bet my net worth so on an eight dollar was the bottom agree I disagree I don't think so I don't agree so much as ether of Bitcoin on that one but yes I do agree I think BTC touches is .09 yeah I agree I definitely agree yeah by the way the flipping where are we right now uh 0.072 uh .09 I think would be a good call it would be a high it's good it's a good call I I'm going with a yes on that mount gox coins are finally redistributed I have no idea on that one uh how about this one nft slump stops returns 1 billion monthly uh yes so he is calling the bottom on nft volume I don't have a strong opinion on that one it's gonna be a good year for nfts but not a crazy year in my opinion Bitcoin pumps above 30 000 uh I think odds are that volatility will take it above thirty thousand dollars and then it could return to below twenty thousand dollars agreed in the same year and so I agree with that one uh that's the thing is I don't think we've hit lows yet but I also think we'll we'll be over 30k at some point at some point yeah 12 months is a long time uh ethereum eighty percent of fat compliance was the top agree big agree o-fat compliant blocks are down only from here on out uh the SEC brings a case against hex drops below a cent uh what do you think at least one of those two things will happen yes okay I'll go with one of those two things do you know do you know what the price of hex is right now Ryan I I bet you don't even know it's not a thing that's burnt in my memory at all yes I care about 1.7 cents less I checked oh it's at 1.9 cents right now 1.9 cents I mean so he wants a 50 drop in HEX there could be SEC brings a case and hex explodes to ten dollars who knows uh Trump nft for revisits all-time high this is not something I have an opinion on David opinion on that one uh Celestia launches above 1 billion fully diluted valuation if Celestia does launch it will certainly be above a 1 billion fully diluted valuation how about this one uh 16 Taproot adoption doubles and hits three percent okay I'm not sure if this is a real prediction this is actually Eric Wall just being mean about of Taproot and bitcoiners he's just saying that adoption doubles and that means it's going to hit three percent oh he's just being mean uh no new Bitcoin soft Fork agree yeah that's probably a pretty easy one look at this one's hard though uh 18 cardano finally drops out of the top ten I'm not sure I could say that uh honestly also not it's at number nine right now Ryan but and with it's got polygon on its heels at number 10. um but the next biggest thing that I believe in that follows after that is Lido and it's that's at number 12 and so the Lido market cap right now is six billion uh I I think this is this is hard to Define because of course it's going to fall out of the top 10 at least once next year easy slam dunk but does he mean for a sustained period of time you know what I mean like our fall permanently I think he's implying uh it stays out of the top ten that's what I think he's implying yeah I I'm not get I don't think that's gonna happen yeah it's not cardano's got nine billion dollar uh for uh evaluation somebody'd have to replace cardano right now and who has it's like right now a lot of these top 10 are trading on meme who has the mean power to replace it yeah we would need another stable coin to make its way to the top ten as that could happen a stable coin die could pump to could knock cardano out anyways die that'd be big uh risk zero changes the game for DK roll up stable smart kind of know what that is zero I versero it's a evm parallelization I think startup um Ashley shop was explaining it to be an ECC it was supposed to be something Eric invested in yeah I'm sorry not ethereum layer 2 tvl reaches above 10 billion dollars I want to say yes to that definitely I want to say yes to that no I'm a hell yes seven right now no it's we're at four we're at four right now four okay well we've been here before we've been close to seven that's why I remember that I think I think it can hit 10 billion yeah like lightning Network public Channel capacity stays below 10K so he's bearish on Lightning yes he's always been uh yes oh wow coming in at 22. Larry and Frank leave the block and start their own competitor wow that is a hot hot prediction at this point this has to just be meme predictions huh I mean I think they could I think they could they seem to really care about their jobs and care about the block but there was that drama at the end of the year um this turns out to be decent called uh both Lido and coin will 10x at least yeah so that that's his uh and he agrees with uh this is also detran Spartan's bags is Lido and coinbase what's this number 24 David I think we are man we're really getting into the bottom of the bail prediction scenario Kobe tweets comments JFC more than eight times with 1 000 likes each probably um suzu and Kyle Davis Davey's miraculously could become influential Bitcoin Maximus I could totally see honestly yeah uh vitalik graduates from crypto after ethereum's migration to proof of sake vitalik will feel like he owes both it to ethereum and himself to step back slightly probably by taking up a few non-crypted responsibilities like AI or charity and you know I don't know if it's 2023 that vitalik does something like this but I can totally see like yeah I could totally see this yeah yeah not quite yet in my opinion but I think this last part is taking up a few non-crypton responsibilities I could totally see that like graduating from crypto is too strong yeah I don't think I don't think so uh re authification re-hypothecation of each stake becomes cool it's called restaking and liquid staking you'll see a lot more of this yeah of course yeah yeah that will happen yeah regrets doesn't get any new texts yes he doesn't have 28 tattoos or at least he doesn't tweet about it 29 doe con Quan is caught I don't know he's in Serbia he's like in the place that you can't catch him in uh if you can catch anybody anywhere don't you think is he who's coming after him I don't know if anyone can you think no he's not going to get caught I'm saying that's red notice in oh that's right all I'm saying is I'm not betting my net worth on it all right uh last one a bit late but Luke Dash Jr loses his Bitcoin yeah this is how you're talking about that later yeah yeah uh all right well what are the bankless predictions David I think we're uh maybe less spicy with some of those but first before we get to the 2022 predictions we should get to our 20 our 2023 predictions we should get to last year's predictions and uh give a report card here how'd we do in our layout predictions for last year uh so Ryan you and I this time last year were bullish and it was also the top uh okay and so it sounds like you're justifying something uh I'm just saying we were bullish when we when it was the top and so all of our bullish predictions are so crypto cross's new all-time highs that did not happen uh that this these are our layout predictions and so these were the ones that we all kind of felt were true as a company we all kind of came together it's like all right what are the easy ones uh so we didn't do so great um cryptocross's new all-time highs did not get that one Heath two merge happens that totally happened total crypto market cap reaches 5 trillion dollars uh we only hit three trillion so we did not get that one uh Bitcoin gets adopted by another nation state we got that one but I will say just barely um car what's car uh this is um the it's a country in Africa so this is uh Central African Republic okay adopted it ethereum becomes a trillion dollar network uh we didn't get there we only got to about 0.56 half a trilly half a trillion yeah Layer Two reaches 25 billion dollars in total locked value we only got to seven oof uh nft sales hit 30 billion dollars uh which totally happened uh it hit 30 billion dollars by April uh one D5 protocol will reach the top 10 in market cap we are almost there but it did not happen um wait with what like yeah oh okay mine is fair fair that did almost happened yeah uh and Dallas will make an eight-figure purchase for an in real life item I don't really think that happened um no it didn't happen but we're giving ourselves uh again we're creating this report card David so we can be nice to ourselves so we're giving ourselves partial credit for this because Ukraine Dao legitimately bought um obviously tons of military guaran was almost eight figures it was something like eight million dollars right but the item that was bought was a was a nft of a yeah partial credit all right partial credit here yeah and then the last one of course Michael Taylor buys more Bitcoin that was just a free space he totally did oh it's very easy all right my predictions this is I did worse than that this is okay now we're getting into Ryan's specific predictions yeah so here's Ryan's predictions also I I said crypto would be above 7 trillion and it only reached 3 trillion size overly bullish I said eth would get to 10K and by the way that's what all of this was based on the bull market yeah yeah and uh so look I mean the basis was I thought we would do another 10x from last all-time high which was in the you know thousand Zone we didn't we only hit 4.5 okay doesn't mean 10x isn't happening it means it didn't happen in 2022. and probably won't in 2023. uh layer twos enter the top ten I think that's a yes if you count polygon which I do Bridges to billions so across and hop issue tokens Bridges I was more bullish on Bridges going into 2022 and crosstalk bridges specifically yeah exactly um Bitcoin to 100K uh it only hit 63k this should actually be an X I don't know that's a check uh web3 gets Social we had some launches far Caster lens diesel it's still too early for web 3D really 16 we're punching on that one David I said D5 would return it definitely did not return okay and yet David it did serve us when C5 failed and that's a big plus um I thought there'd be some crypto banks that would IPO nope we almost got that one with circle and then the SEC said no uh so there you go blocked by the SEC Dows get weirder I'll count Ukraine as kind of a weird Dow that you know fighting a war raised like for a doubt that's kind of interesting uh nfts ad extensions that what I meant is that they would expand to other media properties board apiat Club definitely did that I thought game five would build a niche it didn't way too early overall my grade is a c minus and I think this is because I expected uh the bull cycle to have about 50 more upside than it did but by April the Fed was tightening and then after April just everything Unwound as the tide uh was coming out and uh apparently no one had shorts on in crypto so um you didn't expect everyone to be completely immature and irresponsible well I didn't and I think like some of these predictions just don't take into account macro right because we kind of ignore it because like who knows what's gonna happen with macro so that's what messed me up this year I'm being more cautious David sure I think we're gonna I think there's going to be a lot of ups and downs in crypto but we're going to finish above 2 trillion that is more than a 2X brother yep I think that's ahead uh but there'll be ups and downs eth withdrawals will be enabled that's probably an easy one but I also am hopeful for proto-dink sharding in 2023 now that's a that's gonna be hard to hit if it happens it'll be down to the wire um I think eth will Spike down to three digits sorry David uh if it does that will give us one last final generational buying opportunity because I don't think we're going back to three digits again it's not happening I can't tell you for sure if that's gonna happen but I think it is and I'll err on that side um ethereum outperforms Bitcoin but we don't get a flipping next year a crypto law almost gets through Congress it won't be the end of the world it'll just be something watered down I am super bullish on Layer Two still David this is probably the biggest call um the biggest reach here I think layer two's reached 25 billion Eric Wall calls for 10 billion I'm saying 25 billion in tvl whoa all right bro so that's that's bullish I just carried over I copied and pasted from last year right it's gonna happen and if it doesn't happen next year I'll just copy and paste it'll happen in 2024. uh defy rebuilds back to tvl of 125 billion million we'd have a ways to go there I think that's like a 5x or four or five x or something like that um so those are some of my predictions what do you got do your report card first all right all right here's my report card uh I led with the bear Market never comes I don't think there's a phrase I could have phrased that by and not been more wrong so that was wrong so you were a super cyclist I I mean dude we had just broken off into all-time highs we had just hit all-time highs and like the momentum was continuing like I had the East to 10K mindset just like everyone else uh I was I was dishing out that Kool-Aid but you said it this way which is different the bear Market Never Comes The Bear Market definitely comes uh I my next uh comment was crypto newbies care less about centralization worries and I'm claiming Victory on that one because what did we learn uh Celsius FTX like exchanges blah blah blah blah but I'm also betting on the complete opposite for 2023. uh so I'm gonna take the victory on that one um the merch happens and I got that one right eth competitors try to fix their monetary Supply schedules I have not seen any lick of that whatsoever all of these it's still not it's still not yeah I'm claiming all of these each competitors still have currently their heads buried in the sand about their oversupply of block space and therefore over supply of token issuance schedules solid fee markets arise on an eth competing chain that did happen for a moment on Avalanche and then it went back to zero uh my next my next uh prediction was optimism and arbitrum develop into thriving metropolises and I'm I think that happened definitely yeah big time uh and I also thought that evm equivalents will push optimism into dominance didn't happen in 2022 but I'm Still Holding Out for this one I think evm equivalence is the long game and optimism has been pioneering that nft flipping you loses steam definitely did and yeah definitely did retail around ran out of money so it became less profitable for everyone uh I might I made a claim that rye receives adoption tail wins this was during inflation big inflation moments so I said as a result of inflation Rye will receive adoption Tailwinds I will will say that rye certainly received mind share adoption but that did not translate into no not at all no unfortunate because it's a really cool project yeah board Apes flips punks I I predicted that and I also linked a link to a video because why did board Apes Flip Flip punks because security like properties did I just trigger a bunch of board Apes then go watch the video that's linked in uh the the release that we're talking about right now uh web3 will become adopted as a household name that kind of happened but not really in a way that I wanted it to yeah it's definitely a household name and then the last three predictions I made the bankless meme picks up speed that happened because of FTX so thanks for that uh politicians rise to defend web 3 protocols uh Tom emmer and Pat Toomey shout out to you guys for helping me be right on that one and then bankless keeps delivering uh this was when I was in control over uh and so yeah that's a free space yeah um and we got a lot of things coming out more so I was given a grade by our newsletter editor a b that's good David some good predictions there so what do you have in mind for this year what's your 2023 predictions my my first and foremost prediction centers around ethereum scaling factor and this is this metric that is being pioneered by layer 2 beat Uh ethereum's current scaling factor is 2.4 as in all of layer twos are doing 2.4 times the amount of transactions of the ethereum layer one I think we are going to see that number increase to five so there will be five times the number of transactions on ethereum layer twos as the ethereum layer one I think that's safe that's fine I definitely think that's happening at least one generalized ZK evm will open up its playground for users so that is this is ZK sync this is scroll but I do think this dark net ecosystem will maintain its lead ahead of the rest of the zke VMS collectible nft communities will increasingly look like balaji's Network stake thesis and the only ones that are going to make it through the spare Market Will Survive by injecting utility into their assets that's my hot take there ethereum D5 Blue Chips will outperform outlayer 1 tokens and layer 2 tokens by the way for that matter because ethereum D5 has already been in a bear Market ahead one year ahead of it wow that's maybe your boldest prediction yet because we've had two back-to-back 80 down years well maybe we have an 80 down here in Blue Chips and D5 actually has an up here in that Dows still will not have their [ __ ] together figured out probably most dollars will continue to operate at a loss in a this is fine well the room is burning manner one or a few dowels will attempt to focus on their p l and that will eventually come to be reflected in their token price whether that happens by the end of 2023 hard to say I always like to say run on Bank list there's always a bull market somewhere and I think this one will be signed in with ethereum this will be a current recurring topic throughout 2023 as we see more websites how do we measure that though there's not really like a token you just think number of instances of logins with private Keys logins instances with private keys uh and then the last three here Bitcoin Maxes will continue to become more and more insane and disconnected from reality Corey clipston specifically will spearhead this effort nice job uh dual encroachment from the cftc and the SEC will push crypto into its only safe place the intangible land of decentralization uh AKA they're coming for us and the only way out is through decentralization and then lastly Richard Hart will still be here he'll find a new scam to promote after pulse chain wears off and also Ryan did you know that his last name was Schuler I have no that is real last name Google okay yeah it doesn't have the same ring as heart no heart's a great last name if you're trying to pump a Ponzi scheme so um that's good David we'll see how that plays out then man so those are the 2023 predictions for you uh you know Bank let's get some of these things right directionally I think we are right when we call for specifics not so much not so great but directionally and eventually some of these predictions will happen the longer we're here we're here the more right we are that's right optimism this week a bunch of people are forking it what does this mean yeah so this is a tweet from a from an optimism uh person another day another startup planning to Fork optimism the op stack narrative is very strong from my startup data sample it's becoming the go-to repo for startups to deploy their own rollup uh and so this is actually a continuation of the thesis that I said that evm equivalence will help uh optimism with its slower start uh and for those I made this video called the op stack which explains the op stack and the philosophy behind this prediction it came out the day that FTX went under so there's this like super awesome video that is super informative that got drowned out by the FTX uh debacle so if you want to go down the op stack Rabbit Hole definitely watch this video uh we got some nft stuff too so um a zombie punk was just sold for what looks like to me anyway uh a lot of money but maybe this is down from what it was worth at some point in time 1.3 million dollars for this Punk you're looking at it right here what's the significance of the sale David it's just one of the biggest nft sales in a very long time I accidentally said when we led into sponsors that in a zombie punk got stolen uh no I saw me punk got stole sold but it was a steal coming in at a 1155 each price tag we got a zombie punk and so that in my mind is very cheap that is a good purchase and are they up on their eth from that uh sale the uh the the seller the owner I clicked that link and we'll be able to find out what it was last spot for yeah so if you scroll down to uh previous sales oh it was okay it was last sold Ryan for 500 eth in May of 2021 so that was uh they are up 660 eth on that trade that's the way to be up uh denominated knee if you denominate an eighth during the bear Market that's the only way to do it um this was an article I noticed I don't know if you saw this but from PC Gamer got a lot of traction on Reddit and the title of the article is good job internet you bullied nfts out of mainstream games and I saw so many threads on Reddit this week about yeah I'm glad they're gone hate nfts glad like they're the worst they're kind of a Scourge on gaming uh and I was just reflecting on how just negative the world has turned on nfts particularly nfts in games this was a meme I also picked out from uh from Reddit which was uh whose opinion matters the least and it picks on all of these tribes furries weebs influencers Discord mobs and then crypto Bros too and nft artists us and look who's in the crypto bro picture it's metallic wow wow vitalik is the least crypto bro person like I know I guess if that's what you think a crypto bro actually is um anyway I was just reflecting on this yeah Ryan I'm gonna go ahead and guess that any representative in any one of these quadrants are probably saying the same thing about their particular quadrates that's probably true right we just don't know and I was just reflecting on I remember the early stages of the internet and there was this new idea this is like kind of the birth of Wikipedia and um you know reviews Amazon reviews and Yelp and all of these things web 2 is like wisdom of the crowds remember that phrase wisdom of the crowds well like internet mobs are kind of dumb yeah like stupidity of the crowds yeah uh and so I don't know this is just another example of the internet I think not getting it and not seeing the potential of these things and people making comments on things they actually don't know about and um yeah I uh I think the internet is completely wrong about nfts it's just like being mad about a file format like jpegs or or gifs maybe you don't like how they've been used but how can you be mad about nfts as a property rights mechanism uh I I think it's actually pretty easy to push back on that one because the nfts in their current form are not doing the things Ryan that you imagined that they will do in their heads in the future and so the internet is currently pushing back on nnts as they stand today because we as an industry have not learned how to actually produce an nft that is actually desirable towards mainstream so you are basically your take is well we haven't actually deserve their respect exactly would you also say that about drawing boards the crypto bro um you know escape to because that's that's also being scapegoated right now the crypto a bunch of scammers that sort of thing right do you think that crypto deserves this too this kind of mockery or do you think it's like a broad brush to talk about like who this meme at a high level whose opinion matters least like nft artists Andrew Tate fans crypto Bros weebs Discord mods influencers these are all like communities of people that have members of them that believe in what they're saying and doing right For Better or Worse right and like it's it's like you could also put in like a crossfit person here or like a vegan or you know somebody who like has principles that they stand on and like are annoying on the internet about it and so this is just an amalgamation of like all of those people that's a good take that's a good take anyway uh yeah it's the the internet still doesn't like nfts maybe we deserve it maybe we don't but I think uh this warrants further investigations probably some upside opportunities while everyone else is ignoring it David what's the story about the Bitcoin core developer losing all his Bitcoin yeah so there's Bitcoin OG core developer Luke Dash Jr who tweeted out that he'd lost over to his Bitcoins over 200 Bitcoins in a hack uh he had a pgp pretty good privacy if you uh have been uh listening to our before Bitcoin series you would know what that is uh he says his pgp was compromised and he had all of his Bitcoins stolen uh he says he has no idea how uh and uh there's two kind of main takes that I've seen as a response to this it's what the hell is a Bitcoin core Dev holding on pgp Keys onto a hot computer that is exposed to the internet bad opsec and then the other take is like nice boating accident bro um no one really knows there's also another take which is like if a Bitcoin core developer can lose their private Keys what hope is there for normies what do you think about that take um I mean I've definitely at times held private keys in insecure ways but I've always logged that in my head and then like okay I need to get rid of those private Keys uh I don't know it's it's a personal responsibility thing more than it is like if this one guy can't do it none of us can and then also the solution to that is always Innovation Innovation Innovation uh Bitcoin doesn't have account infection so no I'm super bullish on the future smart contract wallets to make ux easy yeah I think we'll build them um what about this David open seat blocking Cuban artists from the platform due to U.S sanctions what do you make of this yeah that's I mean the headline's basically the news openc had to de-platform some Cuban artists because of sanctions uh it's a sad day a lot of people are mad at openc for this but at the end of the day like they want customers they want every customer Under the Sun why can't they do this because of Regulation this is the design choice that openc has chosen like a web 2.5 thing which centralized front end in the front and just uses it ethereum rails in the back and so this is a result of that so sad day yeah it's unfortunate but as long as these sorts of prohibitions don't happen on the protocol layer that's where they matter most right so nfts can still be deployed if you're in Cuba or wherever you are in the world and uh you can access it just can't open access openc unfortunately all right for the first time in 2023 we're going to remind you that this is the year you should be getting a job in crypto or not David we're not stopping uh we've got some jobs I'm gonna read them on the bank of job boards as usual it's bankless.palot.com jobs uniswap Labs has a senior software engineer they're looking for Alchemy a back-end engineer wepase software engineer webassee also a QA analyst Dimension a crypto native content marketer and more you guys can find that at the bankless job site that's bangles.pellet.com jobs uh all right David what do we got coming up next we got to get to some questions from the nation we used to ask the Twitter we used to ask Twitter what questions do you have but we have changed that up and now we are asking the bank list in our Circle what questions do you want us to cover on the bank list weekly roll up and so we got three questions that we're pulling out out of the Inner Circle and this is a perk for the bankless premium subscribers if you are a premium subscriber and you are not in the bankless Inner Circle you should definitely go there we've been having a ton of fun there lately and this is where we are now asking the questions for the weekly roll up so this is a place where me and Ryan and the rest of the bank list team hang out this is where the token report that we talked about earlier from Ben Jovi gets talked about and discussed and you guys can ask all of us questions and more uh here's Ryan's got a little bit of the Inner Circle up on this yeah I'm sharing it on screen this is kind of like I think of this as like a watering hole for the bankless community like it's um you know how you always say David like it's the bear market so go find a bear Market buddy yeah this is where you guys find a bear Market buddy all right David I met on Twitter and then that just quickly transitioned into Discord Discord is a fantastic tool for meeting friends in crypto especially when if you don't go outside like me or you don't go to conferences or you can't get out there you want to meet some people before you go to the conference this is the place to do that so there are something like 15 000 close to 20 000 people on the bankless journey in the Inner Circle Discord and look at these channels we talk about General stuff nfts we talk about the podcast we talk about token ratings there's off topic areas David you and I jumped in uh and did an AMA in here not too long ago we've done a few of those as well so there's a section in the Inner Circle Discord uh with a question we're gonna answer in just a minute from uh hashara is there a layer two that is IBC compatible this is Cosmos standard IBC or would it be possible to build one such an L2 would remove the need for multi-sig Bridges between different ecosystems and would greatly benefit the entire crypto Universe we ask our ask questions like this we answer questions like that in the Inner Circle so it's a great place to uh to meet the bankless community and level up on the crypto journey and Dave David how do people become Inner Circle members and Go premium sure there is a link in the show notes for you to go click that click that button and it'll take you to where you can sign up for bankless premium and then you can ask some of these questions here we're also in the middle of planning our eth Denver in real life event for the bankless Inner Circle it's going to be our first one uh we're super soaked for that uh shall we get into the questions Ryan yeah so why don't we start with that first question that was just asked so is there a layer two that is IBC compatible and would it be possible to build one what's the answer to that question David yeah sadly this is where the lines are drawn between what Ryan and I call different countries IBC is the rules of the cosmos ecosystem the evm are the rules for the ethereum ecosystem and sadly you cannot cross those lines without having to change languages and what that means is that we cannot cross lines with our assets either without having to have a trusted intermediary in the process facilitate that service so there is no way to build an IBC the layer 2 because if you are building a layer 2 on ethereum you are specifically creating a very formalized relationship with the ethereum layer one and you cannot have two layer ones that you consider equal you have to pick a single layer one to adhere to the rules towards so if you are building a layer two on ethereum you cannot build an IBC compatible a cosmos compatible app chain as your ethereum layer 2 it just doesn't work like that I'm sad to say is it possible that it will in the future I mean is there a research about this think that's possible I do not think that that is a possible thing to do so this is this kind of goes back to why you and I are like kind of like maximalist in the sense of there's going to be a very low number of ecosystems because all of these cross layer one like uh communication bridges are just fundamentally insecure and so it makes sense force from a security perspective for there to be a fewer number of chains that all adhere to the same rules and that's why Cosmos actually fits inside of a lot of the bankless philosophy that we've been talking about and why the multi-multi-multilayer one thesis just does not work yeah what's what's interesting about Cosmos if you want like we did an episode with uh Zaki um about uh and and sunny from Cosmos about this very thing and they talk about this idea of mesh security which is sort of interesting where a set of app chains can kind of share the same Security in some way that starts to simulate a little bit what ethereum is doing of course ethereum is just saying with its layer 2 ecosystem hey everything is secured by and settles on uh layer one so you don't have to worry about that problem of um you know diluting your security when you transition from one chain to the other with IBC this question is from PD in the Inner Circle on the return of the bowl eth becomes significantly deflationary and at the time a significant amount of eth is staked scarcity could be an issue well good for Price could it be damaging for the system is there a mechanism in 1559 to control the level of deflation and so this is the concern that the ultrasound economics of ether are so good and so strong that ether becomes so scarce that its price is so high that we just don't want to use it inside of defy we don't want to turn into act with gas we don't want we it's just overly deflationary and this is actually a question that I asked Justin Drake directly and so if you want to hear this answer from Justin Drake there is an interview I did with him on YouTube about this very thing at Devcon basically his and first and foremost there is a limit as to how much ether we can burn as ether goes up in price you burn less and so it doesn't just burn straight to zero Supply the more you burn the harder it becomes to burn more so the lower supply of ether there is the more resistance there is to further burn and so this is why people like Justin Drake thinks that we kind of asymptote somewhere between like 60 and 90 million supply of ether and so there will always be enough ether to go around and then the other thing is like uh Justin Drake and his answer uh delineates between what he calls collateral money and debt money and collateral money is like ether bear assets bear instruments and you want collateral money to always go up in price and then you want debt money like dollars to always go down in price that's kind of how our economy works out because then no one ever gets liquidated if their collateral goes up and their denominated value goes down and so this is actually the foundations of a very robust economy uh and there aren't the the concerns that like there's just not enough ether to go around doesn't really like actually play out in in economic terms yeah another way to turn that is you know collateral money is like store a value money right and debt money is more what you want for a medium of exchange we don't actually think that uh ether is going to make a good medium of exchange right right something like a stable coin is a much better medium of exchange something like die for instance or even Rye can be a much better medium exchange than uh ether but as ether accrues value and gets more valuable then it becomes a better collateral money there's more economic bandwidth we haven't talked about that Concept in a while but that applies here too uh all right last question for you David this is from uh cell no rocos narokos yeah cell naroko's ass he's thinking about or they're thinking about eth Denver for the first time this year what's the best way to make the most of it and this is from a non-technical person so going to the east Denver that is a conference in February of course in the ethereum community but really welcomes all ecosystems if you're non-technical what's the way to make the most out of that type of an experience there's a bunch of different answers that I've got for for yourself no rocos uh and since you're in the Inner Circle Discord I hope to see you at the Meetup that we're going to host so the bank list HQ Meetup where you'll be able to meet other members generally people in the bankers Community are non-technical so that's a great place to start but also I'm also a huge advocate of non-technical people joining hackathons which seems to initially be like what that's weird that's the opposite of what I want to do let me tell you technical people need non-technical people to explain their [ __ ] and so if you can Market something or promote something or write a presentation and present things that technical devs aren't very good at presenting there is a always a supply gut for non-technical people joining hackathons to be like the marketers the promoters to actually do the pitch and that can really make or break a lot of hackathons hackathon projects so that's definitely a very strong way to get involved there as well and then overall Denver East Denver has developed into it more and more and more non-technical conference even though it is a hackathon first and foremost the first East Denver I did in 2018 I just went to every single Booth one by one by one and I was like hey what are you guys doing hey what are you guys doing people I'm just talking you just talk to people and then you meet other people who are listening to your questions because some people are just really shy and they have questions but they just don't and they're too shy to answer it to ask them so they'll listen to you ask questions for people at the booth and if you're asking good questions people will pick up on that uh and so like a com Booth is our conversation starters uh and so that's what I'd recommend if you are non-technical person going to eat Denver go to the Inner Circle Meetup uh sign up for the hackathon as a non-technical person and talk to people at the booths and talk to everyone it's calling it advice right come say hi to me all right takes of the week we got the first one uh what are we looking at from uh Taha zoffer taha's offer so this is a meme uh this is a very old meme uh and it's funny to see this resurface uh and it's basically a picture of two Legos one is ether one is Bitcoin and ether actually has the little Lego dimples that let other Legos like latch onto them and BTC is just completely smooth uh and so it's just a funny illustration I think this meme actually came from from the money Legos meme which I created way back when I don't know if I can Pat myself in the back on that one um but yeah so this is the money Legos meme except Bitcoins without the like you know the composability part why why remind people of this like this uh tweak had a lot of traction yeah I don't I don't think people have seen this meme in a very long time yeah so they're like oh this is new what a great way to articulate it right now this is an old name yeah this is interesting from domothe so um he says this this is about the ossification in particular of ethereum I think the question is about when is ethereum going to ossify so when are all of the changes going to be in you know the roadmap fully complete and the code is not touched anymore domothy says ossification is a Bitcoin meme in my opinion the ethereum equivalent should be homeostasis the chain self-regulates to keep it its core properties intact forever through crypto uh graphic means first then crypto economic means then through the social layer as a last resort really interesting really good take I think ossification is out homeostasis should be the goal what's your take on this I just thought that this was a really elegant way of differentiating the end game of Bitcoin and ethereum Bitcoin loves to talk about how ossified it is and from the ethereum perspective we consider that like fragile and also they did it too soon the homeostasis balance of ethereum whenever I hear a biology word in in crypto economics Ryan you know I get super excited uh homeostasis just means imbalance and self-regulating and if something is deviated from a particular set point then it naturally and organically returns to a homeostatic balance uh that I and I I just really really like that and then also the the order of operations of first fix things with cryptography and if that doesn't work then do it with cryptoeconomics and if that doesn't work then you have to go to the social layer in order to fix something that breaks well a perfect example of this uh to me is like let's say quantum computers come out and both Bitcoin and ethereum need to be Quantum resistant if you're ossified and the code doesn't change how do you become Quantum resistant right well you really can't you have to break the ossification principle right but if you're going for a homeostasis then you acknowledge that the principle about both Bitcoin and ethereum is for it to be secure and obviously that means Quantum resistant and so you upgrade the protocol as necessary to adapt to that new reality now nothing fundamentally has changed about the core values of the system you're just updating the cryptography yep right but you can't say it's ossified if you're still making code changes and of course we're going to need to be making code changes for both Bitcoin and ethereum moving forward and I think ethereum acknowledges that I really like this mental model homeostasis I'm going to start using that thank you donothy 100 uh here's another take David you you say this one yeah so this is a take from Ryan Sean Adams let's be clear on one thing David and I are not journalists we just like talking about crypto stuff Ryan when you tweeted out this meme uh this tweet uh I definitely saw this same tweet that you did right before that cause oh really yeah that inspired you to write this what was it it was it was the person who was in our Twitter was like why doesn't Ryan and David talk about polka dot like at some point it's like it just doesn't interest me journalism it's bad journalism you guys aren't doing your jobs like yes who does who defines what my job is uh no one does uh and we just Ryan and I just talk about stuff that we like and that's like as people like sometimes read into like there's this Grand conspiracy is like we're not covering chain link and we're not covering polka dot and we're not covering my favorite ecosystem and that and like why what's the conspiracy here it could be because we just haven't gotten there guys because we're busy yeah we're super busy it could also be just like we're not interested in the moment right but it could also be like this this idea I think of a journalist as something different it's a it's almost like in a way David a true journalist is doing something even like more sacred than you and I are doing right like what I would say is what are we we're just like investors on the crypto journey in the bank list Journey like we care deeply about these values we're going to talk about them we're excited by the technology by what's going on we're excited about the social movement what a journalist does is something different they need to be getting at kind of like the ultimate facts and truth of circumstances so like even in these Roll-Ups I mean we're doing our best when we when we report on things where we talk talk about things to uncover the truth but we're not doing like deep journalistic investigation right on the things just giving our takes we're giving our takes right and so um but that like I have a ton of respect for real journalists and I I would love to have more real journalists who are doing the Deep work in this space to uncover truth even if it's uncomfortable and talk about that truth it's just not what you and I are doing it's not what we've done uh I just tweeted this out just to kind of make that yes you'll make that clear and I hope that's clear to you bankless listeners you know we try our best on here we're pursuing what we think is interesting in 2023 um it would be a different standard uh if we started calling ourselves journalists and uh I never will I don't think you ever will either it's just not a thing that we are yeah that's that's the wrong mental model to consider what banklist is bankless is a thesis driven Media company we have biases and attitudes about about the way that we want the future to be and those those biases and attitudes and Theses all are enveloped under what we call the bankless movement absolutely well on that note David uh this is not uh journalism of course this is not the news but why don't you tell me what you're bullish on one of my Theses Ryan is uh the flipping uh and so I'm bullish on The Flipping one of your 2023 predictions was that the flipping is not going to happen this year I'm not necessarily going to predict that it is but I definitely think it's on the table more than what people think that it is um okay I think ether versus Bitcoin can go up way faster than what people expect because of proof that we are in proof of stake with uh with eip1559 like we are in a new paradigm of ether price action and so like the previous coupled relationship that we had with Bitcoin from proof of work I think is much more broken and so I tweeted out this tweet the lappening is going to be 10 times easier than the flipping what's the lappening date oh I'm so glad that's your private meme yeah yeah and so the flipping is when ether flips Bitcoin in market cap as in with ether as an ecosystem either market cap is worth more than Bitcoin the lappening is when ether is worth 2x what Bitcoin is and I'm saying what I'm saying here is that it's it's taken a ton of work to even come remotely close to the flipping we're like less than 50 of the way there although I do think we're closer than we actually that we perceive it to be what I'm saying is once we do flip Bitcoin we when we get to 2x Bitcoin which is the lapping the lapening is when we go 2x the market cap of Bitcoin that is going to be 10 times easier than getting to the flipping because once you hit Bitcoin it's so easy just to do it again and again well and again can I ask you why do you care about this for someone thinking like oh is this just David's bag bias he has much more Ethan he has Bitcoin I don't even know if he has any Bitcoins so of course he's talking about eth right does this matter Beyond like your bags David So this goes back kind of why we made Bank list in the first place is we had Theses and ideas about how crypto economics works and we didn't feel like the rest of the crypto world had heard these Theses and had no and no one was broadcasting them and the whole eth is money thesis is largely where Bank list started back in 2018 2019 when you and I were first getting to know each other like the whole like East is money thing was a very contrarian bet uh and so we came together over that shared like frustrations like why don't people understand ether like this protocol also defy also defy yeah and so like the ether is the best crypto asset of all time if not the best asset in the world ever it's one of our foundational Theses that has pioneered like our own thinking in this space and as a result of my belief on that I have purchased a bunch of ether because that aligns with my Theses and beliefs about how the future of crypto will be and so I my claim is that the crypto economics of ethereum is just 10 100 times more sound than Bitcoins and I expect that to show up in the price sooner or later especially after the merge and proof of stake and eip1559 so this is a bet based on a thesis yes uh how about this what are we looking at this tweet David right okay so this is on there's two charts here and we're looking at the first one this left one this left chart is how bullish if you believe in the flipping thesis this is roughly about how bullish you are The Ether flips the Bitcoin ratio or was it the Bitcoin ratio chart and I've drawn a green line at the end to indicate where I believe that we are going we are currently at .074 and I think we will people this is what people who believe in the flipping think that we're going to do is like oh we're going to flip in Bitcoin at like point one seven and that will take somewhere between one and three four more years to get that done and so that's what this chart shows this is why the typical flippinger believes here's here's what I believe Ryan which is what have you done here and so in the time range here no I've actually increased the time range and so this arrow goes all the way out to 2030 but where people think the flipping happens at point one five yo keep keep going guys because once ether flips Bitcoin there's no reason why it can't keep going after that it doesn't stop after flipping Bitcoin we flip Bitcoin a second time and a third time and a fourth time and it definitely takes time but by the way so when you put when you put the ratio the other way you could like and that this could play out is Bitcoin collapses sure sure it could go down versus ether for sure do you think that's a pot like that's a possibility because I don't think some people I don't think Bitcoin collapses I just think it has a capitalist stagnant yeah okay proof of work is a fundamentally a cap on growth because as your price of your proof of word token goes up so does the net average sell pressure and so the arrow at this point where it's pointing to Ryan is at 0.7 East to BTC so that is uh ether being worth 10 times more than it is right now in Bitcoin terms so that's five Bitcoins so I'm saying by 2030 ether is five Bitcoins you're creating content again about this too I watch this video it's like a 13 minute video on our other bank lists uh YouTube feed did you know we have a bank list there's tube feed two Bankers this is the bankless podcast that you're listening to but there's a bankless short video feed and this is the 13 minute video about each season uh got me bullish Dave that's my job for this video it's fantastic all right so David's bullish on eth and that's what I'm saying relative to uh Bitcoin huh that's exactly right what are you bullish on Ryan I'm just being a user again I get to be a user again this year um everyone was obsessed with speculation last year and I'm really excited about uh using some new Tools in crypto I feel like I have more time to do this I feel like the builders are continuing to build and it's the whole narrative is less about speculation it's more about try new things this is crypto it feels very much like uh 2019 to me 2020 to me where we're just like trying a whole bunch of things so some cool things that I tried recently is I mentioned the Kepler our wallet that is a wallet like metamask for exploring the cosmos ecosystem all the app chains I recommend that it's a really cool place to start also this day that I don't know if you've seen this browser extension it's called fire but you know that problem that you have where in metamask um you don't really know when you're clicking on buttons what is actually happening here yeah well fire is kind of another extension that explains exactly what's going on so look at this I am transferring this nft to this particular address it's explaining it in human terms what I'm actually doing a really useful extension that you can add on top of metamask to sort of explain the transaction before you click approve so it's an extension for an extension it's the extension for an extension and very useful one at that even recently I was going back through uniswap and now with uniswap there's a Fiat on-ramp on top of uniswap there's nfts you just trade nfts on uniswap just yeah most people don't realize you can trade you and nfcs on uniswap I almost haven't realized it because I've been so busy not actually getting to use these apps so anyway at just high level here um everything's great in terms of the tools that are available versus the last bear Market yeah uh and yet people are down in the dumps but I I think it's a great time to be a user so ignore price start using some more apps this is what we do during the the bear markets we level up on these sorts of things and as always there's rewards on the other side so I'm bullish about being a user again and having that opportunity um yeah I hope you get some time to do that too yeah uh try some things out this year David yeah I have to take a break from making content usually I just ask other people's experiences yeah exactly all right uh what do we got meme of the week this year meme of the week meme of the week okay so we have a picture of SPF in a nice suit and a backpack and uh I'm not gonna bother to try and sing this but you can hear it in the background making my way downtown scamming fast made Luna crash I'm homebound I don't know how the song goes but you can hear it right now and just like it's so perfect hearing this music looking at this picture is so great there we go guys your first roll-up of 2023 I hope you enjoyed I hope you enjoyed the meme of the week we're excited to bring 51 more to you in the coming year wrist and disclaimers as always gotta let you know that crypto is risky so is D5 so is if you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us once again for another year on the bank list Journey thanks a lot foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] to poop
