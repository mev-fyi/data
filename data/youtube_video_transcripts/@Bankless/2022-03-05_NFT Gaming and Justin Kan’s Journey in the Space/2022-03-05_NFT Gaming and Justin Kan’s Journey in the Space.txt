i'm curious like what was your aha moment for nft gaming i was a total skeptic at first you know like my history was like i was buying bitcoin in 2013 right before it crashed then it crashed i was like i'm an idiot i'm the bag holder when i saw ethereum start to rise i was like okay this is interesting as a programmer but like it seems deeply impractical to build any like real applications i don't get it it was only about a year ago things clicked for me and i was like oh you can actually make a high-through throughput application one of my friends was like hey we should do something in crypto i was like well the obvious thing to me that's gonna happen is gaming nfts because there's already this long-standing tradition of people spending tons of money you know tens of billions of dollars a year for in-game assets putting them on a blockchain is kind of like to me it seemed obvious it didn't doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that step out and we started working on fractal shortly thereafter in i guess it was like december
