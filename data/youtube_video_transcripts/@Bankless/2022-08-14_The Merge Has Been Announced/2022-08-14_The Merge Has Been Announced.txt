merged date has been decided it's coming in at a ttd number that's very very large but effectively puts us at the trajectory of september 15th to 16th okay so back us into that again so we have got this very large number which is the ttd and that stands for total terminal difficulty it's basically a number that we're going to approach as the miners do their thing once we hit a total terminal difficulty of that very large number which doesn't really make any sense it's basically approximately september 15th to 16th dude i can't believe so september 15th to 16th it's gonna happen we don't know what time of day we do know we will be on a live stream somewhere yeah watching this happening do you think anything could go wrong here i don't think so this is something that has been planned for so long i'm thinking the drama is relatively minimal here so a successful merged fifteenth through six calling the successful merge yeah
