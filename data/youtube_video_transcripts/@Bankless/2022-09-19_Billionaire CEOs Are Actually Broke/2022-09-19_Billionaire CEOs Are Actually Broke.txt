can you wake up every morning and do it on your own terms that is really a core of what makes most people happy the counter to this that is really fascinating to me are the ceos who might make 20 million dollars a year but they have no control over their time every second of their day is dictated by someone else's needs and that itself is like its own unique form of poverty they are like cash rich and time broke i would rather be time rich and cash broke than the alternative and so rather than just like wanting money for more things i want independence i just want to wake up every day and say i can do whatever i want now how you get that and this is what throws people off is i want to build up wealth not money to spend i just want assets sitting around in the bank because that's what gives me independence and autonomy or not the bank but my brokerage account investments that i might never spend so then people ask like what the hell is the purpose of money if you're not going to spend it there's a very real thing that unspent money does which gives you freedom and independence during the next recession during the next bear market or if like you want to quit your job it's all up to you you're not reliant on the kindness of strangers and other people's goals and aspirations to dictate how you're going to live your life it's just the freedom and control to do whatever you want
