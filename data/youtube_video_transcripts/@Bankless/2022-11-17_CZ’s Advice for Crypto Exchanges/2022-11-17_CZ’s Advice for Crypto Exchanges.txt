I would recommend most businesses have at least 10 years of wrong way 10 years of cash if they have zero income very few traditional companies can achieve that but in the blockchain world it's actually not that hard to achieve the binance coin is about 40 billion dollars market cap we have the team portion we never used and we do commit to you know burn that but we also have income like even the team portions was you know double digit billion dollars so most crypto companies if they manage wealth they could be sitting on this really large cash Reserve also in the crypto business they're very clear very simple business models you should have revenue and because we're dealing with crypto money we're dealing with this industry it's actually not difficult for good businesses to make money
