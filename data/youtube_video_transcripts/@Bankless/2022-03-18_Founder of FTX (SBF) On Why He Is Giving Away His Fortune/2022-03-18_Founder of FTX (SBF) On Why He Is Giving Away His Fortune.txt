you tell us a bit more sam about your giving pledge and what you're planning to give to totally so you know in the end i want to i give away basically everything that that i make we're probably gonna be giving somewhere between 100 million billion this year through the ftx foundation and you know part of that is animal welfare part of that is global poverty a big piece is looking at what might really change the long-term vision of the future there are trillions of people who might live and so a lot of this is thinking about like what what could we do today that might actually have long-term impact that might change the lives of of the world and sort of the direction of the rest of the world and a lot of that looks like what can we do that has sort of reliable impact that sort of you can trace out to a long way from here and i i don't think there's like a single obvious easy answer to that i i think it's complicated but i think that there are things that we can do i don't think it's hopeless
