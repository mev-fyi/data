apology do you remember the 90 day Bitcoin bet yeah he's capitulated on it biology tweets out I just burned a million to tell you they're printing trillions the million dollar bet is now closed by mutual agreement I made one million dollar improvable on-chain donations which you can verify he's basically saying the whole like bit signal was a marketing stunt to broadcast that they are going to print a trillion dollars apology says it's still gonna happen it's just not gonna happen in 90 days and so then of course the question is okay but when my guess is 10 months 70 years 19 decades one percent centuries he's giving a much more probabilistic bet here 10 in months sounds like there's a 10 chance that Bitcoin Hits 1 million dollars this year over the long run I'm definitely not betting that biology is wrong
