creature world started about five years ago with this idea that an amazing magical world could be made real i'll be able to see myself in it you'll be able to see yourself in it this is a bridge this is a connector we will be seeing each other i throw my first show and there's this amazing lesson of i can do this there's also this amazing lesson if i don't want to do this damn this is so [ __ ] boring putting paintings on a wall if the goal is to make a world real is this the most effective way to go about that so the next show that i threw was this real immersive experience cobid comes and i'm like everything that i have planned i can't do it anymore what am i gonna do and there was this massive need for connectivity when the only tools that we had to connect were digital how can we create art where it's home is these screens how can we use this to get even closer not only compensating for the separation but actually getting closer than we even are oftentimes sitting in front of one another and there comes creature world
