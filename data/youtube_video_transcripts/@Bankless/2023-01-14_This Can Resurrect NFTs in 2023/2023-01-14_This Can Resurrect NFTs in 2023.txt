is that the resurrection of nfts that nfts add some sort of utility I think that's right each one is going to provide utility for its Community to buy them and own them my claim for 2023 with the world of nfts is that nfts are the closest prototypes to balaji's Network's date thesis so bloggy's Network state is really about dating like-minded people together and then physically instantiated in the world somewhere I think that's going to be largely similar with nfts not necessarily in the real world but also not not that like there are cool cats Meetup I've been to a cool cat Meetup in La the board Apes have parties all the time but then there's also going to be similar Vibes inside of virtual lands and I think that is starting to look and feel like balaji's Network State idea
