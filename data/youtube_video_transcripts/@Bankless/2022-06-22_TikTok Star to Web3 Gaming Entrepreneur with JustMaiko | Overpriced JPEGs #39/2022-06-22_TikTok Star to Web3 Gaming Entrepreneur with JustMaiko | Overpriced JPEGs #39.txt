to date whenever i wait a few weeks before an episode gets released i always like to give that disclaimer because i'm worried there's something we may have said that feels out of touch given the way that the market moves so quickly and we've seen some really hard losses come recently so bear that in mind as you listen to this episode and otherwise i hope you enjoy [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i am joined today by the co-founders of joystick we've got michael lee and robin defay in the house robin has a background in tech and consumer

was a good intro i like that live wow oh do you have it written down thanks appreciate it before we dive totally in and we're going to start talking about schlove pals which is the nft project you have coming out michael and then we'll get a joystick and what you're building there on the gaming side we do need to pause a moment to hear a word from our lovely lovely sponsors who make this show

all right we're back we're going to talk about shlove pals so michael this is really your first foray into like launching an nft project i know you've been in this space for over a year i'm really interested in this because when i've heard you talk about this in other contexts like i don't it sounds awesome and it also is a world that i'm not super familiar with and it has to do with minecraft servers and like making money like a guy named mr beast and i feel like this is all super important and relevant for like the future economy we're all entering into and i personally am not savvy enough so i honestly would love to just start with you breaking down maybe start with like the mr beast comparison that i've heard you give before i know there's like a couple different components to this love pals project yeah but like the gaming component of this in particular and how you see folks in your ecosystem like making money and participating on the gaming side yeah for sure to understand that okay cool got you uh yeah i'll give you a quick i guess elevator pitch of it um pretty much wish love pals uh i wanted to kind of offer the community of web 3 like you know something that i could personally give myself being a creator of seven years and and being in the web 2 space and being a gamer and all that stuff and i really wanted to create something that connected people with something that i was kind of already known for as well as just like bringing a new opportunity and kind of like innovating in the space you know a lot of the nft projects had like it was it was pretty much about eight to ten months of me figuring out what utility was like how could i make something that someone would deem valuable you know and it took me a lot of like trial and error but i finally got it down to where okay this love universe i'm building is um it embodies everything that that i'm kind of creating which is you know shlove which is self love you know so that's that's kind of like my whole messaging and branding and with all of these different worlds it kind of ties it along with it with different utilities and perks uh for being you know a holder of a community um so pretty much it's education entertainment and empowerment those are the three different um ones with three different perks essentially and to start off with the entertainment that was the one that you know obviously a lot of people are going to be known uh you know knowing it for it's pretty much weekly and monthly gaming tournaments uh for either cash prizes or nfts or whatever we decide or whatever the community wants and essentially i'm taking that having the holders of the community play to win this and i get to utilize the content for it for web 2 to promote the server to promote the nft project as well as what i'm doing and essentially the money that i get from the minecraft server as well as the revenue from the content i'm gonna put it back into the prize fund of the entertainment um like competitions and basically it's like a snowball that's just gonna keep growing so say it starts off with something like five or ten thousand dollars a month it's gonna start growing into like 20 000. if i make 50 000 i'm gonna put in 50 000 you know so like it's just constantly growing where it's self-cyclical and uh it's a really cool way to kind of like water drop to the audience that doesn't know about nft is like oh what is this how are they playing i want to get a part of it oh this is an nft what is this you know so it kind of peaks their interest to where i'm not like it's not so jarring in their face it's more of just like a subtle detail that over time they're going to want to learn themselves rather than me just throwing it out in their faces okay i'm going to try and unpack this more with you let me see if i get the the fundamentals here straight and so you have this huge following i think it's like 50 million plus across platforms that are really in the the web two world of things with probably varying degrees of interest and exposure to web three was schlov a term this schlev which is like your self-love was that a recurring theme in your web two content yeah and so that's something that your web 2 audience is like familiar with and has resonated with and all the rest okay yeah exactly and now your your sort of overarching goal here is how do i bridge this gap between web 2 and web 3 and bring more of your web to audience into the web three worlds yeah exactly okay you've got evil genius uh you know building yeah that's right building uh okay money okay so and and so you have these three pillars of this project and does that those correspond to three character like three characters no so all the characters entertainment education and empowerment no there's just three different tiers you can buy into so essentially so every nft every like character is pretty much just for the lower base of like what character resonates with each person so each character was derived off of a part of me that made me feel like this is who i am you know so there's different characters from like shlovy baggins who's like he's determined for wealth and success to support his family and himself you know then we have self-love avert valentine which is like you know in pursuit of self-happiness and self-worth and then there's you know other characters and essentially um it's just to kind of like have a more of a personal uh connection with the nft itself but every character every uh community member will have an opportunity to explore the schlev universe with their shlo pal okay so each love pal unlocks all the entertainment the education and the empowerment you're not picking one or the other exactly exactly i feel like i'm hearing some gary v influence oh like these characters that represent morals and yes you're nodding yeah he's been he's been a big influence on me uh for for a long time he's actually the one that got me into web three when he was talking like all about crypto punks and all that stuff and um yeah i love the messaging that he made and for me it was like the reason i got into web 3 was because like i love my whole messaging and goal was to inspire people through my content to like tell them like yo like you can do this too like i was just a dancer and i was able to make so much opportunity for myself and my family um through social media you know like it was something that damn good dancer you're a good dancer thank you thank you and um i i pretty much saw like it was really dope but i kind of got to a point where i felt like i was doing the same thing every day and it kind of got you know i lost inspiration you know i i was kind of getting bored and with web 3 i was like yo like this is a chance for me to take my legacy to not only entertaining people but actually being able to change their lives and giving them like the next opportunity because i knew it was a gold mine that was untouched and when you're first movers and things you have a lot better of a chance to make it in that market compared to years down the line when this already kind of made i i want to talk about what you've learned from your web 2 experience and your creator experience like one of the reasons i was excited to have you all on is is to to hear some of that from you like what is somebody who's deep in web 3 now who was deep in web 2 and um and understanding your learnings there but i i want to stay on this understanding this gaming thing better because again i think this is actually for people who don't understand this i think it's like important that we understand some of this if we want to be deep in web3 yeah okay a minecraft server like so i think i understand at a high level what's going on here which it sounds like you're saying you're going to do these gaming competition tournaments got a question about that but and the nft holders are the ones who get to participate in these tournaments and win the and have the opportunity to win the cash prizes no not only yeah yes there's a there's a there's a little extra too wait but there's more there's a little more yeah because i know that a lot of community members or nfc people or web 3 people don't play games i didn't wanted only to be like stuck to a specific niche i wanted them to still be able to take advantage of the opportunity so pretty much i'm doing a kind of like a scholarship model where they're going to be able to lend out their um i guess their place in the game to a fan of mine or like you know a non-holder essentially and let them play for them and if they win the non-holder would win about like 20 of the prize while the holder will win 80 so it's like you know to a kid that doesn't own anything but they want to be a part of this competition and then they do you know two thousand dollars for someone may not be a lot for someone else but to a kid that's like that's that's a lot of money you know so i wanted to be able to kind of integrate both uh both my web two and web three audience whether they're a part or not a part okay and that's sort of like these scholarship models we've seen come into place through axiomfinity and and play to earn which we'll get into but the the fact remains that to play in these tournaments that you're hosting you have to be an nft holder whether you bought it or you're you're renting it out from somebody exactly and then if what i heard you saying right is you're creating these flywheel effects which is these games these tournaments that are being streamed you're then going to post on your channels to your audience of millions of people who are you know you're your gaming audience i guess specifically maybe it's not going on your tick tock channel you can tell me but um so that it draws more attention to the nft project and to the the the content yeah they're literally giving me the opportunity to make more content to do what i'm already doing um but it's a way for me to give back at the same time and just yeah just cycling so i'm so curious in the history and the precedent here because again i don't come from a gaming background particularly and it's an area i'm trying to understand a lot better so uh i'm sensing this is maybe where the mr beast comparison comes in i know the name mr beast i know he's like huge and he's connected to youtube and gaming and you know or maybe twitch or one of those and i would love for you to explain the precedent in place for these kinds of cash prize tournaments that's worked before it sounds like yeah i i'm a big creator when it comes i'm big on creating um on top of things i've already worked and just adding my own spin to it you know mr beast i mean he is if not the best influencer in creator in the entire world right now um it is insane to see what he's built and to show like you know money is a massive incentive you know a lot of people got into the web three space and nfc space because of financial reasons you know it's a real it was a really big push and when someone sees that a fan of of someone can compete in a contest to win ten thousand dollars a fifty thousand dollar you know like just dishing out money the views are gonna come and then essentially from that the views turned into you know dollars to to make revenue on so for me i was like okay this is crazy mr beast is already doing this but he's making the money back in the revenue just to put back into his videos but for me it's like okay how can i how can i grow this and consistently grow it even more you know so for me i was like okay i'm taking this mystery beast concept of making these videos um but the thing is that his viewers say it's 10 15 20 million viewers they aren't able to play the games that he actually makes so what i'm doing is i'm taking that concept of making those games accessible to the actual viewers on the minecraft server and then from there you're gonna have loyalty on that server and what people don't know is that minecraft servers are actually super duper lucrative so imagine having all this you know this this loyalty uh going into the server and all of a sudden the server makes you know a lot of money the content makes a lot of money and then i kind of siphon it back into itself now it's like i'm able to just kind of reinvest and grow and what i get out of it not just you know financials like i'm really just reinvesting everything all into it i'm pretty much getting the branding of it all and building my own brand uh where people can associate me with all these things and have a good have a good you know i wanna have a good name to myself and have a good legacy so that's uh that's how i'm kind of building everything okay i have more noob questions robin i'm sorry we will get you in here eventually but i i actually i really want to nail this because i think you know michael you're a bit younger like i'm still young but like i feel old compared to you michael and just like the the you know the i don't know the language we use is different so i'm trying to really wrap my head around it and i think others want to understand this better too okay are all of the games these people are going to be competing on built on minecraft yes so the reason why i'm using minecraft is because it's a it's the most accessible and easiest game to actually build upon you know like there's so many different mini games that you can actually create yourself and experiences that you can create yourself um and and the actual scalability of it is like insane so like you know typically with games like with the larger games you can have up to 60 people or whatnot with minecraft servers with the way that it's built and developed you're actually able to get you know if you have the right team of course you're able to get up to 500 to a thousand to a couple of thousand people all in one single game play and that's why i'm like yo this is insane because like rather than you know playing 20 different games of 60 people i can have one game of a thousand people all playing together and the mega tournament i feel like that's such a crazy um you know thing that minecraft really hasn't been the only game i've seen that's been able to actually break that back barrier and and minecraft has broken like every record it's just like one of the most played games of all time we've seen things like nft worlds for folks who are more in web 3 like i'm more familiar with that f2 world even than i am minecraft you know because of how i've come to this whole ecosystem okay so that's helpful and like in a mr beast case is he also he's also like he has his own minecraft server essentially and has his own set of games no he doesn't with other kinds of games you're choosing to go to the minecraft right now he just does stuff for content he does straight straight for content um i'm i'm bringing it one step further to allow the community to actually be a part and play and and and utilize it because i feel like it's a waste of opportunity okay so you're gonna have like bespoke games built in your sort of minecraft server world folks are gonna play it if you own an nft you're gonna be able to play the game in a live stream slash like recorded capacity so you'll get to see your character playing on you know michael lee's channel somewhere just michael's channel somewhere and then on top of that if you're an audience member watching the game play you can then also go to the server and start playing the game itself exactly in theory like in a whole community of people that may be a combination of nft holders and not whatever and the server itself generates revenue from those players being in there because loot crates tell me that yeah yeah loot crates in-game items you know in-game assets like fortnight and skins yeah great exactly okay and because you control that server you get a piece of that and all of that can go back to be reinvested into the broader ecosystem i think i've got it exactly no you you nailed it that's awesome okay very interesting last couple of points we'll just we'll just touch on this because i think that's just this one this initial pillar the entertainment pillar you've got this education pillar that you talk about that's really as far as i can tell your youtube channel where you're you know making videos around web3 and trying to educate folks right yeah kind of i mean it's pretty much the education perk per se it's pretty much an alpha group in the server anyone that gets in that's new to the community or that just wants updates i wanted to kind of provide everything for them so having basically like around twice a week of like alpha calls of like you know different things to kind of teach people like yo you should invest in this one or you shouldn't get invested or not invest i wouldn't use the word invest not financial advice but um you know like what projects and teams to actually look into opposed to like you know getting rug pulled and scammed like i wanted to take care of my community and anyone that supports me and i feel like education is just a must needed thing um and so you're saying that's happening primarily in your discord channel it's like an alpha group thing within your discord chat yeah when i tried to check your discord channel the link wasn't working anymore can you tell folks what's going on with that what's the update on shelter i heard i heard there was a um you know a several server hacks going on so i had to turn off a couple bots that utilize the whole reaction and entering of the server so i had to kind of take a break and just like reevaluate how to kind of structure the server and how to kind of move forward so uh we're pretty much for the next few weeks and months um i'm hopefully looking to launch love pals in another month or so and um right now it's just kind of regaining the community back into it because the bear market obviously happened all that stuff um and i wanted to kind of take a breather and touch some grass real quick so you know that was pretty much the uh the kind of synopsis of that and um and yeah and to finish off the the empowerment essentially what i'm building with just meta is uh you know just meta right now is the uh uh a youtube education channel and pretty much what i'm doing with that is i'm eventually going to turn that into a uh an nft uh not nfc i'm sorry a metaverse talk show so it's gonna be the first metaverse talk show so think like late the ready player one and the late night show coming together and that's gonna be what just meant it's going to turn into so whether it's long form and also short form content and um and the perk with the holders is that they're going to be able to be a part and produce it essentially and give their thoughts and feedback and also um kind of like request people to come onto the show so it's giving them an opportunity to be heard the empowerment side basically giving them a stage kind of like ellen how you know if you bring on a person that has a cool story or a cool talent or whatnot i want to do the same thing for a web 3 space and integrate this cool metaverse kind of like you know 3d element to something that's already working which is like a talk show so metaverse has a number of meanings so when you say it's a talk show in the metaverse you say ready player one does that mean it's this is really built for vr what does it mean to you to say it's a talk show for now it's going to be on platforms that are already you know our social medias so tick tock uh youtube instagram whatnot um it's going to be made into a video but it's going to be metaverse in the sense that it's going to look like the quality of like ready player one for example like it's going to have the aesthetic of that like 3d characters so think like not okay not real okay so you're gonna have you're gonna have you're gonna interview folks you're gonna interview amiibit or have those sort of like rigged pieces where it maybe isn't a human or you're interviewing a board ape or something exactly that cool so what's the timeline like or is this a stage thing where the entertainment piece comes first and down the line you have just met up where where do you see this planet education education and entertainment are both things i'm able to execute on pretty much immediately um empowerment i'm already working through them i already have the models basically going through them and rigging them essentially getting all the assets together but i have the team already built i have everything else ready it's just a matter of like how long the art takes uh to build the actual characters and the models and um and funding everything so uh yeah i'd say my first video hopefully will come out in july um of a short for the talk show not the talk show so it's gonna start off with short form content first to build the audience and then from there i'm gonna build into the talk show eventually um but it's gonna start off with tons of short form content um and uh and from there just kind of grow an audience and it's going to go into uh whatever else i want to build okay truly last question before we go to joystick and and we'll actually probably touch on this again later i am interested in you know you you're saying short form content first to build the audience you do have some videos out on like your just meta channel or something that feels like around the just meta channel which does talk about web3 education and you know it's noticeably smaller certainly than most of your other platforms is that something to do with the do people like you know the web3 educational content less you haven't promoted it it's not the right format yeah essentially what i'm doing is i'm i'm still in my pre-building phase where i'm building out evergreen content where like i want to build content where people can um basically come whenever and essentially uh you know learn about anything they want from the i'm i'm basically laying the foundation essentially right i'm creating like what is energy i'm building exactly you know so when people do learn about the opportunities and when they're interested when it's a bull market obviously people are going to be interested again um they're going to be like okay i need to learn about this stuff i want to have all that stuff in just meta in a simple and easy way for them to just like understand everything opposed to like you know market updates and constant videos where it's like it only it's only good for like a week or two you know i want to make content that is um dedicated for any anyone that wants to learn whether it's a month from now or a year from now you know and uh from that obviously short form content is going to be what drives and pushes the engagement and the uh traction to it and then from there it's just gonna be easy going okay well we're gonna talk more about your tips of like how to make viral content and like what you've learned about how to hack these algorithms and build a huge audience but we're not gonna do that right now because we need to bring robin into this now uh robin thank you for your patience uh i want to talk about joystick which is the other venture that michael you're launching and you're doing it in tandem with robin and i think a team of others maybe let's start with you robin uh explaining what joystick is if you can just sort of like here are the four things joystick here's what it is and here like the four things it does if you can put in that kind of a framing if not do it you definitely can i definitely can you know everything michael was just talking about it's all about laying that foundation for this ecosystem of building in this web three digital world that's coming together and every piece of what he's involved with kind of fits nicely and is complementary to each of the others so we've been building the digital world since the beginning from the first mmos all the way through to the adoption of blockchain and the gaming industry is undergoing this evolution where you have the ownership of these assets in the game worlds shifting from being exclusively developer owned to now players being able to own them and opening up the doors to what's possible where people can earn real money and the best of them can literally earn financial freedom and so as this world starts to take shape joystick is your north star in this new digital frontier you asked about four things i would say we'll educate you on the best games to play the best tactics to win and the best strategies to earn will equip you with the most valuable assets in the leading games to maximize your profits and your success within them we'll support you with community like family led by creators and web 2 and web 3 gaming worlds and then we'll open doors for you to be seen and heard and grow your footprint in this new gaming ecosystem that's developing okay so i want to separate this into like the consumer experience and then let's call it maybe the back end and what y'all are doing and how the the business mechanics of it work starting with a consumer experience based on what you just said it sounds like this is gonna be browser-based to start right like there's a or maybe discord browser based but like i go on to uh your site and i can get a low down on like okay what's happening in the game fi ecosystem specifically what games are hot right now you know obviously in the last year you've seen things like axi and god's unchained and you could probably argue creeps or wolf game i know i've seen those on on your site so we'll talk about that maybe a little bit but you can see all that okay see these are hot and then get some guidance on how to play or yield you know yield farm or make money off of these games and then borrow assets if you don't have the asset you need to play one of these games i can go on in and borrow an asset from y'all to go and play that game and try and earn is that right and what would you add kind of okay all right we we put a little bit of a flip on the model um so we're not actually borrowing and lending assets but what you have is there's there's literally 3.25 billion gamers in the world but there's only around 1.2 million people that have actually owned an nft at this point so even though we all hear about it every day and we you know it's it's everywhere we look the reality is there's very few people that have actually interacted with and engaged with this technology so as this gaming arena continues to grow and and more exposure comes to it you have this mass of gamers that are going to be exposed to the opportunity to actually earn in the games they play whether it's through the the currencies in the game or actually in-game assets right and so it's we're going to be able to usher you in and show you the best places to to play the best places to earn and then instead of this lender model where which is what the entire industry is adopted it's called scholarships where you essentially have the asset owner who maybe purchased it but doesn't have the time to play and you have the player who can't afford to purchase the asset because oftentimes they're they're exorbitantly expensive and they can be and so when they revenue share on this asset the player is playing the owner's asset and cutting off 30 40 even up to 50 percent of the revenue that they generate and giving it back to the asset owner this doesn't give the player a sturdy foundation to build on top of to build their own presence in this web3 space so the way we're adjusting that model is providing the assets in all of the best games at all of the variety of different levels on a rental model where somebody can come in and pay a much lower rental fee to get access to the asset and then we let the players themselves keep a hundred percent of the revenue that they generate that they're able to generate which will give them the ability to actually establish and scale their own position within this ecosystem so the distinction is instead of borrowing an asset for free initially but then having to give a sizable percentage of your earnings back to somebody you're paying a fixed cost on a monthly basis or something and keeping all of your earnings as a player so it strikes me that both could ben you might pick one or the other you know like as a player one might be better for you than another if you know you're a really good player and you have a little bit of upfront cash that you want to put up for it your model might be better whereas somebody else may be like i have no money up front to put up i'd rather give up a bigger percentage does that feel right yeah it does but we're also cultivating a really special community and we're going to be opening up the opportunity for people within our community that don't have the money to even put up for a rental the ability to earn access to the assets completely free of charge on a trial basis just opening the door for them and giving them the opportunity to earn from nothing because well yes we are going to support people that are the best at the games and this model allows for them to earn more money at the end of the day we're going to make it possible for people to come in with any level of experience from a ton to none any level of finance from a lot to nothing and be able to begin to establish their own journey into this into this realm and to to kind of carve their way towards their own victory so you recently announced an 8 million raise i think you have more you're looking to raise where are you in the stages of this vision coming to fruition we're well within it so we we did close out the eight million dollar seed round um and now we're on to series a we're currently undergoing meetings with all of the biggest names in the industry and looking for the right partners that add strategically to the environment whether it's connections in countries that we're looking to expand in or access to deal flow that maybe opens doors to us with new games and new opportunities that we may not have had open to us otherwise um we're we're pretty excited about where we stand we're literally unveiling everything to the world that we've been building for the last six or seven months and and getting the momentum rolling on so unveiling you're like right now you're in this the unveil period if somebody wants to come and start playing in a game renting an asset is that open and ready to go yep right now you can come in and apply for the beta rental asset access excuse me access to the assets that we have live um there's a new game coming out it's like actually in the process of rolling out right now it's called big time um it was created by ari malek the same creator of decentral land and he had the vision to see that these games are going to act as the bridge to the metaverse and he assembled a triple a um studio to be able to bring a game out a triple a quality game to blockchain well ahead of everybody else right now they're unrolling and if you compare big time to any other game uh on the blockchain right now it's not even close um it's it's by far the most similar to what you would be comfortable seeing as a player of a more modern game today i mean they have that early mover to market so we we just through the leverage in our relationships um we were able to acquire a massive position where the number one largest holder of space which is their land in the game um we have over 12 500 pieces and we're currently putting the using that as the foundation for this entire rental platform to be able to build out the ecosystem of educational resources streaming assets that will shine a spotlight on the game itself as well as joystick and then you the actual rental platform itself um getting players utilizing our assets working with our technology and really putting together the foundation that we will add additional games to as we move forward okay big time i'm sorry if i missed this he started building earlier why was he able to come to market with and i'm taking your word for it i'm not endorsing that as a triple a game but i'm taking your word for it so much earlier than you know we have sort of expected he's a visionary yeah he's a visionary in the space so he created decentraland which is one of the top two largest metaverse decentraland and sandbox um in the space and so he saw early on that these games and the communities and the attention that gets put into these game worlds is going to be the first iteration of metaverses in this digital world and he started assembling the team right out of silicon valley that had deep experience in creating traditional games for many many years and so he was just he just started earlier he started he was ahead of everybody and that's why his game which was developed entirely for the blockchain is out now and being played it's increasingly obvious that everything will become tokenized

term play to earn which i feel like is on the verge of being out of fashion because we've seen games like axiomfinity have their peak and then seem to start to struggle more recently and um the very concept of if you're playing to earn meaning that at a certain point the economics would have to collapse because there's too much extraction and not enough money being put into the system are you guys still bullish on play to earn or are you also moving your mentality to like play and earn and some of these other terms we see come out oh i mean yeah i mean i guess technically play and earn works too because at the end of the day these games are um are essentially going to be free to play as well but they won't have the access to earn you know so that's where the nft is the whole you know thing comes in and that's where the obviously the uh you know branding and ip goes a long way obviously we see that with fortnite we see that with all these games are free to play but you see these you know millions of dollars rolling in every week or every day um it's going to happen with the same thing with these games you know we are early and there are um only a handful of games are out right now but literally i mean we see games like epic games partnering with lego doing three billion dollars for the next metaverse game you know like like there's there's major major companies and games coming out that throughout the months you're just gonna start seeing tons tons come out because guaranteed when you hear something like fortnite if they have like if there's a game that's equivalent to fortnite and and you tell a kid hey you can make money while playing this game that you already play that you don't make money from right now like you're gonna it's kind of a guarantee that they're gonna hop on and be like yo let me try this out real quick you know and and we want to be well i don't know i think the gaming community has had a lot of has not reacted that way and i'd be curious have you received backlash as you've talked about this and you're building up a gaming audience from people you know gamers feel very strongly that they hate this and this is not what they want obviously i think this is the future i think that people i think that people that are against it are you know typically people are afraid of change um but it's the thing that it's gonna happen like you can't stop it you know if you're giving an opportunity to someone to make money while playing a game that they love not just the game like we're not forcing people to play games these games are not forced you know actually infinity although some people may not find it fun but others may find it fun there it clearly was successful you know it was obviously one of the first movers and and it has had such an insane success and and journey with them that imagine when a game like fortnite comes out a game like you know minecraft or what like nft worlds building on top of a game that's already already working right now like it's there's so much opportunity that people just don't unders they don't see it yet basically and we want to provide them um you know that to be able to do that on-ramp really is your goal to be a first stop for people new to this world to come and start trying it out yes 100 100 yeah half of the half of the economy right now of of web 3 literally came from actually infinity like like a lot of people were on board into web 3 because of gaming so and that was top shot which is you know different uh but but it still has that gamified component to it yeah exactly um so y'all are kind of using play to earn as a catch-all to say like blockchain games which inevitably come with them a certain opportunity to either make money or offshoot the money you've spent or you're is that you're not using it too specifically to mean it has to be what we think of as a traditional player in game i i think if we could if i could add into it you know play to earn is going to evolve just like the entire space evolves play and earn is the long-term success because it's all about the fun of these games right the games being fun and players enjoying being a part of the ecosystem because the entire loop is adding value to the experience for them and some of the like axi made massive accomplishments being the first to to lead and pioneer something like that you don't have the others to look at as an example for what to look out for and what may work and what may not work and you see them right now evolving adding the builder economy to their game jiho the leader over there is so capable and he's so he's his head is ahead of the game and he's constantly looking for ways to evolve so i think just like that the entire play to earn space will also evolve into the best iteration of itself but at the end of the day long term it's all about fun it's all about these games being fun and engaging so play and earn is where this industry is ultimately going to head i think you should update your documents i think it's a planner we're building across the board and i can't tell you that updates that update's on the way yeah and we're seeing it with axia i think axi origin you know you have the the the free axes to try and onboard more more folks into it who can play just because they think it's fun and then if they want to upgrade to you know buying an axi um you even it says on on your website that you've invested in axi wolf game creeps i think gods and changes on there guardians of the galaxy or whatever the imx game is um do you what does that mean does that mean you you own by investing in that is that to say you own assets that are available to be rented out to players who want to come on board yeah not everything is available to be rented out but it does mean that we've taken a position and that we own assets within that game um other side's another one we own a ton of the other side land and we're really excited for what yugo labs are building um but yeah anything on the site that's we we own assets within their game world um but the game has to be live for us to be able to rent them out sure okay i want to give you my criticism of land sales and get you to react to it cause it sounds like you're bullish and i think that there's a a problem and i've spoken about it on this podcast i actually have another episode in the tank that i haven't released yet of somebody who's a little bit critical of this which is like web 3 does such a good job of incentive alignment and the problem with these land sales is it puts it says the incentive for yuga now is to make money or they're beholden to make money to a bunch of people who were available to purchase this land on a saturday night or can now afford to purchase it now as opposed to uh aligning their incentives with the people who are building the most doing the most playing the most in their metaverse what do you think about that as a big other side land holder i think there are a lot of different ways to skin a cat so to speak i think that the way that they approached it makes sense for what they for what they were building and i think you'll see other companies other game developers approach it differently to make it more fair based on the people that are building within within the world but at the end of the day anything that's coming from the ground up and being built for the first time is going to need to have the most hardcore supporters that get behind what they're building to be able to blossom their ecosystem and their economy on top of it so i don't know this was the best way because hardcore how are you hardcore to being defined as the people who will buy in early versus the people who will build the most early that's where my problem comes in i think it depends on how much you're going to rely on ugc and how pivotal the land is to your ecosystem but i think you're just you're cutting out a whole population of players who maybe would be really good for your ecosystem but can't afford the land i think that's where we come in regret you mentioned you're trying to raise this series a round i think i'd seen figures like 110 million you're looking to raise for this you mentioned you you've maybe held off on the schlov pals launch because of the bear market what has tried to raise a series a been like in this current market it's been a challenging you know but but it's a good challenge what's really cool about the space that we're building is no matter what happens up and down the market we know that where the technology is headed and where the technology goes the attention and the money flows so we have no no hesitations or concerns about the direction we're going in but we've definitely had to alter our our approach as we've gone just given the climate of everything and so we we've done that we've done exactly that we're still meeting with all of these amazing funds we're actually looking for who could who fits the the ecosystem we're building the best to lead the series a round and who adds the most value um but yeah you just change with the changing waves of the of the of the industry right and we roll with the flow and we do what makes the most sense to ultimately succeed with developing and putting our vision together and so we've done the same thing with regard to the raising process this is a question you may opt to skip which i understand but the 110 million figure we'd love to have you break down where that comes from or 110 million you're trying to raise 110 million yeah so like how the valuation works how you determine that figure if you can shed some light into that i think people would be interested yeah user acquisition is an absolutely massive piece of the strategy for what we're putting together um being able to onboard as many people that are looking to come into this new ecosystem and give them the tools and resources needed to succeed within it and then being the one that they see and and this is not an inexpensive strategy to put together ultimately developing value adding products that we can put into this gaming space um to provide value to both our community and the industry as a whole so that we're able to develop out a community and then down the road our long-term vision is to acquire aaa gaming studios and to begin to develop and release our own titles out through our community into the world and so the 110 million number was a number that we came to that we felt would take us from start all the way completely to finish giving us the resources and the assets that we needed when we looked at what we brought to the table and the amount of money that comparable companies like merit circle and yield guild and others had raised in late 2021 um we felt that it was really fair you know we had more asset nft assets under management than both of them leading into it we had generated 1.5 million in revenue in november and december alone of 2021 so when we were putting this package together the numbers really made sense to get us to where we were interested in going market conditions landscape evolves right and things change and we we got pushback um understandably in that area and so like i said we take the feedback and we just continue to shape the direction that we're going and so that we can all create a win for ourselves and for the community is part of the user acquisition plan or or what percent of this and maybe this is for you michael like is around your community and trying to bring folks from your gaming community into this ecosystem or are you trying to keep these worlds separate no i mean it's in general like it's not even just my communities i think it's it's the gaming community in general like we're not just bringing my audiences we're bringing web to uh gaming creators twitch streamers like people that are already in it as well as giving opportunities to you know like to give them an opportunity to to be able to be an esports player to be able to make them into their own guild leaders to make them into streamers whatever they want i want to give that opportunity to them um to anyone that joins the joystick ecosystem and uh that that doesn't take one person that takes an entire you know a village a team and that's gonna be um we're just gonna spread i'm just i'm just one piece of the puzzle you know i'd love to get your thoughts on chains for i guess that's how i would phrase it um when it comes to gaming i think we've seen recently ape coin made the announcement they would be moving to imx after they had you know sort of the trouble with their other side drop you obviously have axey is on ronin you have dapper on flow do you have a bet as to where the future of gaming will be understanding it probably can't be scaled effectively on ethereum main net well layer twos it can be i mean immutable x is a layer two on top of it no no on top of mainnet but not like ethereum main chain player one correct yeah no understood i understand what you're saying yeah i think that looking at the gaming ecosystem there's some clear leaders in the space what avax is doing with subnets giving the games the opportunity to actually put all of their on-chain transactions onto their own chain which is a sub of the avax chain um that's that's a really value add to the industry um immutable x like you said the the lineup of games you can go through it they've just got a slaughter's row of really really well funded well put together great teams building the games on immutable x um i have no doubt that they'll be a player in the space polygon another one that puts a ton of attention towards gaming um another layer two there on the ethereum chain i think that you're gonna see multiple come kind of step up and then you're also gonna see ecosystems like the gala games ecosystem where they have their own ecosystem of games that have been built out specifically by them for their chain um there will be a good mix of all of them because i think blockchain gaming is going to be one of if not the best use case for blockchain technology in the near-term future so i think you're going to see a lot of people starting to shift in this direction all of the different chains want to get their hand in on the gaming front i want to shift a little bit to the creator economy topic michael you know you're again deep and early in tiktok you came from the musically world so you came up with all these tick talkers who if you have heard of any tick tock or you've heard of these ones i feel like a lot of those early musically people are had were the really early successful tick tock folks what is the uh sentiment right now around web3 and nfts among like the the tick tock young creator crowd i feel like we've seen a lot of things and it's it hasn't really worked yeah no one understands nor cares about it um in that in my opinion uh there's like less than 10 people i know in the creator economy that's like taking it seriously actually doing well and um and and actually again building the foundation um i think that a lot of creators you know like at the end of the day web 3 is complicated you kind of you kind of got to be a nerd in somewhat shape or form to want to be a part of it and the ux is weird right now and not easily navigable yeah so so when it comes to creators coming in and you know like and i've seen a lot like we obviously seen a lot of just people get into it not understanding it and then obviously getting taken advantage of and you know putting their name behind something that's not as reputable or whatnot um i i think that creators are going to eventually understand but it's they're kind of just like they're like they're like everyone else there's just you know it it takes the right person to educate them on it and then for example like garyvee garyvee was someone that i looked up to that i was able to learn like actually understand what nfcs and web3 was through him you know so having leaders in the space and actual thought leaders to to create an actual content creators to actually create good content and entertaining content educational content for the web through space is is like i think like number one the most important thing about the space right now because it's again it's a new space a lot of scams are going around a lot of things that people don't understand because it's the wild west and um i'm trying to you know uh bring as many people on as i possibly can within my small circle and uh eventually to the masses once i feel like i have enough things to be able to bring him in and uh yeah that's kind of just my take on it as a creator putting that hat on specifically not even like a gamer builder what excites you most about web3 for creators i think it's so cool because i've never seen a stronger community than the communities in web3 i think it's so insane how much value you can give to someone that supports you um by by them supporting you and you you can now support them with whether it's you know perks or royalties or whatever it's just like a beefed up it's just a beefed up like tactic to be able to like bring everyone together and um and and make something happen for them not only just for the creator themselves but for their for their supporters so yes are you bullish what do you think we'll get to like decentralized media or social media or better ownership of your audience via nft yeah i think i think you know there's there's so much possibilities uh we're still so early so i can't say this not gonna happen but i'm positive i've already known and heard a few people trying to start it it's obviously just like they have to figure it out so but um i think i think you know we don't we don't see tumblr anymore we don't see uh myspace anymore you know uh who knows we're so early in technology of web 2 technically still we're only what 20 years in really you know like iphones didn't even exist 20 years ago so it's kind of weird um to just see how everything has shifted and um yeah i don't know it's going to be parabolic in the next few years and i think that uh you're going to see we're going to start seeing a lot of things that we just didn't expect at all the exponential age is i don't know if that was coined by uh raul powell but you know he he uses it a lot uh okay your your your quick tips or your your rapid fire how to get 50 million followers with just michael michael lee give it to us now all right quick tip right now it's it's a long process quick tip it does not happen quickly yeah i mean overnight success with any field it looks like it to the public eye but in reality it's like okay like yeah this person got his first you know famous success or shot of success or this person blew up because of this but they people don't see the years and years of commitment and hard work into the craft of into you know what they've done um that that's actually built up into that you know i think that success is a mixture of chance and work ethic you know like you need the right timing and you need the right chance but you also need to be ready for that opportunity as well you know and i think that it's a mixture of both of them and i i feel like a lot of people you know they think it's a little bit easier just if they don't take a look into what's actually happening um yeah it can definitely be misconstrued that it's like easy youtube and tick tock what's the perfect length for youtube in the perfect length for tick tock for a video ah it depends there's it honestly depends on the creator no yeah it's complicated no yeah because there's there's like there's like you know short form content works and it's short and if it's intriguing it's intriguing but then you have like these videos i don't know like like my friends they started watching these um these uh either it's mukbangs or it's um uh uh makeup videos but they it's like they're telling stories throughout and it's like an hour long video and i'm like and they watch it and i kind of like watching this i'm like oh that's kind of interesting you know so like there's there's all different types of content and i think that you just have to figure out what works for you and that's pretty much it there's no guidelines all right no shortcuts no got it that's pretty much it yeah i know has there been anything what have you found most challenging and this could be for either of you or both of you about building in web 3 and maybe comparing it to things you've done in the past it's volatile um you have to be you have to be prepared and that that's why the gaming angle was so perfect for us because we knew that no matter the volatility we can continue forward with the confidence that we know where the technology is headed but i would say that that's something i would tell tell people you know come in with a long-term plan don't come in trying to get rich quick um it's not how this space works you hear you see the stories and the success stories and it can happen but that's not how you should be coming into it mentally yeah it gets so easy to to have fomo and burn out quickly just trying to chase the the highs and the waves and 100 you will almost certainly come out poorer than you start yeah people people people need to realize you can't chase money you got to chase passion because passion will keep you long-term and that's what everyone that's what every single success story i've seen that's the only reason why they're successful is because they're following their passions and they're just sticking through it no matter what happens and that's just that's just how you gotta go i'll add my spin to that which i think passion can some people are like clearly have a passion and like great and congratulations if that's you but a lot of people i think feel like god i don't what is my passion and so i say follow your curiosity like if you're curious about something just keep going where you feel curious and then it might develop into a passion or if it doesn't follow the next curiosity but you know that's i feel like sometimes more approachable to folks than passion which is intimidating yeah yeah ask questions you know to add to what michael michael touched on this earlier but one of the coolest things about the web3 space is that you can just get in and add value find something that you're curious about or passionate about like you're talking about and go into the community and plug yourself in and start adding value start bringing something to the table and so many people are looking for help to build it in the space it's really unique in that regard you know they're not necessarily looking at your degree they're looking at who adds value and who fits with the ethos of what we're building there's a lot of opportunity out there right now robin maybe let's close we didn't get into your background particularly but would love to hear how you ended up here and and why you're building what you're building yeah my background um was in patenting tech products um but in 2017 i really fell in love with blockchain just because the tech was so you know so disruptive and wide wide range of applications across so many different industries so i started to develop proprietary data data sets in and around the crypto space utilizing social data from twitter reddit um discord and building these data sets and looking for opportunities before they expose themselves um to the market as a whole and is that like a bunch of people are tweeting about this project or like what kind of data exactly so tracking hashtags and hashtags for every single project in the cryptocurrency space and watching the social volume of the chatter it was after gamestop and amc and seeing the power of community and the power of what happened on reddit and the power of people talking about things on social channels that was really what gave me the confidence to take the dive into the space because i saw what that did and i said you know this this means that there could be an opportunity to identify identify opportunities that other people aren't necessarily seeing and so we would track literally the hashtags the hashtags related terms on social channels like twitter and reddit and then aggregate all of the data and use machine learning and algorithms to basically look for patterns and identify opportunities before they would otherwise be seen do you have a biggest win you can flag from doing that like we got into goblin town a week and a half ago man i don't know whatever you know it's funny we we had some massive wins uh chain link was one we got in really really early on um others that you know that don't have like avalanche which we we again you asked about the gaming chains we we've loved avalanche since the beginning because they pivoted from ethan and offered solutions to the problems that were happening over there and it kind of lended themselves really well to the gaming space so we we've been supporters of avalanche for a really long time as well very cool all right well thank you both so much i appreciate you coming on explaining this a bit more i uh you know you're tapping into an interesting area so i'll be curious to see how it plays out in the years to come and i'm trying to learn more about gaming so you know next time we talk i'm going to know even more fire but i appreciate both coming on very much of course thank you so much carly [Music] thank you
