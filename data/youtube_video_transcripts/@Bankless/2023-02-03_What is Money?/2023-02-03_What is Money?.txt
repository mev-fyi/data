what is money I'm gonna pull out a quote from Yuval Noah Harari money is probably the most successful story ever told it has no objective value but then you have these Master storytellers the big Bankers the finance ministers and they come and tell you a very convincing Story look at this piece of paper it's actually worth 10 bananas and that story Works try telling that story to a chimpanzee it won't work I love it it takes a collective group of humans all thinking the same thing about money for a money to actually manifest and if suddenly we all stop viewing a certain piece of paper as money then it ceases to be money
