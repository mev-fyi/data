crypto is exactly where it needs to be right now very much not dead very much alive washing out the excesses very much building things people want to use coiled spring on a path to hyper growth i love that vance what do you mean by crypto is exactly where it needs to be right now yeah so i think one of the bigger opportunities right now is frankly to reflect on what happened over the past two or three years as we're in kind of this secular bull cycle for for crypto and i think one of the learnings that i have at least is you know you could probably separate the bull run into two component parts and the first one was the high conviction rally that was built around d5 and people were using the products for the first time and then the second half of kind of the bull run it felt like a lower conviction rally yeah we just didn't have the requisite product progress and so that time actually made me feel quite nervous about the space just in terms of there was probably going to be some sort of coming downturn and then today crypto has been you know largely crushed but what we have is a lot more rationality a lot more people focusing on things that have real product market fit i have a very long term perspective and i understand that this is where the progress is made and we're just excited to be here
