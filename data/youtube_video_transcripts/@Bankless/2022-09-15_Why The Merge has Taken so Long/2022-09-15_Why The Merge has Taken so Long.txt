so the reason why the merge didn't happen several years ago as far as I've heard is that there was just better designs that were discovered as y'all were exploring the design space and so it must have taken a lot of courage to not hit that deadline of moving to proof of stake the first time under the old algorithms and to iterate towards the better one yeah it's tough when you're simultaneously trying to engineer or something and like get it out the door for user to use while also like performing groundbreaking research on stuff that people haven't done before you know if we if we didn't do any more upgrades for the next 10 years and just thought about it we could come up with some really good designs I'm sure but like you kind of have to find the balance between like what is good enough what is sufficient what is secure enough and what do we know today
