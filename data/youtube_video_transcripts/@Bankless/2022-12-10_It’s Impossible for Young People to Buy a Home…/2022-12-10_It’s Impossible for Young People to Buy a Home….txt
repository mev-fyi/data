millennial generation gen Z how are they going to afford a home we have like rapidly increasing fixed price mortgages and asset prices for the houses really haven't gone that down very much yeah so under right you can see the mortgage rates which to your point mortgage rates are now at about seven percent very high right we haven't seen that since before the global financial crisis but at the same time housing prices have gone up a lot and they haven't really come down that much and buyers can't afford they basically stepped out of the market and you can see that here there's no sales sales are virtually at zero I've heard buyers can't buy because of obvious reasons prices are still too high and mortgage rates are too high sellers also can't sell because they're locked into their super low low rates yeah right so they're fixed so the housing market is just Frozen that's exactly right I think the stalemate is going to continue until the unemployment numbers pick up so it all depends on the jobs Market if you want to really see prices falling on mass you need the labor market to deteriorate
