[Music] hello coordination how you doing i got a great episode today with solar punk girl phoebe tickle who is an imagination activist her work centers on the intersection of web3 and regen and the toolkits of collective imagination which i would basically summarize as what are the possible worlds out there if we expand our awareness from just what we need now out in the temporal plane to what will future generations need and what do the people in our communities nations and worlds need and also including in our awareness what do the different material uh material systems out there need so it's been a really sort of interesting episode to talk with phoebe about imagination technology imagining new worlds and i think that it's a core complementary piece to what we're doing in the regenerative crypto economic space to imagine what kind of worlds are possible what do we want to include in our awareness how do we build impact dials that have positive externalities for the world well it starts with imagining what's possible and iterating towards those worlds it's a really fun episode with phoebe tickle and i hope you enjoy it if you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto

hey or should i say hey hey hey someone's been watching my my talks uh so great to have you here i think that you and i got connected a few months ago and uh really hit it off talking about uh your work as an imagination activist so can you tell me what that is yes for sure so um imagination activists are basically activists powered by the imagination so i believe like one of the biggest problems of our time at the moment is the narrowing and the boxing in of imagination so that folks don't even have a sense of what's not on the table in terms of what kind of lives we need what kind of society we live in um who it's possible to be so it's that realm of the unimaginable that i think is getting smaller and smaller um and it's kind of driven by having been part of extinction rebellion and feeling like part of the reason extinction rebellion petered out was because there was a movement based on despair so a lot of people who are solar punks understand this that we need movements that are also driven by hope and active hope and imagination got it can you see more about extinction rebellion for those of us who aren't familiar with it yes so extinction rebellion was a movement of hundreds of thousands of people um most active i'd say between 2019 and 2020 of like around about that time um founded by a group of founders uh largely in the uk so gail bradbroke um roger hallam a couple others and it was a it was an environmental movement um and had greta as one of the figureheads and um yeah they organized these large-scale rebellions so taking over like trafalgar square and and yeah orchestrating like large um direct actions and so extinction rebellion was kind of a reaction to the negative and your work as an imagination activist is trying to chart a positive path forward and break away from the status quo is that more or less correct i'd say so yeah and it's also driven by the belief that that um the solutions that we are trying to create for for the global problems that we face are being created by a certain way of thinking um so there's almost like a layer underneath of everything that we're doing as activists as innovators as you know technology builders like there are there are scripts that run our ways of thinking which in themselves create the problems so the solutions we create actually end up being the new problems which is especially apparent in technology like new technologies are created and then they create a whole bunch of new problems as well so i'm really interested in how do we shift perception and the way that we think and imagine in that deeper level right and i know that you're the founder of moral imagining can you say more about your work that you that you're doing there yeah so and that that actually uh directly relates to i'd say web three and distributed governance and decentralized organizing so for about uh six years i was really working in the realm of distributed governance that started off by uh running an education company when i was 22 with a couple other folks which we tried to run as a non-hierarchical or decentralized organization um which ended up being a massive mess and way more difficult than i could have imagined which would basically spark my interest in like how do you actually do that like i'd never thought about the fact that there are these different blueprints for the ways that you can run organizations and suddenly that opened up this sense of like oh this is like a sandbox where you know the corporation and the top down pyramid is not the only way and we've got all of this new technology where we can actually run um you know organizations on software so that kind of opened up um a whole bunch of work and getting organized getting involved in something called in spiral which is basically like an organization that uses web 2 software to organize so collective decision making participatory budgeting and so that was a really big part of my last 10 years was working in distributed governance but while i was in that realm i realize that the core thing i'm interested in is how we make decisions and even if we get all of these new mechanisms for making decisions in different ways and making decisions in collective ways if we can't imagine the kinds of futures in the kind of world that we want to live in and if our imaginations are actually narrowed down then it doesn't matter how collective or yeah how many different ways we have to make decisions we won't make decisions that are for the benefit of the planet and the benefit of people yeah your experience there kind of reminds me of oh building a dow and the work that we've done with get coined out i always feel like i'm toggling back and forth between my aperture of awareness being do we build bitcoin grants or do we build the machine that builds bitcoin grants and i always feel like i'm getting gummed up with building the dow when i really want to focus on building bitcoin grants because you don't realize how much you get out of the box with a company you get you get payroll from china you get you get benefits you get all these different sas products and by trying to reinv but by trying to build a dow you have to build all those things from scratch or at least they're service providers that are not as advanced and i'm always stuck between inventing a new way of doing work so that we can do the work versus just kind of yolo doing the work yourself and i'm seeing a parallel there with your work in trying to create imagination but also trying to create a non-hierarchical organization that's doing that you built a non-hierarchical organization in web 2 in the inspiral network can you say what you learned from doing that and and how you're kind of approaching web3 yeah for sure um so i was in spiral already existed when i joined um it was founded in 2010 and i was was also the creator of the software lumio and the the software co-budget as well um so it was interesting because it was sort of like a web 2 experience of a dao so i was already trained in a kind of web 2 dao before i moved into working in web 3 daos and arriving into the web 3 scene and around 20 like late 2017 2018 it became really apparent to me that a lot of the skills and the capacities that this group of humans can inspire about 160 people many of them based in new zealand but essentially a global decentralized network of people working together in an organization um and i have to remind myself that before the pandemic like working on zoom and like working in this distributed way was actually really quite rare like for most people their everyday jobs like most people had never tried zoom had never used uh digital software to coordinate in in a way um so we were you know that experience i felt like at the time i was one of the only people in in the networks that i was part of who was actually making their livelihood off um off being part of this network of people who who i'd never actually met before um so the thing that became really apparent when i when i started um getting involved in dao in around 2018 was that a lot of the skills and the capacities in terms of the soft skills like decentralized leadership and collective decision making and the fact that there are these menus of different ways of making decisions a lot of that seemed to be very absent in the web 3 scene so um i could see a massive need for that i feel like that's being um kind of met quite a lot more now like a lot of like sociocracy and holacracy folks are starting to stream into the web 3 scene which is great and the other thing i felt was massively missing in both the kind of distributed organizing uh you know teal leadership um next gen organization scene and the web 3 scene was the the planet like ecology and and like where is that so i love absolutely love as you know the whole green pill meme i love that this is about like bringing that solo punk green regen um topic into web 3 because i felt like it's really really been missing not just in this area but also in like all of the other distributed horizontal governance worlds as well right yeah absolutely i i'm curious what what you learned it feels like you've kind of been front running this whole decentralized organization thing by doing it in web 2 before web 3 existed what did you learn from lumio and in spiral and and all those years that could possibly be taken forward into web3 such a great question i think my like one of the key learnings was that hierarchy isn't the problem like when you and my friend rich bartlett has written a great article on this which i can dig out and we can include in the show notes so it was really the sense of like hierarchy is being you know is the the demon that needs to be like slayed and actually we need to move to a fully decentralized system and then everything will be fair and like as long as we can just like learn the skills like within the web 2 distributed governance world it was like if we can just learn the skills and the decision making protocols um well enough then we'll be able to like have this harmonic organizing where everything is fair and just and i see the kind of parallel in the web 3c and is like if we could just like solve uh coordination or like decision you know like all of these like protocols if we could get like the perfect voting system and the perfect like ways to solve like the free rider problem like all of this coordination stuff like then we'll we'll have harmony but what became really clear was like actually the problem is not at the level of uh necessarily at the level of organizing and structures and that's what really drove me into working in imagination because what i saw i think there's two ways to approach the same problem like one of them is coordination like decision making structures or encoded um you know basically encoded ways of coordinating on a blockchain or you go and start working at the level of culture and at the level of like human development and so moral imagination is about uh helping build the capacity of building ethics and values and imagination so bringing those two together um but to go back to your original question um what i felt was was the big learning from in spiral was that it's not that hierarchy is the problem it's actually the kind of that's almost like a category error like the issue issue is at the level of what kind of leadership and what kind of organizing you have like is there accountability is there transparency in the system is there a flow of power and you can have really unhealthy decentralized systems where it looks like it's decentralized but actually the power dynamics are really unhealthy and you don't have this cycling of power you don't have transparency i mean within blockchains that's that's less of a problem um but you know you could have like apparent transparency by having a bunch of data that is um available for people to see like you know like in a dao but actually a lot of the really key information of like who who actually makes the decisions who has that like soft influence is hidden so you get this tyranny of structurelessness and there's a great essay like the tyranny of structurelessness is like a probably one of the best things that i ended up um yeah finding within that time it's a it's an essay that lays out that problem um i think i actually you tweeted at one point saying like i'm trying to like learn from decentralized organizations and that was like one of the key things and i think like for anybody who's interested like interviewing like 10 people from distributed organizations about their experiences and their hardships is probably one of the best ways to get um the learning of of how to organize in that way right turning of the structurelessness is canon i think in this space and hopefully those of us who have read it have come across it as a purely intellectual exercise not because we're stuck in a tyranny of the structurelessness somewhere and we're looking to to name it yeah yeah exactly yeah it's humans trying to organize it it seems to be yeah pretty much unavoidable yeah well i'm wondering if you can if we can pull that thread of moral imagining and i wonder if you can take us away from the status quo what kind of worlds could be possible and what tools can our audience out there use in order to imagine what possible futures are plausible or desirable and and and lead us there tell us about moral imagining yeah certainly thank you um so i'd say the two there are many different ways of using imagination and and moral imaginations is a research and design studio to develop those tools especially around collective imagination um i'd say like the two main areas of imagining that that we're developing and have developed to this point are like the first tool is around using imagination to expand the moral circle of concern so when you're thinking about how do we make decisions or who or what is considered in a decision using imagination to actually um expand your perception to look through the eyes of a future generation human like seven generations into the future and actually use that like really radical shift in perception to then make decisions that that look completely different to the ones you would make if you were just in your default mode perception of like you as a human with your family with your friends with your like political ideology so that's like really one of the the vectors that we use imagination to stretch the mind so um looking through the eyes of a future generation human looking through the eyes of a non-human actor so really trying to make that like invisible um the invisible actors who are currently not accounted for within the system like helping those become visible um and helping people also embed within their context and history so using imagination to um bring alive this like very cosmic sense of being a human being that is the result of a long chain of evolution with you know with many different chapters and many different um creatures that have given rise to you being here today so it's also in a sense like religion and like paganism and animism used to do that for us it used to take the atomized human and give us ways of expanding our perception so that the decisions we'd make you know love thy neighbor like these very basic rules were helping like bolster our decision-making and and you know and the weights that we organized as a society so that's one of the major areas that we're really interested in developing imagination that could eventually be part of governance so part of the way we run organizations or part of the way that we make democratic decisions and actually there are a couple of friends of mine who are we're collaborating around like how do you embed this kind of perception into organizations so like how do you bring a river onto the board of an organization and how could that river be given a voice and how could that also be connected with then let's say dividends from the organization going to that river and humans then also coordinating to protect and regenerate the river so these really interesting ways of reconnecting human beings and organizations with the natural world and also bringing that perception in super interesting so that's like a whole bucket of of the imagination world and how that connects to governance and then on the other side um you've got the more uh let's say like default like temporal imagination so how can we expand um our time perceptions like getting this sense of deep time and long term long termism how can we uh you know do that like futures thinking work which can be like strategic foresight or like strategic futures where you actually like you know take um it's almost like expanding trends from the current day so you you pick like key trends or key things that are uh visible in the world today and then you iterate them out like what could that look like in five years and what if you take like 10 of those trends and you iterate all of them out into like 10 years into the future and then you almost like um cross-pollinate them like okay what if organizations you know can have uh rivers or like other illegal persons of nature on the board so that's like one trend that could be possible like in ten years from the future and another one might be like a massive increase in refugees like you kind of iterate out all of these different trends and then multiply them together so you help people really expand their sense of what the future can look like which we're you know like biologically like not not very well wired to be able to do that really like rational exponential thinking like we'll just expand our sense of the present linearly but we find it very difficult to do that exponentially so those are the two kind of buckets to imaginate like collective imagination that i think are super interesting and then there are many different like tools and approaches like narrative work or storytelling or working with artists and and bringing like i'm super interested in the role of artists and governance as well how can artists bring alive uh different imaginaries different actors as i was talking about like how can we bring the unseen and unaccounted for into our decision making amazing so let me just say back to you what i heard and you can tell me tell me if i if i'm if i'm close at all so it sounds like it's about expanding your perception from your ego uh and yourself now in the direction of other people um and then also natural materials and also temporally so forward in time as well which allows you to sort of contain maybe the second order effects of your actions or uh design with a more systems lens is is that a fair summary of of what you said yeah exactly like i think that's a great a great summary yeah and i think it's really that point about the second order um yeah like it's almost like the unintended consequences so how can we make decisions based on an expanded sense of the impacts of those decisions or like yeah thinking in a more systematic way i think that's a great way yeah um summarizing it yeah it's a really interesting exercise because i know that me as a human i have these selfish needs it's almost like the marshmallow test like do i want to eat the marshmallow now or do i want to save it for the future and um you know i'm reminded of the a couple times i've i've messed around with loving kindness meditation i think it's called meta and the whole idea is that you think of other people and you imagine how you love them and then the whole exercise is to expand that circle outwards of your love and even include people that you have conflict with and it's sort of a useful tool i've found on many different levels for creating empathy with other people but also especially those that you disagree with realizing that they have their own limited perspective and it's it's a coordination failure it's moloch when we have a disagreement it's not that they're my enemy and so i i don't know if you've ever played with with meta or lovingkindness meditation but that's been my experience that i'm coming at this with and i found it to be an interesting exercise in expanding awareness yeah i think that's a great um great example and obviously buddhism has got like you know 2000 years of developing these psycho spiritual technologies um and and you know you can imagine like governance systems in the future where it's necessary to do like a meta exercise before entering yeah decision-making process yeah yeah and i'm basically just saying that the imagination is is a really powerful tool to do that kind of perception shift and that if we can decide like what kind of world do we want to live in and i guess this touches on solar punk as well like do we value non-human beings yes like should they be valued you know should all life be valued on the same level if yes then we should find ways to actually account for that and i think it's interesting as well the way that you can start to imagine like you know a piece of land or a river owning itself like there's this intersection as well between the imagination and technology where you could really start to imagine like these systems that help bolster up and scaffold these non-human actors being involved being given rights being given like decision-making power yeah that's really interesting it's almost like you're creating sovereignty for non-human actors when you start to build a connector for a river or for a meadow to be represented with their rights in the financ in the open source

positive externalities and it feels like what you're talking about with imagination tech right here is a way of imagining or sort of understanding and mapping out the different positive or negative externalities that our actions have on on these different systems and impact else this feels like a core money lego or like a core technology lego for building more regenerative crypto economic system yeah i think 100 i think imagination is like you know it's a public good and it's part of it's part of the the as you say the lego blocks of these more regenerative governance and economic systems for sure um i think i'd say like largely my work sits in two buckets like one is helping people expand imagination and also like i'm very passionate about increasing the the global commons of imagined worlds like i really believe that like as a kid coming into the world you should just the same way there are seed banks or encyclopedias you should be able to look into these these like seed banks of alternative worlds and alternative futures so that you could just have a sense of like this reality is not the only reality that could exist like it could be so different and just having that sense i think is like that's the core of being an imagination activist so that's like one one bucket and the second bucket is okay once you've imagined those different worlds like how do you learn the skills to actually bring it into reality and so like educating people and that that was the essence of this course that i ran with somebody called steven reed the tools for regenerative renaissance like how people don't even realize that there are actually like huge um like so many ways of doing like regenerative agriculture like all of these different methods and tools and practices like people just don't realize that they're there so you can imagine these better futures but you might just not know how do you actually build the skills how could you and your community upskill in these these different capacities and tools and skills and i think crypto and and web 3 is is definitely part of that and i guess the interesting thing for me around the green pill meme and i guess like a little bit of a provocation is is what i see is and i'd love to kind of flip it back to you kevin that you know like the green pill meme is kind of within the web 3 world so it's like web 3 is is like the the um almost like the imagination opener and then the green pill is like okay but regen web 3. and i guess my provocation would be like regen is like the the kind of umbrella and web 3 is like one tool within like many different tools and like people kind of enter like i think that a lot of people get this like psychedelic like wake up moment of like oh my god like we can create a new society in a new world like by being introduced to web three um i wonder whether whether it's like how do you move from that to then like oh but there's also regenerative agriculture and like there's also um yeah like regenerative like cooperative organizations or like all of these different ways that there are to join the region movement um and also like how convinced are you that web 3 is the solution to all of our problems that's my that's like that the question that's really on my mind yeah well it's fun to have someone as a guest on the podcast who flips the script back on me i'll take a swing at that um and that's it uh so i believe that there are many different forms of capital we just had greg landa on the on the podcast he talked about the eight forms of capital intellectual material living spiritual social wish i could name them all but i think i got close and and the the opportunity that i see is that web3 which is the internet of money is uh the biggest lever that we have or one of the biggest levers that we have because there's a two trillion dollar financial system and finance interoperates with all of those different types of capital and so what we're doing here with the green pill podcast for those of us who are skilled at reading between the lines is trying to create a shelling point for the people who want to use web3 to create more regenerative systems and i see it as one of the biggest leverage points in the world and this is maybe one of my beliefs that could be unpacked because i believe that the old financial system is not serving us in a world in which we've got global coordination problems and we've got global existential risk we need a global coordination substrate that actually can be that lever through which the more regenerative system is built and so i think for me it the tldr of me answering your question is that it's a yes and we need to build a financial system that uh is aware of the global commons of imagined worlds your words uh and is able to manage the externalities to uh future generations to all of these different different living systems and to humanity to expand out it's to expand out and able to to regenerate those things and i don't think the existing system is doing it so um i think that it's a yes and with with the other systems that that you that you mentioned is that fair yeah i i think that that is fair i think we're yeah what you're saying is like it currently it's the best lever that that you can see to do that on a global scale like that global level coordination and i guess yeah what i'm hearing as well is like there might be folks especially like gen z folks like entering web 3 and getting like super excited and what the green pill is about it's like yes it's really exciting but it's not enough like on its own it's like what do we do what are we using it for which i love and i think is is really yeah great i've seen an arc in this space where people get in the space because they want to get rich or they want to be able to quit their jobs and work on what they actually care about and you know the money is the first thing that captures them it brings them in the space but then they realize all the web 3 values in the community and it's at that point like the phase two where i think dropping the green pill is the most poignant because they understand the tech and now they're like oh wait i can use this for creating a better world instead of having to escape the world and create my own little private utopia and so that's the point in which we're trying to hit hit the listeners and and again it's it's not my agenda that i'm hitting with them with i'm trying to create a channel for greater combinations of strength and intelligence to come together so what would you say to someone who's been through that phase two okay they've been green pilled what are the causes that they should get involved with uh what is the imagination technology that they should hit up in order to uh in order to scale up to build this new world i love that i love that question so i'm biased but i think you should you know you should join a imagination circle like a circle of people that you actually regularly do these collective imagination practices and um i am doing my very best to create yeah and with others like a team of others to create the resources and like open source blueprints and practices for folks to be able to do that stuff and i think like seeing you know dows and and communities and collectives bubble up where people are doing that imagination work together because imagination is a muscle and collective imagination is a muscle that we're not used to flexing um and then i think like the other piece is there is so much like exciting uh work to be done around like local um local regenerative action like connect to the place that you live or place you know fi wherever you care about like wherever you live wherever you're based like i think one of the dangers of the web 3 world is creating this like virtual layer of humans who go from like conference to conference and fly around the world and like i would you know i've experienced that like back in 2018 that sense of like my community and my network is this like amorphous global virtual citizenship where we're like against nations and believe that we're going to create this like floating non-nation like citizenship situation i just think like we need to root into the places that you know that actually need that regeneration and you know for as many hours that you spend on like slack and discord in these communities and organizing like go and spend an hour out out on the land and like do that regeneration like learn about also like where where um you know learn about your local csa like community supported agriculture like there are so many technologies and and like organizing patterns and like cooperatives and all these ways that people like us have been trying to create a better world like before the age of the internet before web 3 like it's all happening and there are all these different ways of being involved so i think it's like as you say yes and like i think it's super exciting like these you know the potential of these currencies and and like taos and different ways of coordinating globally but how do we balance that out with the local as well um i think that's really key and actually i'm like part of a couple projects like a project with reiki uh cordon from seeds where we're creating what's called a regenerator a regen civics incubator like an incubator for um local community eco village uh like local regen civics projects that want to like upscale and build capacity to be able to multiply and and create these like blueprints and tools and education platform um capacities to to yeah to multiply around the world so i think we just need to balance out that global virtual layer with the local regenerative community building layer i would say yeah i think that that's that's a a really great way of staying grounded is being involved in your local community whereas you know there's so much global sort of disembodied game theory that happens with the in the global system and sometimes it's just nice to get outside and get in the sun and work in your local community uh so so i love that um i i guess you know i'm wondering uh there's a there's a couple things in my notes here that they're just kind of like memes that stuck out at me as i was doing my research on you uh a couple a couple things that i wrote down here is uh people could tool up as as they wake up uh basically building uh global commons of imagined worlds a toolkit of collective imagination i'm curious you know as i rattle off these memes to you what kind of sticks out to you as as the most important next thing to discuss um i think we've already covered a lot of wake up wake up to tula those are like the two yeah like that's what i'm working on at the moment i'm building an organization that is going to really focus on those two buckets so like moral imaginations exist as its design and research studio but there's an organization now that will be focusing on that like scaling of the collective imagining and like the collectively waking up and the tooling up i think we kind of covered that um and if anyone's interested like please hit me up on twitter solarpunkgirl um so the underscore girl and yeah i mean we've covered imagination commons imagination toolkit um i mean what what kind of questions do you have like i guess this is yeah is this imagination stuff like totally new are you like you know is this have you already been um i mean everybody obviously everybody is participating and imagining and if you read sci-fi or like yeah like creative there are many creative ways of being part of like a global imagination movement but um yeah what stands out to you yeah well i i do think that one of the things that i think that is so interesting about what you're doing is that it's sort of imagining new world i almost i almost feel like we're venturing out into the fog of war and i don't know what's out there until i kind of stumble upon it so kind of stumbling around in the darkness here but but maybe you could light my path and tell me what are the the neatest ideas that you've landed upon about what the world could be that that people may not be aware of like i'm looking for sort of tangible examples of of what the world could be that that sort of because they're visceral and they're they're examples of what you've discovered might sort of uh wet people's appetites to get into imagination technology so what what are the what are sort of the neatest imaginations that you've come up with in your time working on this interesting um i i'm particularly interested in this kind of interspecies justice like i think it's always fascinating when people come up with like you know some really wacky wacky stuff around like a guild of pigeons who you know like revolt against like all of the like spikes that exist on our buildings that like you know kill pigeons or you know like some of it is pretty comical but i think like that's the point it's like to to be able to expand out that's that even just that perspective of like who has rights who has power who can who can make decisions i i always find that like super inspiring um because it's just so far from from where we're at now like we're existing in this like totally anthropomorphic world where actually like we've spent thousands of years like killing off any species that doesn't either like directly feed us or directly feed the species that feed us and it's like kind of extraordinary when you think about it like i think in 100 years like i i'm super interested in how we'll view the kind of species violence that we're we're doing right now like would it be the equivalent of like slavery 100 years ago so like thinking about the things that we look back to a hundred years ago and think like wow that is like so wrong like how could we ever do that what's the equivalent of those things now like i think that's a very interesting exercise to go through um like a lot of vegans will like will also say this like we'll look back on like the the violence against um against cows and like factory farming and yeah it's just it's seeing those things that are like right in front of our eyes but we've just never seen it in that way i think that's the really interesting thing and i think i think a really key turning point was when i realized that i think this this is a very um just key pattern that that we have basically as human beings like attempted to destroy like every single species plant species um that doesn't directly feed our food so like grass like we've basically like plastered the whole globe in grass because that's what our food eats and it's like that just having that perspective of like wow like it really shifts the sense of like human being's um role and and like what what kind of role and what kind of actor we we have like decided to be on this planet um going directly against like nature's most core um resilience pattern which is diversity like diversity and pluralism like we've just completely uh you know it's kind of like the the equivalent of like the laws of physics but in terms of like nature and survival and like that's right part of why we're facing you know existential risk and like massive species destruction so i think like one that's been like a huge realization that's opened up to me from the imagination work so i think rather than like really specific worlds of the future like oh it'll you know you can come up with like all sorts of really like fantastical um yeah technology or like the way that we'll be work like working with data or like very dystopian futures like it's not just utopian i think a lot of this imagining work like comes up with like very dystopian uh situations like i think the really interesting thing is like what they open up in terms of like the way we see the world today like that's that's the interesting thing for me yeah that's so interesting i think that there's probably so many possible worlds out there both dystopian and utopian fragile and anti-fragile that can be imagined when you have imagination technology um is there anything oh good i was just going to add that like also there's many you know it also opens your eyes to the fact that there are many worlds existing today which is obvious like obvious to some people but really realizing that um you know we live in a world of many worlds like we think we think that there's just one world but actually like you know as william gibson says like you know the or it's like a play on that on the william gibson quote like the apocalypse is already here it's just not evenly distributed so when we say like oh my god apocalypse is coming like loads of people in the world today would say like oh that's been my reality for like the last 50 years but yeah that's what i was gonna add wow um is there anything that i didn't ask that you want to tell the audience before we wrap up i think one of the ways that we met was when i tweeted recently about running a web three um like a course on web3 and crypto for regen and culture folks like so that might yeah because i i live in this like interesting intersection of different networks where like one half of my twitter is like web three crypto people and the other half is like region culture people who have like no overlap with the other half so it feels like very schizophrenic so i'm i'm super excited about that developing a course that really really is for the people who have like zero experience zero understanding of web 3 and crypto because i i often get um approached by by people in in my network on that regen side where they're just like i get this sense that crypto is like really bad for the planet but like i don't fully like have the understanding of all of it and like dows and what are these things and i just think like even if the sole purpose of doing you know like running courses in education for folks in that in that sphere on web 3 and crypto is just so that they can have better criticisms i feel like that's really good for us in the web 3 space because then you can actually have the critical conversations and like recognize as well that web 3 is like so in its infancy like right now like yeah i really believe that we're like right at the very beginning and like you know a lot of people will say like yeah like web 3 is here or like it's all it's all here now like i really think like a lot of it doesn't even fully work like we're just at the beginning so we really need like the cultural like sociologists like political science you know democracy activists like all of those folks who've got all that experience like we need them in the space actually like understanding what what yeah the technicals the technicalities like all of that stuff so that we can actually like develop something that is better even if it's like a lot of criticism right yeah i just feel like there's this real when our powers combine moment with regen circles that you traffic in in the web 3 circles that maybe this the audience of this podcast are a little bit more involved in and i'm curious to see how those things clash but also what kind of synergies are created between those two communities as as we push forward and um i think you're really at the epicenter of both of those things so if people in in our audience want to get involved in imagination technology or any of the work that they're doing where can they find you online so like uh twitter handlers solarpunk underscore girl or moraleimaginations.com like get in touch sign up to our newsletter and that you know i'll also be emailing out about this new organization that will be expanding that work so yeah we'd love to hear from anyone amazing we'll put those links in the show notes anything else i should that you want to add before we before we end the episode no i just just love the green pill i think it's awesome like yeah much needed much needed meme and uh yeah it's been great to chat thanks for having me yeah thanks so much for for coming great to have you [Music] you
