my skill set is knowing everyone and knowing everything about every project and if you try and put me into a box and say that i can only work on this parameter of work it's never gonna work for me because my skill set is being everywhere welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with cooper turley and cooper and i have a pretty similar timeline for when we got into crypto we were both at the eth denver 2018 conference and that conference was pretty i think impactful for for both of us it's funny that we didn't actually meet there and cooper tells a story of learning how to grind through the bear market and overall learning how to grind inside of the crypto industry and the fruits that can be born out of grinding and so i think there's a lot of lessons that can be learned here with just getting a grasp over one's mental functioning mental mental abilities cooper is a big fan of of mindfulness and meditation and then using that to just funnel energy into building and just contributing value cooper also tells a story of rather than building something in specific and doubling down on one specific project cooper spreads himself horizontally over a large number of projects and that's enabled him to be a great connector of many many people and just come to know a lot of people we also get into his move towards la and helping grow and build out the crypto scene in la which is a very unique and different crypto scene than anywhere else that we've seen and very emblematic of where we are with nfts and culture coming into crypto and cooper is definitely leading that uh effort for sure uh so let's go ahead and get right into our conversation with cooper turley we recorded this in person at mediverso uh so hence the kind of echoey conference room in a hotel so sorry about that uh but i think you guys will enjoy this conversation no matter what so let's go ahead and get right into it but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitram is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitram and arbitrom's defy and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of decentralization and security if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building your application on arbitron if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps or nft projects building on arbitrary many of your favorite apps are already live with many more coming over soon you can find these apps at portal.arbitrom.one and you can bridge your assets over to arbitrom using bridge.arbitrum.com in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswapgrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless what's up cube hey man it's gone i'm doing well dude we're uh in puerto rico and it's been a fantastic time it has been a fantastic time it's the end of the conference circuit so we're not with a bang here yeah the end of the conference right i mean for 2021 i think so no more conferences in 2021 yeah i got to go back home for for people that are following you around they might think that you work at conferences basically yeah i pretty much do it this way you know i think it's a part of the game it's just being present at all the events that people are at mm-hmm and i think that's something that you are uniquely what your unique contribution to crypto is like you are the guy that's there yeah you're the guy that's present uh i want to i definitely want to end there but let's just go ahead and do the casual all the way back uh where'd you grow up grew up in philadelphia outside the city i grew up playing a lot of sports a lot of video games i was really into collecting pokemon cards actually and so back in high school i started selling pokemon cards on ebay got a really big knack for music at the time it was really into curation finding early acts finding you know new collections and uh you know i was graduating high school and i kind of wanted to do something new a lot of my friends were going to state schools and getting ready to join a frat and whatnot but i kind of had this passion for music and sort of creative activities and that brought me out to colorado where i went to school and just got a lot deeper into the music game when you were collecting everyone kind of collected pokemon cards as a kid but with like the other trends or fads or things that you were into was that like you you picked those out yourself you discovered that yourself or was it like things that other people were doing how did you curate your own interests yeah it was a close friend group of mine um me and my friends had a lot of yu-gi-oh cards growing up but i think the unlock for me was realizing you could buy other people's collections on ebay i was like oh it's not only me and my collection in my basement it's everyone's collection in their basement around the world and a lot of the times people wouldn't think about it they would just wholesale be like i have 10 000 cards they don't want to sort through them uh starts at 99 cents go ahead you know and there was this game to be played of finding the best collection you know knowing which cards were like hidden in that one corner of the photo that were worth like 20 which was a big card and then kind of taking a guess on it and so you would go wholesale buy a whole collection for 400 break it down in its parts have a great reputation on ebay lists each card individually with like name price condition of the card series it's from and uh just getting to understand the game became really fun because when you're doing it with friends it was very easy to collect it and you know just have a fun time recording it basically so i think people listening to that will be like oh yeah he's an nft guy and you are an nft guy but you were in crypto well before nfts too so i think that's kind of interesting that you have like a very like nft conducive background totally but you got into crypto and before nfts are really what they are today yeah i'd say my first tournament nfts was runescape you know it's a game that i got very good at i had a really awesome inventory out of santa hat i was grinding fishing all the time i had like billions and billions of gold and was just doing all these fun games that were essentially nfts you know obviously you couldn't export i've never done earned a dollar for my runescape account but that act of kind of grinding and collecting rare items in a digital game was always fascinating to me dude runescape was where i learned farming i farmed the uh like the essence things that you had to turn into spells and like i was like i was a warrior guy but i did so i didn't use any of those stuff but i had to farm that stuff because other people had to buy them yeah and that's kind of what we're seeing now with axiomfinity which is kind of interesting yeah and it's multifaceted i mean runescape you had combat which you could train you had like you know major you could train you could do prayer and then there's like herb lord and there was obviously fishing and wood cutting and fire making and sort of even like later as the game developed they had like hunter and stuff like that so the cool part about that game is you go so deep into one character's story arc it wasn't just like main objective like play this one storyline and then just like finish the game just infinite you know design space which is what i think we're seeing with nfts where entities is a sector is so big there's so many ways you can go into you go into music nfts you go into photo nfts you can do pfps you know i think what we're seeing now is regardless of what skills that you have there's really room for you to grow and develop your skills yeah i think people need to be reminded more and more and more that nfts is just a token format like it's just a format like it's up to you like people's like oh yeah i do nfts as in like it's a profile picture nft or an art nfc but like no no no like that's just like what we're talking about entities right now like it goes off in every single direction totally another one that just came to mind for me was uh call of duty and how you can do prestiging and get gold guns yeah i think that's an interesting example of nfts where it was like play to earn but in like a very like uh social capital type way when you had gold guns it was like you were just legit like they had no financial value you could never trade them or anything like that when you saw someone with the gold gun especially when the games came out you know it was a race to get to that first gold gun i would go to gamestop with my friends at midnight on the release parties and do completely degenerate stuff but i remember such a social experience to be like get the game go home and then you just see who played the most the next day my friends would skip school and then you wake up how are you first prestige just gave me about 24 hours ago you know it was just a grind to just you know better off your friends and i think that's a lot of what we see in crypto today cooper i think a lot of people will know you as a grinder so when when did you learn to grind was it something that you were born with or like what was your first grinding experience sports 100 my dad was always my coach growing up and so he instilled really hard discipline around like training and work ethic and so starting back as early as uh football you know like fifth grade or something like that my team ended up going to disney world and i was the quarterback of that team and so leading up to that season we were training every single day outside doing sprints and ladders and whatnot baseball little league i was always going to the bounding cages doing like ground balls pitching workshops you know and then basketball in high school was the main sport that i stuck with and so i'd be shooting in the gym every single day doing two hour sessions got an amazing jump shot you know would do different routines with people on my team and i know i just kind of learned that there's there's time that you put in where other people aren't watching and i think that's what really like develops your skills and makes you go that extra mile and me being able to have that experience from something like competitive sports to be able to take that and go to that next level and really be able to demonstrate that in a public setting was really fascinating to me because i love this idea of playing with my friends and everyone's like i'm not the most athletic guy you know i'm pretty skinny it's like i'm not super fast like i don't have like great athletic abilities but i just work hard you know and i think what i learned is the harder that you work at a specific skill irregardless of what it is if you put in enough time into it you're gonna get good at it so it just taught me that there's beauty in being bad at something because the more that you work on it you're gonna get better and when you are going through those early steps of learning something it's okay to be terrible at it because you know that so long as you keep putting in time and effort there's a high likelihood you're going to be pretty good at eventually the pretty good work while no one's watching i really like that line uh what really matters in my mind for people that engage in that sort of behaviors they have to have this internal dialogue because like you people can grind and get good at sports and like if you practice anything you'll get better at it but like if you don't have the internal motivation to do that in the first place like then you're actually not gonna make it right yeah so like you use clearly you can grind and clearly that you're you're talking about um just like again creating a work ethic but why like why do what motivates you do you want do you just like to be people or you're competitive or just like what's up do you just like performance like why do you why do you grind i want to be the best yeah you know everything that i do yeah i think um i'm really driven by people that care a lot about what they work on and what they do and i think that it's less about beating other people i am competitive in what i do but i think it's about being the best version of myself i think there's something that i'm passionate about i want to perform at the highest ability of whatever that is so like when you're when you're taking uh you know free throws and you you miss a little bit more than average you're like oh i could have done better like i have my own personal record that i could be that's what you're you're benchmarking to against yourself yeah in high school i was 93 out of 100 free throws i was gonna do three thousand by 190 i'd be really really pissed nice yeah uh was that a property a character that you were just born with characteristic i think that i grew into it i think um you know like going back to the earliest memories i have like playing sports i was always good at like soccer like indoor soccer and stuff like that but i think it wasn't until i started to be like social systems in schools that i kind of formed an identity around being good at sports and that just being part of like my identity i think when i realized that that was part of my identity i was like if this is gonna be what i'm known for i might as well be good at it and i think from there just kind of developed what i'm really thankful for is in high school you know middle school and early high school was sort of like the installing of grinding but then towards the end of high school i was still practicing every day but i started to have more creative friends coming to my life so the ones that i was playing video games with the ones that i was trading pokemon cards with and eventually going to concerts with and that balance of like during the mornings on in the gym like in middle school i would go to my middle school gym before school started it was like six in the morning i'd be shooting hoops before school started for 20 minutes and then school would start and i'd go to class sweating and then in high school i would come out of that and um had friends that we could just go to concerts with and just do fun stuff and i think that that balancing act of realizing like okay it's okay to not be grinding all the time and find somebody you're really passionate about and enjoy i think that that was a great way to balance both of those uh both of those lives that i was living at the time do you remember your first like a dopamine hit when you were like we're trying to get into grinding on something and you're like yes that was awesome like yeah i want more of that what was your first moment like that my most memorable one was hitting a home run in the all-star game in baseball and where it was like in the all-star game too nice like all the best people in the league and just like ripped it cause i was having just a really fun time with my friends you're all there it's very social my friend had a new bat that i never used before and i just like picked it up and i was like this thing's pretty sick you know and then came out and just  cranked one like absolutely cranked such an electric feeling i'd say baseball one that had the most memories i remember we were in uh the playoffs one year for districts and we were playing the team that ended up going on to lilly world series it was the year prior to that and they had their best best pitcher playing and um cranked a home run off of that one of my best friends from high school growing up he was pitching he was this incredible pitcher ended up being the quarterback at harvard and i hit him run off of him and it was just these kind of examples were like i was put in a position where i don't think i was expected to perform as well as i did but then something just happened and like that extra that extra grind you know it was like an incredible pitcher just throwing darts and it was like everyone was striking out and then i just like pray and i'm just like i'm just gonna swing on this one what's gonna happen just knock out of the parking lots like what the hell like this small puny kid just like banging out home runs like how's it even possible you know like those moments to me were the ones that uh just stuck with me very very much i'm sure there were hours of batting cage time behind that home run huh yeah 100 and it was when no one was there like bless my dad because he would go with me like hours every day and just like allow me to hit as much as i wanted you know buckets and buckets of balls we'd pick them all up run it back again and uh it was just fun you know it's just fun when i'd be able to bring people with me to do it some people like complaining they wouldn't be there and then i think it was good seeing like who really cared like who was my age like 10 to 15 but wanting to be spending hours of their free time in a summer day going and practicing and getting better rather than just like doing some other stuff and just blowing time off is this genetic at all is this a property of characteristics that your parents have too my dad was a professional tennis player so yeah okay all right so it definitely runs in the family at least a little bit you went to uh you went to college in denver yep yeah what was that like it was fantastic that was my music chapter in my life so like i said end of my high school career i was getting more into music i was captain of my varsity basketball team but like the whole time i was playing basketball i was also developing a friend group in music so we were going to festivals we were going to shows in the city i was going to see like aviciis zed's dead you know a bunch of these like early edm acts and just having such a fun time like on the side of sports because my sports friends were my sports friends and i had my music friends with my music friends and uh that's why i kind of got more into like my creative self and so we were going to these shows and like talking about like art and you know just music and just kind of getting into a different culture and when i heard about colorado and specifically this venue called red rocks i got really excited about it i went out to colorado went to a show for an artist named pretty lights just had this awesome awesome experience there and i was like there was none of my friends going to colorado not a single one of my close friends and i was like you know what like i want to change a pace like i don't know what it is but something there just feels right to me and so i just full-on sent it out there and just totally carved out this new identity for myself around music and sort of being in that scene uh how did sports come with you to college or did you kind of just you know do it as a on the side as a hobby just as a hobby i would go to the rec center in bowl and uh my rec team won like one of the championships and i was just so good my freshman year of college because i kept growing i was like six six foot six foot and one six with two my senior year of you're still growing in college yeah i got to be like six five my freshman year of college and so i was off the backboard dunks like just like doing insane stuff you know and so like when i play rec with like everyone there was super super fun uh what did you go to what did you major in i majored in music business i started in accounting my mom's an accountant and i loved um math like i think it's very fascinating to me so accounting was something that i was very purposefully inspired by like it seemed like a great career choice you know obviously cpa that pays well it's a very stable career and so i started out in the business school in colorado boulder as i spent a couple years there i kind of realized like i'm way more driven by this creative side of my life and so i ended up transferring to music business degree which i graduated with from denver what year what was the year that you swapped majors i'd say my sophomore junior year probably my junior year yeah cause i remember the first two year um got really into smoking weed got my med card and just got very into that world like i had an operation with my friends and we were learning how to grow and stuff like that and then i was going to shows on the side and just like very much in this like hippie crypt or you know like weed world that was like all this colorado vibe and so um it took me a year to really find like balance in that because i came fresh out of like varsity basketball team like grind every day like pretty straight edge didn't really do that much stuff to like go to colorado like smoking weed every day and like i am completely sober now i don't do any drugs i don't drink but that period of my life it was like every day and it was very social experience i think that was the takeaway from it is like i was meeting so many new people i kind of came to this new school and i realized no one knows anyone this is all blank slate like how do i meet the most people possible i was like oh wait everyone in colorado loves to smoke weed and so i got my med car and just became the guy to hang out with and he wanted to smoke and so they'd have like 10 people come to my house we'd do these like big circles had like this volcano vape and just go like super deep on like all this stuff and like great i don't remember 99 of what those conversations were but i think a lot of my social skills that i have today and being able to meet new people are largely attributed to me being comfortable going into new environments and just completely chilling out with people i'd never met before on a very deep level interesting how did you get your grind fix if you kind of uh put sports not not completely down but kind of de-prioritize sports did your grind grind fix go somewhere else yeah it definitely did i think um i think my grind fix at that time was just meeting as many people as possible and becoming one with myself spiritually i got into meditation at the time i started to meet a lot more people i started to think a lot more about like myself and my standing in the world and whereas my grind phase in high school was very much i want to be the best at this specific sport my grind phase in college was like i want to be the best version of myself and so i would wake up every morning feeling fantastic i was practicing meditation i was doing a lot of hikes and getting out into the wilderness i was stargazing and going to see shooting stars and stuff like that and i think i just got to see a lot more of the world from that side of things whereas like physically i performed well in my life at one point spiritually i want to work on myself i want to understand what it means to be one in touch with myself like understand my feelings understand how to connect with other people and just get to have a better relationship with myself in the world was this something that you felt was lacking or was it something that you just wanted to optimize for regardless i think everyone's lacking it you know i think that it takes a very specific type of focus to recognize that spirituality is important in your life and granted that does come from a place of often taking drugs to get to that point but i think that for a lot of people they're not very awake you know like i think they go about their day-to-day but they're not in touch with how they feel about themselves and how they think they just are on autopilot all the time and that point in my life was like i want to understand why i'm thinking the way that i am and i want to understand why i'm feeling the way i am and i want to understand why things set me off in the way that they do and through that process i just got to a point of being very comfortable with who i was and through that i was able to just make a lot of friends because i had this very vibrant energy to myself and was very excited about sharing that with the world interesting um so having a goal of just being in tune with yourself is is fantastic but also it's kind of that's kind of like having a goal of being happy you can't actually have the goal to be happy you can't go straight for happiness you have to like enjoy the guitar and then get good at the guitar and the guitar makes you happy so after after the plan was to become closer to yourself what was that was that a means to an end for something or was there anything else at the time that you were thinking about while you were on a search to understand coop i think that's a great way of putting it i don't think i was striving to be happy i was aiming to be present and by being present i was often very happy you know especially going to these shows i developed a crew of people that were always going to the same concerts and i would see them at these shows and i would go and dance for like hours on end and have really intimate connections with the artists and the musicians and started to really understand their career and the culture behind it and i think my you know as i said earlier in the conversation i want to be the best at what i do and at that point in time it was music as a topic and music as a topic meant finding the best artist early on in their career and so for me going to five concerts a week and getting to know everyone in that scene and all the up and coming artists that was my end state it's like i want to be able to find all the best music as soon as possible and be known as the guy that always says the best taste of music how has focusing on um just identifying yourself for your own personal understanding of who you are how has that impacted how you um uh meet and understand other people it's taught me a lot of empathy you know i think i'm able to just like really connect with anyone on a very deep level i love the saying you should treat the ceo the same way that you treat the janitor so regardless of who i'm talking to whether or not someone offered to me i want to be very present in those conversations when people are acting in certain ways or as i'm building longer relationships it's allowed me to just really see them for who they are very quickly and so as i'm making decisions about how to spend time with them or products to work on i think i'm able to delegate focus and attention very well because i understand kind of what drives people and sort of what they're good at and what they might need some help with i'm gonna how what about concentration how's concentration with you how's that look like it's amazing honestly i mean meditation is literally the reason why i'm able to stay so focused on what i do um started about five years ago i've missed five days over the course of five years i meditate twice a day at this point and that pair of sobriety i feel more focused than i ever have in my life uh what's how long what's the meditation look like for you 20 minutes sitting on a pillow just thinking yeah basically lack of thinking yeah lack of thinking thinking about thinking i think is the way to put it metacognition yeah i would say around 10 to 15 minutes is where it generally ends up i have a playlist called peaceful meditation on spotify throw that on shuffle sit there and just kind of feel myself you know think about the thoughts that i'm thinking about think about um what i have on the plate for that day often think about a pretty good tweet if i'm being honest the tweet's always gone yeah it's actually funny most of my meditations these days i'll have one kind of core topic that's like in my head and throughout the course of meditation i'll have like the crafted words in place that i come out of it and just bang and just rip it right away but more generally i would say yeah the goal of it is just to recognize that i'm thinking and recognize that i need to just be centered in my thoughts and so even if i am having thoughts whatever they are it's okay to have those and just make sure it's coming from a point of like relaxation you know concentration and sort of like self-fulfillment and from there i think i'm able to operate at a pretty high level i want the listeners to notice that cooper speaks quickly and never really ums or oz and never pauses to think and is very surgical in what he says and i'm going to go ahead and guess that this is a result of that 110 yeah so when you were a kid before you were meditating was were you not able to speak in this fashion i think i've gotten better at it through practice you know doing these podcasts and writing helped me a lot with that you know writing really helped me distill my thoughts into very clear and concise thoughts and as i've started to go from writing to speaking i think those two things are directly correlated but i would say more broadly you know my uh my meditation has been the focal point for everything that i've done in my career so far you know i know it's a really small thing to pick up but i'm a very big fan of this book called atomic habits that talks about instilling very very powerful habits in your life and even before i read that book this was five years ago the fact that i found meditation as a focus for me to do every single day regardless of where i am in the world i've traveled so many places in the world and even if i'm at a hostel with 30 people i will make sure the very first thing i do after i get a shower in the morning it's papa medi you know get in there for 10 to 15 minutes yeah get focused you guys all my friends i've traveled with they're like all right you ready to go for that i'm like no no i got it i gotta give my meditation and it's like a thing and if i don't have one you could start to see if i get a tiny bit neurotic and so i'm like yeah i need to need to have this every single day in my life okay so every morning after you shower you one one bed yep one bed and then another one later in the day yeah later at night so basically my call every day looks like waking up getting a shower meditating and then doing calls from about let's call it 9 30 until six basically 30 minutes back to back maybe a gap in between as i start to notice that i'm slipping a little bit my mental focus i won't generally grab a bite to eat something really really light like a smoothie or an acetate bowl as i'm sure you've seen them all yeah and then uh meditating get into deep work you know i think that second shift is really important because i think for a lot of us we tap out around that like five to six hour and then we just kind of go do something else during the night but i see that second shift as the time to really like go that extra mile and so for me i don't spend it talking to people on back-to-back calls that's when i do my deep work so i do my writing i do a lot of the project management i do a lot of governance i do a lot of things that are digital first so like being in discords and stuff like that i really try and separate my time from active interactions and talks to more like deep work kind of text-based work and anything that is on the computer when did you get into crypto 2017 yeah and you were in college at the time right yeah i was going through my senior of college one of my professors had a class about future music and he started talking about something called smart contracts and at this point i don't know why the hell this was in the itinerary i don't know why i was talking about it but he was like yeah there's this cool stuff for the listeners that don't know music royalty system is very long right now if i play your track on spotify today you're gonna see a third of a penny in six months from now and so when he talked to me about this technology where you got paid in real time directly to the artist with no middlemen in the middle made a lot of sense to me you know i had been exposed to bitcoin earlier on from like different stuff on the internet we'll say and um you know this was a way for me to advance that thinking to something more practical and so as i started to look into this thing of crypto i saw a new shiny object to curate same way that i saw pokemon cards same way that i saw music i was like crypto here's a new sector not a lot of people are talking about it there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of different information to shuffle through when i see that as a surface area i get really excited about it and so i started from a lens of like music got me curious about this but very quickly i was reading every white paper that there was for every project i was on ico drops every single day and just fully in the mix and it was a game it was a culture and i think online you could find that people were just really excited about finding the next hot project i think the thing that really clicked for me is unlike runescape or unlike you know music where there was social capital associated with it there was real financial value to be earned here and so that curation could go a level above where you could actually make real value and real money off of the creation that you did i think that's why i just ended up diving in so fast becoming so consumed with it so quickly so after you realize that there's something here with crypto a lot of people come into crypto and they're like oh i can make a bunch of money um some people move on from that and then they think about other things but most people start there is that where you were you were at the very like genesis of your cryptocurrency number really really high yeah i think um i was graduating college i had a music business degree that degree was setting me up to go into tour marketing or something that felt very you know maniacal like i was basically just a human putting things in a spreadsheet and i never was excited by that i was doing some artist manager on the side but it wasn't really paying a lot of money and so i was picking up a lot of odd jobs on the side i was doing uber driving for a long time i would drive friday and saturday night nine to twelve nine to two a.m because those were the best times to drive you would have high surge rates and i could make a lot of money i was picking up uh delivery driving um hot hours so instead of it being like you know just doordash during the day there was an app that allowed you to go work at different restaurants for one to two hour intervals for 15 hours plus tip and so i was making like fifty dollars then i would hop on uber and i kind of had a goal at some point just to make like a hundred dollars a day so like i can make a hundred dollars a day that i can make this much a year and then i'll be you know set off and when i came out of college i was like okay i'm making hundred dollars a day this is great but like what am i doing there's no upside here like i'm just kind of driving and like what is the end goal of this work that i'm doing and there was no ladder to climb really so when i saw crypto i saw two things i saw one a way for me to just get the number of my bank account up first and foremost it was the best way for me to make money and be practical with my time and two there was an infinite design space i was like i don't know what this is going to net out at but i am 100 confident that spending my time in crypto over delivery driving is going to net out in a better result do you have a 2017 like token that you just like have a place in your heart for lots of them yeah yeah lots of lots of icos lots of the neo icos they did really good on eo yeah yeah that's funny yeah so i was doing a lot of the asian exchanges and just like kind of going about in these weird directions trying to think like there was one called like red pulse i just remember there was like a peak point in 2017 where there was like three days in a row where i just had huge bags of the top gainers on coin market cap like consistently for four days and i was like i'm gonna go you know it's game over okay like what's up did you get in um i want to say like june 2017. okay we got we got it at the same time that's pretty funny uh dude was there wait was it crypto that really resonated with you or was it one specific part about crypto was it like for me for me i got pulled into ethereum like pretty damn quick yeah was there any sort of like thesis or theory or just culture about crypto that you're like oh yeah this is my tribe or this is what i believe i wrestle with that i didn't find ethereum really until 2018 i was using it to do icos but it actually was something that i came into pretty late because i was doing bitcoin first then i was on bitrax and then i started doing icos when i started doing icos you need to have meta masks with ether but for the longest time i was like i understand why people would want ether if it's just used to buy things other coins i was like i don't really get this and um winning the 2018 but i do remember very vividly during ico culture i love the telegram chats i don't know if anyone remembers like ico days of telegram chats my favorite thing ever would be when an ico would drop and it would be like one of the most popular ones and so the telegram chat like the thing would break and then it was just full-on like the most insane messages you've ever seen like thousands and thousands for a second you couldn't beat it so there's all this profane stuff in there it was really messed up but it was like just that idea of there being such a concentration of power and energy on the internet and one specific chat was like so exciting to me i was like there is such a community here around this idea of just making money on the internet any of these projects are complete dog which most of them were the fact that all of us are just mobilizing to different like little pockets of the internet consistently was the funnest thing in the world to make did you how did that did you start like changing what you wanted your career to be like how did you know that like oh yeah i want to do this crypto thing professionally for my for my job or at that time was it more just like oh yeah these are fun tokens and fun memes i think when uh the run-up happened in 2017 i saw my net worth skyrocket from what it was at that time i was really excited about that fact and i was like okay there's clearly a financial opportunity played here i saw there was a lot of room to grow you know things were very immature and there was a lot of just bs out there and i loved that i could be independent and autonomous you know i graduated college i was doing trading in icos eventually i got good at trading them and so i was like okay what does it look like to do an ico so i went on angellist found a bunch of random projects that had some conceptual vision of doing ico was able to convince them to either give me tokens or give them like five thousand dollar cash or just like some really really marginal amount just to be involved in some way shape or form and through that process i went from being like speculator to really an early contributor you know what that looked like was me just writing a bunch of white papers me writing a bunch of blog posts i would tell these projects here are the listing sites you want to be on here are the good ico sites to be on you know here are the people on twitter that matter and just sort of like getting a lay of the land and for me coming out of college you know these these ceos if you can even call them that these older individuals were just so fascinated by like me thinking that i had this like knowledge of how the space worked that just gave me an opportunity to just be present and i think the reason i'm most successful for that and i'll caveat that not a single project raise a single dollar none of them raised or launched their token ever i worked for exposure basically the whole time and i probably earned 5 000 cash over the course of like six months but they flew me to southeast asia to go to crypto conferences so i went to consensus singapore i went to beyond blocks in thailand i went to pune dx and bali you know most of random conferences in the world and i just started getting in the mix i was like what does it look like to be around these people clearly i'm you know really involved in this but am i am i crazy am i operating on an island or like am i kind of in the right direction i think as i started going to more of those conferences i stumbled upon this thing called uh eath global you know and devcon and sort of like these ethereum conferences i remember when i started to go to those i was like oh wait this is way different from consensus this is way different from like these booth stand conferences where there's some ico project where like a person at the front ended up changing from me just kind of walking around to boost and being like hey i saw that update you have like good job to me being like but you guys like are doing this full time too like i'm not like crazy because i'm like this kid out of college just like randomly like doing crypto full time like you guys care about this and like this is when heath was coming back down and so it started the bear market and uh you just started to see like real people you know it was like sure we all aren't knowledgeable at this space and we probably made some money in 2017 but we're here for something bigger and i think that was when things started to change from it being fully speculative to at least being very intentional and be starting to actually find a family in the space how did you make it to the bear market uh traveling southeast asia you know i'm fortunate enough i graduated college i moved back home for a bit and then immediately just started traveling and so uh me and my good friend lucas campbell who you work with daily um went to southeast asia for three months we went to all these conferences just sort of hutzed around we were doing like odd consulting jobs for projects like writing white papers and just giving them like blog posts and stuff like that and uh it was fun i had friends around me we were kind of in it together at that point and um it was just good having a couple people in my orbit who were kind of in the mix with me because even though we weren't doing good by any means we knew that we were doing something together and i think that vision that there was going to be a brighter future that there were going to be things like maker and uniswap that started popping up we were like okay we might be insane we lost all of our money our parents don't know what the hell we're doing they think that we're crazy but at least we have the freedom to just try it you know fresh out of college not a lot of not a lot to lose you know as we stuck through it i think we started to notice there was real stuff there and as d5 started to come into the picture i think that was when things started to really get formalized into being like we're not crazy there's real stuff here you know this is a topic to cover and this is something that again back to my point of curation this is the next thing this is the thing to really start covering very very deeply was uh callum and james involved at this point no they weren't that was actually a year and a half later and so me and lucas were working closely we were doing consulting for a bunch of projects we started writing for a bunch of d5 blogs so one called defy rate um started contributing places like banclos and the defiant and just really started writing about everything that there was to do with d5 you know at that point i remember i was cranking out like three to five articles a day it was like fundraising announcement token launch you know new update from the decks or something like that and just like really getting as much of a lei land as possible and i really prided myself on on twitter the second that something was tweeted from a project i could write up an article in literally 10 minutes 500 words get it posted on the site and just have it out there rip a tweet and that like consistency to just go from this happened to cooper covered it just like merge that as close together as possible and then i think over time i kind of started again following the space with someone who's very knowledgeable about everything that was happening so i i think that where you started writing and tweeting i think that is the start of your the rest of your trajectory right and so like everyone plays around with tokens everyone thinks they can do the ico d5 well they wouldn't call them d5 tokens back then but like everyone played tokens in 2017 and then we all kind of like you know sobered up in 2018. it sounds like that that was the moment where like cooper's crypto story really began right the thing that actually started is at the beginning of the story that actually has coherence to where you are now is that a fair take totally fair i would say one interesting point to add on is when i was in college and getting deep in the music scene i was actually doing music journalism so i was doing artist interviews i was traveling to festivals i was meeting different acts and covering different shows and that early writing practice i had in college ended up being extremely beneficial for this d5 era because i was already a somewhat decent writer at that point you know it wasn't like i was coming out from scratch like i had been writing for three to five years i was doing white papers as we mentioned and so when i started going to like a news reporting in an editor standpoint where i was delegating articles to people i had a basic conception for how media worked and i think that that trajectory of being able to take a topic and breaking it down into here's what it is here's why it matters and here's what you do to act upon that like that three-part process like really refining that allowed me to just get very practical about my writing and really allow me to start building a brand for myself how did you make it through the bear market financially uh through writing ready yeah um really thankful there was an angel out of silicon valley who started defy rate and he was paying me you know a dollar per word basis to basically just pump out articles and then i was just turning out three to five week and so i was earning maybe 500 to a thousand dollars a week just from writing immediately putting all that into eth picking up some odd jobs here and there writing white papers doing like small consulting gigs which is basically just project management and through that you know just survived i don't think i was excelling but it was enough for me to be comfortable at that time i was living at home with my parents and so i didn't have any expenses and um that kind of rolled into d5 summer i think that was the time that really ended up being like the big change for me i started going like it was like i remember i went to devcon i started meeting some people that were like met james there and started doing some like the fire eye stuff that's where that was born had joined medic cartel at that time and so i was very deep on the ground on the dow front and quarantine when that hit and kovid was the best thing that ever happened to me and i feel really fortunate to say accident for a lot of people is really bad but for me being able to be at home with my parents lock myself in my room work 14 hours a day and then go to the basement and work out and wake up and do it all over again that was the biggest crime period of my life and that's when i saw the most success because i was working harder than anyone else around me and i knew that for a fact and it really drove me to just keep going harder and harder so what was the first thing that was beyond writing um that was like uh that was next in the story of just like actual grinding and being part of uh just crypto like after writing where'd you graduate into governance governance yeah i was on discord forums i was uh in discord chats i was doing work with teams like i remember i was very involved with um ave's v2 launch i was working on with the balancer team at the time started to just kind of work for like more legit legit projects you know 2017 i was working for just anyone who would hire me um as d5 summer started happening as i started getting a little bit of following on twitter and had like outlets like defy right to offer i could start working with more high caliber teams and i think that period of time i was starting to give value-added insights to very important projects in the space and starting to gain social capital by doing governance proposals it went from me just being someone around to me actually playing a core role in the things that were making meaningful influence in the space so the way i got through bear markets was by working for companies from one company which blew up to another company which blew up to another company which blew up yeah kept on going down the line until until defy summer and then i was like okay i made it to the other side yep you did you never had the safety of a company you you were on your own was that was that scary was that stressful like what was it like to be a lone wolf while you know in 2018 and 19 and the beginning of 2020 it felt like just ashes was coming from the sky because the crypto market was burning over and over again yeah i think it gave me a lot of freedom i think that it takes a very specific type of person to be comfortable in that regard i'm very thankful for my parents for just supporting me in that you know they knew about the products i was working on they kind of knew about the life i was living um they knew that i was traveling a lot they knew that i was living at home and so i had a nice pillow you know i had a nice cushion where i could never really fall too far down so even though i was a lone wolf i didn't feel like i was like going to be on the street or anything like that you know it's very thankful and fortunate for that position i think as i started to see a little bit of success through working with these projects i was like i'm starting to get paid in tokens now you know there's a period of time and i remember it was like i would just take any amount of payment to get by like i said with writing i was getting dollar per word so i'd get die sometimes or get usd and then i would choose to buy ether i'd choose to buy this but as i started to do governance it was like i'm going to get paid in ave tokens or lend at the time i'm going to get paid in balancer tokens as i started to earn governance tokens i was like okay not only can i make money from writing from doing freelance stuff i can now parlay that to start getting paid in ownership and i think that transition allowed me to start carving out a stake that felt really meaningful and so as i started to play more of these speculation games so through defy summer we all know about the tokens that launch we all know about liquidity mining we all know about yield farming and i just got really good about being practical in those situations so it'd be i'd be the first one in the farms i'd be the first one treating the tokens like uma ici was like there on unisoft the day that it happened and stuff like that you know and through those experiences it felt like 2017 what happened but more legit and more formal and now instead of me playing follow-on to like you know pump on binance that's up a ton it was like oh you're day one you know and i think that's when we started to see these real big wins in crypto because not only was eth acting as a vehicle for that but there was sort of this underbelly underneath it where you could really go deeper on those relationships and i think that freedom to be agile across everything rather than being like specifically focused on one coin in particular was something that i really really loved so um if anyone that who knows you now they look at you like oh yeah of course cooper would never work for a company was when you graduated college would you have been able to predict that yes yeah never mind about that is not going to work in a company just like not going to make it why yeah i think creative freedom and control you know i think i have a lot of respect for for talented ceos and i've had a lot of i've learned so much by working deeply across a number of projects which i'll talk about shortly here but i think for me you know my skill set is knowing everyone and knowing everything about every project and if you try and put me into a box and say i can only work on this parameter of work it's never going to work for me because my skill set is being everywhere you know it's not being focused on one thing it's me across everything and i think by nature a company is directing you to be focused on one thing very deeply and i think me being across everything is where i've been able to shine in my life thus far when did that strategy become um uh defined in your head like when do you say like oh i am like i'm gonna be the guy that knows everyone was that uh first subconscious and then you realized it and now it's defined or were you like oh no i want to be the guy that knows everyone and then you started doing it like what happened first i think subconscious i think it just kind of happened you know in the same way that i said i started picking up projects in 2017. i remember i was juggling like five clients at the time five just like ico projects and i was bouncing around all of them then on top of that i was still trading and i was like on twitter and stuff i was like i'm actually pretty good at like you know multitasking and project management i started to be really direct about like this time of the week is for this project this time of week for this project and started building on my own internal calendar and through that i sort of developed like my own routine and schedule that felt very good to me you know albeit very chaotic to everyone else but i just had a system for myself that worked well and everything else just fell into place when did you have the aha moment about owning being paid in ownership it's a great question it was it was the writing stuff honestly it was like getting paid in die into my metamask wall and then using that to buy ethon on unispot and doing that consistently over time and then just doing like coin corner with my friends and so every call we would start when we're doing governance or something like that we'd spend the first 15 minutes being like this token's going up why is it going up why is it cool uh lucas and i were writing something called token tuesdays at the time so we were covering different coins and projects new d5 protocols mean like here's a you know dcf of some maker protocol or something like that and it was it was still buying but i remember even before i was earning these tokens i remember when i was buying these tokens i was like it's not only about you know them going up in like a speculative sense and like them pumping like you were buying you were buying ownership you know like we were using this to participate in governance we on governance forums i remember that we got delegated a lot of comp when comp launched and now to me and lucas was like the best thing ever like we got ten thousand comp delegated to us from last time we're like let's go like we're in the mix you know we have governance power now like we were this whole post about why we're a big delegate and why it mattered and whatnot i was like there is such a difference between just like moon boy twitter who's like plotting out charts with like lines and stuff and then just like on the governance forum like actually participating in meaningful discussions and even before we were earning any governance tokens for doing that that sense of purpose and feeling like you're one with the community was just really really powerful to me about the moon boy chart people do you feel like those are your like uh your opposites because you have you have the people that look at the charts and be like oh like if i go if i do this i can maximize profit that way and then you're like well if i grind here i can maximize that way do you feel like these are just opposite ends of the spectrum yeah i think that um i try and see everyone's viewpoint very clearly and so i understand this archetype of a trader and i understand that people find a lot of value and uh you know purpose out of being correct in trading i think it's something where i trade more on vibes than i do on like you know specifics i guess and so for me it was always just a very weird point of reference to to spend your time on i've always found that like traders you're just permanently a speculator you know i don't think that traders ever turn any contributors and i think my biggest learning in the space was the more you become a contributor the more success you're gonna have so i wouldn't say that they're my opposite so much as i am that they are stuck in a phase that i think has a limited upside even if you're financially rich i think that there is lacking a big opportunity for you to be a meaningful contributor to something that matters and then also missing out on the connections yeah i mean i guess traders get connected to other traders but contributors get connected to everyone else yep that's exactly right and you're seeing a lot of traders now become really involved in nfts because i think they like that sense of connection that comes with nfts that you didn't really see with fungible tokens oh that's a good take yeah i like that um how did firearms start started through devcon yeah yeah i met uh james very briefly there and then we went to sf and then alex management has had a meta cartel meetup it was like audience james was speaking from axia labs ave guys were speaking dow house guys were speaking on pokemon and i went to this like little sf meetup and i remember they were just like hey we're talking about like consumer-facing applications we're talking about how does crypto go mainstream we're talking about culture and all this stuff and i was like wow this is fascinating me and james sat down for lunch and then uh that was kind of like this conference circle that happened so it was devcon to san francisco to eat denver to eat london to eat cc all in the course of about a month and a half jesus and uh james was on that circuit too and so me and him just got really close to that time we sat down with the project in london and started talking about doing a project together lucas and i were doing like consulting over here james and calm are doing consulting over here um lucas and i were building this brand around d5 with the writing that we were doing james and calm been working for a lot of legit projects in that time and so we were kind of able to merge like bring in the skill sets that lucas and i had on the writing side was sort of legitimacy that james and callum brought and just started leveling up our community interactions consulting whatever you want to call it to what you know then became fire eyes is fire eyes the thing that you feel like the most responsible for because you work for so many different things in so many different directions it's hard to like when i when i wake up i think oh it's bankless time because that's all i got uh is that is like when you wake up like oh fire eyes first or is it just like one of the many projects that you work on i give a fire eye school credit to james you know i see that as kind of his his child and his baby and i think that he came from a spot of really legitimizing that vehicle you know like coming out of medic cartel um me and him had done this thing called medic land very briefly at the time which was like an esports down so we were just like starting random dials and random projects and i think that he was very much intentional and saying like i know you guys had consulting before but like you need to step your up you know he's like you need to stop getting paid like a thousand dollars in tokens he's like we're gonna work for these products we're doing 20k 13k engagements i know at the time i was i'm so notoriously bad at under pricing myself like my whole crypto careers be like i'll write your white paper for like 500 bucks and then like you know somebody would be like what are you doing man you're the market it's like white papers are 10 grand right you can't be coming out here and writing for 500 bucks i'm like but why not i can write them in two hours like sure i'm gonna it's like 200 an hour like no it's not about the time you put in it's about like the value of the output i think those early projects with james he was like going in very forcefully with these clients and be like no our rates are like this much like oh but how there's only four of you guys you're out of college like i'll give a damn about like what we look like or who we are like we have so much context and value to bring to you that's like you're in or you're not you know and i think that that growth process ended up becoming a very valuable skill for me as i started to do more in the space because it learned to teach me to just overprice yourself and overvalue yourself and start to get paid in what you earn and so i guess to answer your question directly i think that i was an extremely um valuable member of fire eyes and still have today but i would say that the inception of it was definitely due to james and i still give him full credit for that hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation with cooper thus far in the second half of the show we get into the more recent timeline of cooper's story uh moving to la the the getting the celebrities into crypto all of that good stuff and what it's just like to know a little bit about everyone in this space uh because everyone seems to know cooper uh so we'll go ahead and get right into that second half of the show but first a moment to talk

the brave wallet download brave at brave.com banklist and click the wallet icon to get started at some point in time uh you started to get into the world of uh outside of crypto but people that were like you know the hollywood types of celebrity types coming into crypto and all of a sudden it seems from my perspective that when they did that cooper was there yep how'd that happen i moved to la in the middle of quarantine in september i started talking to a project called audies which is a music streaming app um obviously as you've heard in this conversation music played a big role in my life and so raniel reached out to me and he's like hey we're thinking about doing a token soon do you guys want to help ranielle's in meadow cartel adventures and so you're just kind of seeing our work that we were doing and i was like hey not only do i want to do this token but i want to be really involved in this project more so than any of the ones i had been in the past and so it actually ended up being the most formal relationship with the team i've had thus far i signed a contract to start working 30 hours a week i was in the slack channels i was doing all hands meetings and my entire objective was crypto and web3 for like a consumer-facing platform basically and so we launched that token we started doing a lot of nft features and long story short um through that process of working at audience i was like i need to be somewhere that's more culturally relevant than philadelphia where i was at the time i was doing traveling going to these conferences but i always come back to philly i'd come back to home base back to my parents and i was like this isn't going to cut it you know if i want to really go the next level and i want to make crypto cool again i need to be somewhere where this is going to be meaningful and so just up on a whim got a one-way flight to la um stayed with a friend for a week and then signed a lease ended up flying back uh driving across country with my brother and my two cats in my car 48 hours after signing a lease and my parents like you can't go to l.a what do you mean you're going on saturday it's thursday like you're not going to go to l.a and i was like yeah i think i'm going to do it packed up my whole room put everything in the car and just sent it out there had no idea directed what i was doing but i was like la feels like the best spot for me to develop a community for myself around music and crypto and so we're just gonna wing it and i think the rest is history from there have you ever ever spent any time in la or california at all before that no really yeah you're just like la that's where hollywood is like yeah that's probably probably the right spot yeah because through the soundcloud era i saw that all the artists that i had followed were spending more and more time out there like that was just the area where if you were in music and you're in electronic music specifically you eventually moved to la if you made it or if you were someone relevant and so i just saw like through this whatever glass i was like all right if i'm gonna make it and whatever i'm doing i need to be an ally it's just the spot to be so backing up a little bit uh people that know cooper and meet you in real life you have a funny not not funny uh what's the right word uh distinct sense of fashion yeah did that come when you moved to la or were you also did you have that that kind of fashion style also in high school like when did that happen i had never bought a piece of designer clothing prior to li yeah yeah actually prior to four months ago okay four months ago so this is new as it four months ago yeah four to six at this point but definitely very very recent so what what resonated with you with that i think in crypto there's this really funny uh and i love it by the way but just like in crypto everyone is rich but no one wears anything but like a t-shirt you know and just like shorts and it's like i have a ton of money but i'm never gonna show anything but for me i was like well what if what if i show that i'm doing well for myself you know what if i like bought clothes that represented the success i've had and sort of like the vibe that i represent and really go from being like you know wealthy on the internet to like showing that a little bit more in person and something that influenced a lot of this for me is there's a great book called hashing twitter it's about the history and origin of twitter and there was a distinct chapter where they talked about jack when he left twitter the first time to go start square they said the biggest thing that changed for him is he started to wear dior clothing he started to buy a lot more shirts and he would come to the office looking really fresh and in that book they depicted that his employees started taking a lot more seriously by the way that he dressed and when i started hearing that i was like what is this brand called you i've never heard of this in my life and everyone who knows that's listening now knows that i love dr and it's my favorite brand but that was the inception out so i went online and i saw this cool shirt i got it ordered and i was like six hundred dollars for a t-shirt like what the hell like this is insane like why did i overspend this and then i wore it like once or twice people start commenting on it i remember then someone was like wait you bought it online you got to go to the store started to develop a relationship with the brand manager there and she's fantastic to me he's invites me to all these private events and uh saw this new world you know keeps coming back to this new industry new shiny object that's really exciting to me fashion as a design space is incredibly interesting you know the caliber the people you meet there the relationships the representatives at the store the different designers and creative directors i'm starting to see this map of like the way that that world is starting to operate and i think that combined with like web 3 and what's happening now around digital identity i think there's a very interesting intersection where not only you proficient in tech but you can also show that you're up to date with like mainstream culture and i think that intersection is something i want to be very very skilled and well versed in so this is you just applying your ability to multi-task be personable know a lot of people and then now you're coming into la and there's this again and where you're saying a new shiny object and you're just like well let me just like copy and paste that strategy into this new thing that i now care about yeah fortunately with a backing that allowed me to be present in that conversation you know i don't think if it weren't for crypto and sort of the the gains that i'd seen there i'd be able to participate in fashion nearly to the level that i have now but now that i am at a point where i've developed a brand for myself on the internet i'm in la i'm seen as someone that's at the intersection of culture and crypto me being able to represent myself physically with that feels very on brand for me and i've had a lot of fun out of being that guy that goes to a crypto conference when everyone else is wearing a t-shirt and wearing a chain and wearing dior and wearing like a nice watch and just being like happy about that be like you know what guys it's bull market we all know it it's all mania it's definitely gonna crash and this is definitely coming back to zero but for the time being we're gonna enjoy this and we're gonna have a great time with it one of my friends who uh has been around for two cycles i've only been around for one cycle you and i are just our one cyclers he is a big fan of buying nice stuff during the bull market yeah because i mean if you're not gonna do it then like you might not be able to ever do it right so you can you gotta grab the bowl by the horns you gotta you gotta cut yourself up during a bull market yeah i think there's a i'm starting to recognize that there does need to be a rebalancing of sort of the way that we're living our lives in the bull market relative to how we're going to live it more long term you know i think in the last couple months um i've been spending a lot more than i normally have i've been developing habits that i don't think are very sustainable and i need to correct that and so being able to see that around the corner is very important and so i very much enjoy going out and having shopping sprees and honestly the reason why i've loved it the most i've been developing connections with very competent people around fashion and so artists and djs that i know in la people who are very successful in their career young kids who are 20 to 25 that have gotten a million dollar advance from a record label i really have a lot of peers that they can just go like enjoy stuff with so me being able to be like let's go to rodeo and drop 10 bands on some clothes you know and just like having that be like a vibe that we connect around it builds such legitimacy in a way that i've never seen before that it's something i very much appreciate but to that same t it can become dangerous if you don't understand what you're doing in that regard and so i'm definitely been overspending and doing a lot of stuff there but i want to make a very clear distinction that it's not sustainable and it's not something that i should think i'm going to be able to do forever because it's very unhealthy to have that type of mindset so i will say well i've been going very ham in recent months i do want to put this as a public statement to myself to chill out a little bit because i think we're all getting a little bit too comfortable with the bull market and it is definitely not something that's going to last forever well coming from people that came out of a 2018 and 2019 definitely had like people that stuck around they kind of knew that this was coming it's like though there will be this time in my future where like i get to like you know cash in on all the suffering that i have in 2018 yeah so like it's very much a reaction of going through the bear market but the bull market has been around for almost like coming up on two years now right so like it is it is like i i do resonate with that it's time to like oh yeah let's chill for a little bit i remember 400 e thinking that was insane yeah yeah we had that run-up going to eat denver and it was like 350 ethan i was like bull market baby let's go like d5 coins are all off like 10x at that point you know the portfolio was looking pretty good and you were like you're like yeah this crypto thing man like let's go we're good we're going to make it we're going to make it spike down to 80 drops like complete crash remember being i remember being working on my basement that happened and just laughing right we're just like are you kidding me we almost had it yeah i was like how is this still possible i thought we were over this like minus 45 right now just like how is this possible the reddest of red days yeah yeah it was a good shell shock i know that some of my friends got shaken out there i remember a lot of my friends were on leverage and uh an interesting point for for listeners i never trade on leverage i only trade on spot with everything if i want to be on leverage i will earn larger ownership stakes in something but i don't trade on like ftx they don't trade on uidx i don't do anything that's like crazy leverage i'm just i'm in spot in all the positions i'm in and i really want to work for everything that i own do you like borrow stables to farm with you like lock up any money in compound ravi or you just completely stay away from collateralized to any of your capital i have like a very small loan on a i want to say ave right now like maybe like i have a maker vault that i have like some ethan and maybe like 50k and die and then i have some stuff on ave i have a lot of usdc in ribbon finance actually and so i farm with a good amount of stables but typically those stables are the result of me taking profits and not actually taking collateral against something okay so the way that you have upsides exposure is by finding projects early-ish and then just grinding yeah and i would say the best thing that i've learned from bank list and i'll give you guys a lot of credit for is teaching people how to be responsible with their d5 risk management so it's not about going and doing a 10x long on something understanding that you can put collateral in ave and you know properly manage that and then do stuff like the eath fly like liquidity farming thing you know where it's like you have you're on leverage but you're like earning fees and like the permanent losses less like those tactics that are like you can be risky in d5 but not be like full on degen like that sweet spot i think is really valuable for people that are actually experiencing crypto yeah surgical risk yeah um okay uh getting back into the the la conversation you started at audience which is perfect la material i'd say is that kind of where you started to meet a lot of people that were external to crypto 110 yeah my friend uh grady that's here at the conference now actually he um i connected with him on instagram because i've been following his music for a long time he's like hey i'm starting to look in crypto does anyone here know what's going on and i messaged him and i was like i will know more than anyone that you messaged he was like who was this he's like you actually know crypto and i was like yeah top top point at one percent and i said something just like really like verbose about that and it got it got his attention so he invited me over his house we had a conversation immediately hit it off and then from there that was when things started to change for me in l.a at that point i'd been there for three months it was middle pandemic and so i was still in my grind it was like 10 hours a day i would not leave my apartment more than one day a week and just like fully inside when i started hanging out with that crew it went from like me being online in l.a to me being like physical in la like there was cool people coming over to their garden house they were doing album listening parties they were dancing and like i felt like 75 people were taking mushrooms and it was vibing and i was like this feels this reminds me colorado again it reminds me like creative culture but it's coming from a point of very talented creators you know i'd say colorado was creatively inspiring to me but it was from people that were just a fan of culture and then i started to go to la where people were creating culture you know they were putting out albums they were putting out movies there were photographers they were shooting for halsey and eden dior and stuff like that and i was like wow like this is the pin club i was like this is not only a way for me to like enjoy the culture but actually be a part of it the thing is i started to get deeper in those circles i started to bring a lot of this music context they had where i was like of course i know your music i'm listening to it for 10 years you know i've curated it back and stuff i feel like wait really like you actually know my stuff from that long ago and having that additional context with this new angle of crypto like layered on top allowed me to just have such this like interesting skill set whereas like i was relevant in the conversations because i knew what was happening but then i had something of value to add to every single person that i met which was such a rare thing in l.a because it's very much the opposite most people are always on like this social climb type game or they're like looking to get a favor out of someone i was like i just love your work and oh by the way i can actually amplify that by 10 if you want to give me an hour of your time a week i think that combination just started to really snowball and uh today i say absolutely love la and i have a lot of unfinished business because i've been happy and lucky enough to build relationships with some of the most influential creators in the world and i think that we are at the very early pinnacle of what they're going to be able to do in web 3 over the next couple years i think that's pretty emblematic of crypto at large right and i remember thinking in 2017 a little bit too early but beside the point like oh i just hopped on to this building that i hopped onto the roof of this building that's going to just grow yeah and once crypto's finally here i'll just be at the top and all you got to do is know about crypto because people maybe people think icos are weird now but like something about crypto is going to be the most mainstream thing possible i just don't know when and so as long as you're riding that ride you just get dropped off at the very top i'm sure there's a lot of people trying to make it in l.a right they're trying to just do their grind of like making good music or just doing the normal route and crypto is just this hack where it's like well else becoming an expert at crypto and they'll just get dropped off at the top and literally end perfect example and i think the biggest thing i've learned from the past couple months in la this is not gonna be the case forever but for right now the amount of time you need to invest in crypto as a creator to have success from like a financial and a social standpoint is very very small if you start spending 10 hours a week investing in crypto meaningfully with your time and not your money being on platforms relative to your career joining discord servers relative to your community joining a dallas relative to your interest those three things combined i have so many friends in la that have spent not a lot of time but are now selling you know have sold 40 eth worth of work over the course of like three months and that's more than they've seen in like years you know i have friends who are able to now quit their day jobs because they just are financially sustainable on the back of doing like nfts and whatnot i think that was the thing that really motivated inspired me about this run is 2017 i was trading with music people was just like here's the ico here's the coin to buy like it was only a trading group now it's very different where it's like it's not you investing with your time first or with your money first it's you investing with your time and your creative work and you can now earn to get into crypto rather than having to buy to get into crypto i think that difference is why we've seen nfts become as prominent as they are today because there's this entirely new section of creators that's coming in that doesn't know what uniswap is they don't know what dye is they don't know what discord is but they have this beautiful creative talent and now they can put that in web 3 and start to earn on the back of it i think that's an incredibly fascinating topic so i don't think anyone listening to this podcast will not think that you are an absolute grinder and deserve all your success some people out there in the world and then this is just not just for you but there's a certain cohort of people in the crypto world that spread themselves horizontally yep and from the outside in it kind of some people are like well cooper's famous because cooper's famous because cooper's famous like it's just like oh the the meme of just like he's the guy that knows everyone doesn't actually do anything yeah but just like is that's just kind of why it's cooper like that's that's the brand what would you say to somebody like that i would say that it's a very accurate assessment i love the quote he works on everything works on nothing i think that's a great quote my next chapter is figuring out how to consolidate my time and focus into investing in myself and parlaying everything i've done thus far into something way bigger and so i think that my skill sets so far have been very fruitful to me i think i've done really well what i've done i think that's a very acute and accurate challenge and i look forward to doing what i can to level that up love it i love it uh we haven't talked about this yet and then the answer reminded me of this you never say anything poorly about anyone why no point if you don't have anything nice to say that don't say anything at all yeah i don't have beef with literally anyone and i want to very much maintain that mentality because even if you have something that you don't like about me or whatnot um i look forward to trying to change that perspective of you people are going to disagree on things uh respect the pump great mindset to have even if you aren't riding the thing that's doing well i wish you nothing but the best and i think inviting that positive mentality into your life surrounds you with abundance what about does that does that mean that no one out there in the world is deserved of any sort of ire or criticism or or i don't know negative sentiment they definitely are but it's for someone else to criticize them not me and i've actually found in my life that is much better to build a positive relationship with someone first then be very direct and feedback with them because they will listen exponentially more than trying to criticize someone before you have prior context because most times they won't listen to that and so if i'm able to come in and i think this is something that people appreciate with me or what they've told me is once we are friends like i'll be direct with you and be like you're up here or you know you need to fix this or like you need to do this better or like okay all these ideas they kind of suck but like what are we doing here like stop thinking about and me being able to just be very direct with people that i know and trust has been very helpful for me and so i always start from a point of before i try and influence someone i want to make sure that we are on the same page and i know where you're coming from what you're working on so that when i do try and give you advice it comes from a point of love and respect rather than you know me thinking that better than you and me thinking that i have all the answers which i absolutely do not um what about this industry bugs you the most what would you change should be good it's a good question probably just like maturity you know i think that for a lot of people in the space we've all done very well for ourselves and we've not had to really experience a lot of the hardships that other people have had to and i think us being able to take success and really point that in something meaningful and being respectful about our success i think is very important i noticed um a lot of people in crypto when we were enjoying luxuries in life do not take the proper time to respect the service people around them and that bothers me a lot you know having started from a position of being a delivery driver and sort of working like odd jobs here and there i remember you know the days when i was like stoked for a five dollar tip i think in crypto we all have done well for ourselves financially the point where we forget how hard other people work around us that aren't in crypto and there's this sort of assumed assumption that everyone should be in crypto and if you're not you're just ngmi which is true to a degree but you need to be respectful of people irregardless of where they are in life and you need to say thank you you need to say please you need to have manners and even if you're taking a private jet or in a club or something like that that does not give you any reason to be disrespectful to anyone and so just like mannerisms and being polite and being respectful of where you are i think are the biggest things that we can work on as well um how do you think cryptoculture can positively change external culture i think it can be more inviting to people who don't have the same opportunities that all of us did in uh 2017 and 2018. you know i think right now we're in a very growth period of the bull market i think that uh giving back is really important so buying you know up-and-coming creators works buying things with no intention of there being a profit in it donating to get coin grants doing things like this that feel very um positive sum in nature i think that needs to be a very meaningful part of your investment strategy because it's not only about conserving your own wealth it's about creating wealth for other people and so as i spend my time now i think about how do i invest both my time and money into other people so that they can go and expand the vision that we have today and rather than trying to just one-up your own stack use your own stack to give another people a stake or a playing card to go out and make a meaningful influence do you have a have you thought about 2022 gold no not at all not yet is there any anything on the horizon where you're like damn i really want that achieved or done or would it be dope if that happened my 22 goals are to better formalize what i'm doing you know i've operated very much from a yellow standpoint where it's like i'm earning tokens i'm doing trades i'm flipping nfts i'm doing well for myself but it's all very fast paced i want to set a foundation for myself that feels very strong and very tied in so as i start to do bigger projects in the space i can feel confident that i'm operating from a point of leverage because at a certain point and i think everyone in crypto realizes this when you want to make meaningful change on the world you need to have a foundation in place that allows you to do that for a long time you can operate as lone wolf and as a freelancer and just kind of around and just earn tokens here and there but when you want to start hiring people when you start building a team and growing something bigger you are now responsible for their livelihood you're responsible for their families you're responsible for their income in order to do that you cannot operate from a point of complete freedom because it's going to break down and so me being able to better realize what those processes look like and set up standards and networks around me to thrive in those environments is something that i'm very excited about for 2022. am i hearing that cooper is perhaps leaning into the idea of starting his own organization something of likes yeah yeah i mean that's that's the five year plan i think that we are in the uh the my space area of crypto right now i think that the facebook instagram and twitter's of web d have not been built yet and it's very much my intention to build one of them cool like uh like the jack dorsey founder type yeah probably yeah i think it's gonna look very different though you know i think what i'm realizing now is like this whole culture around like dows and giving ownership early on we're getting closer and closer to that being at day one we're doing like air drops after series a five years from now i think it's like some version of like a fair launch like you know day one ownership type schema and i think the founder role will not resemble direct ceo i kind of see it being more like a uh it's gonna be a big analogy but like someone like gandhi you know like somebody who's just like one with the people where it's like you don't have like the biggest ownership stake in the world but like you have the most social capital i think that's position i would love to play where it's like i can be a leader in whatever i'm building but it's not by you know my net worth or my ownership allocation something it's by virtue of the social stake i have in that and there's actually such a large pie around me that everyone else feels so empowered that my empowerment is grown as a result of that so it sounds like you went from d5 summer to conference season it's pretty pretty quickly as soon as cobit was over it's like oh yeah conference season how how has your life changed from you know like you said being in your apartment six days out of the week like in your in your debt everyone like everyone was in their industry during device summers like in their den yeah some people broke out and started doing conference season pretty damn fast and you're definitely one of them how have you been able to juggle all of your commitments and obligations while being on the road and doing conference stuff and why do you like conferences so much just building legitimacy with people you know i don't have expectations of getting real work done when i'm on the road but i think being present in the environments that matter for this industry is how you build trust i think that's the thing i value the most about my brand right now is if i'm affiliated with a project i think that you can trust that it is not a scam and you can trust that it has some degree of competency with it so me being at these conferences and showing that this is my life and i will continue to be on the ground floor of anything that happens irregardless of how well i do for myself is very very important to me you know going you know eth global is expected to have three or four events this year i will be at every single one of them you know i can say that very confidently because i don't want my brand to become big enough to the point where i'm never there i have this mentality uh ga for life so in concerts there's general admission there's vip and then there's all access a lot of people when they start going all access they'll never go to the crowd they'll never buy a ticket again and they'll just kind of only be all access and if they don't have the highest level of access they won't be present i think it's extremely important for you to remember why you're there in the first place and to be there you know on the ground floor and so for me being in these conferences allows me to just say i'm here i'm i'm one of the people i want to be with you i want to shake a million people's hands and i think that's a big part of my job on the road now is not only just being present to go to the club and party to chris lake at 3 am in the morning which is fantastic it's to be at the conference during the day and shaking the hands of people and being like what are you working on how can i help you i'm never too big for anyone and i will always give someone the time of day uh if i can get my facts straight your first ever conference was east denver in 2018. yeah yeah looking forward to eat denver 2022 absolutely i got uh some spork tokens staked on kickback right now i mentioned a few buffer coins yesterday um i'm speaking at the shelling point conference that kevin owaki's organizing i'll be there with you yeah it's gonna be a good one mm-hmm yeah well yeah you went to college in denver right yeah it was especially home for you yeah i remember 2018 being fascinated by the fact that there was an ethereum specific conference the idea of tokenomics and uh it was me lucas and a couple of friends and we were just going completely blind and just being like whoa like ethereum like super cool like you're like what is this crazy space and so it's been a long way um denver's always organized a great conference and i think uh generally speaking i'm starting to see that there's like a an opportunity for new type of events in crypto i think that ethan really fantastic all the global events will be fantastic one thing that my friend grady brings up that i think is very important is crypto is cool right now but it lacks the cultural relevance of it being like hip to like everyday culture and so great example of this is the ratio at these conferences 90 dudes 10 girls at best right every single conference like even like crypto parties that are being thrown is like the cool crypto things to do same type of thing you know like how do we get to a point where um beautiful 23 year old actress wants to come and hang out with crypto people and not feel like they're going there because they want to learn about nfts but want to be there because they're the coolest people in the room there i think trying to shape these events these conferences into a point that those can coexist with sort of the ethers of the world that's the kind of culture that i want to incubate and to give a quick antidote um no filter history of instagram another fantastic book kevin systrom when he was building instagram would do curated dinners with all the most high value people in the world people like to think that instagram just got big out of nowhere but he was very calculated in onboarding people in a select manner where he would do a public instagram meetup where you could just come and talk about taking pictures he would do like a pseudo-private one that was like a vip happy hour and then he would do curated dinner with 20 high profile individuals he would bring you together and really talk about the future of instagram while the concierge service make you feel like you were in the mix and i'm starting to see early examples about in crypto now i think especially with me being in la over a three to five horizon i want to start building a culture where going to a crypto event is not only going to hang out with a bunch of nerds it's going to be with the most prominent people in technology and culture and starting to create those pockets i think is what's going to take us from today where it's very much a if you know you know industry to this being a meaningful part of everyone's lives irregardless of how deep you are down the rabbit hole so crypto has a trajectory through space and time going forward uh how does cooper's presence there how do you want it to be changed by you i want to be someone that can inspire other people to make meaningful change in their lives when i think about what i want to do in the world i want to create technology that allows people to meaningfully impact their lives irregardless of me spending time with them my current bottleneck is that i can only be in one place at once and so i feel very confident if i sit with you and work on a project over a long time prize then we're gonna do something great but i cannot be there for everyone and so what i need to do next is build technology that allows me to take the same templates and materials that i'm doing in one-on-one sessions and scaling that out to an infinite number of people and so over a five year time horizon i want to try and export my mentality and sort of ethos into technology that allows other people to carry the same attitude with them is there any internal lines or phrases or ideas that float around in your head that you think listeners should know uh w igmi wag me yeah yeah i'd say um you know like i said earlier be kind to everyone that's around you i think find ways to be happy about how you spend time on the internet i think that one thing i notice a lot is people hate social media i think social media is fantastic i think if you can learn to make social media a tool and not something that controls you it's extremely extremely valuable so even if you hate instagram even if you never post please find a way to make it feel good to you because it's meant there to be curated the algorithm gives back what you put into it and the ethos that you put into it and so regardless of what platforms you're on i think there's exponential value in building a brand and specifically niche communities i think this is the thing that's going to make crypto really succeed is you having social capital in a niche community i was at a festival in cancun this weekend for an artist millennium 3 000 fans flew out to a destination festival all to be around this one artist they were all wearing jerseys this guy was a deity in his local community but there's 3 000 people there and recreating that environment where it's like family type ethos and different pockets of the internet is how i think that this space succeeds and so if you are getting started crypto today find a local community to spend time in find a way to become a contributor and not a speculator and find ways to be comfortable with yourself online because i think your digital identity is going to be more important than your physical identity over 10-year time horizon and it's something you need to start thinking
