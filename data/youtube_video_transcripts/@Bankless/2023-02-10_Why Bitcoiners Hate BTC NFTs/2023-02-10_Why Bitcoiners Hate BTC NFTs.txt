if you think about board ape drops on ethereum and it just causes these fee surges that's one of the kind of problems that you have when there's demand for your block space that isn't tied to this financial use case it's causing volatility in the system that is not as predictable as the financial aspects of it the things that I like about nfts are these programmable parts to it that make them potentially more interesting even though you can't do it on bitcoin I mean we should probably still be doing nfts on ethereum and therefore I don't like that nfts are now taking up space on bitcoin
