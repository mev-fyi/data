hello everyone today we are going to read part two of a bankless nation uh so this is just me reading the article to you in case that is how you prefer to consume content uh part one of this article is decently important uh so if you have not yet read that or listened to me read it to you i suggest that you do that this one basically picks up where we left off okay so let's go ahead and get into it a bankless nation part two a bankless nation part one drew a line through the progression of different nations schemes that humans have discovered and used throughout history digital nations are where that line leads the next iteration of human organizational infrastructure that will enable global coordination and commerce at scales larger than what the nation state is capable of if humans are ever to generate a nation of earth it's going to be through the bankless systems like bitcoin or ethereum nation states have hit their limits to scale part two of this article takes us into the future where we draw comparisons to the nations and nation constituents of the past and how the same pattern is found in the digital nations of the future further we talk about how digital nations are exclusively opt-in systems and how this creates strong free market forces that are extremely competitive and ultimately benefits the users the most lastly we discuss how this free market competition generates products that are found universally reducing the importance or significance of the borders and boundaries of the nation-state returning power and control to the individual and sets the conditions needed to foster a single global nation of coordinated humans let's dive in physical to digital nations have come and gone throughout history and types of nations have come and gone throughout history as well nations are subjects of the universe and like all things answers to the survival of the fittest unfit nations die and efficient nations live on nations are composed of people and when people see greener hills they will eventually migrate over where a nation whether a nation wants them to or not there's little a nation can do in preventing its people from migrating to new pastures given enough time this is especially true with a migration to digital nations tanks planes warships and missiles mean nothing to ethereum or bitcoin they simply exist in a different dimension additionally they live in a dimension that individuals are perpetually connected to there is no way to put the internet back in the box it came and every day this becomes more and more true for the nations that reside on the internet bitcoin and ethereum same components improved efficiency humans respond to incentives show me the incentives and i will show you the outcome said charlie munger this truth is why we can be confident in the perpetual growth of digital nations they are objectively greener pastors when we compare physical nations to digital nations they are not fair comparisons they are about as accurate as comparing physical nations to organize religion when religion dominated the human landscape however the whole point of these comparisons is that they are apples to oranges we're moving from a depleted and exhausted landscape to a fertile one this should mean meaningful differences in these comparisons the greener pastures found with digital nations are the result of the digital nations doing the same job as physical nations but with more efficient mechanisms because the digital nations are born in the crucible of the free market these efficiencies are passed to the users rather than being captured by the powerful few for the extortion of the many many of the same functions found in nation states are also found in digital digital nations we will discuss a few of these to illustrate how digital nations do the same job as physical nations but with better and less costs so this is a table i made that kind of loosely compares the different components of a physical and digital nation and how they all kind of line up right so the instantiation of the united states of america was the declaration of independence that was the planting of the flag saying hey we are independent from from britain and bitcoin and ethereum the their instantiation is the white paper right like the proof of concept uh the the future forward-looking statements about what this thing is going to look like and then you have the actual protocol the defined protocol which for the united states is the constitution of and amendments and then for ethereum bitcoin it's the actual code they all have they all have their native currency the dollar ether bitcoin uh the governance over these systems the federal government for ethereum it's rough consensus for bitcoin it's the social contract uh there's sustenance which basically it's some sort of some form of taxes in digital nations their transaction fees um the the defense of these systems that the military that protects the united states the staked eath that protects ethereum 2.0 and then the bitcoin mining power there's also the judiciary internal enforcement economy boundaries all these things have like correlates that relate to each other and so that's what this uh table reflects obviously these are a to b comparisons the evm does not do the same job as the police if there is an intruder in your home please do not call the evm however they are doing the same job protecting private property the police force of a nation's fundamental role in the nation is to protect private property and the evm assures that the assets are managed in accordance with the protocol it's the same thing but contained in different nation paradigms governance the usa protocol requires governance this is the main innovation that set it apart from the religious nations that came before it the nation state protocol can be updated so that it can retain fitness to the world around it governance is costly it requires the expenditure of energy and resources it is difficult to decide what consensus actually is and it takes a lot of deliberation and debate to make sure we are actually getting governance right ultimately there are no assurances that the nation-state governance does actually arrive at the conclusion that matches the will of the people the salaries of the governors are paid out of the taxes regardless since there is no competitor government over a nation state the external forces that keep expenditure in check are weak there's always the threat of being elected out of power but the financial costs of a government are rarely of concern of the voting constituency there is no fiscal responsibility party inside of a fiat money regime the money printer renders this moot digital nations digital nation protocols like bitcoin and ethereum are designed to have minimal governments the last time bitcoin exerted any energy upon governance was during the bitcoin to bitcoin cash hard fork ethereum retained governance by rough consensus which is partly volunteer work and partly funded out of the initial issuance of the ethereum native currency but it is destined to expire and follow in bitcoin's path of being a calcified system at maturity these systems are only successful if they are ungovernable and thus require no governance expenditure bitcoin has already shown this to be true already shown excuse me bitcoin has shown to already be there and ethereum is actively working to get to the same place as a result the citizens of these digital nations are under no obligation to be funding the governance of these systems defense all nations require defense expenditure without defenses nations of all types are subject to attack and capture as discussed in part one the value of a nation is a function of the economy that it produces and the economy produced creates the incentive for its capturing coercion therefore defense expenditure is required in the physical world a nation's defense is also implicitly its offense there's nothing stopping the repurposing of defensive forces into offensive forces this unfortunate reality is what generates the incentive for all nations to place extraordinary amounts of resources into bolstering their defenses if a nation has an undeveloped defense it can easily succumb to another's defensive forces because they are easily repurposed to an offensive force an arms race ensues all nations need to place an undue amount of proportion of their economic resources into defense because these defense forces are switch hitters that's a baseball term for all you european and non-american listeners readers digital nations have no such arms race nor do they need to defend against any physical world attack the hash power that defends the bitcoin nation is not found in any one specific geographic spot and while bitcoin hash power is a part of the physical world it is not committed to any one specific spot it can easily pick up and move even more nebulous the stake that protects the ethereum nation doesn't even physically exist it is a purely digital abstraction with no physical attack and even touch complete separation complete separation from the physical world the 720 billion usa military budget might be a might as well be a fly swatter against a digital nation the bitcoin and defense hash power in the ethereum stake are also in their own respective domains ethereum is not validated by sha-256 and btc the asset has nothing to do with validating bitcoin the blockchain there is no arms race of defense expenditure in these systems they simply need to suck up a sufficiently large portion of their respective validating commodity sha-256 chips and eath to ensure that there isn't enough on the free market to warrant a successful attack digital nations are minimally extractive as a result of this additionally there is no subjectivity around where the revenue comes from in order to fund defense defense comes from transaction fees transaction fees come from people who are making transactions making transactions add to the bloat of the systems which is a real cost upon those operating a node those that merely store their wealth and make few to no transactions on the system are not taxed only the constituents that add to the bloat are taxed nation states on the other hand have endless and different rules about what is and what is not taxed and at what rate the subjectivity of these taxes ultimately are inefficient and they tax some people more than they should and others less judiciary the judicial branch of the usa offers finality for the laws of the usa protocol like the rest of the government the operation of the judicial branch has financial costs it bears upon taxpayers as well as the centralization of decision making into nine justices of the supreme court the supreme court of the usa is deliberately a slow moving machine it takes time to get things right however during that time when decisions have not yet been made people's lives and businesses hang in the balance and once again there is no getting around subjectivity humans are fallible and the supreme court justices are no exception the judiciary of digital nations are those that operate the nodes with the full history of the blockchain these nodes these node operators do not take compensation and thus impart no tax upon the system their operation is completely objective either it follows the protocol or is a fork objective objectivity means that no costs are required to discover and follow the correct outcome additionally there is no gatekeeping to who can become part of the digital nation judiciary wow say that a lot of times in digital nations we are all the judiciary where because only we decide what software we run internal enforcement all nations require internal regulation to ensure that no one is breaking the rules of the protocol physical nations have phys have police forces that enforce and uphold the laws of the nation this is the component of the nation-state that keeps its internal operations in check like all things in nation states subjectivity and error are inevitable the 2020 rights in the usa illustrated the misalignment between the police of the usa nation and its constituent people protesters claim that the police are an unchecked force with undue political influence and that the systems of checks and balances have forgotten to check the police indeed as the usa has become a safer place to live nationwide police budgets have continued to increase in 2015 taxpayers paid 250 million dollars to fund police misconduct settlement payouts in digital nations the enforcement of the laws of the protocol is trivial and objective the bitcoin script and ethereum evm are what ensure all updates to the system follow the protocol a transaction on bitcoin and ethereum is either valid or invalid there is no in between if there is ever an attempt to do something unlawful in these systems it is rejected before it is ever included which which maintains efficiency and reduces expenditure the cost of maintaining the rules of digital nations are bundled into the defense costs as they ultimately serve the same purpose ensure that the system is perpetually able to make valid state updates forever summary of the comparisons if there's an intruder in your home do not call the evm likewise please continue to participate in your local democracy bitcoin and ethereum do not fix this however they do enable cheaper and more secure places to store your money and wealth they offer low to no safe tax hate tax safe havens for capital in systems that provide maximum property rights and strong assurances of future access digital nations do not fix the potholes in the in your streets they do however return power to the individual and control his or her money and wealth sub nations brand new subject the fundamental difference that sets bitcoin and ethereum apart is that bitcoin is a protocol and ethereum is a protocol of protocols in part one we discuss how the usa scaled its nation further than any nation before it because it enabled sub-protocols under the main protocol the sub-protocols the states of the usa are enabled to set more finely-tuned rules for their particular domain in order to make sure that the protocol fits a wider array of environments as a result the aggregate usa protocol is a flexible and dynamic protocol of protocols that could morph to accurately fit into its environment here's a dope graphic every contract on ethereum is its own subnation of ethereum by default a contract has complete sovereignty over its own realm other contracts on ethereum can only influence another if it is given explicit approval to do so all ethereum sub-nations receive the full protection of the ethereum blockchain that the ethereum blockchain can give it so long as ethereum can withstand attack ethereum sub-nations are guaranteed to live forever an ethereum sub nation is also a business that offers its services to others designed to generate economic and and they are designed to generate economic activity by some particular means this is how ethereum at large generates the taxes to fund the security budget all sub-nations on ethereum generate economic activity that pays transaction fees to the validators of the ethereum nation sub-nations like uniswap maker dao compound have their own internal fees that generate security for their own domain the point three percent exchange fee on unit swap incentivizes liquidity to come to uniswap making the exchange manipulation resistant the maker das ability fee establishes the market cap of mkr which incentivizes the buyers of last resort compound has its own interest fees to borrow with partly paid to partly paid to suppliers and in the future will likely be paid to the balance sheet of the comp token owners which has a similar mechanism to both the unit swap and maker dow these fees are the taxes upon the constituents of each sub-nation part one of this article illustrated how over time nations charge more and more taxes upon their constituency in the beginning a nation charges what it needs to offer decent protection once a monopoly is established however and the ability for a constituency to exit is gone fair taxes from a nation turn into extortion unlike physical nations applications on ethereum can never prevent exit from their subnation if any sub-nation begins to charge extortion level taxes it is likely that it will push the capital inside its system elsewhere where the same services could be found at a lower tax rate ethereum is a digital nation of minimally extractive sub-nations subnations on ethereum can either be sorry subnations on ethereum can either be a single contract with a single function or a connected system of multiple contracts with a network of if this then that conditions that results in the holistic product single contract kingdoms a single uniswap exchange is a good example of a quote single contract kingdom one single uniswap market is wholly composed of one single contract address all other ethereum addresses are able to access and use the uni swap contract but no other address has the ability to change the protocol and manipulate the way that it operates the protocol is fixed single contract subnations are robust due to their simplicity having just one contract contain all the necessary functions reduces possible attack vectors by an order of magnitude there is simply less to be concerned about the real world correlate for a single contract sub-nation is a city-state like singapore or monaco and similarly draw strength from their autonomy from the rest of the world complete autonomy from the rest of the ethereum ecosystem allows for these single contract subnations to be relatively immune from the changes to the rest of the ethereum ecosystem and are only truly exposed to the size of the ecosystem at large other applications on ethereum can come and go but uniswap in all its exchanges will remain indefinitely multi-contract coalitions more ambitious goals require more flexibility than what a single contract kingdom can offer different requirements of a larger system can be segregated into separate contracts each contract is only responsible for its functioning and the outputs of that contract are the inputs for others in its coalition this allows for each contract to specialize and focus on one particular task while relying on other contracts to do the same if the builders of this subnation orchestrate these different contracts correctly the holistic system of inputs and outputs of all contracts creates a resulting product of the multi-contract coalition the larger and more complex applications on ethereum are unions of multiple contracts that work together to produce a whole that is greater than the sum of each part these coalitions of contracts are composed systems of incentives agents inputs and outputs the goal of these subnation protocols is to produce a healthy economy that returns nourishment back to the protocol maker dao is an ethereum sub nation maker dao is a composition of many different interconnecting agents with incentives inputs and outputs the maker protocol is a system that is designed to produce a useful output die and receive nourishment for doing so stability fees compound is also an ethereum subnation it follows the same basic rules i've been describing here's a chart here's a table that you guys will be familiar with prince free exit governance is perhaps humanity's largest unsolved problem the main reason why nations have come and gone throughout history is that we have not yet solved governance at its fundamental level how do we decide how to fairly govern the systems that govern us further the repercussions of poor governance nations is significant due to the fact that the constituents of a nation are typically unable to opt out of these systems when religions were in their prime opting out was to choose either oppression or death nation-states now blanket the earth and there's no place to go once you revoke citizenship revoking citizenship is simply not an advantageous thing to do anyways you are trapped old nations are monopolies that are also able to dictate how you live your life digital nations are exclusively opt-in systems when you are born you are claimed as either a constituent of the nation you are born in but you are not yet a citizen of ethereum or bitcoin that is your choice to take when you when you so choose this difference cannot be understated because digital nations are opt-in they must compete for your citizenship they must give you good reason to join their domain in order to attract constituents in capital digital nations must deliver real products and valuable services in order to attract participation digital nations are born in the crucible they start with nothing and the only way they grow in users and value is by providing real world value real value for the world legacy nations have never had to experience such strong such a strong degree of free market competition having monopolistic control over their constituents and their constituents capital have rendered them immune from free market pressures even those with the resources and connections available to hide their assets offshore as shown in the panama papers don't have the ability to leverage their wealth just to store it offshore bitcoin and ethereum allow people from inside nation states to migrate their capital to the digital domain where it can be unshackled and highly fluid as a result of this ability to exit nation states will be forced to reduce the extortion of their constituents or else risk incentivizing an exodus of capital the same is true for ethereum sub-nations i expect the capital on ethereum to be fluid throughout its subnations from now until the end of time ethereum sub-nations are in direct competition with each other to attract capital and users if someone builds a subnation on ethereum that offers the same or better products or services for the same or fewer costs then we can expect capital and users to flow downstream into these new pools if an application charges too much for its service it risks risks being forked with a reduced fee or being replaced by a competitor offering a similar service maker dow compound and ave all offer sufficiently comparable services so that the fees that they charge keep the others in check the sovereign individual discussed in part one the nation offers scaffolding to the individual so that the individual can live their life with maximum freedom and autonomy nations that restrict freedom and autonomy from from the individual religions the ussr china tend to be replaced by ones that don't this is because there is no better way to organize an economy than leave people to their own devices so that the people can decide how best to provide value to the world by leveraging a combination of what their skills are and what they enjoy doing the opt-in nature of digital nations along with the free market free market competition of the applications on top of them preserves the sovereignty of the individual by giving the users maximum autonomy and freedoms in digital nations all users are admins in a world dominated by digital nations over nation states the physical location of capital and value is gone money and assets live solely on the internet each every single subnation on ethereum is just one transaction away and lives inside of a small device in your pocket the power this gives to the individual cannot be overstated you have the full force of the ethereum digital nation at your fingertips no matter what nation state that you are a part of or you cross into the purpose of a nation is to foster an economy the economy of digital nations are contained inside the interfat internet but will also manifest itself in the real world as well when a customer pays for the products or services of a business using bitcoin ether or die a transaction was made where no nation state was relevant the same business service or product could serve the same individual anywhere in the world and the transaction would appear largely the same this is the path to a single global community of humans the protocolization of money and finance via digital nations are the tools needed to break through the limits of each organizational scale that we have reached via the traditional nation state the economy of the world will become a single global economy when it operates under one single money and finance system that treats all users equally nation states businesses and individuals are all treated equally under the purview of the digital nation because no one is giving privileges that others do not have we can break through the glass ceiling of global coordination and generate a holistic economy of planet earth world building world building is the process of constructing an imaginary world sometimes associated with a whole fictional universe developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as history geography and ecology is a key task of many science fiction or fantasy writers world building often involves the creation of maps a backstory and people including social customs and in some cases an invented language for the world world building is the art of a fictitious universe that is realistic and coherent enough to capture the mind of an audience using a more expansive definition it reflects on the current state of ethereum ethereum is the new world it is a landscape of new opportunity waiting for settlers to come and settle upon it riches await those who dare unto enter uncharted territory and establish something of significance there those that venture forth into the unknown and cultivate the land they settle on are rewarded by the by the future users of their land unlike a fabricated world found in a fantasy novel or sci-fi world ethereum still obeys the laws of the universe it must generate a coherent setting where the real world problems are solved and that the current state of the outside world as well as the rest of ethereum impact what should and should not be built while ethereum is a blank slate it also answers to darwinian rules only what is fit will survive here's a quote from matt levine cryptocurrency enthusiasts keep relearning the lessons that regular finance learned decades ago and that you see a lot of financial history replaying itself sped up by observing cryptocurrency the story of cryptocurrency might also be the opposite that it's about traveling back in time to progressively forget the lessons of modern finance ethereum is a blank slate it is a blank slate that is quickly becoming populated with all kinds of financial and economic experiments with ethereum we have the opportunity to start fresh and construct a new financial paradigm from scratch we have the privilege of picking out the lessons of history that have worked while also being able to leave behind the ones that didn't it is likely that all successful financial mechanisms that humans have discovered will be replicated as applications on ethereum similarly the ill-fated phenomenon of hyper financialization that caused the 2008 crisis and the 2020 money printer gopur will likely not succeed on ethereum these things will not find themselves fit when thrown into the free market crucible that is ethereum the single contract kingdoms and multi-contract coalitions of ethereum make up the ethereum nation in my piece ethereum is an emergent structure i discussed how the d5 apps on ethereum coalesce over time into a single financial structure and how that structure is ethereum ethereum will be built by pioneers and pilgrims as they move westward into the new world setting up settle upon an empty plot a plot of land cultivate it and then incentivize others to join them in the fruits of their labor labor by having exposure to the upside of the land that they've built this is how ethereum will be built bear the banner all nations have their own culture they generate symbolic totems to symbolize their participation in something greater than themselves ernest becker in his book denial of death labels culture religion nations or any in-groups such as sports teams fraternities social clubs secret societies as immortality projects individuals are aware of their mortality and eventual death and they harness this fear of death by being a part of a system that is greater than themselves the constituent members of these systems come and go but the entity itself lives on sports teams replace all players with young talent but the team continues to compete leaders of nation states come and go but the nation itself persists persists fraternities gain an entirely new set of members every four years yet the ritual secrets and stories are passed on the cells that make up the human body are replaced once every seven years yet the mind body and spirit of the individual are still alive nations are immortal so long as their constituents believe in their power and their legitimacy digital nations are still in their infancy and much of their culture and symbols of these systems are just now emerging emerging bitcoiners wear the lightning bolt to illustrate the lightning lightning network ethereans wear the eth name in their name to signify their citizenship totems are a crucial sorry totems are a crucial component for the culture of a nation that they are symbols of meaning that the members of a nation can rally to and uphold together they generate this symbolism that we can all share together as a community community i have been wearing the black flag as a symbol of a bankless nation an unmarked flag illustrates the neutrality of these systems a flag with no marks and no colors reflects the removal of subjectivity from the bankless nation the colors stripes and shapes on a nation-state flag reflect their subjective this is good attitude as a black flag is the rejection of this attitude of governance i do not accept to be governed by the whims of others and i choose to par instead participate in a system that has been cultivated by the free market the black flag is a declaration of independence from the nations that come before it yet it is also a nation badass if you are part of the bankless nation bear the banner thanks for listening everyone
