foreign ation how you doing we are here today to talk about collective intelligence with Divya Siddharth and Raymond zong of verses this episode is about collective intelligence and we go into the ideas of composable local control basically Distributing decision making leveraging both a core principle of markets and democracy wonder the idea that the closest to a problem usually have the most knowledge and the greatest stake in its resolution so core part of the green pill movement is moving more control into localities and this is how the best Collective decisions are made we talk a lot about pure Tech and extractive Tech versus regenerative Tech and broadly about technology in service of regenerative economies is one of the favorite episodes that we've done on greenpill since it started I think Divya and Raymond are both Galaxy brain thinkers in this space and I'm so excited to bring them to you in this episode of green pill without further Ado I give you Divya and Raymond refi summer has arrived and cello is here for it cello is the layer 1 blockchain for the regenerative Finance movement it's fast Planet positive and built for the real world cello has committed towards producing a sustainable future from the very beginning and is the world's first carbon negative evm compatible layer 1 blockchain cell has become much more than a technology a currency a community or even just a layer one cello is a movement to create conditions of prosperity for everyone you can soon engage with all of this via green asset unit swap pools on cello benefiting reforestation and other regenerative products through the toucan protocol moss and more refi is also about the health of communities and Resource Network is creating bankless infrastructure for circular trade and Mutual Credit networks to benefit small businesses and local economies all on cello follow along on Twitter learn more about how cello is accelerating refi summer for a positive impact on people communities and the planet if you're attending ECC visit to cello Saloon to learn about what's happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts the Opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto Community with web3 support and a non-custodial wallet Opera lets you access defy apps quickly and easily the Opera wallet has buy sell and swap features and of course lets you view your beautiful nfts but the browser still lets you use any crypto wallet extension you prefer giving you the choice and flexibility for the website World Opera lets you view and manage all of your assets across all the blockchains all at once and offers seamless multi-chain support between ethereum Bitcoin polygon binding exchange and other EVMS and layer twos but Opera goes even deeper than that Opera has a built-in home page for crypto natives with the Opera crypto corner with price charts news feeds nft updates to make sure you are always on top of your game and it even has Discord and telegram integrated natively into the browser that's crazy Opera is truly building the battle station for the crypto World check out Opera both on mobile with Android and iOS apps and on desktop too hey how's it going fabulous how are you pretty good thanks great to have you both here uh would you mind doing some quick intros and bios yeah I'd be thrilled to um well hello I'm Divya um bios have always been tough for me but I am currently a political Economist at Microsoft I am a researcher in Residence at the radical exchange Foundation a coast Steward of verses which is how I know Raymond um and I also work closely with the medigov project and the Ostrom workshop and I guess Perhaps it is emerging the constellation of things that I care about which are generally around technology emerging Tech and governance and questions of collective intelligence as a way to govern emerging Tech um and I try to do this through a bunch of different substrates only because I think we don't have the answers and so working across contacts and institutions is the best I can do for now and uh it also embodies the ethos of pluralism uh I hope in my own life so beautiful I can't wait to dive in to all those themes uh how about you Raymond um hey everyone I'm Raymond I am uh coaster of verses along with Divya um and also a co-founder of a project called Commonwealth which is an all-in-one governance platform um and otherwise I could active in experimenting with tools for digital governance and Collective organizing amazing two themes I'm really interested in diving in on on this episode so what uh what's on your minds I guess Divia you want to go first yeah well as we were talking about right before recording um thinking about decentralization is top of mind for me right now and in particular I think this is quite timely uh with obviously moves in the market what does it mean when we call for decentralization and reframing aiming for more decentralization uh into better decentralization what is the right kind of decentralization that we should be aiming for in a system and I think this is I mean on one hand it's a political Theory question and my work Started With You Know Field work uh with social movements and political institutions in India and in the US and thinking about how they coordinate action and so that's kind of where some of my background is at um and decentralization is quite important from that perspective but it's also obviously a core part of the socio-technical conversations we're now having um around web3 and there's incredible promise in decentralization that I think comes from focusing on what we want out of decentralization and how we structure decentralization to get there um through what you know we or I call subsidiarity instead of redundancy which I think is probably too broad to get into with what are you thinking about question but in essence what is good decentralization and how do we get there is top of Mind great okay all right what kind what is good decentralization what types of collective intelligence do we want and how do we facilitate that subsidiarity versus redundancy um all right I've got some questions that I'm going to ask but I'm going to ask that for parity I'm gonna ask Raymond what what are you thinking about right now Raymond yes um I think I mean all of the all the things that you've just mentioned um we're building all of these new systems and putting them out in the world and seeing some of them you know completely um some of them grow enormously large and some of them Crash and Burn and it's just like such an interesting time um to be to be participating in this um things I'm thinking about include how do we just like think about things from a very structural perspective like how can create we create digital spaces that allow for the kinds of interactions and Collective this kind of collective intelligence to emerge and then practically bridging that a lot with mechanism design and product design so like what do these systems look like when they're out in the wild and the first people in the world start to use them and how do they grow into institutions after that right it's actually a really good lead-in to uh I think your work at verses and I think that I've played with some of those sites interdependence space and uh can you tell us a little bit about how versus plays into into the that sort of field of design yeah I think a versus is a gathering space in sort of an open space foremost or around people who were you know writers and researchers and artists and technologists really thinking about how do we build these interdependent digital Futures and how do we create a space where we are meaningfully working towards that goal in a loose confederation so itself sort of decentralized and um for example the pluriverse artifact which I'm much more familiar with since I was one of the leads on that um try to articulate what does it look like to have a world in which many multiple ways of being and knowing interact with each other and to say that that world is actually more powerful and stronger and can grow faster than sort of the monocultural technological space we've been given uh and so again that requires right people who are thinking about the technological side people are thinking about you know the art and the how does that world feel and the philosophy behind it people are thinking about designing the political economic mechanisms for that world and I think versus can bring some of those folks together but really the reason to me it's a gathering space is well we have no interest in sort of being the stewards of the plural verse first and foremost right we have an interest in putting that concept out and bringing in as many voices and people as possible who are already thinking about these things and really fitting ourselves into what's missing in this ecosystem ecological space rather than like what is what is versus going to be so so can we get just get through a a simple use case of versus I've got pluriverse.world up on my browser right now and that's also going to be in the show notes it's basically a place where we can go and we can read about um a vision for the plural of plural verse as opposed to the metaverse I think a world where many worlds fit and then you can sign it annotate it and Fork it and kind of a test that this is a shared value system that that you have and so this is a collective intelligence in action did I just summarize the use case fairly well like any comments on that no I think that's great Raymond yeah I think it's um it's definitely very nascent and we've gone through this journey of for starting out with the Declaration of interdependence where you could sign to the plural verse artifact where you can sign and create something of your own and we're continuing to explore like what these patterns mean and whether we can develop them to a whole language that lets people sort of start to prefigure and create the pluribus amazing yeah I know I've uh contacted you a couple weeks ago because I'm looking to launch an essay uh with Aaron McMillan about uh practical pluralism and we're going to use versus Tech in order to launch that so I think making a platform for other people to build social movements could be an obvious extension of that uh since you all have so much traction with the pluriverse world and I think interdependence Dot online was the other one is that right yeah exactly and I think that is a core piece of the goal like how do we build experiments that others can build on top of and that itself is us you know this concept of prefiguration I think is core two versus and to me which is how do you create the world that you want to see now you're not waiting for it you build that ethos into everything you put out in the moment and that means that when people use and interact with and engage with what you're creating it is already that interaction is the world you want to see right um and I think that is very core to what versus is trying to do where we as a small Collective aren't going to replace the metaverse are we but we can pre-figure what that would look and feel like and the more people use that pre-figurative technology the more we are we are doing that transition already and I think that's what we're so excited about people using that um platform in the way that you're describing exactly and although versus is very nascent and you know we're at this point a collective of people who want to see something happen and are reaching towards it in different ways um it is that principle that I think underlies what is possible when you are small when you're not going to achieve scale through something that is uh you know scales scale without change it's scale through Federation rather than scale through like peer growth what I respect so much about both of you is that you're just such deep thinkers on the theoretical level and you clearly have such a strong command of these Concepts from the theory but you're experimenting with these deeply beautiful sights of putting those Theory into action and I almost see you in this in this Theory action learning loop as you explore the space is is that a fair uh observation I would say it's an aspiration so if it also functions as an observation then we're doing something okay sounds good um well I'd love to dive in on the work that you're doing in the collective intelligence space and I'll ask a very broad question that um I think I'd just be curious to have you take the wheel and steer a little bit both of you but what types of collective intelligence do we want and and how do we create it uh I'd be curious here I guess uh from you first Raymond yeah um so I think like even starting from within versus like the community I work on governance at verses and have been sort of focused on that and were a reasonably diverse Collective alongside along like disciplinary um I want disciplinary dimensions and measures and we all think about things in very different ways and so how do we like go about reconciling all the different directions and uh preferences and that we have as a group and so we have been doing a lot of experimenting there um and figuring out like a lot of this is not systematized right now it's happening in conversations around the group but as technologists we're also thinking about like how could these things extend to design patterns that could like help people Express their preferences and other other governance situations um and to do this we've been looking at tools like digital democracy tools and polis and lumio and other systems for um we're doing this that are out in the world today yeah I think given the Raymond has done such an admirable job sort of describing collective intelligence in a specific context I'm going to just zoom way out and say you know why collective intelligence there's something that feels inherently good about it I mean we want to be intelligence and we we like collectives but I think to me what is separately powerful about the concept of collective intelligence is that it does something that nothing else can do which is aggregate everyone's unique insights and perspectives in such a way that they are actionable so not everything that anyone does together it functions as collective intelligence I think we look at things like markets and democracy and even bureaucracy as interesting examples of something that is somewhat efficacious as collective intelligence because people talking together is not on its own collective intelligence right there it's it's a substrate for it but then you need to structure that in such a way that you end up with outputs that are usable and get you somewhere and so I think when we think about collective intelligence or when I think about it in in my research it is about what is the best way to do that structure without losing the collectivity of it because if you over structure something as we've seen across democracy and markets and bureaucracies then it's no longer collective intelligence you've gone too far in One Direction right and so I think even if we Zoom all the way into something like versus we are incredibly emergent as an organization and so having too much structure kind of kills that emergence and then what are we doing but having too little structure means that there's no way through which we can you know funnel our actions and get to somewhere Collective and I think Bitcoin is an incredible example of that I mean it's always a tension between how much structure you put in and how much community building and emergence that you enable uh and that's really a core of also the mechanisms that we work on a radical exchange and digital democracy more broadly because at the end of the day your execution arm has to be somewhat expert focused it's somewhat institutional right pandemics say Taiwan did an incredible job with pandemics and I think it's a great example of collective intelligence and that's because they use the collective intelligence mechanisms to define the problem to Source Solutions and then they routed those Solutions through experts and institutions it's not the case that collective intelligence ran the day end to end and really figuring out at what points in a governance process you can best leverage collective intelligence and when to separate a mechanism in an institution like I think we are experiencing small examples of that across all of our work every day and I think there's such a large opportunity to be working on this problem right now because we've got a Global Communication System that has reached maturity over the last 30 years and then we've also got these nascent governance tools that allow us to really configure the way these collective intelligence systems are built and it seems feels like an existential question for the 21st century what you're working on I certainly think so and same to you yeah um so how do we you know like say I'm a project maintainer I guess I am a project maintainer that's trying to balance uh I love how you use the word pre-figuration so presets and configuration are two different ways presets mean are like don't let don't make me think and configuration is give me all of the options in the world and like you know how do I how do I balance that as a Founder do I build for convention or configuration are there any sort of tips that you've that you've learned to know I imagine it's like almost like a rubber band where you can stretch it in one way or another like uh and then it breaks if you get too far in One Direction how do I know exactly where I stand if I'm a Founder working in the space yeah I think this is as I said before it's a dance basically right and one of the most instructive things that can be brought into that dance to me are what are the types of and maybe this is just switching the question what are the types of configurations that can be pre-figurative over time Progressive decentralization for example let's say quite specifically like that is something where you have the process is as pre-figurative as the outcome um you want to get to a place where you're building for Community agency and you recognize that structure is required to get there and structure means that you don't start out in that place and in fact if you did start out in that place you would never get to your outcome and so instead of setting up a prefigurative outcome you set up a pre-figurative process and then you progressively decentralize uh and I think this is something it's dicey right because you may end up not decentralizing that's the the problem but I think it is probably better than setting something up that is you know decentralized on its face but in practice is fairly structured it's the Tyranny structuralist structurelessness problem um and then you can't progressively decentralize because you haven't put in place any progress over time you think that you're starting out exactly where you want to end up so I think that kind of mechanism of process can be as pre-figurative as outcome got it okay kind of reminds me of italics um article about legitimacy which is the higher high order social acceptance of a system and there's multiple ways to get to the legitimacy you can get by legitimacy of outcome or legitimacy by process and I think I heard in your answer um that the process can be a way of of kind of like walking the line of uh of progressively decentralizing yeah and I think it's it's a question of also I mean practically what are you decentralizing to words and who are the people that you're trying to serve and are they best served by the form of decentralization that you've chosen I mean I think that this is take something like labor unions for example they're not decentralized right I mean in fact the idea is that you take a bunch of autonomous individuals and you create something Collective out of them and in doing that you lose one form of decentralization which is the fact that they are acting autonomously and suddenly you are you're promising to act as a collective in a way that may hurt you Margaret Levi has this wonderful concept called a shared community of Fate she does a lot of you know work with ethnography work with unions and it's kind of this idea that you expand your Community of Faith such that you're suddenly willing to sacrifice for more people like if you go on strike you may not get paid that day and that could be really bad for your family but you're willing to do that because you've expanded your community of fate and to me that is a it's not quite decentralization but it takes what we may want want out of decentralization which is local control and agency and it puts you into another format and maybe there are some types of decentralized technologies that can enable this people are looking into that and I think it's really interesting platform co-ops Etc and maybe not right and I think that that was the pre-figurative choice for something like a union because there is a core collectivity that has to be found there um and some projects aren't like that I mean you don't always want to expand that particular notion of sacrifice in everything like versus for example is going to be loose end to end because that is the type of of structure that enables us to get to the outcomes that we want I see so different different tensions on that configuration convention Spectrum will be right for different projects it sounds like um I really want to pinch and zoom on something you said which is instead of I think you just said what do we actually want from decentralization you said local control and agency I'd love to just pinch and zoom on that so you know why do we want those things from decentralization how does decentralization help us accomplish those and I guess this could maybe be a lead into the excellent article that you wrote in the Wired Magazine about how the decentralization debate is focused on the wrong question um the degree of decentralization rather than the type so um we'd love to dive into all all in all in any of those things yeah absolutely well a quick rundown of the decentralization argument I think is this um we excessive centralization has many problems right it has problems of it can't anticipate issues uh it has problems of you know technocratic control it has problems of uh information aggregation like think about Central planning versus markets why does central planning generally fail they just couldn't get the information necessary sort of high again and pilani's concept of tacit knowledge you just can't capture this stuff in a centralized way and you can't satisfy people's desires and you can't give them control over their lives so that's centralization these are the things we're working against what kinds of decentralization actually works against those things right how do we how do we solve those problems well you can have certain types of decentralized systems that are really good at information aggregation you can have decentralized systems that are really good at people providing decision making input into things or you can have decentralized systems that are focused on architectural decentralization which in the blockchain space you know we call redundancy distributed Ledger technology can be decentralized via redundancy and that was created for security constraints but in many types of actual Technologies and outcomes that we want to see out of web3 redundancy isn't the best way either to achieve security or to achieve all of the purported benefits of decentralization so if we take something like data um what is the way that data interacts with global redundancy well we already know it's incredibly inefficient in a lot of different ways it's basically operating at the speed of distrust which isn't the speed at which we normally like to operate and it's not the most efficient speed at which we operate which is why everything from companies nonprofits they spend so much time building trust so they can work better right and so why are we trying to operate the speed of distrust when instead the type of decentralization we want is something like subsidiarities so to Define subsidiarity it is essentially local autonomy as much as possible and then scale through Federation because you need scale problems we have at scale um you can't just have localism you also need to get to solving Global challenges through local communities interacting in incredibly strong um and successful ways and so I think when we go back to the example of data well instead of something that is redundant and you know is on one hand highly private private ownership of data and on the other hand highly public in terms of the way that data is stored what if we had subsidiarity where people could pool data it could be much more productive because lots of different types of Technologies could have access to that data through scale but you still have local control over the structure of the right system the network structure that comes to mind for me and this may be not a good one uh I'll be curious here for your feedback is the the layer two scaling strategy for the ethereum network where instead of just putting more power into the base layer we've got these like subsidiary networks layer twos that are actually have localized and then you just roll back up to the Federated structure is that an example of subsidiary I'm not even saying the word right subsidiarity yeah I think it's actually a really interesting example um that vitalik has even named as um his intention has been you know you keep the base layer extremely neutral and that allows for people to build more experiments on top and do things such as retroactive public goods funding Democratic voting systems and and by Nature like the the base layer remains extremely architecturally decentralized so that it allows these other centers to emerge um which feels like the kind of the same the same thing happening with um right Federation subsidiarity but also there's a saying that you know you when you decentralize things like power accumulates in a different place and centralization happens somewhere else and so the question is like when you decentralize something does that recentralize all the power in one place or does it allow this like ecosystem of flourishing Alternatives that's like pluralistic to emerge so L2 is definitely a very um solid kind of example of that yeah totally and that's such an excellent point about the layer twos because of their local agency have the ability to focus on things that aren't a fit for the credibly neutral bass layer uh it kind of reminds me of the 50 states in the United States like how they're kind of little Laboratories of democracy and then if well in theory if things work out at the state level they could be implemented at the federal level so uh once you've opened up my ideas to this idea of subsidiarity decentralization I'm starting to kind of see it in a bunch of different places what are the most promising models of subsidiarity that that y'all are excited about I think that there are a bunch of different substrates on which I'm excited about subsidiarity so one when you say you see it everywhere I think that's an inherent property of decentralization by subsidiary in the sense that look fully decentralized systems where Everyone's atomized an individual just will not go on I mean that's not a stable state for an ecosystem right people will come together they're start to farm collectives like that type of decentralization is just it's it's not the way that humans are and it's not a stable State on the other hand pure centralization is also a highly unstable State because you can't actually operate a totally top-down organization in reality the world's too complicated people can't be instructed perfectly like you're going to do some sort of federation um you're going to decentralize in some ways and so I think most of what we actually have in the world is just trying to navigate this tension without being explicit about it and some organizations do better than others I mean let's take like a very old company for example this a lot of reasons that old companies get disrupted is because they can't move quickly and I think this is a lack of collective intelligence at the corporation level I mean it's the fact that they didn't succeed at subsidiarity small agile team couldn't move as quickly as they could they couldn't do new things they couldn't Federate those new things up to the large level and now suddenly you're disrupted right and so on the flip side what are exciting examples of subsidiarity I mean to me uh this is one of the reasons that I think does are really cool because instead of trying to be entire entities in and of themselves you see a lot of coordination between Dows to accomplish things together which it's not yet as structured in some ways as I would like it I think it's it's tending more to the decentralization side and less to the subsidiarity side but there is a necessity of subsidiary that is emerging I mean people are already like sub-dials for example well why is that coming up because it's difficult to run an organization without that and so let's do that intentionally and on purpose and I think identity is a really interesting place to start thinking about this because identity Solutions you know we sort of started out in the technology technology space on one hand by wanting totally Universal identity Solutions everyone has a public and a private key or everyone has the same biometric solution or whatever right you want something that works for everyone and we're realizing that's not how humans have ever done identity that's not what it means to actually operate with an identity in the world my identity is a product of all the things and places that make me who I am and therefore it's probably much more productive for a subsidiary ecosystem to emerge and it's already emerging it's emerging with things like bright idea and web of trust identity it's merging with some of the personhood protocols new work on still bound tokens I mean all of these different things provide a plurality of mechanisms that are suddenly solving a problem that we thought had to be Universal you know and Universal identity Solutions at the same time are failing right and so we're recognizing universality can't work at the same time as we're growing the subsidiary alternative and I think when that happens it's very promising my one note of caution is let's remember the failure modes because one thing that I think it's important to remember is that all of the problems we're trying to solve are not problems of the last decade or the last three decades or over the last century these are the types of problems that humans have been contending with and building governance structures for and trying to negotiate and build trade-offs into their lives for forever and so when we think about identity I mean this has been true for hundreds of years that we have to figure out what part of our personality and what part of ourselves and our families and the place we're from to bring somewhere new um what do you say on the first day of getting to a new city right like these are the kinds of things that define Humanity what do we identify with are we in a more communal Society are we in a more individual Society so let's learn from those types of things and you know Universal systems I think are one of the things that have failed over time and so we'll continue to fail not just because they're architecturally difficult but because history shows us that that's not the direction in which Humanity tends to go Raymond anything to add yeah I think one When you mention identity like the place where that has really evolved for me on the internet has been the evolution of identity and social networks and that's everything from how people are shown and presented as the in the interfaces to each other online to how they think about how they present themselves online and what parts of themselves they feel comfortable exposing and we've kind of like gone through this Speed Run of that in the last 20 years or so where initially like social networks are pretty homogeneous and then there were these kind of like crowded places where everybody was sort of streaming in a devoid and something that people are seeing more recently is like you have the emergence of these internet scenes and subcultures and people are organically you know recreating these forms of of subsidiary and localism and you will go to some of these scenes and they'll be very explicit that like that's exactly what they're trying to do people use words like cozy uh which is like as a meme um people talk about digital spaces and and crafting identity for themselves online um because these are like really high stakes environments for a lot of people involved and the same way that you know this evolved in in human societies for over thousands of years like we're seeing digital spaces gradually ReDiscover the same ideas like when you enter a space how do you conduct yourself can we make it so that a space is more habitable to newcomers and people people have limited a limited blast radius when there's conflict or something goes wrong and all of these things are collectively bringing us closer to the internet that like actually feels more like more like the real world I'm gonna add that to my Dow vocabulary blast radius when something goes wrong good meme immutable X is the layer

where the nuggets are not me I guess I'll throw it to you Divya what I'm thinking about with collector collects intelligence part of the time is the stakes like what are the stakes of our project right now and to me the stakes are really high in the sense that um you know I've been reading Lewis Mumford recently and his work on authoritarian and Democratic techniques and sort of this idea that there is an inherent kind of technology and Technical Systems have been inherently authoritarian or inherently Democratic over history and you know I think that we often think about both authoritarianism and democracy as nation-state Concepts right uh for example things that are in the U.S tech ecosystem are democratic and things that are in authoritarian countries Tech ecosystem Russia say our authoritarian but in reality I think those are the types of Concepts that can be applied to small-scale subunits very productively and therefore the stakes of something like collective intelligence are both normative in the sense that you know we want to build for democracy because we believe that it is just but there also there's a stake in building good collective intelligence systems to prove the case for a democracy such that that's the direction in which we build um and I feel that that to me is the core of why we do this work because we not only want to say you know these are good things to do but also let's make these the most effective systems we've ever seen so that we keep building in these types of directions and so I think for all of these different parts of it that I've been advocating on whether it's Identity or you know data transfer and data ownership or organizational innovation it's the idea to constantly be making the collective intelligence work better than other types of solutions and so for identity it's really important to say we're not giving something up in terms of ability to use the system ease of use you know scale through Federation growth all of those kinds of things because we've chosen a democratic approach instead we are building something that will solve the problems of the world much better um and one of my kind of core examples of this when I was in India I interacted a lot and sort of worked on the fringes of centralized identity system like athod and I think this is an incredibly concerning project to me um and if for folks who aren't familiar you know it's biometric identity for every citizen it's basically required for a lot of interactions most interactions at all with the state and you know a lot of critics of adad will point to the fact that it's used to track people uh of different religions um it has major privacy issues because it's stored totally centrally and all of that but to me the real core issue is something that is it's a concentration of power issue that that results in all of these other things right but critics sometimes miss the fact that adad works in some cases like we have to we have to be able to vocalize that it is useful for people to have identities it's useful for people to be able to interact directly with the government in certain ways it's useful for Direct Cash transfers to be possible when they weren't possible before it has disintermediated some forms of corruption right it's not all bad and so if we're going to try to criticize and be better than systems like that and on that I think is just an example of the type of system that exists in many different places across the world then our alternative has to have the pros has to be able to do those kind of things and not have the cons and so I think that is the the task of people who are in the space and and what I see is as my task in our task is to prove that point through efficacy as well as through what we think is just amazing Raymond anything to add um yeah I think Divi and I definitely both come to this space with uh this like spirit and natural interest in democracy and pluralism that like this feels like it has the right Vibes for us um but it's hard to advocate for any kind of ideology that way even if it is democracy and when we when we are doing what I've been involved in projects like designing the governance for a Dao or even just like introducing the concept of governance it's definitely um very hard to approach these things directly and that's why we have to think about we have to think of all these mechanisms and even like the concept of generalizing this to collective intelligence to turn into something that is like appealing and useful for people um and I think it's only going to be you know when we have really evolved tools and prototypes and and pre-figurative artifacts out there that people can experiment with and say like actually this is something that that would be really nice for my organization or the way that I designed my protocol to like use this identity system as opposed to something that that keeps everything on chain and in public um it's only when we get there and that the solutions are very appealing to people that will know that um this is something that can stick around because we're definitely we're in the very early days of um of this decentralization and watching how Tech has evolved over the last 20 years you know there's a lot of people who see Echoes of early sentiment around crowdsourcing and Wikipedia and all these information systems and they saw that a lot of that ended up quite centralized in the end yeah I think so I guess I'm wondering you know what is maximum collective intelligence look like like what is maximum coordination Play Play It Forward 10 years and tell me what you know what we could see in the year 2032 if we if we maximum or maximize our ability to create coordination and collective intelligence at scale like can you take me into that future I think I think it kind of looks like Good Vibes it looks like um people being in you know in in harmony with the the computer systems that are using um and the IT connecting people to other people around them it feels like it's the opposite of atomization in a lot of ways yeah I think that's right and I think that I mean let's take its sort of the interactions that we have day-to-day right like who makes decisions over me well uh my workplace um probably my government uh probably some measure of like the people who are around me in local space have some voice in my life uh my family and friends I mean all of these kinds of places in which decision making happens and then there's a lot of decision making I have so little control over right like U.S foreign policy what's going on at the UN I mean these are things that are going to happen in our collective intelligence world still and we don't want to have maximum coordination in the sense that we get rid of Institutions and replace them with some form of emergence so what are the best ways what are the best institutions that can best funnel collective intelligence is what we will have in the maximum collective intelligence world I think and so that will look like you know doing types of work that are we we know are needed for by the community where the community can be local or Global or distributed or anywhere in between there is a way to figure out what types of work what types of resources are are generally required and a way to plug into that and to provide those resources like that type of end-to-end mechanism which is sort of What markets are supposed to do right I mean at the end of the day that is something that sort of works it's not the case that the price mechanism hasn't succeeded at kind of doing that a defining need and filling that need but collective intelligence is better than markets and therefore you know it is markets but we we upgrade those mechanisms to allow for much more granular preference input then we can do a much better job of that that's also true on a more explicitly political side we can do a much better job of you know right now I should have some control over various types of decisions that are being made around me how do we make that control better and how do we make it such that it is institutionally defined in a way that I have exit in voice over institutions so right now I may have some institutions that I'm familiar with say I'm like a big fan of the ACLU or something well what does that mean for me personally very little they email me once in a while and ask for money and then that's most of my interaction with the ACLU what if there were much more responsive institutions that I could both have voice over in the sense that I meaningfully change the way that they acted and that I could exit from and move to other institutions so that I could vote with my feet as well like I think that is a part of the maximum collective intelligence world and there are a lot of pieces of this and this is true for political philosophies that are process oriented in nature that do have to come from us setting up good processes at the beginning but for me I think about this almost similar to growth compounding like economic growth compounding you know a one percent annual growth rate over 50 years is like 64 growth and a five percent annual growth rate sorry 64 growth in 50 years I think and a five percent annual growth rate is like a thousand percent in in 50 years I mean that's the difference that compounding can make for something like economic growth I think that's a similar type of difference that compounding can make for something like better decision making better governance better collective intelligence where right now even the types of things I can articulate are constrained we're nowhere near the best political economies we can have they're constrained but if I if I can get us to three percent annual growth on collective intelligence then boy in 50 years we'll have like 500 percent better collective intelligence than we have now and I couldn't even imagine what that looks like and so I think you know while I have a world in mind I really think about that compounding as the layer in which you know differences can be made amazing I want to say back to you a couple of things that I heard and let me know if if I got it and this is also serves to hopefully summarize for the listeners so it sounds like by the way I just want to thank you for taking my question completely seriously I just asked you to reach 10 years into the future and tell me what it was going to be like which is a totally obnoxious question but I think it's it's it's fun um so I think that we're trying to create coordination mechanisms that take what type of resources are required and get to those outputs of providing those resources and the opportunity with going for me the Industrial Age uh to the information age is that we can now get higher resolution data input into those systems you gave an example of like I think it was the ACLU emailing you once a month and like your only data input is like do they get do they get money from you or not but um the future high resolution data inputs are almost like with quadratic funding where we get 700 000 data points about what an ecosystem cares about um in a quarter and a credibly neutral substrate to input those systems and within that credibly neutral substrate you have to have a balance of pre-figuration which is presets and configuration to allow people to still be able to input their preferences conveniently but to the the configuration bit comes in with the ability to express your preferences in all these different directions um and then I think that like the the right to exit is probably important at some point in there like to withdraw your consent from participating in these institutions I always think of Institutions maybe isn't even the right word like we're creating a coordination substrate and institutions feels like an industrial age word um and then the last thing I'll say is compounding coordination over time creates this sort of Event Horizon that we can't see over and that's why my question was so obnoxious to even ask you what this all looks like so that's me repeating back to you what I heard I'm curious where I got that right where I got that wrong just trying to summarize it and put in other words for the for the listeners here yeah I mean I think that's a fabulous summary uh and possibly more coherent than the input so thank you for that collective intelligence in action um I like the idea of moving beyond institutions I think that you know my definition of institution is something like shared Norms processes and goals in an entity in a wrapper right and you know in an Ideal World we wouldn't use the word Institution for that because I think when you say the word institution what comes to mind is like old marble edifice maybe a Bank inside and so you know I think that shared Norms processes and goals are the type of structure that we want to keep building to get to this future we need a way through which coordination and collective intelligence can flow and I guess one of the reasons I use the word institutions is is because I sometimes become concerned about the fact that we want to move totally away from institutions and intermediaries and things like this so what we're building instead is still an institution like we can't get away from building institutions um and you know perhaps it's a language question but I think that it's important to reflect on the fact that we are building institutions whether we like it or not and so let's build good institutions on purpose um and I think maybe that's a core part of my sort of Maximum collective intelligence future is that we we recognize that when we are coordinating what we're building as a rapper for shared Norms processes and goals and that thing is important to build on its own on purpose rather than as a purely emergent structure because we want some things to last over time we want one simple rate of stability as well as a substrate of growth I think about actually our friend Jackie and versus introduced me to this concept of pace layers from Stuart brand and that's like this idea that change happens on a bunch of different levels at different speeds and so the top speeds are like fashion and art and commerce and then the middle speeds are like infrastructure and governance and the slowest speeds are culture and nature and when we think about you know at what layer institutions operate I would say at all of them and you need very stable institutions in some sense at some of the cultural layers as well as very fast institutions at some of the higher layers right and so maybe maybe we should co-create a different a different word for that packet of things but I think it's important to recognize that it will always be a part of how we organize ourselves framing anything to add there I feel like we're going we're going at like 100 miles per hour I don't know if you want to jump on the train definitely um definitely thinking a lot about fluid institutions um and and governance systems as like examples of those but also um groups like like versus and other you know other other and Bitcoin and other organizations out there as being examples of this or or working on creating this and all of these organizations are experimenting with um new models and you know they don't fit into the mold of traditional organizations um i i find I mean I I find it very reassuring in all this chaos to be able to like lean on the word institutions that's the thing that we're trying to create like but that feels good yeah the meme you know there's certain memes that have come out of this conversation that are just sticking in my brain and the combination of fluid institutions I know just kind of like tickled my brain a little bit to think about an institution but it's not archaic and decaying its fluid and it's does that mean I guess it just takes higher resolution inputs and can respond to more more data how would you define a fluid institution or is that just a word that you just made up it feels right um responsiveness definitely um some larger sense of like more holistic uh it serves a more holistic role and takes into account preferences more holistically um I'd love to pinch and zoom on Divi you said that you were kind of like when I challenged the word institutions I I think that you reacted with a certain amount of um pushback that like we shouldn't abandon our old institutions I don't want to put words in your mouth but um I guess I'm just wondering like is there a a spectrum between like our Industrial Age institutions to fluid institutions to web scale coordination substrates and what is a um what is an effective way of taking advantage of of the novel but without moving too far away from the tried and true you know like how do we oscillate between between those two things I guess I just wanted to pinch and zoom on that because it seemed like there was some daylight between us and how we view these things yeah yeah maybe I I mean one is that I have quite an expand also say you know what about like Bronze Age institutions right things like community and family um are much older and are also types of shared norms and processes and goals and you know institutions like there are some institutions that have been with us for you know a while but not that long like nation states um that I think are quite interesting in that interregnum between things that are feel old but are actually somewhat new and I think that something like nation states may be something that we would agree on or not have daylight over need to be massively changed right because the more the more the world becomes complex the more the substrate of coordination that we need either goes down to the local level or up to the global level and so then we have sort of like a a an archaic intermediary perhaps in the form of the nation state but to me that's not necessarily just a step forward that's also a real understanding of our the historical contingency of nation states I mean some of the ways that original Nations state AIDS you know emerged out of corporate forms in some senses and and you know out of Empires and those types of Institutions are actually quite recent in the grand scheme of things and so um to me I would say am I wedded to the institutions of the last 100 years not necessarily but what I am wedded to is one the concept of Institutions like the idea that what we are doing when we are taking these types of actions is partially but not only institution building and that that in fact is a good thing because we want institutions to channel ourselves through as well as we want other things and then two to look into the history of institution I mean I love like David graybear and David wenger's work for this for example where I think when they describe different types of governance processes they're also describing types of institutional Arrangements over thousands of years um and therefore using an Institutional lens can be very helpful so if we ground ourselves in the present moment and think about well what do we want out of Technology you know in the next 10 years well I think what we want is an understanding of the things that have worked for a really long time which to me are at least sort of like good laterally balanced in institutional interactions and the types of local control that have been a part of human society forever as well as now we need something new right we need to contend with problems at global scale quickly and urgently and that's different and we can't always purely Look Backwards for something like that so then we have a new technology that can do those layers in a way that nothing else could now we can gather those types of preferences as you were talking about uh in a way that we couldn't before as Raymond mentioned right these fluid institutions that's something that maybe we couldn't have done that we can't troll history for but so much of the inputs to those fluid institutions we can and now we have technologies that can Federate and scale what we have often and always wanted to do uh so the question for you is is ethereum an institution yeah okay yeah it is quite amazing institutional vocabulary it has Tech which is definitely got it not all institutions have have you know maybe that much that much Tech mm-hmm elements I mean I would say like language is an institution for example right I mean institutions don't have to be things that can be approached in a shared way that contains shared knowledge and processes to me are institutions like a piece of art can become an institution um and those are the types of things that we come together over so like yes ethereum is an institution also many of the things that are built on ethereum are institutions then you might ask yourself one might ask oneself what isn't an institution I mean am I ever safe right I think that you know there are types of things when we move between types of Institutions like versus there were a bunch of people that came together before we wrote the Declaration and it wasn't an institution at that point and in fact we were in the process of becoming an institution and it's not easy I mean it takes work and you have to figure out what you are approaching in a shared way and so I think that you know there are things also I will say that are not institutions and that is you know part of the substrate the Ecology of humanity so the the Oxford dictionary definition of institution is an established law practice or custom so to me established means that it's highly legitimate it has a high amount of social order so you know we're having this is that how does that land for you as a definition Margaret Levi actually who may be defined slightly more way and perhaps it's really just the word established and maybe established means different things to different people but I would replace established with something like you know shared and made legitimate or something like that because established kind of in it implies a point of view established who thinks something is established right and I think I don't that is actually maybe one of the reasons you push on institutions to start with is that it it assumes a third party point of view and it's legitimated by an outsider and that's not what we want we want institutions that are inside legitimated we're saying we are an institution and it makes it an institution and like that really is the difference between me and the Oxford handbook but you know I think that institutions can be legitimated in that emergent way and that expands a definition usefully right yeah and established kind of implies an entrenchedness entrenchment that I think is maybe a feature in some places like you know with Bitcoin you know it'll always be there um but the entrenchment means that you can't get away from it also so um I guess that's where I have an aversion to that definition um okay last question is there anything that I didn't ask that you want to talk about and I guess Raymond will uh we'll start with you I think I think we covered a lot um there are definitely many more things we could talk about that way I know and explore I know to have you back um all right David how about you yeah I mean hopefully we will in our lives talk about many more things uh I guess to me and maybe it's just a concluding thought like it feels like there is something of an open window of space and Technologies often open up such a window where we can reimagine our shared institutions let's say and ourselves perhaps and you know it's rare to have such a window that's what brought me to this space I sort of like was working on other questions of democracy and politics and cooperatives and kind of came in here because it felt like an open window and I I mean I'm really grateful to you and to so many people in this ecosystem and to forcing that window open like keeping it open and so I guess I'm just I I hope that folks kind of recognize the Rarity and also the urgency of something like an open window where you can actually change the way that institutional arrangements are and the gradient for that change is not always great you know like the the default mode of where that change is going is like reconcentrating power and giving us mostly what we already have that's always true and yet some open windows allow us to redirect that gradient and it's a tough job and the most you can do is redirect the gradient like that I do believe like you can't build the world from scratch you can you can divert the river and like I'm I'm excited that so many people are interested in that River diversion and I guess I'm just grateful to be a part of that space and and hope that people feel that and can work towards it totally so if I'm a green pill listener and I kind of want to uh steer us away from the status quo and steer us away from the failure modes what can I do um what what are the the Practical everyday muscles that I can be building or things that I can focus on it's probably different for everyone like everybody has a different set of things that they bring at the table um and there are a lot of pieces that need to come together for this to happen right there's the we've been talking about a lot of the um political economy and the ideas behind it but as well as like all the work that it will take to operationalize this um from putting people together to to Building Technology to um making it making it a meme in the real world yeah yeah control then it's and this movie is a is a trivial answer but it's it's about how do you control your your locality right like that is why it's context specific it's it's because this is an inherently uh grounded way of looking at things but you know what levers do you have to pull are you a technologist well can you work on building these types of Technology are you already building a kind of technology that can move in these directions you know uh what type of role do you have in the world do you have a community that you're a part of that you want to experiment with these kinds of things in I mean my first big governance process is I lived in a 50 Co-op for a while and we operated on consensus and like you know I I wasn't building any Tech or building any you know outside institutional capacity there but it is an experiment it's it's a way to prefigure the world and I think there are so many small and big ways to pre-figure the world you want to see whether it's how you interact with your local community or on a Reddit Forum or you know with your family or with your local church group or you know your local government all those kinds of things seems like practicing it is the through line that I heard from you in all of those different areas yeah and allowing others to practice it like being an enabler in all the positive ways enable subsidiarity enable decentralization live in the the new world and build what build what's missing um that's what comes to mind for me I really wish we had more time because this has been such a fascinating discussion and I think that y'all are really on the Vanguard of so many important things uh I'm just so excited to see where your work goes and I hope that it intersects with Bitcoin and uh I hope we can green pill more people together in the world um where can people find you online if they want to learn more most of my writing is pretty scattered um but I'm at divisadarth.in and also my Twitter Divya siddar and I'm at raymond.xyz and um you can find a link to my Twitter from there amazing all right thanks so much for being on the greenpill podcast appreciate you both [Music]
