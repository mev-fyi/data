all right bankless nation you know what time it is it's friday morning david tell it to them if they don't know oh it is the weekly roll up time and like always every single week in crypto is absolutely insane jam packed with news and we are going to cover all of it in the friday bankless weekly roll up two big things to cover this week david i know you're at missouri mainnet i want to ask you about that but gary gensler new sheriff in town this is like the return of the sec so we're going to be talking about everything that the sec is doing maybe some of the the regulatory flood that's been injected also is snoop dogg an nft connoisseur has he been collecting nfts this entire time we're going to get to that when we get to the news section as well but but i got to ask you how's mainnet man you've been gone for a while these are two back-to-back conferences you did m-con now you're at mainnet how you feeling oh my i am absolutely exhausted i'm gonna take today and tomorrow off just because the conference wrapped up yesterday but it's just been an absolute treat just meeting everyone in real life again not not everyone for the first time but also a lot of people for the first time uh in real life events are just absolutely irreplaceable um and at some point in time ryan you'll have to go to one in real life are you sure yeah probably we can't just do this in the metaverse the entire time absolutely not all right before we get in guys wanted to mention uh tracer dow they're doing big things in the perpetuals space i actually got a chance to try them out last week and they wanted us to let the bankless nation know that tracer dow perpetuals are now live now live on arbetrim so it's super exciting this is a way to go 1x 3x long eth or go short you could also do the same thing with bitcoin they have all of these various trading fairs pairs there's also some tracer doubt rewards if you then in turn take that position and stake but this is really cool david because it's like one it's on layer two so you get an opportunity to try arbitrarium and to you know try out the bridge two these are these are tokenized perpetuals so very little maintenance very little um like requirements in terms of overhead you just have to get into a position and then hold you can hold that for a period of time so really cool new primitive that they are building and of course you are exchanging directly with the pool so it's sort of uniswap like what you need to do that is some usdc some eath to pay for gas bridges across the arbitram and away you go so we will include a link in the show notes to that really cool primitive yeah the big unlock here is that this position is tokenized which allows it to be composable with the rest of defy so we can now have leveraged tokens interacting with all the other things in d5 uh so that's pretty exciting also be careful with that leverage yeah i was going to say let's get into markets now dave because this is not the week to go uh long i guess unless you were unless you were um you know uh in and unless you're holding for the long term let's say but uh what happened with bitcoin price this week as i pull up the charts yeah bitcoin started the week at the high high price of forty seven thousand eight hundred dollars and then it fell all the way down to forty thousand five hundred dollars overall down eight percent at the week we are currently clocking in at forty four thousand three hundred dollars we're going to talk about why in just a moment but well let's look at the eighth price uh same story here right we had a definitely a downtrend this week we're not at the very bottom we bounced a little bit higher but what are we looking like right now yeah start of the week at the high of three thousand six hundred dollars and fell all the way down almost a full thousand dollars to 2750 we are currently at three thousand one hundred and fifty dollars overall down twelve percent on the week maybe maybe a combination of like two sort of scares there one is everything that's going on in china we'll talk about that in a little bit but with evergrand this is a sort of a real estate property company that has gone completely belly up but the other was some of this sec regulatory fud um you know these could potentially be signals feeding into this some people say hey this is all just noise anyway the market was going to go down regardless of what happened what's your take here yeah if i'm not mistaken equities markets are back up to their high before the the big correction as a result of this china scare so that's that's kind of interesting that equity markets are back to back to normal crypto markets not feeling that same relief that equity markets did and so that kind of lends itself to the whole gary gensler sccs coming to fight us narrative yeah i think there might be a piece of that so we'll get to some of that later um but what are we looking at at on the ratio what what are things looking like this is the easter bitcoin ratio this week yeah if bitcoin at zero uh point zero seven uh and so uh i would say that's right in the middle of the range that it's established since uh the or better part of this year um not too much to say there other than like looking pretty healthy a little bit up on the week looking healthy for each that is and total locked in d5 pulse that's taken a plunge as well this week it's it's back from the lows we've got 83 billion dollars locked in defy at this point in time so still that 100 billion mark is eluding us every week we say that but we haven't quite reached it we'll see what's easy it's teasing us how about defy tokens how do they look on the week i'm going to scroll to the week from the month that's definitely down yeah that is a straight line down start of the week at roughly 410 dollars hit the low of 280 dollars so absolutely punched came back and reclaimed 320 overall down almost 20 on the week dpi d5 tokens down 20 on the week definitely took a beating how about when you take the dpi that's the d5 pulse tokens and create a ratio of that versus eth that looks like we are at the 0.10 mark right now so also maybe maybe flat maybe a little bit down on the week overall that that trend that the downtrend that started in march continues to point downward so not looking so hot for the dpi eath ratio yeah it's almost like um there was sort of a risk off event given this regulatory fund and maybe that the china the china scare as well that's hitting the more risky assets a little bit harder in crypto let's talk about the bed index this is where we combine all three and see what it looks like you'd expect that to be down though it shouldn't be down as much as dpi uh what are we looking at on the week yeah down 13 on the week started at around 160 fell to the low low price of 114 dollars so another punch to the gut it then has reclaimed 135 dollars overall like i said down 13 on the week absolutely okay how about layer two uh how much we have locked in layer two this week it's looking like 3.3 billion dollars that's a bit down on the week as well uh any comment here overall it's still very very young for l2s and so i still kind of think that even with the decline in prices we're going to see uh just increase assets actually moving over and so in combination with more assets moving on to l2s and then those assets also decreasing in value we're kind of flat but i bet you next week we are resuming up on this these are of course uh all true layer two so they don't include proof of stake side side-chains like uh polygon but of course polygon also has a layer two solution called hermes and i thought this was interesting polygon is apparently seeing all-time high numbers of users they just did a 17 increase in daily active users i've not seen the start before but looks like they now have over 200 000 daily active users on the polygon network at this point in time which um i mean that's a lot that's like a you know medium-sized u.s city i suppose now on this polygon side chain and if you look at the growth charts it's just kind of popping stick up only even despite the downturns and he takes there yeah i think this is just the proof of stakes i chain not the other components of the polygon ecosystem i would like to see the comparables between the proof of stake sidechain and all the other aspects of polygon but yeah overall congratulations to polygon continuing success most of the growth is definitely happening in the side chain the proof of stake side change right now although polygon is trying to expand more into layer two we know that um this is an interesting number as well we've talked so much david about 1559 and the burn it's interesting if it modeled what would have happened and apparently since eip 1559 was implemented miners of course they have hardware they have energy costs they have expenses they have overhead in the real world so when they receive eth they have to sell it to pay for all of those real world expenses well now because they're getting less issuance effectively because eip 1559 is is is burning it not giving them um that uh that that fee issuance rather than burning it they are um they're they're not burning it so what is this what is this um tweet telling us david they're saying that instead if we didn't have eip1559 miners would have sold over 400 000 ether but because we do have eip1559 they only have sold 150 000 ether so especially this becomes increasingly important under proof of stake where the value of the ether represents security of the network the less and less we can sell ether the more and more secure we have a proof of stake system and as we all know proof of work is basically a race to sell the the coin right it's proof of selling and selling reduces security and we like security yeah absolutely and i think this all feeds into the east supply shock that we're going to see this is beginning with eip 1559 but now pretty soon when the merge happens so maybe call it q1 of 2020 then we get a 90 decrease in issuance as well and uh i think um i think that's going to be a narrative we talk a lot about in the weeks to come let's get back to sort of the main macro you know i guess conversation here which is evergrand this is sahil bloom who wrote a fantastic thread on what is going on with evergrand in the china story we don't usually cover things outside of crypto unless they're big enough unless they're macro enough to actually affect crypto and i think in this case david they actually did affect crypto um so sahil goes through a breakdown of the story but the tldr is evergrand is a fortune 500 real estate developer in in china um at its core it is a home building business so it had 1300 projects across 280 chinese citizens uh it's also a developer and what it did it was growing uh fantastically spectacularly sort of a you know chinese real estate darling but it funded this growth through massive amounts of debt i feel like the u.s banking and real estate industry has heard this story before as well here it is playing out in china what ended up happening is uh you know billionaires were created on the way up the debt burden grew and now the entire thing is crumbling the entire thing is uh dissolving um the debt is kind of weighing evergrand down and they're not able to pay their ever-growing obligations so what's happening i believe is the chinese government is looking to bail them out but i think there's a global macro scare about a potential chinese real estate kind of bank debt crisis that's that's catalyzed by this might not be just evergrand might be some other chinese companies and david we're actually going to have the author of this tweet thread sahil bloom who's a financial educator an investor in the space i think has some great takes we're going to have him on the podcast on tuesday to go into this story in a bit more depth maybe ask some ques crypto questions as well china has definitely been increasing its relevance with the rest of the world especially in the last few years or so and so i think it's definitely an important lesson to learn about how much can chinese markets impact the rest of the world fun fact china doesn't like it when uh native chinese people invest in america there's definitely capital controls capital restrictions but they really really like it when u.s investors invest in china because it's kind of like a way to kind of have a hold on the united states markets so china is very very privy to this and we are uh becoming more and more attached to the hip with china as time goes on so these are some of the questions that we're going to ask the heel yeah absolutely guys we will be back with the releases of the week and of course the news of the week going to be talking gensler going to be talking snoop dogg but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the d5 apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing v5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrome arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarium so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrometer layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrum and join their discord guys we are back with the releases of the week let's start with urine which is a fantastic d5 product we talked about many times on bank list apparently they have just released their v3 to users i think this is mainly an innovation maybe a facelift on their user interface which is like famously not been amazing and this is an upgrade to that user interface yeah urine has definitely had more interfaces that kind of make it seem like they're not taking things seriously a lot of uh colors and random placements yeah it's playful but this looks a lot more like it's optimized for um you know financial financially minded people it looks like it's taking itself a lot more serious uh seriously now so uh congrats to the urine team on the fantastic facelift absolutely let's talk about the second release uh coinvise v3 this is a i believe it social token issuance and maybe administration platform i don't know a ton of details about this david but what's the high level take yeah overall there's uh growing infrastructure for social tokens uh and that what that's what coin advise is doing is trying to make it easier for people that have communities to manage their community using the token uh and so i think as more and more infrastructure like this gets built out we're only going to see more and more social tokens and that in my mind is a very very untapped pool of potential because influencers like to influence and if they can get a tool to help them influence even more they're just going to absolutely adopt that new technology let me ask you have you changed your mind on social tokens there was a time where you were super bearish on social tokens i was bearish on personal tokens um social tokens i think are different but the lines between those two things are blurred why why were you bearish and what makes you more less bearish now and more i guess um embracing of them or enthusiastic about them yeah i just was getting flashbacks to the ico days where like people people are actually raising money on personal tokens and i did not think that as an industry we were ready for that yet people saying like hey doing literally a personal token sale like not unlike what we saw it during the ico craze like like an ipo except that the p is personal initially yeah that scared me uh and so i uh voiced my concerns about that uh and if hopefully that kind of staved off that whole phenomenon until we were actually ready for it uh and now i think we are closer and closer to be after being ready for it and part a big part of that story is actually having the infrastructure the social tokens are are much different i mean there's generally no no uh initial raise so there's no selling to the public right um but you are kind of coordinating a community and giving them rewards so it's sort of only upside uh are there any other major differences in your mind is it it's like some of the early personal tokens were very much tied to like you got to like um tell someone what to do right like issue them commands or some there's also a portion of their revenue upside yeah it was very agreements right mm-hmm yeah i think that a very important differentiator is that because social tokens generally are air dropped to communities that already exist and so they're meant to bolster a community whereas some personal tokens i saw were trying to because of the token existing in the first place it would make a community i thought that was just like the putting the car before the horse well we're starting to get some infrastructure that's the story behind coin buys the ability to mint airdrop lock and reward a community members this is also cool david i feel like we predicted this for a while i remember saying this in the early days of bank list that you know we were provided bankos is providing education that soon they'll teach in business schools and here's uh berkeley university as well as berkeley university of california as well as university of illinois stanford imperial college of london they have a decentralized finance class now i'm not sure if this is um actually a free class it seems like some of the material at least is i don't know if it's you know it provides a credit but i went through some of the material david and it's actually like pretty impressive in fact i saw some sort of bankless content in some of the slides not directly our content but like um let me show you let me show you something i think you'll recognize if i could find it here uh yeah oh yep yep so like these slides uh you know bankless and d5 making its way into university campuses which is um yeah pretty cool to see i think we saw a little bit of that last year i mean i know there have been some general cryptocurrency courses over the years like what is blockchain this sort of thing but this is a defy course specifically and uh berkeley said they needed to offer this because there was overwhelming demand from the student population like no kidding i mean if i was a college kid and you were teaching me about d5 and i unlocked this entire new world like this would be my favorite class like absolutely not any others now i don't know university campuses aren't necessarily the best way to learn crypto like you learn crypto and you learn d5 by doing it by plugging in by getting involved by listening to resources like bank lists but i am super excited that they are starting to teach this because i feel like it's been totally missed for a while yeah no 100 percent um i would not miss a single class if i was attending that at that university are you implying that you used to miss some of your classes david at the sun no no never never never all right sirion this is cool um i've seen some people do this with their nfts that is put their nft on like an apple watch face right because you could do that you can customize your apple watch faces uh this is zurion providing a way for you to do that like automatically not sure exactly how it works we'll include a link in the show notes but i think if you have an nft that you want to display you have an apple watch you can tap into xerion and just get that set up so you're displaying your uh nft on your apple watch um do you have an apple watch david i used to but i returned it because i just didn't find myself actually using it all that much it's just like a lot of noise yeah yeah it's just like i i don't need my wrist to vibrate like i don't need to be that hooked into a chip all the time but i do think that there is a very missing world about flexing nfts in real life right as as in with actual like you know things that you wear and so this is i think part of that story yeah it totally is i think there's a there's a story of like integrating nfts and web3 and crypto into the real world and now we're putting it on devices i wouldn't be surprised to see apple natively support this at some point in time like their own apple nft like inft or something who knows what they'll be branded as um all right robin hood is rolling out wallet uh crypto wallets and and transfers actually the ability to transfer from robin hood to a crypto wallet this is something we've criticized robinhood for for a while like it's great you're onboarding people into uh crypto assets but these are all like robin hood crypto assets right right users don't retain any custody of their assets they can't even withdraw it from the platform so this is robin hood allowing users to withdraw their doge withdraw their eth withdraw their bitcoin withdraw whatever they purchase on on robinhood to real self-custodial crypto uh which is a good step i i feel like it's somewhat like of a baby step it's almost like reticent to like clap for this but like also it's cool i mean robin hood has an absolutely massive demographic that um is not generally crypto native and this isn't a way to onboard them into more crypto native tools yeah no this is a very important step for robin hood to even like stay competitive with the rest of the crypto world they needed to be able to onboard actual assets allow users to actually have a wallet it's a very it's a very important thing to actually learn how to manage a wallet and a private key uh and like you said like robin hood has so much surface area with so many different people and so i applaud them for making finally making this move and robin hood like don't stop keep going like do more stuff yeah i heard recently like um 40 of all robin hood crypto revenue is from doge just alone right like robin hood users love doge yeah i bet you they actually don't care about actually self-custodying their doge yeah i mean i guess we'll see this is this is super cool this is great for decentralization that robin hood is adding this they're feeling kind of market pressure and maybe user pressure to add this we'll see how many people end up using it but it's nothing but good news i think for the crypto industry guys i hope robin hood knows how much how many support requests they're about to get from people who sent their money to the wrong spot they're about to get punched with that for sure that's true all right two more quick things uh one is bankless nation bankless dow season two launch party that is happening on october 8 2021 at 11 a.m that is going to be live on twitter spaces if you're plugged into twitter you can access that this is all about what the dow is cooking up for uh season two um i i paid attention at a high level of this i'm looking forward to digging in to all of the season two plans but like i always feel like you know hey season two of the office was like the best you know that's when the show really hit its stride i feel like season one for a dow this is a period of time i think for for bankless doubts like four or five months this next season will be another i think three months um this is sort of a period of time where where a dow sprints on various activities but in season one they were really just forming and now they're starting to hit their stride figuring out what they're supposed to do what their purpose in the world is and uh they're executing on it so if you're interested in joining for to see what's going on in adao to see what's going on in bankless dao go check that out we'll include a link in the show notes you can rsvp and put it on your calendar yeah season one was all about all right we have a down now what do we do with it and now season two is like okay like we've got the answers let's actually start to to build some stuff so nice job dao speaking of which one of the answers is apparel i think they're going to be doubling down on apparel this is some awesome like collegiate apparel that the bankless dow is uh dishing out what's the story on this david yeah i was recently at mcon which was metacartel's uh convention in denver and meta factory which is the uh spin-off out of meta cartel that does all of the apparel they they in collaboration with the dao do make the dao's apparel right and the amount of bankless like swag i saw at mcon was absolutely insane uh it was like at least 50 of like the meta meta factory's apparel that i saw there was like bankless dow apparel so that was pretty cool um this uh this drop right now if you guys are listening to this on friday you you have to get it if you want it you have to get it today because the sale ends tonight at 11 59 uh est so if you're listening to this on friday you have only a few hours left to snag this drop and don't forget when you check out make sure you put in an eth address so you receive some robot tokens they distribute that every once in a while it's kind of a loyalty program for people that purchase from meta factory all right let's get to the raises of the week there are some absolutely massive ones uh the first is from so rare we talked about so rare often uh they just raised 680 million dollars and this is a large number okay the valuation of so rare this once again silver is an nft fantasy football in the u.s we'll call it soccer league 4.3 billion dollars is the valuation of this series b investment absolutely incredible growth story of course all of this is happening on layer 2 ethereum which is super cool to see as well so this is zk roll up ethereum um i don't i don't know what they're going to do with all of that money quite honestly but i have to imagine there's some massive growth growth plans that they they intend to massively scale maybe to other sports what's your take on this yeah 680 million dollars is an absolutely monster raise and i could only imagine that at least some of that is going to go to marketing uh and so i think we're going to see a lot of uh not not just over but also definitely sober start to market their products in more traditional means like maybe straight up tv commercials during the commercials behind the actual games that are being played right i mean where where do people who care about football where do they go they watch tv uh so i bet you we see some silver commercials coming in uh shortly what i love about this is all of this uh like this growth budget goes into bringing more people into the crypto economy bringing more people into the ethereum economy and sort of draws all of the normies right no like maybe you don't care about crypto you don't care about bank list you don't care about anything we're talking about in the show you just want a hot nft of your favorite like football player okay and you see a commercial you're watching you're watching a game you see a commercial you hit click and before you know it you're creating an eth wallet right like how crazy is that uh so congrats on so rare for that raise another big raise bitclout so this is a decentralized social network um on the blockchain i believe this is this is not an ethereum this is sort of a fork of some sort of proof of work chain they just raised 200 million dollars from a16z and a few others i've actually used bitcloud um like once i think to collect like the big clout uh tokens um i think they they ported a whole bunch of crypto people's accounts from twitter onto bitcloud but what's your take here is this sort of the decentralized social network future do you think this is that this has a future or um what about it yeah so this is actually not not big cloud this is the big cloud creator who apparently the story is that he used big cloud as kind of like a proof of concept or you know or something just to prove out that this actually this new product which is apparently called tiso for a decentralized social um uh and so apparently it was like the alpha for this which is now receiving 200 million dollars from a16z and others uh why a proof of work blockchain i have no clue um but we do know that people like to invest a lot of money into layer ones and so maybe it was a strategy to optimize for raising funds um but again like i don't know why you would build it as an actual blockchain that's what the app layer is for um i'm a little bit confused on that yeah it'll be interesting to see this one play out i i'm kind of undecided whether this is like um you know a great experiment or like genius or whether it's sort of like hey everything's pumping i better raise some capital now the last um the the last funding that big clout founder received uh nader was from basis if you recall that was an algorithmic stable coin in like the 2017-2018 era and um that didn't work out for many reasons some of which were regulatory and they the team ended up refunding all of the investors their money so you know what does that mean maybe maybe second time's the charm i'm not sure i i can't decide maybe i'll have to use bitcloud some more and figure it out for myself um david another raise from dapper labs so 250 million i feel like they just raised a few months ago um and now they're raising more 7.6 billion valuation round for dapper labs that is the maker of um nba top shots crypto kitties um they have a blockchain as well that is kind of a called flow it's sort of an eth competitor eth killer if you will specifically for nfts any takes on this yeah like you said they just raced and so like there's that uh rick and morty meme of the robot asking rick what his purpose is and it's like what is your purpose you raise money like where is all this money coming from like i guess we're just aping in hundreds of millions of dollars into l1 chains that are application specific it seems very odd yeah it seems odd and yet nba top shots has generated a massive amount of revenue so this is not like the 2017 era like icos where people were just you know hoping for things um dapper labs actually has revenue it's generated off of this and one one assumes the investors are valuing it based on some of that revenue generation potential so i'm not sure what this means but definitely if you're an entrepreneur in the space now is the time to raise and people are doing it uh david let's talk about jobs because now is also the time to get a job in crypto if you haven't already done that one way to do it is go check out the bank list job board it's got some hot new jobs of the week the first is a community manager for aragon aragon is a decentralized autonomous organization protocol a platform ogs in the space check out that position if you are interested in helping get a community up and going also looking for a founding blockchain engineer at highlight a senior software programmer from popcorn that community lead position from popcorn as well a senior front end web 3 developer at tracer dow these are all positions that that you can use to to kick start your crypto career if you're not already here 100 get a job we just talked about all these uh different uh blockchains and l ones raising a bunch of money that money could become your salary uh get a job absolutely all right news of the week david we got to start here gary gensler new sheriff in town the revenge of the sec so much to talk about with gary gensler maybe we should start here um they uh gary gensler did an interview with the washington post called the wayforward cryptocurrency i don't know if you got a chance to watch this this interview but i know you saw this clip any high level takes on this uh before we get into the detail yeah it feels very much like uh nanny gary gensler like coming into our industry and taking care of us and making sure we're super duper protected and we have all the regulations it's weird but it's weird that he was really asking for like more transparency out of the financial products that he sees in crypto i'm like dude like how much more transparency do you want literally it's a public ledger you can't get any more transparent like what what are you actually asking for and so it seems to be like he's just using all of these very basic words to convince people that don't know about crypto that the sec needs to regulate crypto there's definitely been an anti-gary gensler anti-s8 sec vibe that's that's going on in cryptos because the sec feels like you know it's increasingly uh combative with the industry right like canceling coinbase uh lend accounts and um removing its ability to to come to market um and this is kind of another step but what i think is interesting is gary chose not to at least for this specific interview i'm glad he's engaging but he chose to do it in the washington post which is like hardcore institutional media right a lot of other crypto media organizations that would love to talk to him bankless included so if uh gary or anyone from scc is is listening we'd love to have gary on the podcast to talk more about these crypto specific issues but this was very much for the washington post audience uh and like kind of the the institutions even the interviewer i i felt like i don't know david did you watch the the did you get a chance to watch the full interview no no i haven't no but um so i i watched the video and i had like a few notes a few takes on this you want to hear him absolutely hit me all right so like the first is i think everyone who's listening to this has to realize that gary gensler knows his like he knows his from a technical perspective so at mit he was a professor at mit and he taught about crypto and blockchain courses and i saw a number of those courses he knows what he's talking about he knows his way around the technology he knows enough to be dangerous in this space and his feedback in this interview was i find the technology very interesting he says this i do think this technology is interesting it's pushing central banks he said it's pushing fintech that's why he chose to teach it at mit so he thinks that technology is like maybe academically interesting and he thinks that it's a catalyst for change which he seemed to appreciate so i guess maybe that's the good side um one other thing that i think came through in this conversation is he's definitely not interested in sitting back so he wants to be ultra proactive it kind of is like hey jay clinton was the old sheriff you know he did some stuff not a lot but there's a new sheriff in town crypto and i plan to get ahead of some of these issues he mentioned that a number of times he said this quote i don't think technologies last long except outside the public policy okay and i feel like he has badged himself and made it part of his mission to bring crypto into public policy to like merge those things together even if um like the policy isn't ready for crypto or maybe the policy was written in the 1930s and does not pertain or needs to be rewritten i don't think he quite sees it like that he wants to see uh emerging so he intends to be really proactive okay those are those are all interesting takes i'm worried that gary gemsler doesn't actually want to talk to crypto people i think he wants to stay inside of his own comfort zone when it comes to media um he i remember hearing about how he used the term stable value coins when he was referring to um when he was referring to stable coins and people were uh speculating that that was alluding to stable value funds which are an sec regulated product and so i think he's being very strategic with what he says and where he says it and i my suspicion is that if he were to come on a show like bankless or any other crypto show it would him he he wouldn't not be in like friendly territory right he wouldn't have the freedom to craft these narratives because we would totally call him out on some stuff we would want we would drill down into specifics we would ask the questions that we would want to ask and we would have and we would he would not um have the like the home field advantage so i'm con i'm worried that like gary only broadcasts to the crypto industry but doesn't actually come and join us well what's interesting is like and definitely actually speak louder than words but his words are actually the opposite of that david so in the in the conversation he was having with with the interview of the washington post um he said this our door is open but people aren't coming in it's kind of like hey industry crypto industry you guys are a bunch of like cowboys like i understand what you're doing is like technologically disruptive but if you want to do something come and ask door is open just like come ask our permission we'll have a good faith talk about it and then you'll be off on your way and um you know it'll all be fine so he very much maintains a posture of the doors open but it's again it's like you're saying actions speak louder than words and if he was serious about opening the door he would do what hester pierce did i think what some cftc commissioners in the past have done it just like show up at crypto conferences right engage the community um talk to us i mean we're not criminals we're not hugsters we're not like trying to defraud people we're trying to grow a better more transparent open financial system for the world i think there are some some shared goals one of the goals he went back to in that conversation david was like the interview asked why does the sec exist and it's like to protect investors but he said it i'd i'd love to dive into what he thinks that means right because like crypto has a shared goal of like wanting to create better conditions for investors as well but the sec's uh like way forward means protecting investors from like four percent yield on a coinbase lend account right like is that really protecting investors um but one of the things i was the reason i watched the full interview too is i was trying to figure out like new cop on the beat he said that they have robust authorities over crypto and they're going to use them these are some of his words it's like i was trying to figure out where's the sec going to target next and it felt to me if you read between the lines and you sort of inferred some of this to you is if you raise money if you're an ico like look out okay number one so if you raise money from unaccredited investors in the us i think you have a target on your back uh number two stable coins i feel like have a target on their back as well i'm not sure how that's going to play out i think that's going to be a combination of sec plus treasury trying to take some sort of action maybe it'll require a congressional like new legislation through that process but i think that's got sort of a a target on its back particularly centralized stable coins right so the the usdc's of the world and the third area is lending and staking which he didn't get into a lot but like those three areas i feel like have targets on their back and particularly he kept using the term platforms which i think means more centralized exchanges centralized entities so the coinbase is in gemini's and block fives of the world uh less so decentralized finance he actually said something positive about decentralized finance being a catalyst for change um but if i was in the con those three areas i would be like relatively worried i guess yeah no i i do think that the sec is kind of like prepping for um bigger and bigger moves when it comes to the crypto world yeah uh absolutely i mean he's clearly sort of an institutionalist um i i don't think this is the end of the world right i think there'll be some enforcement actions but like at the end of the day it'll be fine i do feel like david the crypto is kind of like ddos attacking um the regulators right so like how do you bring uh thousands of tokens like to court and like do you even have the staff to go do that right maybe this goes to conversation we'll talk about a little bit later but um this was also interesting at the same time this conversation about crypto was published in the washington post gary gensler tweeted this right after which was a an appeal to freshmen in college or any college student to start saving early and start saving regularly right so if you stock away five dollars a week you know eight percent yield i guess that's investing in the stock market you know uh by the time you're 65 you'll have a hundred thousand dollars right um i think this fell to many in crypto like the wrong time for this sort of um yeah this sort of appeal to you to millennials and and gen z what's your take on this yeah it uh i generally have more nefarious thoughts about this um because like he's he's saying like hey just say five dollars a week all you got to do is save five dollars a week the united states printed 26 of all outstanding dollars last year and so like if we want to uh view like the value that and that changes the value of what you save and when he's saying like you know save five dollars a week what he's saying is hey but put five dollars a week into your bank account so the banks can go get the yield right and this is what banks do they take your money and then they get even more yield on it and they don't give you back all of the yield that they get they keep it for themselves and and so like gary genser who like like you said is an institutionalist to me he's just advocating he's like indoctrinating all these young folks in the world to like be a part of the banking system which has cut out so many returns from so many of its customers for the last like decades and so it's it's very much the opposite of the values that i stand for and it's it's the same advice that we've heard for the last like 30 years and i i think there's a lot of institutions out there that are taking advantage of that the fact that like this is the quote unquote like formal advice you're like oh yeah save five dollars a week that's not working for people it hasn't been working for people it just feels like an elite baby boomer take on this right it's like millennials if only stop spending money on coffee and he actually mentioned coffee coffee and avocado toast right and just save your money and and put it in the bank account right then you too could be rich one day right it's like nothing against long-term thinking and and saving but like i the reason i don't think it's actually effective indoctrination david is because college students aren't dumb right they're looking at a 0.01 interest rate in their savings account and they're going like wow like like why and and they're looking at the stock market right and you know eight percent average maybe over the long run but they evaluate stocks versus crypto and what do you think they're buying so uh you know i i think gary gensler is about to have a bunch of college students who are like asking questions about crypto during his office hours rather than rather than people asking you know how they can save their money and put in a bank account it just feels like patronizing you know it's like crypto is the largest opportunity for our for our generation for millennials for for gen z and to not acknowledge that it even exists or that's viable and to like crack down on it without giving viable alternatives i think is uh is terrible it's short-sighted it's frustrating it's annoying and no wonder they're getting some pushback on this stuff yeah and this is why literally every other generation gets frustrated by the boomers right because the boomers just say think that because it worked for my generation it'll work for your generation too forgetting that like the boomers haven't let go of all of the institutions that made them made their generation one of the wealthiest generations of all time and so i like i said it's very very nefarious where he's cracking down on coinbase uh lens products while he's saying oh yeah save five but meanwhile don't look at this crypto thing save five dollars a week like like you said he talked about like hey instead of going out for coffee you can make coffee at home all right so you're just gonna suck the joy out of life like hey like coffee at the coffee shop tastes better and he's saying like no suffer suffer and save so you can put the money in the banks i mean we haven't even addressed like student debt and the rising costs of going to university which is like a whole nother can of worms but let's keep going because we're not done with the sec story another thing that happened while you were there was an attendee actually a speaker at the missouri maine at the maynite conference right the mainnet conference was actually um served papers right subpoenaed by the sec um there's some conversation like we don't know who exactly this person who this person was some say it's the one of the founders of uh the terror chain dokuan i believe others like there's some conflicting reports about that it almost doesn't matter it's like wow the sec actually when they show up at a crypto conference they show up to serve someone papers right that's an interesting message do you think there was some signal about this oh absolutely i mean even if they didn't intend for that signal to be signaled they should have they should still understand what they're doing right like maybe they didn't tend to intimidate everyone but that was the net outcome of what they did right and so regardless it's an intentional choice was that the vibe sorry for people like oh like people are still coming to terms with it uh there wasn't too much conversation about it but i do know that ryan selkis was like fired up let's talk let's look at his tweet but before we do um jake jake says this two reasons the scc might do this this is jake travinsky the target lives outside of the us and is hard to serve at home but sec knew they'd be in new york city and took advantage of the chance for a personal service number two the sec wanted everyone to see this happen live to send a message or intimidate the industry that second one is uh is particularly concerning this is what ryan selkis said why don't you read it out david yeah ryan says if you're wondering when i actually decided to run for senate it's when these efforts came to my event didn't buy a ticket and served one of the speakers a subpoena enough talk more war on our out-of-control regulatory state um ryan was definitely feeling himself at this conference first off it was a fantastic conference a huge success and it's the conference that ryan selkis who's the person like leading the charge into trying to uh you know reform governance so go reform our right yeah totally uh and so like it's kind of it's kind of ironic that like the the guy that cares the most about this issue was throwing a conference and the sec showed up to serve one of his speakers there he follows up this tweet saying celcus 2024 time to activate the crypto political machine do you think he's actually gonna run for senate i hope so i mean we need more crypto native people in the halls of our government this is kind of the bottom line this is the only way this is going to change either we convert them and convince them and you know show them the values of crypto or someone crypto native actually enters their turf uh so i hope he does something like this um definitely a lot of messages happening from the sec i guess this last one this this was kind of a quiet dropping from coinbase but um apparently coinbase dropped formally dropped their planned lend program this is a program to lend out crypto assets like bitcoin and eath um stuff like this happens at celsius and blockfi and uh gemini but they they plan to drop it after the sec warning so uh some terms of service i guess were updated to say that so the sec basically scared coinbase into not offering a four percent yield account to retail investors which rather than not have your coffee would be a good way for college on a fintech app on their phone where they're comfortable with no no less i'm kind of bummed that coinbase didn't take this opportunity to take the fight to the sec um but who knows they could be playing some different type of game uh who knows how they're playing it it seemed very clear at least from their social indications that that coinbase does intend to fight in some way um so we'll see how that shapes up anyway that's gary gensler new sheriff in town we'll see what the sec does next feels like it shook up some crypto markets long term i don't think this will be anything to worry about but in the short term who knows um let's talk about some ethereum stuff is that we can't be regulated yeah absolutely okay talk about some ethereum stuff um what's audience doing here david yeah audience has onboarded a ton of celebrities katy perry nas steve aoki the chain smokers are all part of the audience family now and so they were these celebrities are doing an a part of an investment round for audience uh which is exactly what audience needs because audience is a music platform and so this is a web 3 platform using web3 uh incentives and tokens to bootstrap an alternative to something like spotify um and i think that's that's pretty cool i was uh talking with a girl here at the conference about how she wrote a song and then put it on audios and because it like landed on like the number one slot for audience for a day or so she was airdropped a bunch of audio tokens so the contributors the value creators are getting uh governance control over these platforms which is just good incentive alignment i bet the sec has something to say about that too yeah it's super cool that that's actually what's happening though um this is cool as well the economist had a story that they ran late last week on friday of last week called down the rabbit hole this is all about decentralized finance that's actually a really good framing of decentralized finance as well um but like i have to comment on this i feel like the magazine covers are getting better right we had that pleaser dow magazine cover in fortune which is fantastic we've got this economist down the rabbit hole i mean this is what crypto natives call it all of the time we're going down the rabbit hole this is you know journey west you know these are our metaphors that they're using they got the story around to centralize finance largely right um our magazine covers are getting way better than they were in 20 2017. i feel like the uh the big cover i remember from 2017 was olaf carlson wii on the cover i think it was ink magazine like with i don't know just looking like um how would you even characterize this looking like this was sort of a you know um a money run and you know the icos were just like this big kind of scam or flash in the pan now our magazine covers are actually reflecting what's really going on in crypto it's refreshing totally 100. um xerox mackie is stepping down david what does this mean for the sushi swap project yeah xerox mackie he's basically been the lead dev behind sushi swap ever since uh he took over control from the guy that uh started it whose name escapes me but he's been the core contributor towards sushi swap since basically day one and he has um there's been a transaction people noticed this so they saw a transaction that removed his address from the uh governance contract on etherscan and then he has then yet conv then he then he confirmed that yes indeed he is stepping down uh moving into uh what he is calling an advisor role um we don't know why um but at the end of the day he could just be tired or burnt out or just wants to move on and so i guess cheers to is your ex mackie for taking a new step in life we get to see what happens when a pretty large leader of a project leaves a decentralized project does does it all collapse or does it keep on going my my bet is on the latter but um this is definitely a good experiment to see um david let's talk layer two stuff this is a blog post from the optimism team called the future of optimistic on uh the future of optimistic ethereum what is this post about what are they talking about here yeah this is the optimism team uh broadcasting their design philosophy about how they are doing optimistic roll-ups uh and so instead of having just a massive suite of code a gigantic code base and deploying on ethereum optimism is going for what they are calling a minimum diff as in like how minimized can they make the difference between optimism and ethereum and so what they are doing is literally removing as many lines of code as possible while also still having optimistic roll-ups and the benefit of this is that when you remove all the as many lines of code as possible when you have an app on the ethereum main chain it is extremely easy to just import it over to optimism and having that minimum diff allows for what they are calling one click deployment and so you don't actually have to modify any code the oevm the optimism ethereum virtual machine is supposed to be minimally differentiated from the evm which means anything that's built on ethereum can easily get deployed towards optimism and overall like less code means less bugs like generally and so reducing code surface area is reducing bug and exploit surface area and so the optimism team has been hard at work and trying to get that minimum diff as minimum as possible and so they they have released this blog post talking about all the lines of code that they have removed and they are going to roll out this new version of optimism uh in october i believe part of the story here is that layer two just keeps marching on right so like we have time to cover all of the updates but dye was just released on arbitrary for example um usdc and usdt is now enabled if you withdrawing from optima from arbitram using the hop network so there's no delay period on these types of withdrawals aztec which is another um roll up that we haven't talked about they are now raising their transaction throughput to a hundred thousand per transaction we've got one inch on arbitrary so like layer two is just evolving and it's it's coming to incorporate all of the tools that you might find on layer one and i think that's going to continue in the future at even accelerated rate now 100 yeah no we are about to we again we've been saying for a while but it's also becoming more and more true the rate of growth of l twos is becoming exponential and so are the celebrity endorsements of things that are going on in crypto and nfts i want to start our nft conversation with this look is snoop dogg an nft connoisseur has he been this guy cosmo medici all along he tweeted this out on september 20th that was you know four days ago now i am cosmo medici apparently cosmo medici is like a well-known nft account sort of a connoisseur of nfts deep in the space but a pseudo-anonymous account no one actually knows who he or she is at least we didn't think we did until snoop dogg tweeted this out that that he is that person what's your take on this david do you think he is cosmo medici i i think snoop dogg has a friend who is guiding him down the nft rabbit hole and maybe they share accounts or something but like the language that cosmo medici talks about when he tweets is not something i would see snoop dogg saying um but who knows uh maybe i'll just take him out his word yeah i mean absolutely i mean he says it point blank and the cosmo medici account confirms that they definitely have a totally different style of of communication but it seems obvious that somehow snoop dogg if he is not cosmo medici is uh is intimately involved in this account and this nft collection and wow i mean snoop's got like what almost 20 million followers oh my god uh and he's a business person right like he's a talented individual really great at this sort of thing so i'm not surprised that he saw nfts early as well snoop if you're listening or cosmo medici should i say we want you on the bankless podcast you need to come here and tell us about your crypto journey sir we would enjoy that uh david let's talk about time magazine they are releasing some nfts too what's going on here yeah this actually just happened about an hour before we are recording this but time magazine has time pieces great name uh a first of its kind collection of more than 4 500 original nfcs from over 40 artists around the world so time magazine getting into nfts and this is one of those nft's uh drops that you know spiked gas fees there was insane demand not everyone got all the pieces that they want they were all priced at point one eth and they apparently all sold out extremely quickly uh so congratulations for time for getting into the world of nfts yeah they're definitely early at least from the mainstream media side to uh to tap into this and do it in a very crypto native way which is super cool um we mentioned before i think like their editor in chief uh of time maybe their ceo he is um you know he has an ethereum address right uh he's dot eth so they're definitely very plugged into this scene uh which is great and i guess this next thing is an item from the regulatory section sort of this is chain analysis apparently they've been scraping data this entire time and they have been secretly operating a bitcoin block explorer site called walletexplore.com and they've actually been scraping users ip addresses who visit this site and interact with it to find leads for who for law enforcement clients this is like a honey pot for crypto users and they're using it to essentially gnarc on people who law enforcement is is interested in um guess i'm not surprised but what's your take on this um i mean yeah what do you expect we have an open transparent permission list you know ecosystem where the ledger is fully auditable like what do you expect is going to happen it's a little bit nefarious that they propped up a block explorer and they are using that information that people are giving them uh to again arc on them and report so like when you type in your address into the block explorer the uh chain analysis like links that to your ip address making the association and well if you put this address in it's probably yours um so like kind of fu chain analysis for doing that but also like it's what do you expect it's an open permission list ledger that we all have so these are kind of the activities that you would expect to come when everyone can view the ledger yeah cryptos definitely remains a system that it's not smart to do illegal things on right right because it is so public and because companies like chain analysis exist which is why i never understood that angle coming from um politicians and others that like crypto facilitates all of this nefarious activity it's like if you're doing nefarious activity you're doing it with 20 bills 100 bills like benjamin's right you're not doing it with crypto at least you shouldn't be uh because chain analysis can figure out exactly who you are and yeah knock on you um all right regulatory stuff after block fi new jersey and texas these are two states who went after block fi calling their lending product a security uh and trying to trying to ban it in in those states they are now going after another centralized crypto lending uh company called celsius and their crypto interest accounts is this just the vice starting to tighten a little bit more david yeah a hundred percent and we're just gonna like i said we're going to just see this more and more and more um it's again kind of a bummer that lending platforms which allow people to save money because they're not in like these approved methods are getting the the vice um it's kind of sad i don't know what's going to happen here whether this is going to drive more people to defy do you think or whether the vice is going to grip even tighter and some of this is going to start going out after um like developer software developers of d5 lending products you have any thoughts on that well if they do it'll be interesting because we can't regulate defy we'll see we'll see how they do it maybe they just go after the people um don't like it i uh one of our first articles on bank list was about self-directed iras because i thought this was like a super tool for retail investors you basically set up a self-directed ira and you you can break your uh ira account this is for american investors of course you have these uh ira retirement accounts 401 k retirement accounts you can break it out of brokerage jail so you essentially rather than only being able to invest your retirement account in like an e-trade or a charles schwab or a fidelity you can uh buy crypto with it outside of these accounts using a self-directed ira well congress wants to destroy the self-directed ira wants to prohibit you from doing it only approved assets uh this would essentially kill the whole crypto self-directed ira and this language is embedded inside of the infrastructure bill most perniciously and of course you know if you read this entire post you can you can get into the details of of why they say they're doing it um a few actors outside of crypto have been using it to harbor um like to evade taxes basically in uh in a nefarious way and so now all of congress is coming down on the self-directed ira and saying you can no longer use this um to me this is just another example of like legislative regulatory overreach in our in our financial markets it's completely unnecessary they they are killing a tool that retail investors would actually use to better their lives restricting a very small minority who would be using this to for tax evasion purposes so super frustrating i feel like all the regulatory news this week has been bad this is just another bit of bad regulatory news and when we zoom out and remind ourselves that nation states like to account for everything and they like to have their approved assets as the assets that people touch they don't like crypto assets because it's outside of the control of the nation state so this is just based off of that truth like this is some of the reaction we get from that yeah they can't control it they don't they don't want it and it's so hard to know whether this is an attack directly on on crypto maybe it's probably not it's definitely an attack on financial freedom right which is uh which is particularly troubling right yeah it's kind of the same thing absolutely all right guys i am tired of talking about all of the regulatory stuff that is going on so we're going to get to the takes of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this bankless episode possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uni-swap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right guys we are back with some of the hot takes of the week this is a take from me why don't you read it though i i said we won't even talk about anything regulatory but but here we are talking about something regulatory uh wha what's the stake yeah you say i'll never forget the advice of former cftc commissioner brian quintez when i asked him what the crypto industry could do in the face of regulatory attack and brian answers build faster which for an industry that doesn't like to ask permission is a fantastic take this is such a good take i think from brian uh again this is an episode we did with him a few weeks ago former cftc commissioner and a very honest answer right and i think what he was getting at here is like if crypto can build utility and value and saturation faster than the regulators can respond and react and try to clamp it down it will reach escape velocity and be completely unstoppable so if you're getting down about all of this regulatory stuff what is the answer build faster and i think this is building faster on the social layer right so like doing things that that we're doing from a media perspective right are helpful to that and it's also obviously a call to developers to build utility faster into the networks and i just think is is general uh fantastic advice for the crypto industry uh thank you brian quintes for that yeah david crypto builders i dare you to build even faster don't stop let's do this take from raul paul so he had a take on uh regulatory stuff as well yeah raul says listening to gensler and it's clear he is laying down the hardest case he can for regulation of digital assets but my view is that he will likely get his way that most are going to be classified as securities but with a wholesale change to what that means it's like when the internet started to gain traction authorities tried to impose harsh rules but in the end they had to there had to be a grand compromise to not stifle something very important indeed so the take here that raul raul was saying is like there's a chance that the sec is just like oh all of your favorite tokens that you have in your ethereum wallet they're all securities maybe that's what happens but if they do say that it just really waters down what it means to be a security it's like okay cool they're securities like now what what are you gonna do about it like you can't regulate all of them uh and uh again going back to the whole building faster thing we should just meant more tokens meant all the tokens yeah i i mean who's going to do the sec filings for something like ether as nasa who's going to file it like a 10k report right right like it can't it can't possibly have the same restrictions as a security like um you know apple or yeah any other security and i think that's what he's saying here that securities will be watered down in their meaning 100 let's do this take from jp koning much of decentralized finance has just cloistered speculation on top of speculation but here's a neat exception maker doubt a decentralized bank is engaging with the real world by lending 21 million dollars to finance a solar farm in new york number one that's awesome that make your dallas doing this so this is real world lending using a d5 protocol um number two jp conan is a fantastic writer i've got a tremendous amount of respect for um like his understanding of monetary economics and and history and many of these things but he's definitely a crypto skeptic and he's been a skeptic all along uh he says much of decentralized finance has just cloistered speculation on top of speculation but here's this real world thing that's happening what i find is interesting with crypto skeptics david is they somehow separate um things into two camps there's like real world activity and by that they mean like traditional activity so like assets like stocks with with cash flows or property or real estate right and then they have the other side which is crypto activity and what's that that's kind of like it's just speculation that's not real world activity um it's interesting to me it's like what's your definition of real world activity and what's your definition of speculation there's a lot of speculation that happens in the real world and if the metaverse comes to fruition like all of this activity that we're doing in these in these digital worlds that is going to be the real world like so the definition of real world is going to completely change um but that's something else i read in his comments but what are your thoughts so there's a spectrum here right like on one end of the spectrum we have nft brock jpegs that are trading for like 500 each that is straight up whatever he's calling not real i would definitely call that not real like it's a jpeg of a rock like it's pretty nihilist uh and then on the other side of the spectrum we have maker dow giving out a 20 mil 1 million loan to finance a solar farm in new york literally changing the way atoms are oriented in the world and also as well like improving solar life which is a very important part of the world to improve upon because of sustainable energy so that's really nice at some point in line there's a there's a line where like just uh john will say like okay that's fake and that's real but i do think there is something to say like when crypto does actually impact the way that atoms in the world are structured it's inarguable how real that becomes it's like it's it's it's it's moved out of the it's escaped out of the internet and it's now actually changing atoms uh it's hard to argue with that with saying like oh crypto it's just like a bunch of hot air like well not if it's not if it's funding a solar farm uh and so there i feel like there is that to be said about it however i do agree with you where like hey like if i can have my ether rock in my like vr metaverse home sitting on my table who's to say that's also not real absolutely yeah well said um let's talk about this this is an image of the genesis of the ethereum logo this is a tweet from uh alex van vandessen from 2016. uh i didn't know it started as a greek sigma sign apparently and you could see this in the image its progression over time to the uh the ethereum symbol that that we have today yeah i i had no idea that this was true turns out the ethereum logo is two e's superimposed upon each other one rotates to the left one rotates to the to the right then they do some trimming and boom you have the ether logo that's pretty cool yeah absolutely all right david that's the end of takes let me ask you the question we always conclude with which is what are you excited about right now right now i'm excited for the pleaser dow party on saturday if i can recover between uh today and tomorrow i'll be ready to get back out there uh this week has been absolutely exhausting so i'm gonna take some time off and then rest today and tomorrow but please redown party the dog party the doge party is gonna be a ton of fun the other thing i'm really excited about is like ryan i was walking around main net and at these all these other like satellite parties and satellite events and like dude i can't go more than like three steps without somebody saying like hey love what you guys do at bank list and so it's a very fun environment to be around and so uh i know it never gets old it's always a ton of fun to hear it i like hearing everyone's stories about how one particular podcast episode resonated with um for some reason i love the stories it's a fantastic fun vibe what are like the favorite episodes see we told you oh uh it's pretty diverse actually really but of course the crypto renaissance is always it's always up there that's that's a big one um and then the recent ralph paul one also came up a bunch as well that's awesome man very cool what are you excited about ryan um i'm excited about the the energy to fight some of the regulatory overreach that's that's happening in the u.s so um david david i tweeted this out yesterday to my u.s followers just because i was curious have you considered leaving america due to u.s crypto policy why or why not and i got a massive amount of replies here uh and they varied some people were like i've already left the us some people are like no i'd like to i don't have the means other people were like no uh my roots are too deep here but but i'd also like to but there were surprising number that fell into the camp of like hell no i'm not leaving we're here to fight this thing right and uh of which like ryan sulcus was one of them he said uh why should we leave they're the ones who suck summarize that well right um so there were a massive amount of replies that were like hell no i'm not leaving uh you know not to the end this is one particular reply uh that that i enjoyed the united states this is from mr gives the united states reigns in much of global legalization parameters legislation parameters winning the fight here reverberates globally i'm not running a way to protect my business profits and self-interest i'll use my platform funds and physical body to win this fight on u.s soil before i run wow these are some resolute defenders of crypto freedom of financial sovereignty and they're here in the u.s and they want to make their presence felt in the u.s and they're going to stand and they're going to fight this thing because as the poster is saying the tweet is saying like if not the us where's the fight going to be fought right right yeah like you have to stand somewhere and so why not stand at least in a country that that memetically anyways values revolution values values freedom that is kind of america's founding story so that kind of resonated with me and that's why personally i'm staying and why personally i want to be involved in this fight whatever capacity i can be uh so yeah that's what i'm excited about that people have resolved and we're not going to take this sitting down we are going to fight for this industry and our values and for decentralization for the next generation and i absolutely resonate with that right and if we don't fight them here and we move elsewhere there's a chance that it just follows us right and then we have to fight the fight there right and so might as well just like get it over with and do it inside of a country that has a good court system rather than one that perhaps doesn't have a good court system yeah absolutely we we still have a chance here too i i think it's way too early to uh to say anything has been decided so um crypto's only gaining steam and only gaining political power imagine being like the regulators right they have never gone up against financial markets that also have an insane amount of like tribalism and community and energy behind the assets that they're going after right so it's like i don't even think that they understand what like they're poking a bear it's like you don't want to mess with crypto people like we really really care about what we're doing and we've generally made a decent amount of money and so we have the funds to fight too uh and so like those two things a really really powerful combination absolutely all right david it's that time meme of the week time we got this one ralph paul this is a classic raul probably didn't discover this one but why don't you describe what it is yeah it's a it's a classic meme of three people sitting in church pews uh and the person in the front is labeled me buying what i think is the dip but then there's a person sitting behind that person with a gun to that person's head unbeknownst to him saying another dip and then there's a person behind them with another gun to their head saying another dip and then it zooms out and there's somebody in like the the upper level that behind everyone with a sniper rifle shooting the last dip labeled as another dip so always be careful when you buy the dips because the dip could keep on dipping that's raul's comment is enjoy the ride this is what you get when you have an 80 volatile asset class with exponential returns buy the dip works in the end but you can't time it to perfection i think that is uh that is well said from raul and we will end the week on this of course none of this has been financial advice no one can time the dips eth is risky defy is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on
