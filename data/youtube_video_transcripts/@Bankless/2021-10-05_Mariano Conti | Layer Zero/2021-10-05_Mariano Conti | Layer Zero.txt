[Music] welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today we're talking with mariano conte who is one of my best friends in this space absolutely and is one of the most foundational builders i would say he worked at the maker foundation working on basically all aspects of the maker dial contracts but he got actually into ethereum before ethereum was even a thing so he was one of the first people to live a bankless life if you will and uh started receiving money for his code uh in bitcoin uh and that's how he got introduced into the whole bitcoin space and a lot of people know mariano's story it's he it's his story so every time he goes on to a podcast and anyone ever asks like hey mariano how'd you get into crypto he tells the story uh but as soon as mariano and i are done having reflections about the current state of crypto in 2021 i start at that point in the story uh where he got into crypto but then i start going backwards not forwards uh and which is something new that i haven't heard before out of mariana's background uh and then of course we finished right where we left off uh back around to the current state of crypto in 2021 but this time with a different angle i hope you guys enjoy the conversation with mario and ocanti but before we get there a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof of stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eth with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eth terra or soul and get liquidity on your stake go to lydo.fi to get started hey mariana how's it going hey david it's been a long time yeah it's been a long time since i've seen you in that particular room yeah yeah i've been missing this one it's uh it's weird after a year and a half of seeing myself talking to others with this background uh then i spent what like more than three months uh away yeah away from home away from argentina so where where el everywhere in the world did you go before you came back home to argentina uh i did the us a lot um road trip from miami to san francisco uh went to see france in seattle went back to miami uh did a little stop somewhere in the u.s for something then i think at the paris mexico uh punta mita which is like a nice place in mexico it's a a beach resort then what else then miami again then denver then new york then a fourth time miami and then back to buenos aires yeah uh you know it was uh it was weird i we were just traveling with my girlfriend and miami was the original destination and we had the return tickets there so uh it was like our our hub in the us and uh oh my god yeah i left at a different time that my girlfriend so miami became our our yeah like our center in the us even though it's the place probably that i uh you know traveled the least inside i just stayed in the hotel the whole time but yeah it was interesting interesting months out of all of these travels that you've done recently how much of it was crypto specific or crypto travels and how much of it was like just like mariano exploring the world uh i think it was almost half was crypto or a little bit less than half so the original idea was just to do the the road trip right to rent a car and drive it from miami to to san francisco and we did that and on the on the road i met a few crypto friends but that wasn't you know uh the the main idea for the road trip so in a couple of places i don't know in vegas i went to see a meme at his uh uh you know lair [Laughter] i saw i think i saw hudson and the johnny from element in dallas uh but they were like sporadic you know the main idea was was traveling uh and but then after yeah uh you know hcc in paris that was entirely crypto m-con in uh denver and then you know mainnet and the doge party in new york that was 100 crypto mexico i was supposed to see uh the some somebody from the crypto community there but in the end i you know i spent most of the time with family and i couldn't uh see anybody and then i felt bad because uh i got a lot of messages when i said that i was gonna be in mexico from the you know the crypto community there which was very impressive and i lived there for a long time so it's like it's my second home and it was like oh i don't know i felt weird people were saying oh mariano is coming to uh to mexico city it's like they wanted to organize things and and take me out for coffee or beer or tacos or whatever and they were like oh you don't have a car you're staying for a month i'll loan you a car like do you need an apartment um yeah it was felt like really good mexicans are incredible yeah i want to circle back to that but over overall i want to ask you yeah you've been in crypto since like 2013 or 2014 when you first started playing around with with bitcoin before there was really a big community right uh late 2014 late 2014 so like yeah now now that we are on the other side of kovid how has like crypto in real life changed or how is it different or new now that like the crypto community is hanging out with it with each other post 2020 right like we had everyone the whole entire society all of the world got locked down right we all have to go into hiding and now not only is society like coming out of hiding and like redefining itself like crypto especially is is coming out of covid but also in extremely different contexts right like post defy summer post bitcoin and ether breaking all time highs post nfts becoming a global phenomenon so like for somebody that's been in the crypto in crypto society for a very long time what's it been like to do in real life crypto stuff all over the world for the past like year or so um first off it was incredible you know going to paris and seeing people there after that was my first crypto conference after a year and a half um i know a lot of people went to uh bitcoin miami and which you know it wasn't an ethereum conference but i hear there were a lot of ethereum people and defy people there that uh you know kind of co-opted the city and some of the parties for me it was uh it was paris and it was incredible first you know seeing friends after so long we're uh we're growing the community but you know there's a core that is still like it feels like a tiny one you know just like a group of friends uh who we were defining and creating d5 together uh a few years ago and feels like either we did our thing and and now we're doing something else or or continuing to do it and seeing everybody in paris felt a little bit like that and then on the other hand noticing that actually the community had grown a lot and there were there were plenty of people who i had never met in person before because they had joined the you know in in defy summer maybe a bit later there was uh the entire nft community some of them people who we know from before that got into it but then also so many new players and then maybe of course but i don't know why i even mentioned this but it always exists what we call tourists right people who got into this uh during the bull market and you know when we're back to a period of uh peace and quiet meaning that if it does happen right the prices end up dropping again and stay down for a large amount of time these are the people who will say hey i'm out of here like i was only in it for [Laughter] but all in all i felt that it was still very much the community that i know and loved the the friends we made along the way and uh okay i'm gonna be completely honest from last time can i say this almost everybody also that's og like got rich i mean let's not beta okay if transparent ledgers are transparent we know this exactly uh so many people do not have financial concerns anymore and this is this is an entirely real thing and and it did change a lot of us but i think like for the better it's um and it's interesting because you talk to these people like we're all friends we've been through a lot together we've been through maybe one or two bear markets and we spent a lot of time building and we spent most of uh covet uh building i remember when the pandemic was starting i was in um i was in warsaw and black monday was uh black thursday was happening you know uh and even though we knew that at that point defy was pretty much gonna survive instead of you know the drops in in 2018 and everything uh i know a lot of people that had a had a really tough time and then i would say 99 of uh dogs who who stood by and continue they're yeah they're very well off now and either if they're still continuing to build or not or they're doing other things uh it's i don't know how to describe it it's yeah community of friends that we now have yet another thing in common and we can talk with each other about this kind of thing that you know essentially changes you in a way and but also frees you it's incredibly liberating you have all this space in your brain and you know this brain power that doesn't have to worry you know about survival anymore right maybe it's like oh food and rent are taken care of so now we can move on to bigger and better things exactly it's like i'm done with this this part is i never have to worry again i mean hopefully right hopefully right you're not going yeah and it is great talking to two friends that are in that situation and also i see a lot of people becoming more creative uh more daring being able to take more risks so i think this was just incredible for everybody you know a generation of builders of investors of believers that it paid off for them it is it is decently surreal when we go to these ethereum conferences bitcoin bitcoin conferences too but the ones i'm used to are the ethereum conferences and i look around and see everyone kind of just assumes that like everyone else is doing like pretty well for themselves right like there's just this air of just like uh what's the word um abundance around and like i'm a little bit i i feel like i should be a little bit concerned because that feels very toppy right it feels like a top signal right it's like okay everyone around me is wealthy like damn that's got to be the top but also at the same time the whole point about crypto is that we supposedly have found ways to fund this whole thing that's sustainable right kevin milwaukee calls this like regenerative finance right and so like i feel like we're in that uh like schroedinger's phase where like is this a top or is this a new paradigm like we don't actually know but yeah kind of like to your point like what you said like there are so many builders who suffered through the 2018-2019 bear market and built all the way through it that like well i mean of course they made a bunch of money when they come out the other side like they they're the ones when you suffer the pain of 18 and 19 like you get to suffer the suffer the euphoria of 2020 and 2021 right and but when you look around i mean i agree that on the one hand you see people and i don't know dressed in prada and things like that but i still dress like but don't you also feel like like you know yeah but it is well deserved it's like okay i mean of course we think this yeah yeah but but yeah yeah at the same time like we we keep on talking about hey like new paradigm crypto is a new new fundamental asset class it's a new economic foundation at the end of the day it kind of makes sense that like everyone who would go to like the ethereum community conference which has been an ongoing conference ever since 2015 or 16 i think like well i mean it's the only way that this would ultimately happen right like the people bootstrapping the economy obviously get financially compensated for that those actions yeah completely yeah yeah i'm i'm really happy that it happened and like i said this changes the dynamics a lot and in my opinion it it's gonna let a lot of people and a lot of teams you know build differently uh built with more conviction last bull market uh most of us still didn't know a lot of things and right i i tend to put almost everybody in the same bag and i feel comfortable doing that because i've spoken and i'm friends with so many you know projects inside the ethereum that you know i can generalize of course there's outliers but when i say something in the general i feel confident that it mostly was that way uh a lot of projects they now know like i'm an extreme ethereum boldheart but even i know that yeah we know where it is going but uh this is an asset class that in the end is still affected by macro by whatever you want to call it and it's not going to always behave the way we know that it should right so and a lot of projects didn't know this back then or didn't prepare for it so you know even the ethereum foundation was right uh selling ether at the bottom and consensus to you know pay their engineers and pay people and a lot of projects did that and a lot of them were on the verge of of closing yeah a lot of them did close a lot of them did right and but also with that with that scarcity we got things like uh you know moloch down february 2019 in like depth of the of the bear market why because uh you know i mean cassandra and a few others they decided hey we the community we're gonna take matters into our own hands and if we can we're gonna bootstrap a grand style and just like hand out uh money to projects to continue building and this was deep well little little remaining money that we had yeah yes yeah and they have said yes i'm in and consensus yes uh i'm in and a few of us in the community that that i'm in pink were like yes we're in and out of that you know exploded a whole bunch of dials and the ecosystem as we know it now so i don't know um i think uh everything we need to make sure that whatever is happening that we make the best of it so i think we did so in the the bear market and i hope we do that in the bull market and you know projects are now a little bit more diversified uh when they can uh but also extremely bullish when they can and yeah i mean i've never been more excited to be part of this community really and one thing that i think is significantly different from 2017 and why like when i juxtapose like is this the top or is this the nude paradigm points for the new paradigm side of things are the fact that like everything being built here seems to be much more sustainable than in 2017 right in 2017 it was like spin up a website spin up a a white paper receive like 100 million dollars in funding we still have that sort of like ape tendency and things get overfunded very very quickly but it's on the backs of a much more real and sustainable like set of projects that are being funded right these aren't these are no longer ideas with the white paper anymore like maybe people are still aping in like 100 million dollars into some brand new thing that just got spun up but that thing that just got spun up is something real right and so like the speculative energy is still there but like these projects that are coming out in 2021 are seemingly much more sustainable than anything we've ever seen in previous bull markets and so like and it's also really important like when we have while i think you and i look back upon like the 2018 2019 and we aren't the only ones and look back on it with nostalgia right like there's a lot of people it was like we all wanted the bear market to end back then but now with like this maps with mania back then we also are all kind of wishing for simpler times to have this like bear market come back so we could all be quiet and like have a quiet kumbaya community but also at the same time having these builders like you uh and mean and like these leaders like eric connor who made it through the bear market can and then and then provably like did well for themselves after the fact i think that gives a lot of um conviction and a lot of like a lot of people willing to take risks on to build these new things right to enable and inspire a new generation of builders so that like we went through the bear market so you don't have to right like yeah you you didn't come in when it was like the weirdest time ever to build something on an ethereum which was 2018 and 2019 but you you are here now and like look what look what building did for the people that came before you right uh and so like hopefully that was like the bear market to end all bear markets uh and we there as a community of sustainable builders we can build things where that indicate to future peoples like hey even if you do build through a bear market you come out on the other side okay and like we've kind of now that we're building more sustainable things like you should be okay regardless i hope so i hope so and and yeah you know one of the things i do now uh you know as an angel investor and advisor is just i talk to projects and i did this as well with the you know some young founders in right now during my travels you know in paris uh denver new york couple of other places um they asked for my advice and in the end we start talking about the old days you know 2018 2019 because that's what they end up enjoying the most it's like talking about how we built certain things and just so they make sure that they don't make the same mistakes we did and this is something i i mentioned all the time it's when we were like i look now and it's gonna it's gonna get better there's uh proposals and everything but like maker governance right now uh there's delegation and something but it's just not very easy to use uh it is complicated uh but why is it right when we were building it i would i looked behind my shoulder and there was nothing there was nobody i could hey uh can we talk about that like we were inventing everything right i didn't know who to base or what to base ourselves on so we just built something and yeah it wasn't the greatest thing but it was the first and then compound came and they uh they benefited from what we built and they built something so much better that now it's it's basically you know governor right alpha bravo and the comp token they're the uh the standard i would say of governance uh on ethereum projects and others and now i like to think element uh they looked at what compound data now are coming up with maybe governance 3.0 or whatever and so that is what i like to just talking to projects and saying and that's what they get the most out of just like doing that talking about the things we built and then mistakes we made so yeah i think and also i think when you if listeners tune in to like me and anthony suzanna we do a semi-regular live streams every friday now and then we ultimately end up just talking about the way things were right so we all we everyone who was went through 2018 2019 ultimately always ends up talking about it and i think it's actually important right because it offers like history lessons for so many of the newcomers that have come in 2020 and 2021 just so we it's important to i think broadcast and advertise like hey what what it was like to be in crypto in 2018 and 2019 when literally the world just forgot about crypto and what they do remember was like the ico scams and not well and because that's basically the only thing there was to remember right um yeah also uh you know yeah back then and this is also why i think that now is a great time to build uh there is still like back then there was ico scams just a white paper and nothing more and get a ton of funding right uh right now there are equivalents um i've been working on a script i'm probably never gonna release it but it uh i get an idea and the script uses the namecheap api to purchase a domain name uh change the dns to like a server that i have uh create a template for a smart contract for a 10 000 uh pfp nft drop set up like a standard website and then all i need to do is change the css a little bit and i mean what else can i automate uh create a discord create a twitter handle and you know in a day you can have a 10k nft drop and you probably earn a nice bit of change with that if you set it to 0.05 uh you can maybe make i don't know 500 east i know it's crazy and out of mostly automating things but that is that is the cynic in me that on the other hand yeah the the ico projects they were building and they were creating these camps but there was also nothing there there was a maker we were building but we hadn't released yet uh there were only like five protocols out there and none of them would maintain it you know there was auger there was djing stills right i remember when talking to new people i always look back on like when i got into ethereum in 2017 in early i was like why why was i excited about ethereum i can't remember anything like ethereum itself was cool but there was nothing on ethereum to actually be excited about like if you wanted to go trade tokens you had to go to binance uh yeah i mean i suggest you go you grab your oldest account just go to ether scan and and go to the transactions and like go through them like from oldest to newest and see see what i was up to yeah no you'd be surprised there's more there's probably more than you remember um i went through this because of uh the ydx and i had an account where i don't remember in the probably 2018 something uh i don't know interacting with dydx i need to double check but you know cryptokitties 2017 ether delta what was it yeah ether delta maybe 2016 even i don't know but like you said there was not a lot and now whatever you're building or whatever anybody's building that's new there's at least a foundation right you already have you know protocols for liquidity for swapping you have stable coins stable coins have been one of the biggest factors to keep the money inside the blockchain right inside ethereum back then it was oh i i need to exit it's like you had to exit to a centralized exchange traded for what best you could do is owning tether on binance or tether right yeah it wasn't even on the ethereum blockchain it was on omni omni tether oh omni tether remember omni yes remember it was a it was a big deal and then suddenly and suddenly it's all on ethereum here c20 yeah uh and now you can just if you trust the system right and if you like believe that usdc is not gonna uh rug you black yeah blacklist and if you believe that dai is gonna maintain the peg or luc or uh you wanna be in rye or you want to be in fracks or in um or in any of the i don't know dozens of projects that now exist there's absolutely no reason to leave and i mostly don't uh you know leave ethereum the only bridge you know the only side chain i played with a little bit is polygon uh and now you know l2's uh arbitrarium abridged uh you know a few weeks to play with that but i know i've never i don't know maybe i should because i've been telling people i'm becoming more of a an ethereum maxi as as time goes on as time goes on and i have a different definition of of maxi which i'll say it in a minute but i always used to be very open-minded and it's like no no i'll give everything a chance i'll try everything but now i've never used solana i've never used avalanche i never used phantom i don't think i ever used uh binance and i like staying there i i realized that i'm one of the lucky few that once can pay gas flows out yeah right i was not priced out and this is a funny anecdote uh a lot of argentinians you know i've been advocating the usage of dye ever since i got into this and this is the reason i got into this uh originally i mean and it's still in my mind to you know serve and people in an undeserving economy and help them free themselves from inflation and capital controls that that is still that was still uh i don't know if it's still front and center i i think that i i fought my fight and now it's in the hands of now your watches and then pull yeah um but that was the original goal right and so many argentinians they got onboarded to die and they had to use uni-swap and they had to use pool together and then they they got a lot of money from airdrops and it was incredible but then during defy summer they were priced out but because there were some they were some of the first people who got priced out there were some of the first who got into binance and into whatever projects are there you know that the cakes and the beef and i don't know what else is there and they ended up making a lot of money because they were the first price out of ethereum and you know there were some of the first to get into polygon and i'm not gonna begrudge anybody from making money that's that's not why i'm here uh it did break my heart a little bit that they got priced out so hopefully you know now that we have our bedroom and now that we're getting optimism and that you know we have the the ck roll-ups and hopefully we're going to get them back into default because i still believe that this is not just about playing with d5 it's also the ethos of decentralization that i'm a believer that ethereum is the only the most credibly neutral blockchain out there and you know we saw what happened with uh solana being down for a while and yeah but but it wasn't interesting you know seeing this and watching uh people ending up making a lot of money and they sell the chains but me i don't i don't use them i i stay on ethereum and when i say i'm an ethereum maxie i'm an attention maximalist ah okay that's why i was gonna ask for the definition yeah yeah my attention is on ethereum like right now i'm not full-time right i angel invest i help out some projects but mostly i've been enjoying my life and i think that you know i deserve a little bit of rest been traveling everything so the limited time that i have and also uh i'm already 40 years old so declining uh mental cognitive abilities or whatever at 40. well it's been a it's been a journey man uh sure right yeah the weight of the makers maker oracles on your shoulders exactly uh with the limited time that i have it's i don't have enough bandwidth even for what's happening in ethereum it used to be that you knew everything that happened in ethereum then it was just what happened in d5 in ethereum and then just maybe in the lending protocols inside d5 inside ethereum and now you have dials now you have nfts you have so much and it's a my definition of maxi is attention maximalist i don't think everything out there is a scam there are other probably interesting projects that no maybe they sacrifice some decentralization for speed maybe they but i won't call them scams not in like the bitcoin maximally sense that yeah that's generally a bitcoin flavor is to call everything a scam yeah if it is not my coin it is a scam and everything that is not bitcoin is just something that will wants to take your bitcoin i don't think that with everything but i am an attention maximalist is i want to stay in ethereum because that's and also it's all i know i'm not going to learn a new programming language i'm not going to make new friends i got my friends and we're on ethereum and we like it there so and the moment i make peace with that so much happier right i'm a little bit trollier on more posting on on twitter and people have mentioned that um but i don't know i think it's a better way to uh to enjoy life no no i i totally agree and definitely i have my own like uh group of uh non-crypto people i'm trying to get into crypto and like have definitely turned towards like a shitpost maxie in that group at some point in time like i feel like this just part of the natural progression that people go through is like uh you build you build really hard uh finally the market turns in your favor and then you just like coast you just like relax like oh thank gosh and also at the same at the same point of like kind of what you said just like all your friends are in ethereum and like that's that's like that's the society that you find yourself in right like it's so hard when you have both the economy and the society around that economy like that bootstrapped each other like it's to what you said it's like not that you are shutting yourself off towards other things it's just that like it's hard to get yourself to uproot yourself when so much of your your life and energy has been dedicated to this one ecosystem right like exactly and the ethereum culture has always been one of acceptance like we are like oh new thing let's like let's try it out give it the time of day uh but that's also worked against ethereum culture in its fa at the same time right where like a lot of nefarious projects came and was like hey give us the time of day and ethereum's like okay that's our culture to do that and then we learn those lessons the heart the hard way uh and so like i think there is some amount of like healthy i don't care isms about some some people in the deep ethereum community culture right because like you it's not it you don't get to be called a maximalist just because like you've run out of time and you and because you don't know anyone your time like your time is your time exactly it's like yeah so why haven't you checked out this project and this one because i don't care and i don't care it's like i'm not calling it a scam i'm just saying that i don't care and but yeah that's true i i think maybe we as the ethereum community we skew towards the two nice uh at some point while you know the bitcoiners they skip the other way right definitely the being about everything not their coin maybe it worked in their favor i uh i default to being nice it's like as i will tell you no but with a smile it's like no thank you um but i don't i i think that's that's the difference between between the communities as well and uh yeah then we get into the whole you know ethereum killers presenting on on on main stage at devcon and i think there's a first and last time for that all right guys in the second half of the show this is where we go into mariano's background pre-crypto uh without actually going into the crypto section uh so uh stay tuned for that but before we get there a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a

borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than

power of ave ave dot com that's aave.com mariana i wanna actually so yeah go so many people tell you uh ask you when you come on the podcast like all right tell me how you got into crypto and then you they go through the story of just like oh i was working in argentina blah blah blah i want to start at that point in the story yeah but go the other direction and so right before you got into crypto what were you doing and what were you doing before that yeah uh damn there's gonna be a lot of honesty in this podcast uh the truth is that i made a couple of good investments early on in life so i discovered crypto at 34 maybe 35 before that probably didn't work all that much maybe like three four full years out of my life um what do you mean you didn't work for three years what were you doing no no i worked for three or four oh you worked for three to four years total out of you know when i left college oh or up to like 34 yeah uh so it goes without saying that the it's 34 onwards when you started working for the maker foundation it's probably the hardest you've ever worked in your life yes yeah yeah for sure okay uh before that i was working for a couple of years for a digital agency and i started working there i think around yeah maybe start of 2014 during the world cup and the reason was uh i think my girlfriend she got a job and i was like at home doing nothing and i got bored and i'm like okay maybe i'll find a job for a while just because you didn't you didn't have anything to fill your time yeah yeah and i discovered and i yeah um i had moved back to buenos aires in 2011 so i spent most of 2011 2012 2013 just like not doing much just enjoying running with family and uh so during those years what were like the center pieces of your life because if it was it wasn't crypto right because crypto hasn't happened yet so like you got when you got up in the morning what would you think about good question um i mostly lived a kind of hedonistic life i uh watched movies and went to parties and read books and used my computer and you know kept learning about programming because if you're an engineer you need to more or less stay current with things uh i had a game developer phase where i built a whole bunch of different um prototypes for video games uh that are still out there somewhere um spent a lot of time with family spent a lot of time thinking about you know the argentinian situation and how different it was uh from you know growing up in mexico which it is a third world country but compared to argentina it's so much more stable and um and yeah basically doing that it was when did you move from mexico to argentina in when was it like april 2011 yeah so the year before in 2010 i got like i think i turned 30 or i was about to turn 30 and i got like my i called my first mid like prices i wanted to go first oh no should i be expecting multiple i don't know i think there's another one coming at some point maybe uh maybe this was the one and i just had it earlier uh you know i i was born in buenos aires we moved to mexico when i was six so in in 86 i stayed there for 25 years and even though we came back to buenos aires almost every year maybe two months out of the year when i was here i was the mexican when i was in in mexico i was the argentinian it was weird growing up like that that not bad at all right it was just that thing stayed in my brain and uh in 2010 i was like okay i want to go to argentina i want to live there i don't just want to go there as a tourist for two months in the winter or two months in the summer i want to be there i want to live there for six months and figure out what it's like uh and i thought what was it what was your identifier when you were in mexico was it like your was it your accent like in mexico do you have an argentine accent and when you're in argentina do you have a mexican accent like how would they figure that out i used to no uh it was easier in mexico because i had you know mexican accent grew up there and yeah but uh yeah it's sometimes like a couple of words but when i turned to my brother i would talk to him and like argentinian but it would be like a weird argentina accent when i came to buenos aires then it was it was always they would look at me funny with my accent so yeah but where are you from still still to this day and now i used to be able to switch between accents and now i don't i like my brain created a mix between argentinian and mexican and mariano dialect yeah yeah exactly and it's weird when i'm here now people yeah they look at me and it's like yeah this guy is not from buenos aires maybe from a weird part of argentina they say where are you from spain from mexico from uh yeah that was that was the mix and i just wanted to be here and live here for a while so i told my girlfriend at the time in mexico it's like let's move to argentina for six months just let me like do this i want to you know commune with my roots with my motherland that they will go back to my mexico get married have kids or whatever and she didn't want to so i broke up with her all my yeah that was bad it was yeah i had been with her for like four years were maybe gonna get married i said i'm sorry there's something that i want to do so yeah we broke up and i gave away when you when you broke up was it like this is over or is it like hey we can reconvene in a few months from now or or what what was that like uh no it was mostly over well i don't know maybe i thought if i only stay in argentina for a while and then go back maybe we'll sure be able to pick things up happening yeah that never happened it never happened i came to argentina with two suitcases one had my clothes and one had my computer and my monitors and i stayed here uh forever so i left my dad and my brother they still live in mexico now luckily you know the first four years i don't think we saw each other because i was here and i didn't travel um but now it's like yeah i see them all the time it's like easier well with cobit became a little bit harder last year but now it's yeah that's that's over that that's also one of the cool things you know distances they don't mean much anymore right let's say if it wasn't for this freaking pandemic uh i don't know it's like maybe we needed it to don't you feel and sorry to change subjects again but don't you feel like this pandemic uh i don't know advanced the crypto adoption by two to three years maybe oh absolutely right it's like well there was the the whole idea that like um uh people started speculating in the stock market because like televised sports weren't a thing so they were just bored and they needed they needed a horse to bet on and so they started gambling in the stock market and then like you know d5 summer happened nft winter happened the first the nft like winter as in like the first bull market of nfts that happened during the winter after d by summer just because we were all bored at home like speculating on our computers right like we needed an itch to scratch and so why not let's just have a bull market everyone's home yeah that's crazy yeah yeah so when you were you you said you had only worked for like three or four years before you found crypto what years were those again uh so let's see i had a job out of college i was doing what just like junior developer i think it was uh programming in c-sharp i was also part of uh like a small shop and i don't even remember what i did um yeah i i programmed for like two or three months oh yeah it was like uh one of this i don't know i was doing just software for like accounting uh before that i had already like uh i did early on you know the first website for my dad's business and you know i did the i did software for you know his uh salesman and you know for managing budgets and and like that and that thing is still running to this day it's like here no yeah once a year like my dad and my brother they call me and it's like hey can you and they already know that uh i open up zoom or hangouts and it's like hey that you know i'm all smiling and i can already see it in their eyes when they're gonna ask me about something like that because my face changes and it's like you're gonna ask me to look at old code that i don't don't even remember how it works like 20 year old code but it still works and it's out there and it's you know helping a real company do that's awesome that's amazing mariano has code that hasn't gone down longer than ethereum and it's not unbelievable that's hilarious okay so so it's not that complicated but uh but yeah when these uh awesome non-crypto investments that uh what time did did they happen there were they post college around that maybe yeah so probably before when was the what was the first no not the first bubble the bubble was around 2 000 99 to 2 000 yeah uh-huh yeah 2000 no the other one uh oh there's another one yeah yeah but not uh not the internet um the other financial classes maybe 2008 oh the housing crisis yeah yeah yeah so the bubble between 2006 to 2008 right yeah right so maybe a few years before that so maybe 2005 and six you know uh my dad bless him uh he said you know you sh you're young you have a bit of money because i had worked for a few months doing this you know just building software he said how about you buy some dollars and you put them in the stock market and i buy the stock market and he taught me a little bit about the u.s stock market and he said yeah and he said you're young you can take risks and now is the time and he's an accountant oh he's also an engineer like he started engineering for like four years so that is where he got that side of me and he's the one that got me into it so we figured out a way to do uh you know a wire to the us and then open up like a zero commission account uh online and yeah i started you know buying and selling mostly tech stock you know uh i don't even remember like you know amd intel nvidia activation maybe i have no idea the things that i that i knew about right i zero diversification it was all tech only yeah tech only because it's it's what i knew and i kept that for i mean even to this day i i probably still have a couple of those that i that i never touched and yeah that was my first foray in that and i was lucky with that because yeah we had the the 2018 if you look at the the chart but then i had another couple of odd jobs here and there and those pretty much sustained me for a while okay so the the question i want to get to is like you worked for a few years before crypto came into your life you had this uh you were lucky enough to put money into the stock market at the before the housing crisis um and you were just like uh like riding off of that to to fund a what you call a hedonistic lifestyle so i want to i want to get to know like when did the work ethic come and why did it come and what made it come that's a really good question i don't think i've ever thought about that but like on the spot right now i would say when i discovered crypto and i started working you know at maker i found my freaking calling i i have no other way of explaining it it was it was finding a group of people who were building something together and not just what we were building the way we were building it you know decentralized all over the world uh on a chat room but never met each other and i don't know i felt such a kinship to that and i was always you know i built my first website 95 96 so i've been involved in this kind of thing but always on the fringe right uh like i feel i could have been like i know on the on the internet revolution of the late 90s but i never did because i was on the fringe uh i could have done with web 2.0 and i never did because i was in the sidelines building but never felt like yeah i'll dive into this but then when i found web3 and when i found maker found ethereum that's when i don't know my brain finally said okay you've been involved and around you know computers all your life but you've never been you know done more than that and when i discovered this that's when i knew yeah this is this is what i want to do and it never felt like work it just felt like yes i'm gonna do this and i you know stayed up for hours and hours uh building and talking to people and i would go to bed and i i wouldn't be able to sleep right i would move around and then i would have to wake up in the middle of the night and just go back to coding because it was such an incredible energy and you know i never i never felt that with with anything else and it went even beyond that uh i'm like okay i'm a developer in this now and then i discovered you know crypto twitter or whatever and conferences and it's like i need we need to go deeper right i just i don't want to be a coder i want to be i want to be famous inside ethereum like that i told a friend of mine i think i was drunk either in buenos aires or in the first berlin it's like i saw people giving out talks you know talking about their projects and then they would come down from the stage and people would go to them and ask them questions and i looked and it's like i want to be that it's like uh at every step of the way it's like what can i do to be even more involved you know and i don't know i don't know why it happened but it happened and it happened with ethereum that's why i'm so you know adamant about community about purpose and why i always get you know i do those sappy tweets about yeah the community our people my people it's like something something clicked you know i have no other way to explain it and at every step of the way it was okay now you are doing this what more can you do and you know that gave way to uh whatever angel investing or it's a for me that was the next step is that okay now that you're financially well off maybe you can put some of that into other projects i mean to friends projects and into you know young people's projects and so that's you know that led to to where we are i can just imagine uh mariano trying to fall asleep and he just sees code just like running through his eye through his eyelids like oh with the wait the maker contracts they could be like this and then get up and start writing them well that's how the the second version of the oracles happen like when we released uh oracle's v1 like three days before actually releasing single collateral die i went back and checked i have the the first commit for the second version of the oracles so as soon as the first were done and not even psi was released i was like okay we need to make them better for next version and yeah i was like oh epiphany and this is writing things there it is it is pretty interesting to see like there was a lot of there's a lot of people that have similar stories and and i resonate with that story myself as well i was like it's working pre-crypto is just not working the same post-crypto and there's there's uh i'm reminded of the layer zero i did with eric connor where we talked about like well crypto it's not just like your career it's also your like entertainment and it's not just your entertainment it's also like your social group and it's not just like your social group it's you know all of these things all put together right and so many people have a similar story of just like uh i was working my nine-to-five job i was like looking at the clock waiting for the clock to run out so i could go home and do other things and then i found crypto and now it's completely reversed it's like i can't like i can't put it down like i can't wait to start i don't like to finish uh when i'm when i'm done working i just turn on crypto twitter when i'm done with crypto twitter i just dm my other crypto friends uh and it allows i've seen so many people go from like yeah i went to my eight hour a day job working two hours a day to going from like now i go to my eight hour day job and i work 18 hours a day right and there's so many of these stories and there's that and each person has their own story to tell as to like why it resonated with them but like i think the ultimate through line is like well something really magical happens when we have financial assets that align with our human values and as you as somebody coming from argentina which has seen a chaotic government with a chaotic financial system perhaps you look towards ethereum and you see like stability and not just stability for yourself but if you can build it stability for the people around you yeah yeah i you know everything that you said i hope it all sounds sane to me it all sounds like it clicks i have no idea i hope that somebody you know that maybe is just getting started in crypto is listening to this and you know dm me or like contact me if this sounds like you or if this sounds like we're talking about a cult it's definitely both it's nothing it is a little bit of both right it is the only difference between a cult and society is how big the cult is if the cold if the cult is two billion people well then you just call that part of society yeah where do you yeah that is true in that case we need to uh we need to grow this grow grow this cult when we were uh in uh denver with the uh m-con for mcon i was with uh the um meta factory guys in the uh in the hills of colorado and we were just joking about how like uh we were just doing the classic cult joke like we we have uh our group of a collective group of people that all rally around the same totems like who do we pray to the god of moloch right like we have our own currency like i actually think we should have just actually just commit to this thing and just actually just instantiate a religion at least if not for the very release at least at least for the tax benefits that's not a bad idea right you have your own language right yeah uh-huh yeah no that's exactly right we have our own rituals we have our own just like values we could absolutely make a church of moloch i would like that that would be yeah no no we totally we totally could and yeah now that you mentioned denver again it was it's so good being out there that i mean i saw you in paris i saw in denver so in new york uh you know the difference after emcoding denver i thought i wasn't gonna have a great time in new york you know because magnet it was gonna be something like completely different suits yeah but then i enjoyed myself so much there as well uh a different vibe certainly but equally enjoyable and yeah you know just uh ethereum people all around like you say the talking about similar things um just you can instantly you know talk to somebody new and and just like talk to them for a long time and find common interests and also talk about meaningful things at times right um [Music] i now i i like to say a lot of people ask me hey are you building on d5 uh are you doing something still i like advising d5 projects i like uh investing in them i'm glad i'm also on the sidelines now in d5 like i'm glad i'm not building d5 but i'm not against it it's like i still love defy i still think it's extremely important but i say that i paid my my pound of flesh and now i'm enjoying it from the sidelines and i have to worry about oracles and liquidations and race parameters and governance and sometimes i talk some about that but it's always from a place of love right it's it's only because i've i've lived through it and yeah but that doesn't mean i don't like it i it's like it's because i love it that i feel that i can you know in a position to to criticize it a little bit but then through that hopefully make it a little bit better well there's something to say about just like we all we all joke in this uh industry like oh one year in crypto is just like one month in the legacy world right yeah or it's the other way around i don't know either the one that makes crypto go really really fast um and like to some degree like this is expected right like you you were introduced in crypto in 2014 you started building vigorously 2016 through uh 2020 uh maybe 2019 i can't remember when you left the foundation and then now then you turned it to 20 20 20 20 jesus yeah um it's only been 13 months oh my gosh hey at least it's been a year right anyways so like you go you go through the cycles and then and then you hit the sidelines right and like everyone's doing even to some degree like i'm doing this a little bit in the sense that like a new d5 protocol comes out and like sometimes i don't even read the announcement posts anymore whereas like in in 2018 a new defy protocol would come out i'd break out my ledger put some money in see what happens gas was zero dollars uh i play around with it it's like oh cool now i know what this is i can tell all my friends about it and then now my friends are coming to me with like oh this new defy protocol have you heard of it i'm like no can you please tell me about it but i think that's important right because there there needs to be this churn of active participants that are doing the things in the crypto world right and if mariana was still there like hammering out smart contracts left and right you'd take up a lot of space for a lot of other people to build their own stuff right like there is ultimately only so much things that could be done it's seemingly endless right but like we do want some healthy churn of new builders to come in the old builders to step out and take more passive roles uh you know the the village elders who are guiding the the crypto novices and you know we can only guide those people so much they need to just learn by doing and even even we also don't want the the veterans of 2017 18 19 to actually dictate what the crypto novices of 2021 need to do because they need to do their own thing right um and so like to sometimes the best you can do is just sit down the sidelines watch and angel invest that's uh yeah exactly and it's also yeah after you know a career of playing you retire and whatever become a coach or right yeah it does feel like a professional sports where you just like you can't last that long like it's it's too hard it's too hard to keep up it's too things move too fast it's too taxing well there's a lot of people that you know are still going right and right yeah that's that's incredible uh i don't know how they do it and you know uh i mean off the top of my head maybe i'm just mentioned but but you know martin koppelman and stephan george from uh you know gnosis they're still building of course everybody you know the core devs uh vitalik and peter and chris with the salinity and martin surender and there's so many people who are still around and uh you look at that the defcon zero picture and he said wow how do they still be in the same drum yeah but then that's also what what keeps me going it's like they built this and they're still around they're still doing they're still researching maybe some of them from different positions uh but they are around and that's also why i think i don't ever wanna you know not be around this ecosystem right um it's given me a lot and i it's not that yeah i owe it everything and i have to be here it's not it's that i i want to be here and i hope that i will still want to be here for you know years to come and i think that this lends itself back to that like maximalism conversation that we were having before right like there's zero other builder focused communities that have this sort of track record and so like the it's when somebody says like oh why don't you pay attention to tara it's like well none of my friends are so why should i all right like we're all we're all kind of focusing on the same thing right it's like there's the there's that metaphor of like the hunters of a hunter-gatherer society they're they're looking at the deer and all all the hunters are shoulder to shoulder like looking at the deer they're all pointed in the same direction and so like for me like when all my friends were pointed at the same direction like i'm looking with with them i'm not looking like oh look there's a squirrel over there like no we're all looking at the deer yeah oh um and i for example in new york i saw a friend of mine uh will barnes we worked together at maker um smart contracts and now he actually he was at consensus before and now he left in this building on solana he's building a d5 protocol on solana and um and i think he was a rust developer uh before and i don't know either we talked a little bit in new york or just somebody on a tweet was like they they wanted to know because there are there are very few examples but they exist right it's like when when people say on twitter oh every developer i know that you know the the vcs what is it the multi whatever multicoin yeah oh every developer i know is leaving ethereum for solana you know those tweets that's 100 but but also i know of one case right right so i mean it does happen and yeah i think he was mentioning uh why he moved and it's like oh in my case he said you know new challenges new technology [Music] you know the things he uh thinks like solana might be good for uh you know he wanted those like fast block times even if they uh you know sacrifice decentralization it's like for my project i feel okay with that i said yeah we talked it's like interesting like that's totally fair um and then i went like them could i look at you know something different at least you know for the for the intellectual exercise of seeing how something works and you know not for me i cannot learn i cannot learn a new programming language man it's like i already have enough of them in my brain plus there's just the the switching yeah that you're the switching cost is like not something that that you're interested in right and it's like it's kind of like the same problem as like um trying to spin up a whole new social network right like sweet we have this brand new awesome social network let's all go and no one goes right it's like well i'll go if you go i'll go if you go i'll go if you go and then no one actually goes right and then it's what they are making a whole new group of friends and i'm talking about whole new things nah i'm 12 for that happy where i am this goes back to the to the party analogy and i think this came from also uh you know i mean he said somewhere like ethereum is a party and all my friends are here so why should i go to another one and then that got expanded a little bit it's uh with analogies of gas and  it's like oh yeah we have uh we have beer at this party and then somebody says oh but there's like uh champagne at this other one but it's like far away and there's nobody there and there's like the yeah i'll take the beer that i have with it versus the champagne i don't yeah exactly and then the friends that are that are already there uh i remember i talked to kami russo about this and she put in the book like infinite machine the the last chapter is called the party it's funny i'll have to go reread that chapter because i actually don't remember that yeah last chapter and i think it actually starts with uh with me yeah that's why oh i'm such a big ego that i i have like i have like the book the parts where i mentioned i'm like [Laughter] no that's awesome dude that's great if there's one thing that having it having an ego in crypto is definitely beneficial because like there's so much like clout to be claimed that you got to claim it right yeah yeah yeah you gotta you gotta play the game i also said that you know the best thing i did on twitter was like going from read only to read write right you know when i started producing instead of just consuming uh that also opened up you know it opened up a lot of opportunities it opened up new friendships uh it opened up investment opportunities it like really improved my uh you know ethereum lifestyle it was so good and that's also that's incredible i freaking love twitter and i'm on twitter all day as i think i was with my girlfriend yesterday we're watching tv and she's like hey what are you gonna do and i was on twitter it's like what do you mean like job wise it's like i'm on twitter this is my job now like i'm like drafting a tweet it's gonna take me this the whole it's gonna take me it's gonna take me 20 minutes to write this stream yeah yeah and but what other you know growing industry as you know ethereum uh crypto web 3 is also so accessible it's like you can you can go on twitter you can add whoever uh i don't know leshner now with the compound thing and he will answer right he's the founder of a multi-billion dollar protocol you can uh you can add cane and he will you can add i mean i'm thinking the ones that are there a lot like joe delong from sushi uh a lot of the add-ons and they will answer right they will have if you ask a good question if you ask yeah ask a good question yeah oh and of course i used to be i responded to every single dm uh was like my pride that i said yes i will answer every single dm and my dms will always be open and and i have a lot of followers compared to you know like you guys but still it's now it became unsustainable like it's extremely overwhelming yeah i i cannot do it anymore i still try uh but you know when when it's like a good question you know either like what should i do with with my career should i get into solidity i at least try to you know write a couple of lines because uh i did that you know i well at the point that i was starting twitter i was also you know now in the you know the ethereum the conference circle so most of the friends the community i made you know through conferences and not so much through twitter but you know where else is that i don't know the beginning of the space age imagine if you could like  tweet it when we have these like digital we have this like digital society right and so like where does the society congregate well it's going to congregate on goddamn twitter right like web 3b like be damned like we're going to fee we're going to use these web 2 platforms until until we can't until we have something better and there's nothing wrong with like to congregate on twitter to be of our place of just mutual conversations and the whole cool the whole cool thing about twitter is just like one massive mess of asynchronous conversations and so like you don't actually have to tune in you can tune in as you so choose conversation is going on with or without you and you can choose to add to the conversation to the global the the global conversation of this like crypto society you can tap it into now whenever and it's like literally the industry having a conversation with itself yeah and when there is an alternative we'll find it and we'll use it uh i don't wanna i don't wanna force it it's like so many projects in ethereum they were like ahead of their time uh and they failed because you know the landscape wasn't ready we weren't ready for certain things uh people you know existed for a long time that didn't pan out i know uh ava is building something now i hear maybe that'll be it maybe it'll be something else i'm not in a huge hurry we're changing so much right it's like when somebody says yeah but you're communicating on twitter and on discord it's like we're already changing so much so fast is that we don't have to change everything at once right it's like this is like gradual it's not like okay we're out of the city and now we're gonna live in the mountains and it's like you know do or die 100 or nothing it's like no we're doing what we can and let's not force everything and we're we're doing it in the correct like order of operations right like where the high value stuff goes first and now we've just unlocked l2s and so we've gone from like 100 main chain transactions to like five dollar l2 transactions but you also have to think of like what's the value of a tweet and yeah maybe maybe the value of a tweet goes all the way up to 10 cents but it's never going to exceed like a dollar right and so uh and most tweets are going to be worth .0001 pennies so we just need to once we have an economic platform that's like that then we can talk but right now we're doing all the stuff that's worth at least a 15 transaction right so there's just an order of operations exactly let's do the the foundation first internet money you know metaverse money whatever you want to spend right yeah uh i just remembered who said it the other day and and you replied  on twitter way too much oh celcus yeah with celcus right yeah yeah yeah if sulcus finally says ethan's metaverse money and i'm like dude ethan's just money man it's okay celcus you can say it it's all right i still like the guy oh no he's absolutely great a good conference yeah everything he says about crypto is absolutely spot on until he starts talking about ethereum and then it's only so-so yeah oh well well i can't win them all yeah so mariana what's next for you man um what's next i've i've been itching to just like go and on and put something out there put your builder hat back on but not let anyone know yes and i was talking to a prominent founder in new york about the benefits of of going fully and on and you know there were several things that they told me that i hadn't thought of and and it's not you know the the responsibility or or the legal liability even though you know that that's there it's something else it's like the being liberated uh from from judgement yeah and and just being able to to build and release something without you know pre-judging and and people thinking ahead of your intentions right uh yeah you can't build anything these days without people coming and judging you yes like even when we release the the bankless dow with the bank token like people judged for better or for worse i mean everyone that received the bank token was like yay and then there's a lot of people that were unrelated were like boo yeah i don't know um totally and everyone i talk to and this person as well is like this this shroud of uh anonymity feels good to them and like i said it's liberating but not just you know it's a builder uh crypto twitter as well you know that nobody has their actual face anymore it's just like profile pictures it's a crypto punks and board apes and whatever penguins and etc uh was and there is something weird i think people have become a bit more honest in what they say and i don't know if you've seen this movie hollow man you know it's like the invisible man whatever and there's a line i think he says something like you wouldn't believe what you're capable of when you cannot look at yourself in the mirror i found myself saying that i might not have said or just like written things that i might not have said if you know i'm seeing my picture there like looking back at me you know my head shot it's like you know with the glasses and hey going to defcon do you know that some bars will put a mirror behind the bar so that customers have to see their own faces when they yell at the bartender right and what they're like bitching about something i was like oh dude like i'm oh i'm doing that i look really ugly when i yell yeah yeah yeah yeah well it's the exact same thing here it's like you're looking at a and at some point that picture is you right i mean you have your punk uh back there and now when i see that i see you like i already like that punk if i see um i'm scrolling and i see it i know that it's you and then if i you know sometimes i double check it's like okay is this like uh right click save right whatever but you know that is you but it's also like a you know a mask uh in front of you and so is my punk and i find myself typing and saying things that i might have been a little bit more restrained and i think that the whole crypto twitter uh has done that so hopefully that's that's making ourselves no more honest through anonymity if that's even possible but no that definitely makes sense for sure um i was in my mental models like that's our metaverse self and it's very appropriate that like well we're on this internet platform web 2 or not like and now we have instead of our faces our digital representations we want to be and like one of the it's also worth noting that like the face that you have like you didn't ask for that you didn't choose that you didn't sculpt that yourself and so like the soul that you have behind your face it's actually a complete anomaly that of the relationship between the soul and the face right those are two separate things so like in the metaverse world we're gonna slap on a brand new face and it's as much as real because we at least we've chosen the digital representation we chose that i chose that crypto punk i didn't choose my own face though so like there is some sort of like uh natural resonance with like when you put on a profile picture avatar i will i will say that like a lot of my friends in my uh normie chat they all got into penguins all the same time and they all swapped out their profile pictures with penguins and we all lost track of who was who you cannot recognize any of them yeah i remember when when we were all penguins who was like who the is this i have no idea and then you have to keep track that i don't know for example alex vanovik now he got he realizes penguin i have to remember okay you know the viking penguin that's alex yep okay uh but there are people whose identity and yeah i mean i did choose my punk but then i also kind of didn't it's like i grabbed whatever floor punk was there at the time but if i could have chosen one i would have chosen one with uh maybe a couple more features right they're so expensive [Laughter] uh but yeah yeah so so the answer of what's happening next for mariano is spinning up an anon account and putting out some contracts somewhere uh yes but then how the how the hell do you do it it's like do you tweet do i tweet from my account it's like oh i just found out about this project i just ate into this contract come join me from this completely anonymous person that is totally not me i have no idea how to do it but right you're gonna have to start start from square one without the clout of mariana conte you're gonna have to spin up a brand new identity that has no help from the actual human i you know i i met so many uh add-ons during the last three months uh a few like big accounts and you know you meet them and they're people right they're people like us and it's like uh they're anonymous in on twitter and everything but it's like once you start meeting them it's like yeah hey i'm this person hey i'm this person but i i never asked them how they got started right yeah how they got started as an anon yeah i met i met g-money in real life in new york i was like i don't even know what the hell i was expecting but i was like oh you're not a punk i forgot like that's crazy you're not an ape uh widow they're in a cap yeah yeah that will that'll be a great story to tell is the story of how mariano's and on account became more followed than his actual human account that'll be funny no if that starts happening like i'll well doc's like docks yourself yeah yeah like no no no wait this is me this is me i swear to god it's me follow follow my mane [Laughter] no but for sure that is that is what i want to do next i i seriously just want to come up with like a tiny tiny tiny project because i actually produce a fair amount of code and i tweet about it and i tweet like stupid like solidity snippets to do you know fun things like saying gm to a smart contract and not if you don't say gm once a day then transactions fail and it's like hey grab this code and add it to your smart contract so you need to say good morning or yeah and stupid stuff like that but i never end up when i was talking to somebody else uh like a builder in the space and they were like yeah same thing it's like i produce a lot of code but i'm not you know like the the andres or the doms of the world that they treat mainnet as a playground right they build really quickly and they deploy like i build fairly quickly but i don't deploy it's like when i get to that part i become so middle of the curve you know that it's like oh no but maybe i should test it and no i don't like this and yeah the ui and and then somebody else is like contract in 20 minutes and it's like here use ether scan and i'm like no i cannot do that yeah that's got to be the maker dna in you yeah i know the conservative side yeah well mariana should we wrap it up here yeah yeah let's do it yeah well i appreciate you uh 90 minutes yeah not not bad thank you for coming on while you are coming out of a cough from mainnet yeah all right sorry if that was me that gave it to you i you know have my my mate as always and i'm glad that you know my my throat was cooperative and thank you because yeah we've been trying to uh record this for a few days now and uh yeah you're pulling it out for the last minute for listeners that are listening this on tuesday we're recording this on monday night so not that we discussed anything timely but uh it is still extremely extremely fresh yeah no no it is and it's like yeah we're just that's what i like about this we're just carrying on a conversation that we started a couple of months ago yeah in paris literally in paris yeah i was like oh you told you told me the story of uh when you were wrapped up in the blankets under this fantastic new air conditioner that you had and then your girlfriend came home and after a long day at work and saw you all cozy under the blankets just you've been like super hot all day and got super mad at you it was like we're going to talk about that on the roll-up or not on layer 0. oh man yeah yeah and and then we continued it over in like different continents different cities and now here it's yeah yeah i will say that that is that is definitely something that i've noticed with us but now that you actually name the thing is like the conversations that you and i have all kind of seem like one one seamless conversation we just pick up the thread random opportunities yeah i don't know that is exactly right are you going to listen by the way no i'm not after all the traveling i've been doing i specifically scheduled a podcast recording during lisbon so i couldn't go so i will be home in in san diego during that time ah smart man i might end up following but right now i'm leaning towards snow lucas the editor at bank list hit me up the days like i just found into a one-way ticket to lisbon i'm like well bye and then eventually i'll see you in uh pagoda in colombia not not uh not argentina for defcon but close enough maybe afterwards i'll come to argentina i i know i i remember when i tweeted that you know gonna meme that combi 2022 thinking like the people at the ethereum foundation it's like god damn it mariana's doing it again they responded from the the official defcon account he's like no no no we're squashing we're squashing that meme right now yeah it'll happen at some point in time and when it does it'll be glorious yeah no i i i believe it we're we're going to do something in buenos aires at some point yeah and it's going to be amazing i will be absolutely there for the week before the week during and the week after because it'll be fantabulous
