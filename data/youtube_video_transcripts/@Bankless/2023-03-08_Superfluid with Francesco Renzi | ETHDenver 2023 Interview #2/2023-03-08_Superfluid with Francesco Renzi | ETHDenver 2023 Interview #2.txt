[Music] thank you we're here at the interop summit series coming up next is Fran from superfluid what is super fluid it does streaming payments and France got some interesting takes about who and where streaming payments is getting adopted in the web 3 landscape small disclaimer here Ryan and I are investors in superfluid uh but first before we get into that conversation with Fran from superfluid a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023 why because Kraken has been around for over 12 years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry trusted centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable with over 9 million users and not a cent lost choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no-brainer we need exchanges like Kraken to provide the on-ramps to get people to go bankless and kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor if you're unsure about your centralized exchange or on-ramp perhaps open an account with Kraken today and if you're unsure about the rest of web 3 well then maybe you should get your learn on with metamask learn learning about crypto is hard there's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry until now metamask learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about web3 if you are a company trying to onboard employees or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your Boomer parents metamask learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons making learning about web3 fun and easy now once you're through kraken's Gates and you've taken the metamask course on what's a DEX you're safe to make your first stop into the world of D5 where better to start other than uniswap uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps but it's now also an nft aggregator as well making uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading Tech that's out there uniswap's a big announcement at East Denver is their uniswap wallet which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big old bully about crypto apps in the App Store uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem so if you want to use uniswap but with the cheapest possible fees then use uniswap on arbitrop the arbitrum layer 2 is the host of ethereum's most vibrant defy and nft communities arbitrary is already surpassing the each layer 1 in transaction volume and it's not even close to full capacity with so many vibrant communities on arbitrum arbitrim is a good place to call home for the era of layer twos speaking of settling into new homes the Phantom wallet is now available on both ethereum and polygon that's right the number one wallet on Solana is expanding into the ethereum ecosystem Phantom is the one wallet for everything displaying nfts making nft trades swapping tokens staking tokens so if you're a multi-chain surfer or an nft power user then the Phantom wallet is for you it also comes in Mobile check it out at phantom.app now let's get into the interview Vegas Nation we are here still at the interoperability Summit hosted by axillar and I'm here with Fran the CEO and co-founder of superfluid what's up Aaron hey yeah it's uh it's great there's a lot going on Denver is uh even busier than I've seen it last year so yeah so were you here at Denver last year yeah it's my fourth time fourth time yeah uh that's all of the times yeah I think yeah probably yeah uh yeah I think that's right uh there's not many people I've seen also have been there all of the times East Denver last year fun fact uh bankless engine 13 000 people I think we've counted 18 000 people here this year in a bear Market build Market excuse me how dare I friend speaking of build Market what's your building uh so super fluid is a decentralized protocol that allows you to stream money so using super fluid you can basically make one transaction on chain which initiates a recurring payment that happens every second so you can use this for all sorts of different things uh from payroll to tokenvesting and uh also a use case we're very excited about which is subscriptions and subscriptions in games so that's something we've launched recently seeing a lot of success with okay subscriptions and games and like first off how does this work so streaming payments like technically how does that work so technically uh super fluid has its own token standard which is an extension to erc20 okay and that token standard enables streaming the same way a normal token has transfer so you can do uh you know token dot transfer or token.stream right and streaming is basically moving money every second from one account to another and when you build it in your game it allows you to do things like receive rewards every second or for example pay a fee every second to get access to a particular part of the game right and I think um people who get go down the crypto Rabbit Hole they kind of get that pitch of uh you could pay per bite of internet access or you could have your payroll per paid to you per second this is that technology that unlocks that is exactly it so the the world that we imagine in the future is everybody's getting their payroll every second they're paying their subscriptions every second they're paying their rent every second you know they're getting their dividends every second everything is streaming around fluidly on chain okay and unlocking Capital like all of that exactly that cool stuff uh where are you seeing adoption of superfluid what's getting uh picked up on the move so so that's that's the tricky thing right adoption's really hard there's not that many users in web free and building an Economy based on streams is going to take a long time right objectively it's hard but when you build a game you can design your in-game economy from scratch right and you can design that in-game economy to use this Capital efficiency to use this uh you know this coolness of streaming from the ground up and that that's where we're seeing a lot of adoption now we we integrated with a game called Planet IX a couple of weeks ago and they got 25 000 users in a matter of two days wow all right oh listen to crypto game because 25 000 users in two days that's a crypto game yes and how is your crypto game leveraging super fluid so basically it's a strategy game you have a base and uh your base is uh the basic is free but if you want to expand your base you have to rent extra land okay and to rent that land you have to you have to stream their token right so you stream the token through the contract it gives you access to the land and you basically get better yields and you grow faster in the game so it's a bit of play to earn and so you're making a bet that rather than trying to deconstruct parts of the economy that already exists you'd rather inject super fluid into new economies that are being born right in this day and age exactly exactly but obviously this it's a stepping stone right but if you look at gaming historically it's been where adoption happens right it's gaming important right porn we maybe don't want to get into we'll say that one for a later date exactly exactly gaming right you can build unique experiences and people will adopt new behaviors not because it's better for them but just because it's fun right so you can introduce these behaviors and then you know when all of your in-game assets are streaming to you you're gonna ask your employer to stream your salary right and that is the The Next Step but that will take a bit longer so a lot of people across the web 3 ecosystem are really hammering this idea that it's going to be gaming that really is the next big wave in crypto and that's a really awesome narrative it's harder to vet how true that is but as someone who is actually working with games and they're integrating super fluid to some respect what's your Vantage Point where do you stand on like the whole web 3 gaming is the new the new bull market what are your attitudes there I I think it's uh it's and very hard to deny right like we've uh struggled to get users right you know we got a customer they're streaming money right there's 15 people in a team right 15 people streaming salaries and then we do one integration with one game and we get 25 000 unique users in two days right the scale is different and the scale is different because the use case is lower friction it's much easier to get into a game than to get a job at a web free company right so there's a ton of opportunities and all of those users onboarded for gaming they learn to use metamask they learn what self-custody is they learn how to use openc they learn how to use uni Swap and guess what that becomes their financial life right so all those users onboarded will stick around as long as these games are fun they're engaging and they have these uh engaging in-game economies right and you tell me is there a better place to build an in-game economy than on chain right yeah so you're a big plus one on the web 3 gaming is the next Walmart what's your attitude or belief that uh crypto mechanisms actually can make games more fun rather than getting in the way of ux and UI like how do you think that that problem is going to get solved um well that that's uh for the game designers in the room right I would I would argue it's another tool right but it's a tool that doesn't have competitors right in web 2 you just can't do this stuff right the interoperability is a new thing that people have to learn right when you're building a game in web 2 it's a wall Garden you make all the rules in web free you have composable assets you don't make all the rules anymore right you literally can't know what will happen with the assets you create and that is harder to reason about but it's a massive opportunity and whoever cracks it and manages to create games that are engaging composable you know maybe other people can build games using the same assets whoever can crack that is going to have a massive success that can't be replicated in web 2. so you you said the word interoperability which will bring us back to the beginning of this uh this interview because we're at the interop summit here from uh hosted by axillar and uh how does superfluid work with other chains you said it was an extension off of the erc20 token does that keep you constraining you to the evm world or like how does superfluid work in the cross-train ecosystem so at the moment we're deployed on eight uh different evm networks and we are planning to scale that to pretty much every evm Network it's much easier for us to deploy there at the same time uh somebody actually built for a hackathon a proof of concept on starknet which was very good and they now got a grand to finish that up so we're very excited starknet is going to be our first uh non-evm implementation and I think long term super fluid is going to be everywhere right it's a token standard tokens are everywhere super fluid has to be everywhere as well it's going to take a while it's a lot of work but it's worth it right if people have been peaked by this interview and they want to learn more where should they go uh so follow us on Twitter that's super fluid underscore HQ uh go to our website at superfluid.finance come to our Discord that's Discord superfluid.finance and for any developers out there a very interesting opportunity we host the hackathon every month it's called the super fluid wave pool uh whatever you build on super fluid or even if you just make contents you can submit it and we we're doing prizes every every month there's different themes different prizes different co-sponsors a lot of opportunity to build with us and you know make that future we're talking about a reality amazing Fran thank you so much for walking me through it yeah thank you cheers cheers
