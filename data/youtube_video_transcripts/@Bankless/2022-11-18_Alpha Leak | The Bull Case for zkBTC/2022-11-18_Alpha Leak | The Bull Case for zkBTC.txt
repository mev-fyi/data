today on this Alpha League episode we are exploring ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin which I didn't even know was possible until I stumbled upon this website called bitcoinrollups.org which is a research Endeavor out of this man John light who got a grant to go research what can you do when you put a roll up on bitcoin is that even possible and so it turns out a lot is possible also in this episode I bring on Eric wall who's also a bitcoiner a technical bitcoiner to help me co-moderate this conversation because this is something that Eric Wall I know is just very interested in and wants to see happen on bitcoin so we talk about Roll-Ups on bitcoin of course what that means for the lightning Network what a what you can do on a roll up on bitcoin is it just a payments Network that is a better lightning Network or is it the full Suite of smart contracts tokens uh what's it take to put Roll-Ups on bitcoin do we have to hard Fork is it just a soft Fork how like how complex is this how is the community going to receive this because the Bitcoin Community is generally resistant to change but we've kind of been seeing a tide shift in the Bitcoin Community lately maybe there's more bitcoiners that are more interested in something like Roll-Ups on bitcoin and overall I'm just really fascinated about this concept Roll-Ups on bitcoin and it's kind of restored my interest in Bitcoin it's one of the most Innovative things I've seen out of the Bitcoin space in a really long time uh and so this is something that I hope to see coming uh for the future of Bitcoin so I hope you enjoy this exploration into the world of ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin with my two guests John light and Eric Wall right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly if you fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to

Sovereign but also moonlights as a Bitcoin researcher in his free time and recently got a grant from the human rights Foundation to do research on how to do ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin and this is what piqued my attention and why I wanted to do a show on this because ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin I didn't know that that was possible but according to John's research it is possible John welcome to bankless yeah thanks so much for having me and also because I am uh uh not the always the best person to ask Bitcoin questions we're bringing in some help we're bringing in Eric Wall uh who's going to be my technical co-host my bitcoiner co-host to ask me and ask John uh some more some better questions more than just a higher level stuff so Eric thank you so much for helping me do the show today thanks for having me having me David cheers all right John let's get into it uh let's explain a little bit about yourself give yourself uh our bio uh and kind of how you came to be working on the intersection of ZK Roll-Ups and Bitcoin sure so I'm a long time bitcoiner Bitcoin is my first love you could say in uh cryptocurrency uh world and I have had a fascination with a cross-chain Bitcoin protocols um even before side chains the term sidechain was was even developed I've been interested in in this idea of like you know could you move Bitcoin into other chains that have different sets of rules and the side chains white paper came out in 2014 I was really excited about that um years went by and the best kind of side chains we've gotten so far are like Federated multi-cigs um that hold people's Bitcoin um and I've always been interested to know like can we do better than that can we have permissionless trustless side chains or at least Bridges to to other blockchains and um a couple of years ago I was working on a project in the ethereum world called Aragon and this is a Dao creation tool and it was also around the time of like well first there was cryptokitties which kind of caused a lot of congestion on the blockchain and we were already starting to think about scalability around that time so like late 2017 early 2018 but throughout the that that um bear Market Gas fees started coming down and it became less of an issue but it was always something in the back of our mind so research was ongoing about how can we improve the scalability of this system so that it doesn't cost like a hundred dollars to cast a vote or something like that um and eventually um you know ideas like plasma and state channels and eventually Roll-Ups um were invented in the ethereum community as ways to reduce congestion move transactions off chain make transactions cheaper more scalable so on and so forth and and so that's how I first became familiar with roll-ups and um eventually these two interests of mine kind of converged where you know I realized okay Roll-Ups are basically like trustless Bridges um that you can use to transfer coins to other blockchains this is like you know kind of the original side chains vision of like having you know trustless uh Bridges to other blockchains and you can move your coins between different blockchains and I thought you know wouldn't this be uh cool to bring to bitcoin John I think the the most interesting thing about this for me is that uh ZK Roll-Ups are a technical technology that just makes sense to me in the ethereum ecosystem it's the it's a the logical progression of like State channels to plasma to Roll-Ups uh has always felt a very like a natural progression of scale for a blockchain and so then uh when we talk about using this which is just an inherently neutral technology ZK roles are just a neutral technology the fact that we can uh allegedly which what we're going to unpack today that we can apply a ZK roll up to bitcoin gets me excited it's one of the first things I saw a lot of potential out of out of the Bitcoin Bitcoin space in a in a long time like lightning has never really interested me liquid has always been a joke but ZK Roll-Ups seem like uh if we can apply them to bitcoin it can open up a brand new world and that's really what has gotten me excited here is it and so really just to Define these terms we have ZK Roll-Ups on ethereum is it simply as is it as simple as just taking the technology that we've gotten and started to roll out in the ethereum world and just applying it to bitcoin and then also it just like quote works is it is it really that simple depending on how validity Roll-Ups are actually enabled on bitcoin layer one the smart contracts that secure the bridge between layer one and the layer two validity roll up could be practically identical to the smart contracts that are used for validity Roll-Ups on other chains or they could be quite different because Bitcoin uses a different state model than ethereum for example so ethereum uses a state model that's known as the account model Bitcoin uses a state model that's known as the utxo model and this has implications for how you program smart contracts to interact with user funds including in this use case enabling users to transfer their funds into a layer 2 protocol such as a validity roll-up so while the roll-up features will be or could be identical between Roll-Ups that you could build on ethereum for example or Roll-Ups that you would build on bitcoin the actual mechanics of how the funds are secured on layer one could be quite different Eric I know you've always been an optimist about the future of Bitcoin Innovation I know that ZK Roll-Ups has been one of those things when you saw this paper and also for the for the listeners who have a computer handy bitcoinrollups.org is a useful website which is kind of the the punch line of this whole show uh Eric when you when you saw this paper when you read this paper and saw it out of John light what did you see what got sparked in your imagination yeah so just to give some context on like how the research project came to be uh like the sort of origin story here is that it was actually Udi wertheimer that had some argument on Twitter that led to CMS Holdings making a hundred thousand Grand to uh charity of Udi's Choice might have been actually it might have been the the the podcast that you guys did within the the BNB uh b b is sound money hyper sound money or something yeah right so um CMS sent a hundred thousand dollar Grant to the human rights Foundation the human rights Foundation partnered with starkware and Alex Gladstone who's the chief uh strategy officer at Human Rights Foundation has been like he has his own like he he's very idealistic with Bitcoin and he wants he really wants Bitcoin to succeed and he's very I would say in many cases he's very uh intellectually honest about like what the complications for um for Bitcoin is and then he uses the human rights Foundation sometimes to to create grants and create research projects to to solve the bottlenecks that he's seeing so Alex lasting he has been interested in trying to understand like can we use something like CK Roll-Ups as an alternative technology or is that as a complementary technology to to the lightning Network on bitcoin and then uh he did a combined Grant between stockware and the human rights Foundation uh to to research this basically and I was helping Alex find the right candidate to do the research projects we had a bunch of different applications and I've known John light like from Twitter from before and I know that he's uh very clued in about what the technology Stacks already looks like so it's not going to be completely new pieces to him so we chose him base because he was the best candidate and the uh the uh work that he's done uh we're very happy with with the work that John has done so uh from our from our end uh the the research project I would say has been a success and uh it's incredibly interesting to listen to John speak about this because John was previous to to having done this work he was a bit skeptical to whether or not Roll-Ups were actually a fitting technology on bitcoin I myself have been skeptical uh whether or not because one of the things that a roll up does it's it it allows you to segregate state from the main chain to uh a secondary layer so one of the scalability bottlenecks in ethereum is that the the main chain state is so bloated but the roll-up is a new state um and in Bitcoin we don't really have we have a utxo set which is the the closest equivalent to a state uh the way that we have it in ethereum but the state in Bitcoin isn't really you know it's not it's not tens of gigabytes or hundreds of gigabytes large as it is in ethereum it's much smaller it's it's much leaner so for this reason it hasn't been really clear like do we actually need Roll-Ups on bitcoin does it solve the I mean ethereum is an extremely computationally heavy product right Bitcoin doesn't really function in the same way we don't really have the same type of scalability bottlenecks so therefore it really has been a question like does does ZK rollups on bitcoin actually solve the correct type of scalability bottlenecks and sort of the interesting thing that has come out of John's research is that it does address those specific bottlenecks it is uh something that we can use to reach like orders of magnitude more scale and Bitcoin so so when I hear a roll up on bitcoin two things come to mind one is a better lightning Network um my opinion on the net lightning network is that the ux is too difficult for it to be really adopted as a mainstream technology um and and so if with a ZK roll up on bitcoin we might be able to have the scalability of that we need in order to scale Bitcoin payments to the world um so I want to go down that rabbit hole the other Rabbit Hole I want to go down is expressivity it's like okay what other potential is unlocked by Ezekiel does it make Bitcoin more expressive than the layer one and so I'll we'll take those one at a time John uh is a very simple like ZK roll up on bitcoin just a better lightning network is that something that we've unlocked here by the way could I just jump in here real quick yeah sorry let Eric uh let Eric hop in he probably can ask the question better yeah so no I just want to I just want to mention something that I thought it was pretty funny so um I had a bet with the editor of Bitcoin magazine about whether or not the merge would happen this year and the BET was for a Tungsten Cube and as we know the merge happened this year so uh he was going to send me 333 dollars over the lightning network uh yesterday and I downloaded a wallet called the wallet of Satoshi and I sent him an invoice and I wasn't sure it's going to work because the problem that you usually have with lightning is that you don't have enough inbound liquidity so in lightning you need uh liquidity locked up to be able to receive a payment which one is one of the most fundamental limitations of the lightning Network and in this case it actually worked I didn't have to do any setup I just received the payment of 333 dollars I was like holy lightning actually works and I was this close to making like I guess I feel like I have to be intellectually honest when good things are happening with lightning like if something really works and it impresses me it would be intellectually dishonest if I said you know I'm not gonna publish I'm not going to Tweet about that so as I'm writing the tweet I thought you know I'll just I just to go and look up but this is actually like a non-custodial wallet and that it is in the custodial wallet that handles all the lightning uh channels turns out the walls of Satoshi is a custodial lightning wallet so this was all like done in a centralized fashion and I was like okay well that's the reason that you know this works and it wasn't it wasn't this discovery that the lightning Network suddenly Works um so I think you know the this this issue with lightning is really in my perspective this is the reason why Roll-Ups has been such a huge interest for me it's because these Channel limitations that you have the lightning and John you've looked at this um like you in your in your rollups paper you've gone through like the sort of user experience bottlenecks or quirks with the lightning networks and how Roll-Ups are sort of different so it would be super interesting to hear like how you compare those two technologies yeah yeah I think it from from what I can tell people's experience using lightning varies some people have a great experience all the time some people have problems and it it's very set up dependent like dependent on the wallet dependent on what nodes you have channels open to depending on how much liquidity you have um like I have used Phoenix wallet and Breeze wallet and blue wallet all for lightning um I believe blue wallets implementation of lightning is custodial but Breeze wallet and Phoenix are mostly non-custodial um and I I have I haven't had any problems with with any of those wallets I think I've had two or three outbound payments that have ever failed um and it was because the person I was sending it to just didn't have enough uh liquidity um and uh so whereas Roll-Ups they're blockchains so if you have funds on the Chain you can send it to any other address on the Chain um and you know as long as your transaction gets included in a block like the payment is going to complete the trade-off that you get is throughput so lightning throughput on the network itself is not constrained in any way you and I can pass back and forth uh you know a Satoshi millions of times and it's not constrained by data it's not yeah it's not constrained by the base layer uh you know block size limit uh yeah good clarification um it is constrained by bandwidth and like liquidity um but it's not constrained by the base layer um transaction throughput and the transactions on Lightning have what is referred to as like local state so only the parties to the transaction actually even know that really the transaction is happening and that that's like where you get Lightning's massive throughput and scalability gains from because you don't need to tell your your transaction to the entire world you just keep those transaction details between the parties to a transaction whereas Roll-Ups have what is called Global state where everybody who's using the protocol knows about all the transactions because just like with the base layer blockchain you're broadcasting these transactions to a Global Network um some nodes out there that are performing the role of block producers are bundling those transactions into a block and then that block has to get confirmed on the layer one or or base layer blockchain and so the amount of transactions that fits in a rollout block has to fit within the the L1 data a availability capacity whether that's you know within the the layer one block itself or in some like data blob that's attached to the block um and and so that's that's like kind of the fundamental trade-off like you get these nice user experience benefits where it just feels like using any other blockchain um but you're you're fundamentally constrained in in throughput by the data availability uh capacity on on your base layer blockchain Okay so is it is it fair to say if I um uh that we've seen Roll-Ups grow in adoption on the ethereum side of things we haven't seen the lightning Network really become adopted on the Bitcoin side of things is it fair to say that like with Roll-Ups on bitcoin we would have a payments Network that is Superior in its adoption potential than lightning network is that a fair thing to say well I don't know that a fair comparison can really be made between Roll-Ups on ethereum today and lightning on bitcoin one they're used for very different things so you know the amount of money that say circulates in a financial system for trading different types of assets is almost certainly going to be different than the amount of money that's circulating through say a peer-to-peer payments application or something like that another thing that you have to look at is not just the liquidity but the actual like amount of users um and there are thousands of lightning nodes on the network and some of those are custodial so they have like customers who are utilizing those nodes that it's hard to you know even say how many users they have unless they advertise it since they're hidden behind like a custodial interface and so even the throughput on the network because it's not a global state we don't know how many transactions are happening um across the lightning Network so it's hard to make a compare a comparison and even if you could compare them like I said I don't think it's quite comparing Apples to Apples um with that having been said I think that because of the ux benefits that you get from having this Global State model and like being able to receive offline payments being able to receive payments without requiring inbound liquidity and and having Channel limitations and things like that I think those features do overall improve the user experience and so light uh Roll-Ups could be an alternative for certain use cases and not others um like if you need really high capacity high volume low value transactions like micropayments or Nano payments then you know a state Channel network such as Lightning might still be the better option but for simple venmo like peer-to-peer payments or maybe even like you know business to business uh payments Roll-Ups might be better like a better user experience the the the constraints or requirements of that type of payment this might be better suited to to a Roll-Up yeah so there's a there's a problem segment here that we don't really know the answer to like is the reason that the lightning network is not taking office quickly as you know other layers on ethereum for example is it because the user experience of lightning is bad or is it because people don't want to make payments with Bitcoin we don't really know the answer to those questions but I can speak for myself as a bitcoiner that I would probably make more transactions if the lightning network was more reliable then I would have a wallet with some funds in it I would go I would use it whereas with lightning it's always like I pull up my wallet it sort of has to sync my channels are not always configured and then that sort of leads me to go and put that into a custodial wall but I don't want to put a sizable amount of funds in a custodial wallet because I'm sort of worried that it's going to disappear so it's not clear exactly what the what the reason is that that people are not using I think whether it's user experience related or if it's something else my perception is that it's the the property that it's the the roll up on bitcoin and Bitcoin roll up revolves in general are this persistent thing that has 100 uptime is a big unlock whereas like the lightning network is this more nebulous thing where parts of the Latin lightning Network go offline then they come off online later uh and that the lightning network is just this Loosely uh connected network of nodes when some of those notes go offline uh versus a roll-up where the roll-up is one single blockchain with 100 uptime I think that's the unlock that I think really uh gets me excited about the potential of a new layer on bitcoin that sees a lot of demand um uh yeah John some some thoughts on that yeah well to draw another comparison I think today Roll-Ups don't actually fit the full vision of like what we uh imagine a roll-up to be right or the full potential of a roll-up like today they're uh secured by multi-cigs not by layer one consensus today they have single block producers not multiple block producers and so there have been outages on Roll-Ups where users can't access their funds for 24 or 48 hours or longer um and uh and so similar to the way that you know the lightning Network it's immature people are still building out tools for managing liquidity and figuring out the user experience uh at Rough edges I think some of those rough edges are going to be able to be smoothed out some of them might you know might never be able to be smoothed out um similarly you know with Roll-Ups I think there is a potential there to get to an ideal state of trustlessness security uptime um and we might never reach that full ideal in the same way that even with base layer blockchains today there are bugs and there are there are there are ux challenges um but like we can move incrementally closer to that ideal and I think the ideal state of a Roll-Up again for certain use cases is arguably Superior than lightning or other layer 2 protocols that we can build on Bitcoin today so that's that's one of the things that makes me excited about Roll-Ups is that I think they can fulfill particular use cases they can fill a particular potential that that just isn't possible today yeah one example of that that I think is super interesting is that like I can say to you David like um by the way I just sent you uh forty dollars on the uh ZK sync Roll Up or On the arbitrim roll-up and you're like oh and you're like okay so do I go and claim it with my ens name like David Hoffman and then you can then you have access to those funds and we didn't have to coordinate on which layer like we need to do any setup process before that I just sent you those funds like an email like I just know your email address you now have those assets uh so that's something that you can do in a roll up you could do that on a roll up on bitcoin also but you just send them funds without them even downloading a roller wallet you can send them funds and that's something that you cannot do with with the lightning Network the way that it's currently uh the way that it currently exists right because as a user as a lightning user I need to initially initialize my lightning node and then also maintain that lightning node in order to have like my email address being able to receive emails which is just like not a ux that people are used to and perhaps just like is insurmountably difficult for Global adoption but this idea where you have this persistent address that exists at any layer that works universally and you don't have to maintain a node or initialize a node in the first place to be able to access this uh I think that's just a ux that is more resonant with with the internet going people of of the Modern Age I don't know if this is a problem that could be solved but you do have to be careful about that because I remember there was a problem with some tokens on optimism that the optimism team was distributed to I think an investor or something like that winter mute it was a trading firm but there was actually a Nuance there is that it was a it was a gnosis multi-sig and it was a very early version of the gnosis multi-sig so it was a bit of software on top of a layer uh and that particular software right it was a contract address so they had it didn't actually have anything to do with the fact that it was on a new layer it was a specific multi-sig implementation that created a new address that was um different from the address on the layer one so that was more of an application layer uh difference than a protocol layer difference I thought it was something like the case was like they they had the contract address on layer one that optimism team sent the tokens to the address on Layer Two and somebody else deployed the contract to the optimism roll-up and was able to basically create a wallet with the same address and therefore like they had they they were the owners of those tokens that is what that is what happened but that but that's an application layer thing not a blockchain layer thing it was as the specific code of the actual multi-sig that created that property that was allowed to be exploited rather than the actual like layer itself does that make sense yeah yeah yeah I just I bring it up to say like I don't know if it's you it's uh you can 100 assume that a user is going to you know have the same address on on all layers so you want to be careful about that but um sure assuming like I said at the beginning like I don't know if that problem can be solved um but if you know maybe when it can and you can reliably assume that then then you get to kind of this Nirvana state where you can just like right you know somebody's address you can send them money anywhere and just tell them like hey your money's over here go get it um I think that would be a really great place to end up certainly okay so I think we've unpacked the differences between the payment properties of a Bitcoin roll-up versus lightning I want to get into expressivity uh and so when we get into a a new layer on top of Bitcoin that's a ZK ZK roll up uh what other things can we do on a layer on top of Bitcoin that's a ZK roll up that we can't actually do on the Bitcoin layer what like what what kind of new features are unlocked for us so are we getting like the full scope of like tokens and smart contracts and ens names or is it something more more simple like what are we what is what are the new things that are unlocked here um potentially yeah any anything that you could do with a blockchain um you can full touring complete expressivity yeah yeah I mean you you need to have a verifier on layer one that is capable of verifying the the proofs of that computation um and I discussed in the report that I wrote up about how if Bitcoin developers did not want to enable that level of expressivity for some reason they could restrict the complexity or or power of the computations that are able to be verified on layer one basically intentionally handicapping the the verifier um on layer one um but if you if you want weren't to do that then yeah theoretically you could have any kind of blockchain converted to a rollout and layer one doesn't need to know how to like execute those transactions it just needs to know how to verify the proofs and as long as it can verify the proofs the state can be updated and users can safely make withdrawals and the roll-up just works so this is one of the like mind-blowing facts about Roll-Ups on Bitcoins that they actually enable fully touring complete virtual machines so this was I went I was I was interested in rollup since 2019 and it wasn't like a couple of years after that I realized actually wait a stark proof can encode an entire virtual machine it does that on ethereum and then of course it should it you can also do the exact same thing on bitcoin so the way that you can think about the the validity proofs that you implement on the mainnet is that they're almost like adapters like like they're almost like a power adapters that can change the entire virtual machine of the system that it's validating so it opens up basically like Limitless potential any new type of virtual machine which is why like the limitation the the comparison between the lightning Network and a roll up is sort of Limp because it doesn't really even address this whole new paradigm of applications that they roll up potentially unlocks um it would be interesting to think little bit about Okay so we've talked about the transaction throughput benefits when we're only talking about like account to account transfers in a robot if we're talking about like current complete smart contracts would it even be feasible to run uh like one like a unit swap or like could we even run one um like smart contract application so they exist on ethereum without like breaking the scalability boundaries of Bitcoin that I don't know because we've only really looked at like account account transfers where the uh on-chain footprint is kind of it's like small like 12 bytes per transaction I would say so I mean if you look at if you look at the size of like even just a raw uncompressed uh uni swap transaction on chain it's you know not even kilobytes like uh it you know it's it's a very small amount of data to actually update the the state of of the uni swap contract so I think I think you could the same way that we're able to confirm not just a single transaction but batches of evm compatible transactions within ethereum blocks which even accounting for call data are much smaller than Bitcoin blocks um yeah I think I think uh it shouldn't be a problem on bitcoin so maybe it's fair to say that so the the the hardest thing maybe to achieve here because when I when I read your research we you also looked at like enabling Z cash style fully private transactions uh through a roll up and then the um scalability of the system actually goes like it actually decreases so you can't make as many zcash style transactions using a ZK roll up on bitcoin as the mainnet uh Bitcoin layer can do regular transaction itself so if you go into like the ZK the zcash uh style Paradigm through roll up then sorry Bitcoin does like four transactions per transaction four transactions per second right now it'll only be able to do like three transactions per second if it tried to do ZK uh zcash style transactions using a robot right yeah yeah shielded transactions because you have to in like the transactions end-to-end encrypted it like blow this blows up the size of the the transaction um even with you know the the most efficient proofs that we have today um it it ends up being bite for bite um about 20 bigger uh 20 25 bigger than a a normal one input two output Bitcoin layer one transaction um I think you know you could that's not a huge uh hit and it's you're getting a much better privacy profile like if you tried to have a similar similarly private uh Bitcoin transaction like you just couldn't even do it like you couldn't fit enough inputs and outputs to match the anonymity set of like a shielded transaction um so they're not completely comparable but um uh yeah I think it's I think it's worth the additional 20 25 uh size to to get that strong level of privacy but um it's up to each user to decide really yeah you could potentially also maybe run an application like tornado cash and that's maybe that's not the the one application that you'll see developer rushing into developing right now but you could potentially run an application like that also if you just want to get like a mixer that runs on bitcoin because I mean we have coin joints on bitcoin um but the Privacy is not perfect the scalability is not very high maybe something like tornado cash through a ZK roll-up maybe that could be um a use case for people that want to get better privacy or do you think that maybe um zcash style transactions are are the better use case here I think I think mixers have a lot of foot guns involved because there are a lot of like rules that you have to follow to use a mixer safely so you don't de-anonymize yourself and as a consequence damage the anonymity of everybody else using the mixer um so you know I would I would Advocate you know if people want privacy the direction that we need to move in is is getting people to store their money in shielded pools and to make shielded transactions um simply depositing your money into a shielded pool and then taking it out a couple days later uh I don't think that really solves the problem because then you have staying inside machine there is sort of more elegant solution to the Privacy problem but going in and out of mixers all the time right yeah you like you're you're less susceptible to timing attacks uh you're less uh the the your like questions about post-mix privacy are uh easier to reason about um and of course you know Z to Z you know fully shielded transactions are kind of the gold standards so I would hope that most peer-to-peer payments um that don't need to have any kind of public component moves

just to make sure that I'm tracking this conversation what we're talking about is there's various applications that we can do on a ZK roll-up perhaps Limitless and it's really a function of the construct trains of the Bitcoin layer 1 block space and so now we're talking about all right like what applications are like high priority uh what applications on a ZK roll up on bitcoin do we want to emphasize first uh and I totally understand that uh private payments probably resonates with Bitcoin culture more than tokens um and so maybe that's that's kind of where we start and uh kind of open up the design space for for stuff that kind of resonate resonates with Bitcoin culture but in theory so long as there's block space on the Bitcoin layer one there is potential uh on a Bitcoin CK roll up on its own Layer Two and that that potential is really just only constrained by the imaginations of the developers that can build on it this is my takeaway is that is that correct yeah um but it should be said though that uh bitcoiners have recently they are recently waking up to this idea that in order to win the payments use case for any blockchain system it's a good idea to start out with stable coins so if you can if you can build a stablecoin payments rails that could come that becomes universally adopted that'll be much easier to later introduce your own native token into that so if the lightning Network for example becomes the leading solution to transfer stable coins around then Bitcoin gets an edge relative to ethereum and if if Roll-Ups become the leading solution and they're based on ethereum to transfer stable coins it'll be easier to sort of sneak ether into that mix and transfer those tokens right so um but I do think that transferring stable coins on the lightning network is not that easy they have a solution currently which involves swapping the stable coin in and out of Bitcoin multiple times just to complete the payment which means that they're going to incur like multiple spreads on those payments so they won't necessarily be very cheap and the ux as we know isn't perfect with lightning either so something like a ZK roll up on bitcoin where you make stable coin payments will potentially be advantageous even to the like the the uh the path to adoption the the bitcoiners have already sort of understood is is is optimal so the Roll-Ups could fill a use case there where you're using them to transfer tokens also and I don't think that Bitcoin is necessarily would be like against that idea one of the things that um we we didn't mention that I think is interesting is like this idea of building layer three protocols on top of a layer 2 roll-up in order to compensate for any shortcomings that would be on the roll up such as you know transaction capacity due to layer one throughput limitations so like you could have layer three protocols like validiums or volitions or things like that where you actually have off-chain data availability you reduce the security Model A little bit it still ends up being a stronger security model than like your typical Federated side chain um and you're not constrained by the base layer um throughput capacity so if you wanted to say on board an entire country like El Salvador um to bitcoin you might say well we don't want just everybody to have custodial accounts because that's not the Bitcoin way um but they're not all going to fit on layer one or maybe even Layer Two can we do something that's like in the middle and I think uh a validium built on top of a roll-up could be that sweet spot where it's still not custodial there's a strong guarantee that users can get their funds out with data uh with if the data is available and um and and at the same time you have basically unlimited throughput I mean just as as much throughput as the sequencer or block producers are are willing to allow for to to to produce their blocks but um yeah that's that's I think an interesting way as we were talking about those those limitations of throughput on the base layer that's like an interesting way that you can use ZK Roll-Ups or validity Roll-Ups to um enable these these new protocols that that aren't possible on Bitcoin today that offer interesting security and scalability uh trade-offs yeah and you mentioned in your uh in your paper you mentioned uh the ability to build the Lightning Network on top of azk roll up so in order to improve the scalability of the lightning Network you could run it on on a ZK roll up on bitcoin so that could be like a layer three but it's true that you point out that I mean the lightning networks the way it's the way that the lightning network is constructed it's it's designed the way that it's designed because of the limitations of uh the Bitcoin base layer and the script language the scripting language of Bitcoin but if you have a ZK roll up you could build a little bit different uh like a little bit different scripting language and build a little bit different lightning Network that solves some so for example if you want L2 or other things that people are waiting for in in lightning you can sort of enable those things with a ZK roll-up module and then you can build more interesting or more user-friendly uh more secure perhaps even lightning networks on top of that roll up so that's uh do you agree with that with that assessment yeah yeah I think I think enabling developers to try more things more quickly without having to wait for base layer consensus changes um I think will help Advance the state of L2 or like off-chain protocol development and um yeah that's that's an exciting possibility we sort of have to sort of get into what exactly needs to be done on the Bitcoin base layer to even enable this I think this is a should we get into that discussion maybe yeah that's exactly where I was going to go next because I've had this discussion with other people who are familiar with building on the Bitcoin blockchain it's like all right like how do we get Bitcoin trustlessly over to ethereum how do we build like bridges that are trustless and every time I like ask developer-minded friends like how do we do this thing on bitcoin they're like well we're going to need to change the op codes and as as soon as I hear that line change the op codes my mind just goes like well that's not going to happen because that means a hard Fork uh and that Bitcoin just doesn't hard Fork like that's the vibe that's the social contract uh and so John what does it take to actually get a ZK roll up into Bitcoin like what changes do we need how do we actually uh arrive at this at this future state that we all want for Bitcoin so there will need to be new OP codes but the good news is that if it doesn't take a hard fork okay so the way that op codes have been added or disabled in Bitcoin over the years um pretty much since the Satoshi days is using a style of Fort called a soft Fork which is considered backwards compatible Okay so old nodes don't need to update their software in order to remain on the network and in consensus and able to send and receive coins with other nodes that have upgraded and uh adopted the the new OP codes so this is how for example p2sh which we use for multi-sig uh in Bitcoin was adopted this is how segwit was adopted and most recently Tap Root okay so Bitcoin does soft Forks like it's very successful it has successfully implemented soft Fork upgrades in its history so it's reasonable to assume that we can do this again if the Bitcoin Community wants ZK roll-ups yeah yeah for sure well um I mean this this still introduces if we think about the risks that Ezekiel roll up introduces on bitcoin I think a lot of people are afraid if you introduce a turing complete virtual machine module through a ZK roll up on bitcoin then you can have very complex smart contract smart contract languages run basically on top of Bitcoin and if there's an exploit a bug like let's say like a dow hack in that second layer then the base it sort of becomes the base layers problem so now if you have to sort of save all the users in the second layer because there was a bug there then maybe you need to do that through uh soft work on the on the on the base layer so so the problems that can happen in these external layers can sort of trickle down to the base layer itself and also issues like Mev for example if you have a role of generating lots and lots of mov and then the the miners that get to include the the proofs of the roll up on the on the on the main it maybe there's like getting to include those proofs pay way more than any other transactions do so then miners are all of a sudden incentivized to sort of reorganize the blockchain to be the ones that get to include these proofs instead of just like mining the blockchain as usual so the same similar this the same critiques or similar critiques that have been levied against Drive chains are theoretically in my opinion could be Levitt also against uh ZK Roll-Ups but the advantage that ZK will absorb has here is that it's it's it's different it doesn't have the same political baggage that drive chains do uh all the conflicts between the core developers and Paul Storch who was the pioneer of Drive chains is not relevant anymore and ZK Roll-Ups also they have they have stronger security guarantees right so it might be worthwhile actually doing this for ZK Roll-Ups while for Drive chains it wasn't really worthwhile because you still it was just a merge mine sidechain basically uh so I wouldn't I think that there's still uh a conflict that would need it's not just a matter of a technical Improvement that when we have time we will get it into Bitcoin it's uh a whole ideological question of whether or not this upgrade makes sense to bitcoiners and I think like from my perspective what really would need to happen for people in the Bitcoin ecosystems to seriously evaluate this is if ethereum started to flip and Bitcoin then it would be like okay you know maybe maybe we need to try something new but unless that happens and Bitcoin just keeps this very dominant role I think people will more think of ZK Roll-Ups as something for the future maybe I don't know those are my thoughts I'm less uh convinced that ethereum hypothetically flipping Bitcoin would cause that deep of soul searching to say change the calculus of whether or not it would be worth implementing evm or terrain complete ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin I think uh there's a there's a view in the Bitcoin community that ethereum is like a tech platform and so ethereum flipping Bitcoin would be no more noteworthy than a tech startup you know stock market cap post IPO flipping Bitcoin or something like that um at least I'm sure people would try to explain it away um in that way and that might not even be uh that invalid of of a viewpoint but um I think that part of the debate it involves even more Nuance it's like we could enable ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin without enabling fully turning complete uh evm compatible or or other kinds of fully expressive ZK Roll-Ups we could say we're going to enable the verifier to verify transactions that are uh no more complex than Bitcoin is today like you can't do it just can't it isn't capable of verifying computation heavier than that um and so you would be you would be limited in the types of scripts that you could build on the the layer 2 roll-up and you know bitcoiners might say like you know we can start there and maybe in you know a few years down the line after we've done more research on say cross layer Mev or these other like more subtle economic game theoretical concerns um you know we'll we'll make a decision about whether we want to enable these more expressive roll-ups um so I I do think that we could see um validity Roll-Ups on bitcoin before we even have answers to like those those questions about the more expressive roll-ups so the the perspective that I'm seeing here is that like in the ethereum land anyone can build a roll up and deploy it at any time there's no like changes to the base layer like we can have a bajillion different Roll-Ups of a different different uh bajillion different varieties what I'm seeing here John is that like that's not true in the Bitcoin land the Bitcoin social contract needs to come to consensus about what flavor of roll-up they want to enable and that kind of makes that future roll up more enshrined than ethereum Roll-Ups where ethereum Roll-Ups are all kind of commercial they're all built as like a second layer to ethereum that don't they and they don't really impact the base layer because they don't have requirements upon the base layer a Bitcoin ZK roll-up would require things of the Bitcoin layer one and if the Bitcoin layer one changed itself via a soft Fork to enable a specific kind of roll-up that kind of enshrines that roll up as like a more of a First-Class citizen to bitcoin than a and then ethereum does to to its own its own Roll-Ups Eric Eric did that make sense and do you agree with that I agree with that and also one of the things that I think that you almost touched on is that in the Bitcoin world then we we don't have the ability to plug in any type of robot into the Bitcoin system we have to decide on a specific proof system and then enable that specific proof system so and this is one of the the big complications of it like how do we even decide which proof system we want to enable like there's plunks there's redshift there's growth there's all these different types of cryptographic mechanisms I mean we know in Bitcoin that we sort of prefer cryptographic systems with the least amount of new Assurance least amount of assumptions so we want something that is maybe Stark based you can go into this also John so we we want something that creates the least amount of Risk by using something that is as tested as possible and we don't want any trusted setups but we still have to choose a specific proof system and then we have to stick to that and then if there's a new one that comes along then that would involve a new uh soft Fork so this makes the way to enable Roll-Ups on bitcoin like we have to be way more thoughtful and we can't just be be really nearly about it go ahead John yeah I mean there there might be ways in which you could say um enable proofs such that like the the miners verify them but uh the rest of the full node network doesn't have to so it's still kind of like a soft Fork but um but uh the you know the rest of the network doesn't have to verify it and it becomes almost like an SPV security model but yeah if you want if you want the full Network to verify it for each new proving system you you enable you might you might need to uh you know if you don't if you don't kind of have like a a very generic uh system from the start you're yeah you're gonna have to do a sequence of of soft Forks um and if we get to the point where like Bitcoin ossifies and like can never work again because coordination is just too difficult then we're stuck with what we've got and you know good enough will have to be good enough I think at that point we might see uh The Innovation is shift to higher layers um but uh yeah it's that there there is some path dependency there that the community is going to have to think about um you know really think down far down the line like how much can we future proof this without enabling things that we might consider dangerous um and so yeah they're they're there are a bunch of decisions to make here um and it's an open question as to how the community would actually make those decisions um how the community actually enables soft Forks in general is kind of an ongoing conversation in the Bitcoin Community um because with Taproot we had speedy trial with segwit we had you know the the the lock-in plus like the US the uh the lock-in deadline plus uasf like their you know Bitcoin has has tried all of these different things and there's not really consensus on on what is the best way to to go about soft Forks yet uh let alone soft forks with so many different options that that have to be considered along with them and I noticed that we didn't fully really respond to what needs to there's more things than just enabling a proof system on in on bitcoin that you need to enable for Ezekiel roll up to exist so there's two parts to it that you people usually talk about the first one is being able to validate the ability availability proof is EK proof and the second one is a covenant right and you talk in your paper about recursive components maybe we should also mention like talk about what's this other part that needs to be enabled why does it need to be enabled and what exactly is it yeah so we talked about the the proof systems and yeah the other major pieces enabling recursive Covenants and a covenant for those who aren't familiar is a type of smart contract that restricts the outputs of your transaction so for example you could have you could lock your coins in a covenant that says you can only spend those coins to a specific address and then when you go to spend those coins you can only spend them to the address that's defined in the in the Covenant and a recursive Covenant is where you are able to apply restriction to the outputs of your outputs of your outputs of your outputs like almost in or actually potentially indefinitely uh restrict how a coin could be spent um and we use recursive Covenants for validity Roll-Ups basically to enforce that when the state of the roll-up is updated that all of the coins that are currently held in the Roll-Up remain in the roll-up script as those coins are being basically spent in the roll-up Trends uh State transition uh transaction they're they're rolling over into the same script always um unless there's a valid withdrawal uh transaction coming out of the roll-up in which case the Covenant is restricting uh the script such that users can only spend to a valid withdrawal address that has been validated using the validity proof um so like if a user deposits some funds into the roll-up it's going into a script on on layer one then the block producer on the roll-up produces a roll-up block so so updates the state of the roll up they basically spend all of the coins that are in the roll-up script to an identical copy of the roll-up script so they're like moving the coins from the the roll-up script at State a into the rollup script at State B and they're including a validity uh proof that says you know this state transition is valid and then a user comes along and they say I want to make a withdrawal from the Roll-Up so then the roll-up block producer again is going to produce another block they're going to roll over the the coins from the script at State B to State C and then they're also going to specify well some of the coins are going to come out of the script and be sent to this uh destination address and the script is going to consider that valid because there's a validity proof which proves to the layer 1 full nodes you know everything about this transaction including this withdrawal is valid according to the the rules of the roll-up um so the recursive Covenant is basically needed just because of how the mechanics of like a Bitcoin transaction works with with the utxo model yeah so it's not like the most sexy part of a robot the Covenant part but it's sort of a required element because an easy way to sort of explain it would be like in Bitcoin you can't have a variable that you update so you don't really have a persistent state that you can update like let's say you want X to be four and then some transactions happen now you want X to be six and you sort of want to store that variable you can't really do that in Bitcoin because there's no way to store a variable there's no way to store State on bitcoin but the Covenant uh would sort of allow that and um it also is worthwhile pointing out that the Covenant that has been discussed in Bitcoin the OPC TV the check uh check times verify check temperature check template we're very verified yeah this one isn't uh sufficiently uh General to enable uh to enable something like ZK wall of some Bitcoin because it's sort of a very specific type of Covenant so that thing doesn't allow us to to to get to to the rollout version yeah yeah you need you need the fully recursive covenants because you need to be able to restrict essentially forever like as long as the roll-up is in operation this you need to be able to enforce this rolling over of the utxo from the script uh from one state to the next and the only way to do that is with uh recursive covenants unless you change you know you were to change like the the state model of Bitcoin completely to like an account model um but like I said that that would probably be too radical of a of a change I don't I don't know if that would very very well politically we both need to decide on which Covenant do we want and which proof system do we want before we can enable Zeke will of some Bitcoin and both of those things are sort of uh complex questions for for implementation wise for for Bitcoin for the Bitcoin system and Community to sort of decide on yeah there have been a number of different um proposals for how to get even like recursive covenants specifically into Bitcoin um some developers have talked about like uh optx um some have talked about or Simplicity like just enabling the Simplicity language um uh there was a record there was a suggestion for Chia lisp um so yeah there's there's a lot of ideas floating around but no consensus yet of how to enable these kinds of generalize or or recursive Covenants well amazing guys I I feel very very educated as to the way the Bitcoin Works a little bit a little bit better and how ZK roles might actually get there John um what are there like clear next steps like what what are the next steps for getting this done if the Bitcoin Community agrees that is this is the next step well I think it's going to take experimentation with those different options to see what's uh what makes sense maybe some more research to find out what is the minimal set of changes that would be required if we wanted to enable only validity roll-ups I think there tends to be a preference in the Bitcoin developer community that if we're going to make a soft Fork it should be usable for multiple different kinds of use cases and not just a single use case so you might be able to argue like validity Roll-Ups enable a bunch of different use cases so even if we were to soft Fork only for validity Roll-Ups we unlock all of these other use cases and so that kind of specialized soft Fork might be justifiable you might also say well if your validity role can only do Bitcoin style transactions anyways uh then you know it would be nice if the op codes that we enabled for validity Roll-Ups were also useful for other use cases um and so then we might you know have have a bit of uh a conversation about about the trade-offs there um but yeah I think more research more experimentation there are already some developers that are like working towards an MVP just getting like a basic Bitcoin style validity roll up working on a test network uh somewhere um and so I'm sure you know they'll be thinking through these questions um but uh yeah but I I would encourage like there to be multiple work streams multiple different you know experimentation uh experiments going on and um you know we can all compare notes in in and see what works see what doesn't where the trade-offs and eventually hopefully come to consensus on something so we can bring this to bitcoin and allow users to experience the benefits I have to ask one like last uh question here so in your paper you talk about how Roll-Ups enable potentially 50 times more transactional throughput with similar security guarantees that Bitcoin has on its base layer so this is I mean this is pretty um a pretty staggering result right but why do you think that this research is coming from like the human rights foundation and we found like a non-core Bitcoin developer to do this research and like why isn't this type of very interesting research coming from within the Bitcoin core that the elected the regular the traditional Bitcoin developer ecosystem itself like why did it have to come from this like satellite route like of ethereum interested people in order to to to explore this area uh I don't know if I could answer that question I mean everybody's got their own projects going on um there have been a number of different research uh papers that have come out uh pertaining Bitcoin specifically through non you know not directly from from Bitcoin core contributors um for example like bitmix sponsors a bunch of interesting research um there's a bunch of interesting research that has historically come out of like Academia um so yeah I think just people you know certain people get interested in certain things and and uh and and the research bubbles up from from those domains so yeah it's it would be hard to to answer that question any other way because like I said I think everybody's interested in in different aspects of of the Bitcoin system and just because of my own unique you know personal and professional history I happen to have a background in in both you know evm and and roll-up research as well as like Bitcoin cross chain protocols and it just made sense for me to combine those areas of research and and see what was possible with Bitcoin and Eric I I think this is this story of Roll-Ups on bitcoin is like personal for you because uh I consider you like a frustrated bitcoiner uh or you're a bitcoiner who wants Bitcoin to do more just like can you from you put me in the shoes of Eric Wall like when you see ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin like uh does it make you optimistic for Bitcoin like what's it like to be you in the middle of this discussion yeah I mean this is the the role of discussion that I try to bring to bitcoin back in 2019 was one of the things that led to like my departure from the Bitcoin Community because I had built up this reputation within the Bitcoin ecosystem for a very long time as the old coin Slayer like someone that was extremely critical to Technologies built on altcoins so I thought that like when I discovered Roll-Ups and I looked at them and I thought holy this architecture like this way of architecture detecting a scalability solution on top of a base layer is actually generally interesting so now that I've built up over these years now that I've built up this social capital can I just get my Bitcoin peers to look at this technology and think oh like maybe we should explore uh that way of architecting Layer Two and discuss how to implement that on bitcoin um but the whole conversation got completely derailed when people discovered like Eric are you proposing that we uh that we even accept that research is happening on the ethereum side is actually valid like aren't you don't you know that everything that comes out of ethereum is a scam I'm like it doesn't matter where it come from it doesn't matter like who made it just look at how it's constructed and then we can have a technical conversation around that but I would I completely failed to make that conversation happen in 2019 and that was like when I started to entertain the idea that the intellectual Center was sort of leaving Bitcoin and going moving into other like the ethereum ecosystem more and that's why I've been spending so much time in in in the ethereum ecosystem is because that's where I can have like stimulating conversations around this but I am happy though that now at long last we are starting to see interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem like these ideas are starting to to become accepted and we can discuss them again in in Bitcoin so I'm happy about that but it's been like three years out in the cold like being called a an idiot than a pointer when in reality you know like we've done the research now for ziki Roll-Ups there is validity to those ideas and we can probably for the first time entertain that you don't have to be an evil person just to say like maybe we should do this on bitcoin right well I have uh even less social capital in the Bitcoin space than you probably far less uh yet ZK Roll-Ups on bitcoin what we're seeing out of uh John's here's research uh on and again bitcoinrollups.org to to learn more uh is like probably the most interesting and exciting thing I've seen out of Bitcoin since I've been in crypto uh and so I'm hoping this conversation continues uh and I I definitely want to be a part of a part of that story as well because uh Bitcoin can be more expressive and deserves to be expressed more and I see ZK Roll-Ups as the first legitimate path to getting that done uh so John thank you for all of your all of your research and also coming on the show and talking to me and Eric about it here yeah definitely thank you so much for your interest and Eric thank you for helping me navigate an area that uh a muscle that I don't flex very often so I needed some help on that one so thank you so much for your help thanks for having me all right cheers
