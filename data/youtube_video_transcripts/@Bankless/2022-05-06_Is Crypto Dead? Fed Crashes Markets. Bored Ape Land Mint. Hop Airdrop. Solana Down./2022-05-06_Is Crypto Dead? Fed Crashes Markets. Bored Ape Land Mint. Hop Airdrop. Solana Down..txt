red alert this is an attack on defy i know i'm laughing but it's also not funny they're coming for d5 thankless nation is the first week of may and it's friday morning so what time is it david it's the friday banquet's weekly roll up time ryan where we cover it the entire week of news in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless ryan what happened this week look man so much happened this week oh first of all david by the way i'm excited to see you at permissionless in person that's coming up really soon yes so we're going to meet in person for the first time we'll talk about that later yes allegedly i am a real person okay i don't know where these rumors came from but what are we going to talk about this week first we got to start with the fed watch all right jerome powell packed his biggest punch yet a largest interest rate hike since the year 2000 that had an impact on markets we'll cover that in the market section what else we got david yeah speaking of impact on markets the gas wars this week were absolutely insane the board 8 virtual land sale created 166 million dollars of transaction fees burned an absolute ton of eth uh there's a bunch of fiasco and bunch of drama with that leading to a brand new ape chain question mark i don't know if that's a good idea we'll have to talk about that also solana went down again i don't know if this is the fourth the fifth time the sixth time should they convert to banker hours at this point david down down for working hours only yeah just snow saturday sunday hours we'll talk about that too what else we got a troll is suing pool together for a quarter billion dollars which is ridiculous they are they put ten dollars into uh into pool together and then immediately filed a class action lawsuit against pull together this person doing this has very strong connections to you guessed it elizabeth warren so this is a red alert this is an attack on defy i know i'm laughing but it's also not funny they're coming for defy so we all need to get up to speed with what the hell is going on with the attack on pool together yeah man i've lost some money in d5 maybe there's some lawsuits i could drop well but we also have a new airdrop that's coming i hope you're ready for this we're not going to reveal what it is but be sure to listen to this episode to find out more what else should they do david oh they gotta just like subscribe rate and review ryan if you're watching on youtube you gotta click that button so you can go and subscribe this comes out every friday and it's the most high energy way to recap the news in crypto also the most entertaining but also if you are listening to this on the podcast please rate and review the bankless podcast the number one podcast in crypto you know it uh and we want to make sure that we get to the mainstream and we need those reviews to get that done look at david hyping us up man but you know this is a lot of fun i enjoy doing this every friday this this happens every friday guys so come back for the next friday and subscribe so you don't miss it fridays happen every week fridays to happen every week that means we're recording a lot david uh you know what else we're doing we're doing a lot of experiments in web 3. we uh have this theme on bank list where you can join crypto and become a self-sovereign employee you can work for a bunch of dows there's massive opportunities to be sort of a self-sovereign worker and independent contractor in this new economy but the thing you're going to need if you move your cushy move from your cushy corporate job is health insurance you need some benefits you need someone to manage payroll opolis does all of that for you in a box this is a way to pay yourself in crypto they handle health insurance they handle uh dental they handle medical they handle all of it and they'll even pay your payroll in crypto so you can start receiving your your salary in crypto from a dow so if you are a dow employee or want to work for dows in the future you got to investigate this this can onboard you into crypto david there's uh some benefits here when people sign up right some deadlines and benefits what are those oh the web 3 always has benefits ryan if you sign up with opolis before may 25th 2022 that is this month as the end of this month you get 1 000 work tokens the native token of opolis and a thousand bank tokens when you sign up and you get your first paycheck paid by opolis basically it's a collective it's a big collective a dow for getting good healthcare rates basically de-risking the process of becoming a self-sovereign worker in web3 that's why we love opolis it's a dow that services other dows guys you can go check that out the link in the show notes it's bankless dot cc slash opolis make sure you get that capital o in there all right david let's get to the markets man what are the markets telling us about bitcoin this week they were almost happy ryan but now they're sad uh we started the week at thirty nine thousand seven hundred dollars trying to keep our head above that forty thousand dollar level which we definitely love and we just never got there uh we are currently down to thirty six thousand three hundred oh wow it's dumping as we speak uh so it was down six point five percent when i wrote this but it looks like we're down to something like seven or eight percent down eight percent on the week so far that's funny people thought we were out of the woods look uh after the powell speech you could see that in the charts right so the kind of power speech around here on wednesday and markets were up after powell talked we'll talk about what he said in our fed watch but then a day later bam oof we got wrecked no there's a big red candle down tried to be bullish but we just couldn't do it same thing happened with eth what's the story on ether this week yeah ether start of the week at 2 940 again the 40 000 is to bitcoin as 3 000 is to eat we tried to climb above 3 000 we couldn't do it uh we were uh when i wrote these numbers down it was 2700 760 we're now down to 2720 so that's about like down eight percent on the week big sad face we are setting all-time lows on the week as we record right now so sad face yeah it's it's it's funny it's like we thought we were out of the woods happy times after fed market goes up and what this looks like to me i don't know what it looks like to you david was is just whale games the games whales play during crowd during crab season when the market doesn't know which direction to go in and uh suddenly we have a a massive uh dumpage right here you know what's happening ryan we don't have any links in here but uh people are getting liquidated this morning like because they on on margin even though we were at these prices at that on may 1st and so people aped into a leveraged position like yesterday oh yeah and then got liquidated today of course yeah they were they got bullish after the fed news and the market responded very favorably to that and now they're paying for that the very next day and getting liquidated that's what's going on i can't believe people have that in the streets decisions like that but yeah what do we know we don't trade uh if bitcoin the ratio what's that looking at uh oddly looking good it was up one percent this week um and so pretty cool it's actually trending in an upwards direction do you ever look at this in trading view the technicals yeah yeah that whole like meter thing yeah it's basically a weathervane dude it just follows like did it go up recently then it's a buy did it go down recently then it's it's a sentiment indication not like a technical indication it's not what technicals are though just sentiment indication is it more than that are the triangles more than that do they mean are more than that and triangles are more than that but like in the same we recorded a podcast with um uh jim o'shaughnessy and we like one of the big tldr's is that narrative follows price uh and so like yeah people are happy about their assets when they go up in price like crazy thought that's a great episode by the way that's coming out monday and it has a whole bunch of tips that jim relays to us that are super useful in crypto and how not to fall prey to the the fud and the fomo and all the psychological track traps we can follow in crypto how about uh the total market cap of crypto we up we down uh we're down if you go to that 24 hour tab we started the week at 1.9 trillion dollars we are currently down to 1.77 trillion dollars so lost 130 billion dollars in crypto market cap this last week we lost half an elon i think that's the measure but let's talk about the fed stuff because that uh is dictating some of the outcomes in the market at least i think right now uh the fed just raised rates by half a percentage point so that's 0.5 that's the biggest interest rate hike in two decades the goal of course is to fight inflation it's the largest since 2000 as i mentioned it's the first time since 2006 that the fed has increased rates in back-to-back meetings okay so they did that they also announced some guidance to the future so it's not just happening in may 50 a 50 5 increase in may they're also planning another 5.5 increase in june and also in july that's what uh powell's guidance is saying and then he provides a bit more guidance as well but basically they're they're doing some quantitative tightening so that means you know that balance sheet that they racked up over covid and like the last amount of debt that they've accumulated since it's about nine trillion dollars at this point all right so they are they're reducing it by 50 billion a month and they they're planning to do that in june in july and august so you know that's a quarter of an elon or so they're going to reduce their budget by uh and then september and going forward they're gonna get even more aggressive and it's probably a hundred uh billion a month but do you see the market nine trillion dollar debt uh yeah and they're reducing it they're trying to pay it back at 50 billion dollars in money yeah you got to do those down payments you gotta what does 50 billion dollars do to the face of nine trillion dollars you know how many months that'll take ryan i just i just did the math because i'm a member of the math words 180 months oh that's 15 years it's due 15 years to pay back the debt don't say it's not doable david it's doable 15 years i guess that's shorter than the most horror mortgages well well powell says we don't want to do things too quickly and that's part of the thing because a soft landing is the goal so what he means by soft landing is basically like we're not planning to do this until we totally until we wreck the economy we just want a soft landing so we're just not trying to cause a recession here guys all right he said the strong economy can handle these rising rates right now and some of this quantitative tightening and i guess we see if he's right but what that also means to me maybe the market responded with this is like if there's indications of the r word recession and you know some blood in the streets then some of these plans could reverse maybe the market's anticipating that the story here is there is a needle to thread with can we fight inflation and also not cause a reflect a recession at the same time and so that is the fed's drop to thread that needle let's raise interest rates to fight inflation but also let's raise interest rates not too much so that we cause the r word the recession word uh there's a bunch of debate as to whether that hole in that needle even exists ryan so like we actually might just have to be chosen choose one like what do we want the recession or the inflation it's like you know which which nut do you want to be punched in um but but basically uh what's going on is like you know the fed the fed is saying hey we're going to raise interest rates this many times throughout the future future and it's like you know to put this into a visual terms it's just like imagine it's like hey we're going to punch the market in the stomach seven times and then the mark you're glad you went with the stomach because i was getting the visual there and then the market like braces for seven punches and it does that by like selling off that's what we saw through january through now uh but then the fed is like oh we've changed we're actually going to punch you guys eight times or perhaps they say oh we're gonna only punch you guys six times and so like the market can brace or unbrace based off of like how many times the fed is gonna punch it and to be fair like we're calling these punches but it's just like i mean they got us drunk first right yeah like the market's totally like drunk and like here's a tweet you wanted to talk about this it says party hard party hardy and then dot dot dot hangover and what we're looking at well why don't you explain what we're looking at here yeah this is the disposable personal income amount over the last what like 50 60 years and like during the middle of covid you see this uh real personal disposable income it's like savings in the bank right yeah just like personal savings how much cash you got your slush fund your personal slush fund yeah uh and like it was it like jumped up like four times higher than it has ever been in the last like 50 years as a result of covid because of the the stimmy checks the the unemployment income uh and so that was like what everyone was talking about oh they're roaring 20s like everyone's partying everyone's quitting we got all this money uh and then uh in 2022 when they start to fight that inflation it goes in the complete opposite direction so now people have less disposable personal income than they've ever had in the last 50 years as well so it's just like whiplash first we got a bunch of money now everyone's poor it is it is scary it's scary yeah like tech stocks have erased all of their gains like all of these like uh you know wall street bets traders and dj and robin hood traders like they don't have any money anymore uh and so like all the money's gone all the money's gone oof yeah and the money is uh evaporating at you know before our eyes with inflation as well this is the kind of volatility and something that you've said recently and we've said for a while at bankless is like hey you know that volatility that you're trying to avoid in the crypto market well it's common for the real world here it is look at this whiplash you know positive 30 30 percent now we're negative 20 in the space of like just uh a couple of quarters um let's stop talking about fiat though david i want to talk about the new economy yeah the new economy the economy that is actually enjoyable to look at uh we put out bankless put out ethereum's q1 results and what does this look like uh bullish is that is that the answer that you wanted for me i want more detail now we'll go into this yeah hang on all right so the ethereum is a protocol so it's not going to release its quarterly reports so somebody has to do it on ethereum's behalf so we have volunteered we put our lead analyst mines on the case and they produce a report ethereum q1 results you can review this on the newsletter but here are four quick facts to cover what the state of the ethereum economy is in the last quarter uh 2.4 billion in transaction fees that's up 86 year over year plus 2.1 of that a billion was burned in east so three billion dollars paid in tips to minors 2.1 billion dollars of ether burned can i just pause i want to pause there after you're done sorry david which created a 54 decrease in ether issuance as a result of eip-1559 so while the u.s dollar is inflating the inflation rate of ether got cut in half that is so cool this is so cool so what we're saying is like if you if you look at the us government which is operating in a deficit okay the ethereum economy the ethereum government brought in 2.4 billion dollars in transaction fees and then this eth burned that's essentially a dividend back to all the eath holders it's a a freedom dividend to use uh andrew yeah it's it's a stimulus and uh eth owners like people who own eth got 2.1 billion dollars in uh value back so we're going the complete opposite direction of fiat economy there's no def there's no nine trillion dollar deficit here we're actually like giving the surplus back to eath holders that's exactly right take us through the next one okay because d5 did some cool things talk about d5 yeah so there's also incredible growth in d5 as you'd imagine so a two thousand seven hundred percent increase in perpetual volume which is hugh it which is huge uh six thousand six hundred and fifty seven percent growth in spot volumes and also another doubling of stablecoin supplies that's pretty impressive on its own what's uh can you tell us about the nft ecosystem yeah of course we can't not talk about nft ecosystem because it's at some point the nfc's ecosystem just broke all metrics like what does it mean when trading volumes rise nineteen thousand percent right like i don't even know how to quantify that but that's what happened to the nft market nineteen thousand percent increase year over year as a hundred and sixteen billion dollars worth of nfts traded in q1 116 billion dollars in q1 ryan q1 that's just one quarter a crazy quarter it's a bullish quarter i certainly like looking at these numbers rather than fed numbers um there's also a really cool uh chart here david that you uncovered uh yeah talk about this yeah this is a brand brand new dune analytics dashboard probably covering like the most global set of metrics about uh ether and ethereum at large so you know it starts with the basic basics like the price and the market cap but then it gets into more granular stuff like how many milli how many wallets there are to 105 million how many total transactions there are 1.56 billion how many blocks have there been 14.7 million 50 million smart contracts created and then you get to see some gas metrics the price over time so it's like the most global universal like satellite level view of just the state of the ethereum economy and the cool thing about this is that it's real time like bank lists the q1 q2 quarterly reports those are really useful to compare quarter over quarter but also this dashboard just uh compares granularly block by block by block for the complete state of the ethereum economy never before i've seen like metrics going into economies coming out of crypto right now that's awesome i guess they they did our job we could just screenshot this and this is your play record here it is in real time um optimism doing some things too what's up oh we saw this coming from a long way off you know you don't remember the whole layer two two two summer ryan that's oh i remember yeah right yeah it's it was always predicated on tokens because tokens create incentives and we need liquidity mining incentives adoption incentives and today or this week i mean optimism has announced their stimpak their stimpak program along with one of their uh you know very famous slightly indie hippie niche memes that i don't really get but they're they always do these odd neat memes it's cute but also i kind of don't get it but i do get it at the same time anyways um for the listeners it's a cat looking at a fish uh and this fish is the stim pack it's peekaboo though it's a surprise for the cat like a surprise oh yeah okay the cat is the community in this picture the fish is the liquidity mining you're gonna get right right well okay so the op token is not yet unlocked people got their air drop but they have not been able to claim their air drop that happens in just a few weeks there are 230 million op tokens coming to uh liquidity mining incentives just project growth incentives uh for context the optimism total supply is like 4.2 billion so 230 million of that 4.2 billion supply going to incentivize project growth on optimism ryan can you smell that the schmidt the fish or the bunny or or layer two two two i smell layer two two two in fact look man we released two episodes on this this week it's called the trillion dollar opportunity in layer to use i think that's what it's called and it's a two-parter and it's a must listen if you're interested in all of our thoughts on the opportunities ahead in layer two two two twenty-two summer summer of twenty years yeah all of it i mean most of the opportunities i think are pretty expect are expected like the just looking at the native tokens of the layer twos the optimism token the probably coming arbitrarium token uh then the tokens on layer twos like the lyra token all these apps and then also the liquidity like all this stuff is known but then part two of this whole series is something that i'm pretty sure 99 of listeners 99.9 of listeners have not yet heard of and the magnitude of this opportunity is equal to all the other opportunities on layer two so don't fade that podcast yeah listen to them both back to back uh okay nfts all right so defy seems a little dead these days david but what's propping up the ethereum economy these days it's nfts again people thought anything these were dead when will the jpegs go down in price it's like never is the answer what's happening here what are some metrics that are relevant well okay so there's been a 116 million transactions on on nfts uh which are absolutely crazy opencv registered more than 476 million dollars worth of mnft trades on one day that was one day that's half a billion dollars of volume on may 1st as a result of the other side project launch which we will get into in just a little bit the single previous day record for openc was 323 million dollars set on august 29 2021. so nfts continue to break records however i will say that there is a lot of churn in nfts uh volume does seem to be just kind of permanently leaving many projects and going into newer projects so there's always this like churn this like rolling forward of the nft ecosystem where volume seems to be going all-time highs every single quarter like it's going into new projects every single quarter so like it's not like defy tokens where like the same tokens are around quarter after quarter after quarter there's always something new in the nft world because like everyone's always looking for the next new shiny thing yeah right right that's that's how it goes guys and uh we've got some more stuff to cover for you including the ape gas fiasco david just alluded to it we're gonna talk more about that uh ens markets are on fire as well we're going to discuss why and what's the last one this is big david i think i i hope it comes out by the time i i say this because if it doesn't i'll be in trouble but the hop drop the huff drop is coming it's a drop and we're gonna hop about it and it's gonna be fun all right guys so all of those details are coming up in the second half of the show we'll talk about the hop drop and other related things right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that help you go bankless if you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth optimizing your taxes is just as

thousand dow members are all robbing about at governance.avey.com all right guys we are back newly released on the scene lido is doing an interesting uh scorecard for themselves uh they are giving themselves a cess assessment excuse me a self-assessment on all the things that make lido lido so i just really like this uh because it's just transparency and making like the weaknesses of dao's explicit you can check this out at scorecard.lido.fi and they just go through and give themselves a rating a self-assessment on every single variable of every single metric that they need to work on and so they have things like node distribution geographically around the world uh they have things like governance that needs to be improvement such as uh is there a robust set of lido governance delegates is a lot of governments have sufficient safeguards uh governance seems to be the weak one but um i mean i just like the explicitness and the intentionality that leido's putting into giving themselves a rating on vectors that they need to improve on yeah we really need lida to become more decentralized or other sticking pools to kind of pick up the slack rocket pool is is there of course they're more decentralized in a lot of ways than lido but they have not been able to accrue the massive amount of stake that lydo has and so you see most of the the issues on the scorecard the decentralization scorecard are all governance related involved with who can be a vital validator and who cannot be and how upgrades happen this sort of thing so yeah you know what gets measured gets managed and look they're naming it so hopefully they get better and this is super important because there's some debate in the ethereum community about the massive amount of a stake that lido has accrued like over time and it's more decentralized than like say a coin base doing this but still there's a lot of centralization vectors and that could be uh that that is not a good thing for ethereum long term it's also david it's early in the game though like we haven't even done the merge you can't even withdraw your stake so i expect a lot of things to play out but hopefully lido goes in the path of making their protocol more decentralized over time yeah and overall it's just giving a road map to other alternatives other staking as a service people saying hey like if you're trying to do a staking as a service thing like here are the variables that you also need to work on so i i consider it just like a public good for the ecosystem just touting out knowledge about the difficulties and what it needs to be targeted yeah i'm pretty happy let's see progress uh what's next david ens constitution there is a constitution a literal book for the ens dow a set of binding rules that determine what governance actions are legitimate for the dow to take but this is instantiated in a book uh so there's a physical book a physical book yeah you can well you can download the digital edition for free but you can you can buy a a physical edition for about a hundred and fifteen dollars but in addition to the physical book there's also the special limited edition where you can bid using the ens token on 25 numbered copies out of a total of 50 i would imagine the other 25 goes to like horror dow members but there's a physical copy a physical constitution with special edition being uh bidded on sometime soon uh starts it started actually it already started it ends in five days uh so like you know real world relics about our dows which are kind of cool if you are that into ens which you might be if you are in the 10k club which we'll talk about in a second you might be interested in buying one of these special editions of the ens constitution that's cool very cool what's this david we got a transaction heat map feature from etherscan yeah this is just good data visualization so right now a new feature out of etherscan is you can go into a specific contract or a specific address and you can just look at the heat map for activity as in just how active is that contract has that contract been over the last year uh the cool thing is you can do this for every single contract so you can just get a nice little visualization visualization of the activity around addressing what am i looking at is this less more less more what transactions for this particular contract just like raw transaction number ah cool that's cool yeah etherscan just continues to pump it out pump out the features uh raise time man every week i feel like there's a new crypto fun fund that's raised some money this is a crypto fund um that is investing primarily in public tokens the title of this article is crypto wonder kids secure 85 million dollars to start their own hedge fund uh ryan watkins is in on this we've had him on the podcast before he's a former analyst at missouri uh definitely knows what he's doing and there's a lot of big investors backing this particular fund uh who are they david oh my god there's so many brad burnham from union square ventures we have apollo global management co-founders josh harris also do kwan i think you all know who he is alameda research from out of sbf's camp and also got multi-coin capitals kyle simani so some big chats going into this fund what's cool about this is i do think that there's something to the thesis that the real opportunity is not private markets in crypto it's actually undervalued public markets and so i expect this fund and others to follow to uh to see if that thesis plays out um here's another one syndicate they just got another six million dollars in funding what is syndicate david yeah syndicate is a new fund it's six million dollars isn't all that much but it's the structure of syndicate that is uh more unique it's type kind of like a y combinator but for d5 but for daos and it's trying to figure out how do we include as many people as possible compliantly and legally which is the challenge into the fund and so they have raised as a result of this a total of 28 million dollars in just this year again a very like robust name of contenders on this list a16z carta ledger circle ventures openc uniswap labs coinless polygon ygg pool sweets fermion outliers vc dao creators of uh friends with benefits rug radio loot project dead fellas nansen like all of these people are part of syndicate the cool thing about this is it's not actually a fund it's a tool set that allows people to create decentralized investment clubs they have like one over a thousand different investment clubs uh that they've uh that they've created on this fund and so this is another six million dollars to fund that that infrastructure and that tool set so more more investment clubs coming to crypto more democratization of finance which is uh definitely what we need like we need fewer you have to own a million dollars or over in order to invest in this fund and more like capital structures for the people and hopefully d phi brings that about david um it's jobs time but we also have a community question going into this what's the question yeah so we are doing a new segment called community questions they're going to go at the end but because this particular question is relevant to jobs we are raising that question up to the job section and so uh degenerate i love the name says are there jobs in web3 for people who don't have experience in web 2 or code and degeneracy i think we got plenty of answers for you on the bankless jobs board the answer is yes they definitely are i'm gonna i'm gonna go to that jobs board and and show the positions maybe as we go through we highlight them because it's time for us to tell you that you should be getting a job in crypto now's the time crypto companies crypto projects they are hiring hard right now and you should investigate you should be on their list you can enroll in the collaborative submit your resume also i'm going to read out a few samples of jobs that crypto companies are hiring for as david dances and listen for the ones that are non-technical uh the first is a marketing manager non-technical technical non-technical vp of engineering that one's technical yes head of growth that was lead community management that's context calls senior product designer parcel kind of technical not really though ethereum core developers extremely technical yeah don't sorry that one's technical go laying engineer starnet client nethermind as well bankless newsletter editor what's up i'm technical that's all technical content manager at tally that's non-technical director of developer relations at vallest uh that might be a little technical a little bit not really though solidity architect elue yeah that's definitely technical marketing manager non-technical ux designer prometheus research labs kind of mixed results and community manager at dgen dogs club definitely non-technical you just need to be sociable so as you can see degenerate there are a lot of opportunities for people who want non-technical career trajectories in crypto in fact i feel like that's a lot of the demand these days that's where some of the like people need managers people need like people's growth skills marketing skills community writing skills writing writing skills universal writing skills are universal get a job in crypto guys like even if you're non-technical especially if you're non-technical the bankers job board has those jobs for you so uh go submit your your resume submit your profile or take a look at one of those jobs uh david you ready to get to newsman uh yeah let's do it are we ready for it yeah this one's big why don't you lead with it uh this is what i'm dubbing the hops drop pop protocol one of my favorite bridging protocols allows you to be a bridge or across all the layer twos uh and back to the layer one and they a while ago teased this loading bar which is like really really close to finish uh and also i i hit up the hop team that there is no official hop team there's actually a really cool story behind pop they've never taken any venture capital ryan really like yeah they've never taken any money that yeah that's an option they just started building out hop protocol they put a team together uh and they haven't it's a little bit like ens dow where they have not taken any outside investors uh and so how they are releasing this token they call it the uh fair fair launch where like uniswap was the fair launch right retroactive token because no one saw it coming no one even knew what the term retroactive token airdrop was but now that's been gamed and so hop protocol they've been doing this fair fair launch strategy where they kind of just figure it out they just give it hey you've done some work here are some tokens you uh you've done a lot of work here's a lot of tokens and it looks like they are teasing perhaps but again when i'm dubbing the hop drop and perhaps they might be coming perhaps on the bankless uh podcast and youtube channel perhaps tomorrow or today yes today for the listener so p.m pacific time 4 p.m eastern time uh at the very least top will be launching the dao and so we're going to talk about that with chris winfree from hop protocol um yeah so as we're expecting some announcements probably by the time this podcast comes out i hope it comes out but anyway stay tuned for that for the live stream with chris winfrey of hop protocol yeah we should say at the time of recording it's unknown whether there's going to be an airdrop associated with this or not but when people say dao they also generally mean token because how is a doubt governed by tokens you guys put one and one together and uh join us at 1pm pacific time today to hear what they have to say and what some of the criteria for the dow responsibility might be um david what else we gotta talk about yes go time yeah fiasco time so this happened this weekend i was kind of monitoring it a little bit twitter but like you know and this this one was hard to pull away from once you realized what happened could you go through the board ape yacht club mint fiasco the crazy gas fees that people experienced this weekend and all of the fallout that resulted yeah so listeners might remember a yugo labs released that deck a while ago talking about their metaverse they're going to build out a metaverse complete with virtual real estate virtual land uh so we have come to that part of the deck uh there was the other side which actually i think is a cool name for metaverse land other side yeah metaverse land nft mint was happening on ethereum uh and so this happened on saturday saturday night this this mint went live it was the largest nft mint ever and the demand for uh for the other side land nfts was so strong that it even crashed ether scan very rarely will ether scan ever go down but they managed to get this done uh the average gas price ryan was absolutely insane like never before seen gas prices like it i saw numbers up above like three thousand for a very brief moment but thousand way yeah three thousand way for the for the very very peak but even on the coinmetrics chart you can see here there's absolutely needle of a candle all the way up from like the typical gas feed that's been in the last few weeks of like 40 to 50 all the way up to 800 dwarfing all of defy summer so that is pretty cool 60 234 eath were spent in gas fees ryan that is absolutely insane uh and in one in just a few like in an hour or so this new contract brand new contract becomes number six in the all-time high leaderboard for burned ether that's a ahead of metamask that's a head of metamask uh and so like just jumping up to the top inside of 24 hours 55 900 ether was burned this is it right here this is it right here the other deed the other d yeah that that is it that's on the burn leader board number one i went crazy it's number one on the week oh it's number one in the last 20 days yeah and then it's number number six all the time it's all time six uh taxpayer right um thank you board apes for your contribution to ethereum public goods uh funding security that's that's pretty it's a pretty big contribution yeah yeah i think it's not necessarily a good thing it's not a good thing because a lot of people weren't able to get their transactions through uh this is what happens when ethereum becomes super congested is transactions fail uh and so what doesn't happen is ethereum doesn't go down we'll talk about that linothor a second but yeah a lot of people weren't able to get their transactions through they spent thousands on gas but they are reportedly being refunded by yugo labs because hugo labs has basically infinite money um and then people people are going like why if only we could have known like how could this possibly happen like where did this come from completely blindsided there's no way we would have known that an nft auction like this would have resulted in what we saw um and then didn't you go labs i saw this tweet thread they went through a long tweet sort of apologized in their community what went right what went wrong and one of the tweets that uh yuka lab sent out was basically like oh ethereum is not sustainable it's not scalable available for the apes and so we encourage the board api club dao to start planning to migrate to its own chain that's what they said so they want to move off of ethereum this was floated out there anyway and create an ape chain of some sort to handle this excess transaction some sort of a side chain let's call it um are you sure other people were interpreting a brand new layer one a brand new like what's the difference right it's a question like it's a side chain until you can get other people to come on the thing with you and then maybe it's a layer one but you have to kind of earn the right to be layer one in my opinion uh andrew steinwald had a take on this what was his take on eucalab's potential threat to migrate yeah he puts this into context dapper labs the creator of cryptokitties created their own chain flow because they broke ether ethereum back in 2017 with the cryptokitties congestion 2018 axi infinity tried to work on eth but transaction fees were too high so they tried on loom that also didn't work loom network is a is a deep cut of an old plasma chain that is no longer relevant uh oh so that didn't work so they launched ronin the side chain yuga labs now also saying ethereum's broken so they need a new chain um for the record ethereum is like five to ten times more scalable than it was back in 2017 that's a little fun fact that we actually have way more scalability than we did back in the crypto kitty's days um you can talk to the immutablex team who minted a ton of on-chain nfts but then there is some pushback on this whole thing where uh fubar he's a famous crypto twitter commentator also a technical guy he goes to yooka lab saying to you collapse you guys wrote a terribly unoptimized contract unoptimized nft contract creating created a gas war lied about dutch auction mechanics to pump your own narrative and then hid how many wallets were eligible to participate in the mint maybe get a solidity dev before you go trying to create binance smart chain 2.0 wow hot take hot take that is a hot take right so basically they shot themselves in the foot they knew that this would happen and they're not optimizing and instead of kind of like saying oh we could have done things differently they're kind of taking their ball and going to another chain yeah they're saying ethereum's unoptimized and then fubar is basically saying no your guys's contracts are unoptimized i think there's some skepticism some people are like well was this all planned to begin with because now you get to benefit potentially from the uh we've got a layer 1 token pump that is so popular in the narrative right now if if you know ape coins become a layer one coin as well uh but there is a path forward that i think it makes a ton of sense to me uh this is uh somebody uh called way corey cory.eth this is what i would do if i'm hugolabs right now i fork optimism launch my own rollup i make apes one house and the ape coin the other house this is alluding to optimism's two house governance structure later i get atomic composability with the entire optimism ecosystem this satisfies the need for the ape chain to have its own self-sovereign blockchain just fork optimism they already have this is a beautiful thing ryan the optimism team is is like pioneering this whole two house governance model one is nft based and one is erc20 token based the er the nft is like this soul bound nft for identifiable people and the other one is the optimism token the apes already they have demand for a brand new chain that's their self-sovereign like control where they get to create their metaverse they already have the nfts ryan they're the apes and they already have the apecoin it's the apecoin it's a hundred percent the right all of these pieces are so perfect this is this is this is this is advice this is actual advice to any of the yuga labs people that might be listening to this this is the best path forward for you and not and also not to fade the atomic composability with the entire optimism and other evm equivalent chain ecosystem not to mention the ethereum layer one itself yeah i think it's the game theoretic optimum uh you know because otherwise you're actually you have to spend a coins in inflation or something to pay for security and in this model you get security of ethereum for free so you're not really sacrificing anything from the migration you stay completely composable and you maintain the security now they might not benefit from the short term where an alt layer one pump though david i don't know that's what they're after there's a there's a we're a brand new sovereign blockchain layer two on ethereum that's possible yeah i think i think it's a pretty obvious choice but we'll have to see what they do uh from here um david there's another big story that's happening and that is uh e s names we talked about e s a little bit earlier and we mentioned it on the roll-up is people snapping up ens names what's happening here with the 10k e s club oh yeah this story has just continued ryan there have been one million ens names total created and people are just bidding on all of these four digit e s names uh so they're calling it the 10k club like are you in the 10k club you know how they're like usually nft profile picture projects or like 10 000 of them well the bottom 10 000 numbers of e s like one through nine nine nine nine like i don't actually think single digits or two digits are viable enough same so i think it starts at one hundred might start it might start at zero zero zero up for interpretation but anyways there's the ten thousand club as in the people that have three digit ns names up to four digit uns names wow so if you have like one two three four dot eighth or remember last week five five five dot e got sold for 55.5 eth of course um uh and so yeah if you have the four-digit ens names you're in the 10k club and we're doing a live stream wait so what is so the 10k club itself that this is not a dow that's going out and purchasing all of these units it's it's basically a self-organized entity that just came together and is like hey we have a club now and we're gonna let everyone in it who has from zero to 999.en eth basically and you come on in we'll build a treasure we'll do some cool dow stuff but it's not it's not a uh organization that started in advance it's kind of more emerging it's a bottom up down rather than a top down out of it's like out of the trade guys like wait do you guys also own four digit ens names i own a four digit and a yeah let's get it into a discord together it's great it's really fun man yeah and so there's also there's well there's the 10k club but there's also the 1k club because there's for the people that only have four or three letters in as an 1k club yeah one fun fact for you david you know turtles there's only 500 turtles tiny turtles in existence so that's right do not try and equate i'm just saying look i'm just saying that could be a club too okay out of here don't discard the turtles absolutely get out of here uh in addition to uh all of the the 4ks for i think the floor price for a 4k in the same is something like 1.5 eth the five digit uh club the 10 000 uh 10 000 no the 100 000 club has 98.5 minted as in there are only 1.5 percent of the numbers up to 100 000 that are minted so there's still some numbers there to claim there's one point five percent left yeah and as soon as they get as soon as they get minted you know what happens is like the floor price starts to rise because people want to get into at least if they weren't able to get into the 1k club and they weren't able to get into the 10k club well then they can get into the 100 000 but still there's the million club there is also there's no rush it keeps on going oh hilarious it probably dilutes with each uh each each club that you become part of in that ring there but um before we move on we are doing a live stream with uh two members of the 10k club community tonight as in yesterday for you uh friday listeners uh and so that is available on the youtube as well and everyone is a friday listener besides our editor so that applies to all of you yeah so for the editors we're live streaming but you guys already know that let's talk about this starbucks stick it in the nft game man corporate nfts they're saying my favorite wise are doing this and such what's star what's starbucks doing though do they have a unique take or is it kind of same same it's uh let me let me read it to you ryan you can tell me if this is unique or if this is the same same starbucks we plan to start our first nft collection membership and community later this year based on coffee art and storytelling it will come with a host of unique experiences and benefits worthy of a genesis nft collection from starbucks uh okay unique or the same time you know what starbucks has never done this i've never seen it done with coffee we could have a utility nft for coffee who knows i guess you know what it's cool look i don't want to disparage it it's cool look starbucks starbucks is getting in the game i think it starts to feel when you see too many of these experiments that are kind of cookie cutter and they're coming from corporate it starts to feel a little uh you know me too inflation theater we're using nfts too watch our stock price go up a little bit like that so we'll see what they actually do we should probably suspend judgement until we actually see what starbucks is trying to too late i already judged well you did judge but let's give them another chance is what i'm saying remember budweiser they're doing it well budweiser started from the beginning very strong yeah they have never tripped up see we're you can hear the nft hipsters in us that are just like you better do this right starbucks or we're going to judge you hard right yeah speaking of not doing things we already have shitty coffee so why would we expect any different nfts he's also a coffee hipster uh speaking of doing things right or maybe not doing it right solana they went down down like salon okay down bad and uh this is not the first time we've talked about it a few other times i think the third time it's like the fifth time i think so i've lost track but i think this this bears some analysis or some conversation why don't you start by telling us what actually happened yeah there's a solanus status twitter account which that existence of that twitter account i feel like tells you everything you need to know anyways uh block production on solana mainnet has halted uh there's been a quick side quest there's some debate as whether the halted word is appropriate other people had said just say call it what it is it crashed uh validator operators should prepare for a restart in mb validators channel on discord uh so yeah that's what happened when was that that was on april 30th in the evening time uh solana ended up going down for seven hours uh because of uh bots that were swarming an nft project called candy machine um and the solano foundation calls it a in effect a denial of service attack uh but again debate because people were these were normal nft minting bots using the solana blockchain more or less as designed like you you have those bots on ethereum too but there were too many of them and because solana doesn't restrict its block size and it lets every transaction go through uh they just got swarmed with capacity uh and so it broke it crashed it went down that's the first part of the story so solana goes down uh due to nft bot spam transactions right and so number one we should say l1 blockchains are not supposed to go down like let's just try this number one job is they do not i understand people talk about well it's in it's in beta but it's like i don't know how much billions of dollars a 20 billion dollar veda no as soon as you're billion dollars or larger you are not in beta that's what i have user's savings on there so you have a layer one but the other thing is imagine if if this was like a layer one that had all sorts of layer twos attached to it and settled on it right then all of those layer twos would no longer be functional either so you can't build on something that is not up all of the time but that's not the only part of the story and i think even the more alarming part of the story is not only did solana go down there's talk of censorship right at the validator level yeah which in my mind is even worse david but what what are we looking at now with this tweet yeah in the effort to get the salon train back online they were talking about blocking the the contracts that the nft bots were engaging with so if they block the contracts as in the validator say hey we don't answer to this contract any transaction that is pinging this contract we will not process uh we will not honor uh and so they hey uh somebody says in the mb validators discord on on in solana they say uh blocking candy machine v1 and v2 and the magic eating clone should be a last resort any other options somebody follows up saying in my opinion blocking them is perfectly fine for now i'd rather have a network that is up without nfts versus a network that is down and then 10 green check marks in support of that and then people spelling out in letters yes f the bots but like ryan it's it's not like i'd rather have a network that is up without nfts versus the network that is down it's i'd rather have a network that is up with censorship versus a network that is down that is the through line here and that is that's the thing that i personally do not agree with it's also a whole bunch of validators in a discord channel shouldn't be able to have the ability to decide this it's not like this shouldn't even exist this conversation shouldn't even be possible on a layer one that is censorship resistant that's what we're saying this is a tweet from the magic eden founder uh i think maybe coming into discord what does this say david uh well this is not the imagination founder this is the guy saying that the maya trickettian founder is begging salon availabilities to not block their contracts uh and it goes please do not block this contract please do not block this contract right because this is this guy's business like he's got a business to run and he's on solana and like the solana validators are like no we have to like shut down your business because it's clogging the network i'm a little bit worried we're a broken record on this all right because so i don't i just i don't want people to get the impression that we're just like bankless is here and we're just like arbitrarily bashing other chains okay the reason we're talking about this is because decentralization is essential without decentralization without censorship resistance uh properties we don't even deserve to be the whole industry doesn't even deserve to be worth over a billion dollars it's accomplished nothing we're databases we're open databases we are not a new social fabric that we can like create a money system on or create a new property rights system on effectively everything that the crypto people have been talking about is a bunch of  okay that's why that's why this is important to us and it's not about solana in particular it's about let's make sure at the base layer of our protocols we are building decentralization such that corruption can't seep in such that validators can't censor and block transactions because if we're doing that already at this early stage in the game then we're no better than the system we just left you had a take on this too david yeah i called this the dual problem of solana it goes down because its fees are too low to prevent spam attacks and the other problem is that the solana tokenomics are terrible because it's issuing 5 8.5 million dollars a day in security spend while only generating 53 000 in fees per day so like across those two things it can't keep itself online because it doesn't prevent uh transaction fees because their fees are so low or excuse me it doesn't prevent like spam attacks because the fees are too low but the tokenomics are bad because it's inflating so much and it's not capturing any revenue so i mean to me the simple answer is you raise the fees to prevent the spam and then you as a result of those fee that fee capture you stop issuing so many soul tokens uh this of course is like the ethereum game plan so like the critique here is like oh you just want salon to be like ethereum granted solana is being designed to do something that ethereum is not it's supposed to be this like all like this instant messaging platform across the world but like in my mind it's just like that's not how blockchains work it's just not what's going to be long-term sustainable so this is my path for solana to become a network that has good tokenomics that also doesn't go down look and i recognize i think the salona community knows that they still need to fix things and so there is the hope out there that they take a path that leads towards more decentralization while they're scaling this and you may be maybe you kind of agree that the solana network is in beta and they need to take steps towards this so i just very hopeful that the salonine community gets things together and they figure this out and they move it forward but they're not going to be able to do that unless they have some better mechanism design here yeah the last take i'll say on this is remember we are here to have anti-nation state level resistance and so if your network trips over because like nft minting bots killed it like a nation state can definitely kill it like it can definitely go down yeah the fed the fed just has to go in that discord channel be like yes stop right now please yeah you get your guys quit your shenanigans yeah stop stop blockchain right now and then deactivates or aml kyc or anything else you'd like anyway moving on uh warren buffett still doesn't like bitcoin david he just doesn't this is my shocked face well let's uh read some of the quotes he said so he and charlie monger just this week buffett said he wouldn't pay 25 for all the bitcoin in the world yes you would buff it don't lie why would you not do that right yeah it's like a it's like a he's virtue signaling right he's basically virtually signaling and say hey all the other boomer investors of the world i wouldn't take bitcoin for 25 um he goes in my life uh charlie munger says in my life i try to avoid things that are evil stupid and make me look bad in comparison to somewhere else and he says bitcoin does all three uh question mark there but then he follows up and saying the billionaire investor explained that holding bitcoin is stupid because he expects it to be worth zero dollars in time okay evil because it undermines the integrity and stability of the u.s financial system yeah status okay uh and also makes the united states look foolish because china's ruling party was smart enough to ban it see ryan these in my mind all i call these all personal problems as in like yeah those those are your problems bro like bitcoin's gonna add another block every 10 minutes regardless of your opinion on it you know it really cracks me up when people like this um talk about bitcoin say it's stupid and it's going to zero yeah it's also evil and it undermines the u.s financial system like you got to pick one of those things if it's stupid and it's going to zero it's not going to undermine the u.s financial system is it it's just gonna go to zero so you don't have to worry about it so how come you're saying it's stupid and it's also undermining the u.s financial system you gotta pick one charlie sorry you can't be bothered that's a really good point yeah well moving on uh maybe buffett monger come on bakeless discussion they're fantastic investors in other areas so i just don't understand this refusal to like dig deep in this space but um let's talk about this this is this is big david so it's pulled together it is involved in something we alluded to this in the uh in the intro today tell us what's going on with this troll that seems to be suing pooled together yeah somebody who is connected intimately connected with elizabeth warren's campaign i think a previous campaign like helper person came to pull together they bought ten dollars worth of pulled together tickets for pull together no loss lottery which they call a prize linked savings account as in as a savings account that you get a prize every now and then uh and then as soon as they did that they filed a class action lawsuit against pooled together saying that it operates in the regulatory legal gray area and then it's actually a lottery uh and that is not a legal thing to do uh and so this this class action lawsuit is suing pulled together on behalf of every single pool together user that has ever deposited money into pools i'm one of those oh you're one of those so he is suing pulled together on your behalf ryan uh and so for of the i believe the 144 million 122 million dollars that has collectively been been put into pool together they are doing a class action lawsuit for 2x that amount so they are suing pool together 244 million dollars to make their users whole the thing is pull together is a no-loss lottery no one loses any money that's the point so no one lost anything yet they are suing in a class action lawsuit pulled together for a quarter billion dollars it's embarrassing david they're picking like the nicest protocol to do this too right rather than go look at all of the other like all these djent protocols and like people who've got shitty paths and maybe run away with the money this is freaking pulled together it's pulled together we've never lost anyone like tens of thousands of people from uh like countries all across the globe if there's any defy app that has onboarded like third world countries and like non-western countries the most it's pulled together it's a savings account man it's a savings account that boosts your savings like why why isn't this person who put why doesn't this person put ten dollars in their wells fargo account and sued the us government for like losing nine percent per year yeah on their money right like i mean you pulled together is only upside i don't know why they're picking on the nicest kid in the class to go do this to maybe it's because of sort of the the lottery type of exam maybe they feel like they have a stronger legal case but yes it's very clear to me that they are trying to make a um a statement to the entire dfi industry and they are trying to to use the court systems to troll the court systems into like i don't know some sort of action that would further regulate further uh constrain further destroy the innovation of the defy ecosystem in in the us that's what the intent seems to be yeah and i think they're not they they don't really care about pool together specifically i think they are seeing pooled together as they get in the armor because of its association to being a lottery and they're going after pool together and i think the the strategy here is if they win something in court they get to go in discovery mode and so pull together has to turn over all the communications all the discord messages and then like oh you know all those people it's a it's a dow so they work for other dows and so the communication is about like uniswap comes out and compound comes out and so then they get information about those things and it's it's a it's like a backdoor attack into the defy ecosystem using a legal exploit in the legal world it's an it's it's insipid in both accounts so absolutely f these people it's not it's not even a lottery right like like in the traditional uh usage of the word lottery people put money at risk and they actually lose money right no one's lost money here they've only gained money here right i don't or not or nothing yeah worst case scenario you get your money back i hope i hope in some way that the the defined crypto industry rallies around pool together i don't know if there's a way to do that but like if this is a hill to die on i mean like you picked the wrong protocol guys like i mean there's there's examples of shadowy protocols out there with like some you know stuff that like some shenanigans going on pool together is not one of those right okay so i don't know if there's a way to rally the d5 community around this and push back but like we have to win at every level of government or else people who uh i don't know what is the vendetta against this is it coming from the banking industry i don't know well i mean a former technology lead for elizabeth warren's 2020 presidential campaign mr clinton is described in this lawsuit as someone who is gravely concerned at the prospect that cryptocurrency which consumes volume voluminous amounts of electricity could contribute to climate change besides enabling bad actors to circumvent financial sanctions so pull together what it's just look at this voluminous amounts of electricity contributing to climate change i put ten dollars in pool together and now you owe me like 150 million dollars insane uh yeah anyway enough said there hopefully it's just you know nothing comes with that but i know um well pool together has spent a lot of money fighting these legal fees so this is not just this has been ongoing this this news broke we actually covered this news months ago ryan like person put ten dollars into pool together now suing them over yeah we saw the original complaint that was like a quarter ago this has been going on for pull together ever since then so it's not like this is like some brand new thing like they have been fighting this and like they're finally just like going public about it all right moving on uh hopefully things get better we get a lot of work to do in the u.s uh the faye protocol things have just speaking of things not getting better yeah this is not getting better okay so there was an exploit rory capital exploit david what happened here yeah there was a 80 million dollar exploit in a what's been described as a textbook reentrancy bug uh somebody was able to bug the rari side of the fey rari dao for 80 million dollars as a result there is a 10 million dollar bounty on that 80 million dollars on that capital exploits um i don't really know how to read the code but there was a cool tweet that i saw that illustrated the uh illustrated the exploit um but again these picture the the person putting out this team says uh is a textbook reentrancy exploit whatever that means that is the type of exploit that i believe is that the one that got the dow david yeah it was the other one also parody wallet i i don't know if reentrancy attacks are like universally the same it's probably just like the same pattern over and over and over again the smart contract code there's a flaw in the actual smart contract code which is different than an economic attack anyway guys we got more to cover coming up next we're gonna do this new segment dave it's gonna be a lot of fun questions from the nation these are questions from roll up listeners like you to dave and i we're going to answer those questions of course we got to get to

question in your mind after listening to the roll up for dave and i to answer go follow at banklesshq once a week it will ask you what question you have you could drop your question in the thread and we will uh pick maybe one of the most liked our favorites to answer and uh we got a few questions teed up what's the first one david yeah first one comes from michael wong good buddy michael wong actually works at bank list his question is for you ryan how tall are you i feel like this is a troll tweet okay because there's some rumors going on how about you'll find out david when we meet in person i think no one knows this but i'll give you guys a hint it's somewhere between four foot six and six foot four i think it would be between those numbers what else we got well i think that confirms that you are not a bot because you at least have legs yeah but definitely have likes definitely like all right next question i'm a huge fan of the podcast and both of you thank you to uh trucking.ed for that i have learned a ton about a crypto in general from bank list my question is why do you guys seem to only talk about optimism arbitrarily and polygon when discussing layer twos loop ring seems to be trying to accomplish exactly what you guys are they don't finish that sentence but we get the gist uh you wanna start yeah i'll start bloopering is fantastic blueprint is great we actually talked a lot about loop ring during the early days i think um we're fans we love all of our children all of our children being all of the l2 solutions that are truly decentralized out there big fans of our trump big fans of polygon big fans of optimism zk sync star ware starkware all of these things loop ring included it's just a matter of like time and attention of what we can focus on in a given week we tend to focus on the ones that are gaining momentum and gaining more traction so you know one proxy for this that we like to look at is on layer two beat you can see total locked value and growth of these layer twos over time and we pick you know the most legitimate ones uh and the most high growth ones are the ones that we we generally prioritize but all of them are fantastic what would you say david all right i'll play uh devil's advocate ryan i think the the reason why loopering hasn't had the adoption that other layer twos have had is just because it's not generalizable zk roll up it does its two main features it's really good at payments and it's really good at swapping tokens uh so like it's a good like currency exchange slash payments roll up you can also do nfts on it uh but it doesn't have like the generalizability that something like an optimistic roll-up has uh and so that like constrictedness and use cases i think is why like bloopering has kind of lacked behind the the rest of the layer two ecosystem over the last year since we started covering it um but uh i mean as soon as we see any meaningful adoption we'll we'll start we'll start talking about it but just like you know got it got to go to where the attention is got to go to where the news are and news is and i just don't see that much like use cases coming to uh loopering that that frequently yeah absolutely uh here's the next question i don't know if this is i don't know if this is a troll or whatever that's a good maybe a little both it's good you want me to read it which yeah you read it which one will come first sharding on ethereum or ethereum the movie well that's a legitimate question never mind i take it back this is not a troll question so what do you think will come first eat sharding or eat the movie and we said eat the movie was coming what cami told us 2024 two years before yeah sometime before 2024. yeah well it depends on when in 2024 the movie comes but like you know both of these things could be delayed in tandem with each other so this is actually a really tough question like the timing on these things is actually kind of lining up i do think charting does happen in 2024. um you know what this is a good question for the dank sharding panel that we are doing so this is a pen look that was totally unintentional there's a there's a panel we're having vitalik we're having some we're having tim baco we're having some of the other uh prototypes this is like an earlier attempt to bring sharding to ethereum basically in the form of data sharding and i think we're going to want to talk about timelines if we can in that panel are we talking dank chardon 2023 or 2024 we'll ask that question of course tim baiko and the rest of the ethereum researchers hate having dates press upon them so we'll ask this question instead that's a way that's a way thank you listener for giving us this question it's a much more low-key way to ask and not put them on the spot but still put them on the spot yeah sorry tim i know what you're listening uh take something for the week days of the week uh this is yeah this is coming from you you want me to read it to you yeah take it to me please brian sean adams says that layer twos are parasitic he's being he's being uh facetious here layer twos are pacific pars parasitic to the ethereum economy the same way that new york california texas and florida are parasitic to the u.s economy and then of course he follows up with lol no they're not they're really not david and this is something we talked about in our episodes earlier in the week uh the trillion dollar opportunity in layer two which is this is a map of u.s states and they're all renamed in this map to countries with similar gdps and so like california is renamed uk because california uk are the same size in terms of economy canada is is the size of texas is the size of canada right so all of these states are massively contributing to what to the united states gdp right all right they're all secured by the united states federal government they uh subscribe to the same security regime they subscribe to the same protocol that is a great analog for layer twos all of the layer twos that we've been talking about loopering included optimism arbitrary loopering starkware all of these things if they are settling on the ethereum network then they are net accretive to the ethereum economy they are part of the ethereum network if you will some people talking about like even last week last weekend they were talking about ethereum transaction fees are so high oh my god and like they are on mainnet but broaden your view of what an ethereum transaction is if you're doing an ethereum transaction if you're doing a transaction on arbitrary optimism in the future that is an ethereum transaction and that is 95 percent less in cost right the transaction would have cost you ten dollars from the ethereum main net only cost you one dollar fifty cents on arb trump right and so that is all net accretive i don't understand this uh this idea that layer twos are going to be parasitic to ether as an asset they are absolutely not and i think we have the full version of that case as to why in our episode in our part one episode we dropped earlier this week yeah for uh bankless listeners that are not on twitter this was part of the twitter discourse in the last week was that i think it was largely coming from like the avalanche camp saying that layer two tokens which is now in the conversation because optimism launched their token they were like well layer twos are just gonna suck away all the transaction demand from the layer one and we're like yes that's the point uh but like the contrast is like avac subnets versus ethereum layer twos these are competing visions um and then the claim out of the some of the avalanche camp is like the layer twos will just be parasitic to ethereum um i definitely don't see it you guys uh listen those episodes and and do your own due diligence and uh you get your take here um david this was something that uh yeah i tweaked you a little bit this one uh this one this one triggered me here uh this is a conversation from some non-crypto people about how blockchains are completely just like non-useful for computing technologies so the parent tweet says every computer scientist should be able to see that cryptocurrencies are totally dysfunctional payment systems and that in blockchain technology including smart contracts misspelled is a technological fraud will they please go say that out loud and then somebody follows up saying harvard computer science degree here many decades of practical experience there is no computing problem for which blockchain is anywhere near the best solution and before we go to my tweet i want to go to uh santisiri's tweet who retweets this and says oops t is my tweet santi siri whoever had on layer zero he goes college dropout here many decades living under high inflation blockchains don't solve computing problems they solve social political and economic problems yes yes that's right it's not a computer it's not a computation platform it's a social platform it's an economic platform so like you know mr harvard with your computer science degree like you're not coming in here being an expert bro and so this is the tweet i followed but but maybe he was right though david before you get to your tweet maybe he's right there is no computing problem for which the block that's what he said computing problem it's in the domain of computing problems maybe he's technically right he's technically right but yeah he just misses the force for the trees what is the what is the force through the trees right and so i did the whole capital letters on capital letters i was making a fun of it i go harvard computer science degree here decades of xp i go no amount of credentialism can help you understand blockchains you learn about crypto by doing crypto things not by sitting in an armchair you know what happened next ryan what happened he blocked me yeah well look man your tweet was a little spicy i understand i think look i think that um this is just the ivory tower talking about like coming down and saying like i'm an expert i have these credentials i understand like listen to me yes and you know this this this system that you guys are creating over here is completely invalid and haven't even spent the time to do the deep dive due diligence to actually come up with a well-informed critique and we see this all of the time um so i understand why why you tweaked um do you have something against harvard though something any no it's just like oh i've got a harvard i've got a harvard degree like it's kind of the crypto industry is inherently anti-credentialist just because like credentials are like incumbent production protections and so like regulation like credentialism it's all just like trying to gatekeep away and so like you know especially about blockchains where there is no textbook there is nothing and so you can only learn about crypto by doing crypto things you can't learn about crypto by like reading about it i just always turn back and i'm like okay explain why this industry is worth two trillion dollars explain why it survived every single time that you said it was a ponzi scheme and it was going to zero just like charlie munger explain what's happening here like put put them on the defensive and you don't usually get good answers you usually get answers like it's rat poison squared or it's a complete scam or it's tulips it's a bubble um love to hear from the great critiquers of crypto they are few and far between uh david i gotta ask you the question what are you excited about this week man dude i'm excited about the layer zero that i did with carl florsch i've said it a bunch of times this week but i'll say it for my last time carl flores he was a guy that got me into the ethereum space to begin with during just the mania of 2017 when i didn't know anything i was a crypto novice all these different block chains existed they were spinning up new ones new tokens were a thing i had no idea what was up what was down and how to interpret these things and then i uh stumbled upon carl florish's cryptoeconomics.study website where he was walking through like com like complex but also basic issues about blockchains and how blockchains work like things like nonces and hashes and uh and he just like taught me so much in this thing and then so as a result of that it's like oh whatever that guy is saying he's saying the right things like this guy gets it he understands what's going on and so karl flores has been a personal hero mine ever since and i finally got him on layer zero ryan and so we talked about uh what we do we use the metaphor of like if humanity is a decentralized school of fish how do we steer the school of fish so that's like the through line of the metaphor throughout the whole entire podcast and this goes into the question of retroactive public goods funding and the the mev auctions on the optimism layer too and it makes me super bullish on humanity ryan because the public goods funding we talked about this in the part two of our layer two podcast which again for the like 50th time of this podcast the the path towards a star trek future ryan is actually known like we actually have the steps to getting there like first we sell blocks on optimism we send that money towards public goods funding using the retroactive public funding mechanism we build up public goods on optimism we scale that out to ethereum we scale that out to the whole crypto industry we scale that out to the whole world a few question marks and then all of a sudden we have a star trek future like this this path is concrete and it makes me really optimistic about the future so if you have not listened to that podcast with carl floresh i beg you to go listen to it so you can see the path forward for an optimistic future as well it look it's not just a substance that carl brings it's also tone if you can find me a more optimistic human being a more genuine human being like you know i've never i've never seen one carl it just exudes this enthusiasm this optimism this hope for the future that's pretty infectious so all right ryan you're up what are you excited about look uh it just kind of hit me we booked marc andreessen for the podcast all right he's coming on the podcast with chris excellent reason and he does that's the increase in a16z for listening it's the guy who did the netscape thing it's the increasing the andre he created the browser you know the thing that we're all using to like do everything in our life whether it's mobile or on the internet it's like the portal into the internet you know he was there for that he was there for like all of web one's development all of web 2's development now a16z is doing big things in krypto and web3 and i just can't believe that guy's coming on the podcast dude like i just he's been uh on my list of people i've wanted to talk to since forever way before crypto but like we'd have no no chance to you know bump into each other rub elbows uh until now and so i'm just it just kind of hit me this week like holy mark andreessen's coming on the podcast so that's happening that's what i'm excited about yeah man we're just getting like the wisdom of our technological elders getting on the podcast later yeah he's also coming on with chris dixon who was our most downloaded episode ever so you know it's going to be fire anyways um plus you get the perspective of mark andreessen and recent yeah that's pretty cool that's gonna be a hot episode yeah it's coming soon end of may uh david meanwhile week game of the week let's show it before we do how many days until permission this ryan uh i don't know i just i've lost track of time so it's about 12. 12 days 12 days that's it till the first day of the conference i think that's right that's about right man that is that is soon i'm excited so here's the meme of the week we we brought on a new uh like memer person in bank list and so this is one of his memes this is the uh the there's that the cute gif of like the two toddlers running from super far away to hug each other and it's me and ryan it's awesome man i can't look it's gonna be fun we're gonna meet in person i don't know where that's gonna happen we haven't like arranged it or anything but uh it's it's gonna be awesome dude to actually meet you in person in my physical human body okay oh yeah yeah that's what they all say so here's the weird thing it's like the artist drew my head backwards i don't understand why well yeah that's because no one knows what the back of your head looks like dude that's what you said on twitter yeah but then i showed you what that my head looks like this is exactly what it looks like if that's not what it looks like i'm gonna be so disappointed i've never seen you wear a gold chain before no i put that on for the picture you know because it does it does hit the mullet yeah this is my office you see that meme of the week uh do we have a second meme of the week we do we know just that one guys that's it it's roll up time thanks so much for
