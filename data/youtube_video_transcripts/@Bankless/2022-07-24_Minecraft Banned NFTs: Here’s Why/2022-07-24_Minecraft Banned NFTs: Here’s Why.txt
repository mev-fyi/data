minecraft just issued a ban on nfts in its game but i want to give you the reason why each of these uses of nfts and other blockchain technologies creates digital ownership based on scarcity and exclusion which does not align with minecraft values of creative inclusion and playing together nfts are not inclusive of all our community and create a scenario of the haves and the have-nots the speculative pricing the investment mentality around nfts takes the focus away from playing the game and encourages profiteering i gotta admit when you read that it is a reasonable take it's not just like nfts are like bad and they never work and they're just a bunch of scams and they're always stupid it doesn't align with our values we want our economy to be completely free purely open source we don't want digital property rights in the minecraft universe we want everything to be copy and paste it definitely is reflective of the last like two years of nfts it's the people that are creating scarcity and exclusion and that is definitely a downstream byproduct of a bull market mania where prices go up
