this is the first royal nft okay uh queen elizabeth in on the united nft the holy spirit hey banquet station happy first week of april this is the first week in april 2022 that we are doing what david oh we're rolling up the week in crypto ryan where we condense the entire week of cryptocurrency which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless so many crazy things happened this week uh gosh ryan you want to tell us about it give us the tease tease us yeah look okay i'll give you the little tease so uh elon musk just became the largest shareholder in twitter and for those of you who are like that's not crypto news well twitter is like crypto's social governance protocol basically it's a lot a lot of the social layer of crypt of crypto happens on twitter so that we're going to talk about that uh uk the uk united kingdom is minting an nfc this is the first royal nft okay uh queen elizabeth in the united nft the holy spirit yeah it's it's a very special royal nft so we're excited about that and the uk talk as well also the stable coin wars are heating up if you haven't heard of the stable coin wars we'll talk about them there's this thing called four pool on curve there's a lot of detail here but the the key thing is stable coins are getting aggro with each other like communities coming after one another and like trying to conquer market share while do kwan is trying to basically kill dai uh according to his own tweets meanwhile maker dao is making deals with tesla at the same time so there are some deep things to be talking about in the stable corn wars this week uh luna is also buying bitcoin and avex so that's what uh that's what we're going to be talking about uh not etho so that's interesting political choice what more to say about that okay guys before we get in we want to tell you about this uh really exciting nft opportunity all right so this is an nft that goes to a good cause that's the first thing you need to know so uh it is national awareness day for hiv and aids on april 10th and mac the makeup company consensus nft they're partnering up teaming up to present some art by the artist keith herring some fantastic art here embodied in an nft and all of the proceeds go to support those affected youth affected by hiv and aids so really cool opportunity if you've never partaken in the nft sort of shenanigans as david calls them this is a good starter nft um some of the the lowest tier mints cost 25 and then upwards of there there's a limited supply and the art is really cool david keith herring i've had an opportunity to uh to look up more of his art and i'm sure you've probably seen it in pop culture references but uh he's done some incredible work here in the past yeah i actually i didn't know the name keith herring but i knew the art by keith harrison it's very iconic art uh and so this is actually a pretty interesting opportunity we have a very big company mac cosmetics pairing up with consensus one of the biggest crypto companies uh using the art of keith haring an absolutely like massive artist in the space to make some nfts where a hundred percent of the revenue from these nfds is going to uh youth hiv aids awareness so like there's a lot of cool things all in this nft project um and so perhaps this might be the nft project for you maybe you don't uh maybe you're looking at all these uh monkey pictures and all these like i don't know all the weird nfts but you know if you want to get into an nft and also feel good about it maybe this is the first nft for you if you've not yet minted an nft so if you want to hear about that sign up so you don't miss it go visit the link the show notes it's bankless dot cc slash capital a uh sorry capital m capital a capital c and you'll be directed that where you can sign up um david some other things going on is we're doing an episode on treasure doubt treasure ecosystem and i think that's cool in and of itself but also this is a new show series that we're playing around with um tell us about this david yeah we're calling this the alpha leak series uh basically anytime that there is a community out there who wants to present the bowl case for that community uh bankless is here for you uh so i started out with this whole series with maker dow uh and then uh the this is going to be the second show in that series treasure dao uh and so i'm just posting on twitter it's like who should come on next so if you are a part of a community and you think that the bold case for that community needs to be heard uh make sure you're following bankless and me on twitter because i will always listen to who gets the most energy into these tweet threads uh you know you got to get that engagement ryan uh and that's how we decide who's coming on next is who wants this the most uh so treasure the ecosystem uh really really vibrant community uh never been on bank list before but now they will be uh and so your community can be on bank list too uh so yeah i can tune for more i can't wait for the cardinal episode david oh god oh what did i just do i don't know i think you may have said too much yeah uh speaking of saying too much though i don't think we're doing that in the bankless alpha report but um there is a lot disclosed in the alpha report a lot of alpha okay so this is where you get your alpha there is i think a growing need for people that are really just paying attention to the token ecosystem as attention goes from one token to another uh the bankless alpha report is where you get an understanding is why is attention going to where it is so this is coming off of analyst ben kiev he's a super hungry zoomer analyst in the d5 space he's the methodologist behind the gmi index and he pays attention to defy more than anyone that i know he is on the bleeding edge he's on the frontier and so he is covering the hottest tokens that have captured people's attention in the last like month or so he's explained why they've captured attention and then he gives his rating overweight underrate underweight or neutral along with some price targets and some analysis and justifications as well this is going out to bankless premium subscribers for those that pay 22 a month this will be an ongoing uh thing every single month to capture some of the the hottest themes and the biggest alpha that ben discovers ben and the rest of the bankless analyst team discovers in the d5 space so if you are a bankless premium subscriber this uh alpha report is coming to your inbox today friday as you are listening to this so go check it out you can see the preview here but the text is hidden uh and so expect this to come out every single month uh and it just will always be a rotation of the hottest tokens that are in the people's mind share every single month uh ryan anything to add to that oh dude i'm super excited about this because i actually i actually want to know right it's like um we're so busy with the day-to-day of kind of managing all of the news and the ecosystems like uh to to spend the in-depth time that our analysts do and finding actual token opportunities and what the catalyst might be it's something i don't have time for so this is something i'm going to pay a lot of attention to and i i can't wait to read the entire thing i've read part of it now david but i uh i'm going to give it all my attention soon we actually we asked ben to put in these like did digest to to really bolster up uh the the bankless rollup and what we talked about but then we just realized you know what let's just put into a report and so that's what we did absolutely uh okay speaking of reports i guess market market report what's the market telling us right now uh bitcoin where are we at on the week uh it's a womp womp womp week ryan uh bitcoin is down seven percent start of the week at forty six thousand dollars hit a low of forty three thousand dollars to where we currently are right now at 43 and it's 43.6 thousand dollars okay we're down we're down let's uh look at the three months still up still up a little bit crap crabby up uppy crap you're to date we're kind of down ish but it's all been crap how about ether what's that looking like on the week ether prize started the week at 3 300 hit a low of 3150 to uh but it also had an inter-week high of three thousand five hundred and fifty dollars looked really good ryan trying to break out to the upside it failed that breaks out and now the bears are in control again but also not really because we didn't really break down below 3100 so crabby weak but down overall down uh six percent i think yeah down six percent over 3k it's a good day that's what i say and you know it's true because it rhymes yeah yeah that's true for anything uh eat bitcoin we'll talk about maybe why we're down on the weekends in a second because i think some of this has to do with the uh the fed news uh this week but before we get there the eth bitcoin chart on the ratio the all-important bitcoin ratio what's that looking like this week oh it's looking good ryan last week it was at .072 this week is that point zero seven four so above a little bit more than a two percent growth on the week uh you know you can't be disappointed uh yeah we didn't really get the us dollar breakout that we wanted but the east btc the risk appetite indicator is slowly grinding upwards okay crypto hungry for more risk i guess the bet index which tries to moderate some of that volatility in that risk a third a third a third but that's a third bitcoin a third d5 uh tokens and a third eth what's that looking like on the week yeah down seven percent on the week started at 122 uh currently at 113 dollars are we good uh there we go gas markets uh it was a lower gas week most of the time with some huge spikes i think uh like the gary v spike we'll talk about that when we get to the news but what's the average gas what's this looking like yeah average gas last week was 40 gray it has moved up to 44 grey so ethereum usage marginally increasing marginally increasing there you go well let's talk about maybe why some of the prices are down this is our fed watch the fed officials this this week announced a plan to shrink the balance sheet by 95 billion a month that's a big number that's a big number right so this is reverse quantitative easing quantitative tightening i suppose i don't know if these terms are still used very much but uh 95 billion a month they are shedding and this would shrink the fed's balance sheet by one trillion per year david and the the reason uh is of course this is on the back of concerned about uh inflation you know it's it's not so fleeting apparently as the fed was talking about last summer it seems to be a sustained issue that the fed is now dealing with and so they're not only talking about of course shrinking the balance sheet but also continuing to to raise rates expeditiously was i believe a term that was used and we saw some of the damage that came in the bond market as a result of this so uh massive damage this was like one of the biggest drops i think since the 1990s in the bond market so the biggest drop we've seen like 25 plus years on what time frame though just for for the listeners that aren't looking at the chart are we talking about from the end of november to where we are currently time frame now this is a different chart this is a different chart i i was just saying that in general this is the ishares uh 20-year treasury etf chart which is down 11 year-to-date so in general it looks like a crypto chart ryan the takeaway is like people are getting out of bonds what's interesting about this is um stocks are still up right so you got bonds going down stocks up like people don't want to be in bonds people want to be in i guess traditionally they've been seen as risk on assets like stocks like even crypto didn't take too big of a hit compared to bonds and you sort of wonder if maybe the definition of risk is changing fundamentally like bonds are somewhat risky like i mean you're looking at a federal government who's printing trillions per year all of every single nation state is trent printing so much money these days and their deficits are getting higher their ability to pay them back without printing is becoming less and less likely and so are bonds really the the safe asset i don't know maybe the market is showing some signs of that cracking of course i'm not a macro economist i just see the fed doing some more tightening interesting that crypto didn't take quite as big a hit as i thought it might and perhaps all of this is saying something to us it's also saying that uh u.s mortgage rates are up you're looking to get in a mortgage the time was like a few months ago not so much now rates are up to like four four and a half percent almost now and uh the take i have here is that the volatility the joke the tweet is saying this is not oil this is not a meme stock or even a coin it's us mortgage rates which is indicating the absolute like gargantuan run in mortgage rates from just like earlier this year where it was at three percent down up to four point four percent which is like a big move in mortgage rates apparently which is also the speed and magnitude of the move is kind of what's uh caught a lot of people by surprise and my take here is that the world is becoming more and more chaotic as crypto becomes less and less volatile the the world around it is becoming more and more volatile i remember in 2017 2018 one of the conversations about why crypto will never work was like oh it's too volatile it's too volatile well the rest of the world has gotten a lot more volatile since then uh and also since then crypto volatility has dampened so you know not really how i expected that to play out at the time but uh the world becoming more chaotic makes crypto a lot easier uh a lot more appetizing than previously can i just say this i feel like crypto has made me volatility proof totally i just if you've been on crypto you are prepped you are prepped for that you are totally prepped like emotionally like you've been through like volatility wars like you are the you are the veteran and so when you go back to the regular markets you see something like this you're like oh is that it people are talking about this why are they talking about this it's always funny to see equities and people are like a four percent shock to the market stocks are four percent s p's four percent down i'm like what i don't wake up over four percent four percent in either direction how boring no thank you uh speaking of volatility i guess um volatility of three hours capital in their in not last week but the week before where people are of course tracking their uh ethereum addresses and seeing that three hours capital they just bought another 31 000 each it's another 100 billion dollars not a lot probably for three hours capital but interesting and i feel like this is part of the the great merge rotation that we're about to see like even trading firms are like okay we know that that merged narrative yeah we want to be here um so that's what i think is happening here with three hours capital yeah so i think the next steps for three hours capitals after they are done rotating into eth you'll start to they've already added the eth tag back into their bios i think this is um and like you know at some point they're going to start talking about the merge on twitter like this is what everyone's expecting this is the game and a bankless episode maybe i don't know whether we'll do that we'll have to see when the time comes guys we're going to get to the releases and of course the news of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible maker dow is the og d5 protocol the maker dao produces dye the industry's most battle tested and resilient stable coin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity instead you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint die directly with maker the power to mint new money is in your hands the maker protocol

the hot releases of the week the first is it's nitro time that sounds awesome okay here's what it means though arbitram very popular layer two optimistic roll-up layer 2 they have just released the test net version of nitro okay this is um this is going to be a seamless upgrade i believe so there's nothing that that folks have to do and of course this is still test dent so it needs to go through the process and eventually get to their main net a few things that this uh includes are one a custom built evm emulator that's what they had previously they're now replacing that with geth so getting a bit more standardized i think is part of what they're doing here of course there's also the minimization of layer two costs so gas fees on arbitrary going down once this is implemented through batching and compressing there's so much room for optimization we've been talking about this for a while on bankless with um optimistic roll-ups and zk roll-ups once you have the first version of these things where transactions are maybe still like you know 10 cents 20 cents 25 cents a dollar that's just the first version now all of these layer twos are going through the process of just massive compression uh and that's kind of the first pass of uh improvements into these ecosystems and that's happening with uh nitro now the same is happening with with optimism as well so it's really cool to see these upgrades yeah a couple paragraphs out of there out of their article today we throttle our patrons capacity but with nitro we'll be able to release these controls and significantly up our throughput and while arbor from today is already 90 to 95 cheaper than ethereum on average nitro cuts costs even further when we eventually migrate arbitrary 1 over to nitro it'll be a seamless migration from the current stack to the nitrous stack so users will have an uninterrupted experiment experience the only thing they'll notice are reduced fees increased capacity and overall faster experience so this is they have the test net uh and then they have the current arbitrary one and they're doing the indiana jones hot swap thing if i was on the arbitrary marketing team i'd start calling this the merge uh if i were them just because like this is perfect do you guys hear that yeah there you go some some free advice and marketing advice for you guys is that the arbitrage merge is coming uh i i think that if i might be getting outside of my technical capacity here but replacing the evm emulator with geth i think is following in optimism's footsteps of optimizing for evm equivalent which is a concept that i'm super super bullish on this is how you scale ethereum out beyond the l1 and have evm equivalents across all the l2s it makes things very very replicatable replicatable is anti-fragile this is how crypto works uh really excited to get this arbitrary nitro out the door and ryan i'm going to go ahead and guess that this is the last major thing that arbitrarily does before they launch a token this is my guess oh interesting well i don't know if the team can either confirm or deny that but we have predicted that 2022 would be l2 year and by that we also meant token tokens okay we definitely did so give me give me give me give me all the stuff arbitrary we want tokens we want low gas fees we want all of it and it seems like they're delivering that so super cool to see um instadap really cool app they just released a light version of their application what's cool about this i think is the ability to get one-click defy yields i almost worry that it's too easy like look i click that button i start earning 10. three one percent on my eat how it works how do they do that i don't know how it works but uh because i haven't looked at it i'm sure it's you know throwing it into all of these strategies there might be some leverage you don't know the risk anyway cool stuff from instadap uh let's talk about layer zero not your layer zero god dude not that layer zero this is a uh a bridge a bridge application a bridge a bridge platform that we're talking about last week in the context of receiving some funding the interesting thing this week is a nft project that has rolled out something that the industry and people are calling omni-chain nfts in fact william pister did a fantastic overview of what omni-chain nfts are what they are why they matter but it's basically the idea of deploying an nft not just on one chain you don't have to pick a solana or a polygon or an avax or an ethereum but deploying a little bit on each chain and the application itself i believe sits inside of layer zero right so it's almost like a layer zero type of application uh and the idea of an omni chain is you don't have to be pre you don't have to mint on like one specific chain and live there you can kind of live pieces of the nfts live on all of these various chains it's a cool concept and something i i think we'll see some pickup uh this year and so does william peaster what are your thoughts here yeah having nfts that change their expression based on properties is always interesting having one of those properties be which blockchain is it on is pretty cool as well it's one of those things where i can't really immediately think of a use case for it but i also probably couldn't have thought of a use case for the internet back in the 1980s and so same kind of thing where it's just like opening up the design space to something completely brand new um again thank you for naming your project after my podcast ghostly ghost is the nft project by the way this harkens to a podcast episode we just did with olaf carlson wii that's coming out on monday for bankless listeners where he made the case that bridges might also be an application platform in the future as well i wonder if we're seeing hints of that with omnichain nfts and layer zeroes we'll be following that closely of course um i see eth is a new interest compounding eth index from index co-op okay this is a way to boost up your e-field as well uh super cool i um i could tell you a little bit about where the yield is coming from but i don't know all of the details here's a dune analytics chart describing the process but basically it deposits lido's liquid eath token is collateral and ave and then recursively borrows the east through ave and then swaps more of that uh eath for staked eath so it's kind of a margin play on your eath to boost your yield on eath using staking plus some ave margin you could like do this yourself but it would be a lot of work and this asset that you can buy from index co-op essentially automates that entire process um what are we looking at as far as yield look at this ten percent ten point one hey that's where the instant app yield came from i guess so that would just make way too much sense and so in theory this should be risk-free if we uh remove away smart contract risk and other like defy exploit type risk which is always a risk in theory this is risk-free right because if the value of your eth goes down the value of what you also owe is also going down so you're immune from u.s dollar fluctuations because you're putting your staked eath as collateral to borrow eath and so these things move in tandem with each other except one moves slightly higher than the other other one over time so in theory this is a risk-free move to leverage up on yield if you are okay with taking smart contract risk and any other deep exploit risk that might come with this yeah i asked an analyst who's very familiar with this product what he thought about it uh he said good product but non-zero blow up risk but it's still probably safer than leveraging on ave yourself and it's really accessible to retail of course the the risks are the smart contract risk as you said and then any mechanical issues with the automated leverage and leverage and rebalancing sort of functionality that's going on so there's definitely some risk here but wow 10 yield on eth is pretty appealing with uh with a single asset that does that so index co-op bring in some cool products to market um david what's this tracer having a competition yeah tracer dow having a trading competition 25 000 in prizes and nfts it starts wednesday april 7th that was two days ago and it ends the 16th and this is on the arbitrary wrinkle b test net uh this is ahead of tracer dao's coming v2 when they decide to go live on the main net with their v2 perpetual pools which i'm really excited about i'm already using tracer v1 but the properties coming in tracer v2 are definitely much needed and as soon as those come about we will be talking about that on bankless and and around and trace so if you want to come and be part of the tracer uh trading competition and perhaps get up to twenty five thousand dollars there's a link in the show notes for you to go participate perpetuals products uh they're the future super cool here to have them in d5 all right uh let's talk raises so the first is not quite a raise i suppose but uh is a lot of capital so sort of counts the luna foundation that is lfg they just bought 231 million dollars worth of bitcoin they of course have plans to purchase 10 billion dollars worth of bitcoin they've stated to to backstop usd i think they're at like one over one billion now like one point one point one point three something like this um so that is 1.6 1.6 okay 1.6 that in and of itself is a story and by the way if you'd like to hear kind of a a debate about the the merits of ust and uh maybe some of the um the risks associated with ust tune into our podcast from earlier this week on the bull and bear case for that that's one piece of the news but the other piece of the news is this david do you read this yeah this is uh this is an interesting choice uh buying bitcoin to backstop your your stablecoin makes sense uh but in addition to that the tara lfg fund has bought a hundred million dollars of the avax token uh and so that is a different choice than buying bitcoin uh and again the idea is that we have these reserve currencies uh that help backstop the peg and so it's like ammo in the bank to use if in case there's ever a lull in ust demand and usc removes its peg you use the bitcoin and the rest of your reserves to uh to buy up the the stable coin to make sure the peg is maintained bitcoin i don't think anyone really would question the choice to use bitcoin as an asset to backstop this the 100 million dollars into the avax token questionable questionable there is a big difference between an 830 billion dollar market cap in bitcoin versus the avax market cap of 200 and uh of 23 billion dollars and so you if you are going to backstop something you need something that has strong insurances and extremely high liquidity and is going to be available for you in the time of need uh in a time of need is with avax token which has uh a lower history of price than bitcoin does is not the same level of assurances that bitcoin has uh and like they've they've skipped from going from the number one crypto asset which is bitcoin with an 830 million dollar market cap skipped over ether skipped over bnb skipped over solana justifiably skipping over xrp and cardano down to avalanche down to the number 10 crypto asset so this in my mind is not actually something that's in the best interest of the protocol this is a political choice this is like an alignment with the avax community because they're putting avax on the terra balance sheet okay so it kind of depends here for my to like my take is this like i don't think that um tara is actually prioritizing risk mitigation with the move like this and in fact that was kind of what we learned from our podcast earlier this week with the bull jose who explained much more about the terra ecosystem usc that the end game for uh ust and tara is actually like utility it's actually usage and so the prioritization is not necessarily on risk mitigation with a move like this the prioritization is on composable communities right uplift basically so if i get the bitcoiners on my side at tara what happens bitcoin price goes up a little bit tara price goes up bitcoiners are more friendly to my community more likely to use usd oh yeah we like we like usc and luna it's it's kind of a bitcoin friendly and a portion of it's backed by bitcoin how great is that do this rinse wash and repeat do the same thing with the avax community now we talked about the time it's political yeah it is it is political but it's it's a move for not to backstop from a risk perspective it's more to like pump the usage of this thing maybe even pump the value of this thing right so avax now the avalanche community is like okay uh i'm excited about this number go up for luna token number go up for avax because avax is only the second coin that lfg has purchased and everybody wins everyone's happy now whether you think that is a short-term game destined to fail or whether you think that is a long-term bootstrapping phase sustainable thing that's going to bootstrap ust and luna into the stratosphere this strategy does make some sense from that perspective but i would also say i still make this claim i'm not sure what the difference is between ust that is buying and custodying uh bitcoin and avax for its reserves to bats backstop a currency and an actual bank yeah like i don't see a lot of distinction here it's kind of like it's a bank gym you know this is what a federal bank does looking a little bit like that and um that that's some probably unresolved piece of the discussion i i think jose made a lot of fantastic points uh in our discussion with him but i was still not understanding how this is much different than a bank's balance sheet that is trying to prop up the the value of its asset uh so i've still got some more i guess due diligence or like you know things to think through on that side i will throw a flag in saying that putting avax on the balance sheet doesn't make ust the token have more utility like ust has the same amount of utility based on what's on top of the terra blockchain putting avax in the lfg fund doesn't add to the utility of that token so here's what it could do though it's like the avax community now wants to adopt it more so avax now prefers die and so or excuse me they prefer ust to die why because ust is now um base backed by avax and so you're creating a composable community linkage there and so that could increase the utility of usd so why would they skip over ethereum which has a much larger d5 ecosystem and goes straight for avalanche which has a smaller more nascent defect as well i think that is what you said earlier which is the um enemy of my enemy is my friend i actually didn't say that earlier in the podcast that was in the vitalik debrief okay guys we just recorded an episode with italic this morning uh that debrief will come out in two weeks i think yeah yeah yeah i think that's what's going on yeah don't you do you have another explanation uh yeah no i think again it's a political alignment as in like yeah let's band together all the the subdominant l1 so that you know together we can we can beat ethereum i think that's kind of what's going on here it's interesting it's it's crafty it's clever in a lot of ways you got to hand it to him from that perspective does it actually increase the or decrease the risk of usc not sure about that one yeah because because luna and avid and the avex token have to have such a high correlation with each other so in the time of need you need it non-correlated assets bitcoin is still pretty correlated but also you know it's bitcoin it's much more stable i would have it would have made much more sense to have gold if we're going to do this whole like centralized custody thing like effort let's do gold i don't know put some dye in it i mean really because it's backed by real estate and tesla which is actually where we're going next in this story well let's talk about oh no actually you said a few more things no yeah a few more things first so wormhole which is the bridge you remember had a big massive hack biggest hack bridge hack in history until last week uh well they've recovered from that crypto bridge wormhole is seeking 2.5 billion valuation price tag in private token sales i don't know my mind's exploding at the valuation of these things now bridges are just valued as highly as as layer 2's i don't quite understand it yet uh am i missing something are we collectively missing something this is the debate as to uh whether or not we live in a bridge ecosystem is it's there's the debate as in you know a layer two cryptographic bridge or cross layer one interoperability bridges which i'm pretty sure unless i miss something the interoperability between l1 blockchains is not a solved problem maybe that's what they're trying to solve but i i'm pretty sure in theory it is a unsolvable problem and so all layer one bridges are going to have to be centralized multi-cigs and i don't think it can get any better than that at the fundamental level this is to what i understand about cryptography which is more decent than most other areas of my technical uh knowledge you cannot have a secure cross layer one ecosystem like uh and so like these valuations on these cross layer one bridges i just don't it doesn't make any sense to me most of the uh bridges and by the way i think i am bullish on bridges and i think as are you bullish on bridges is a category like hugely bullish on them but most of the bridges uh that we've seen are like more layer two to layer two yeah which uh makes a lot more cryptographic bridges yes right this is this is a multi-layer one bridge but if you want the contrary opinion to that listen to our episode with olaf carlson wii because he's very bullish on bridges and i think polychain was probably involved in uh i don't know if in this sale but layer zero for sure uh anyway is back baby uh twitch co-founder nft startup just net netted 35 million in seed funding so a twitch co-founder is starting an nft startup and in seed funding he's getting 35 million dollars for that that's seed funding david that's not series a that's not serious b that's like i got a powerpoint with some ideas you know it's that level of seed funding i don't know maybe it's just me this week valuations seem a little more ridiculous than usual what do you think we could get for like ten percent of bankless how much no idea how much c funding do you think we could get i i think you could create a narrative bankless is a media interoperability bridge crossed cross blockchain chain for them no one would build not doing it uh of course i wanted to take this more seriously this is my bad course one they are a staking ecosystem leader they've been doing this since 2018 they're getting into the venture game uh so investing 30 million dollars into promising protocols so staking company turns vc interesting yeah there's there's a discussion to be had there i think we'll we'll skip that one how about this boba network valuation just hit 1.5 billion dollars after a 45 million dollar series a round who's in the series a uh companies like crypto.com huobi bit uh bip mart will smith seriously will smith and paris hilton yeah will smith uh we're trying to get paris hilton on the podcast by the way that might happen how about will smith i just you know he's been in the news lately paris hilton first she's smart and she's crafty and she's got some some awesome nft opinions yeah i'd be interested in hearing will smith's opinions about some things too you know what's interesting about this one ryan uh 1.5 billion evaluation on boba network boba network is a fork off of optimism which also raised at 1.5 million dollars not too long ago uh so like ll2 forks raising at the same valuations as the l2s themselves can can we call a narrative here like this narrative couldn't be more clear to me what i mean the l222 narrative there's no we've already called that i'm talking about like an alt l2 narrative that's coming so i think a lot of the rotators of the world not calling anyone out three hours capital i'm not calling anyone a lot of the rotators of the world will be very excited to capitalize on this narrative because we've seen the offspring off-brand layer twos that are community-backed and non-vc and more pure like that's going to be a whole thing and non-ethereum cabal you know fork and optimism fork and arbitrum fork some zk-sync technology and create an off-brand layer to you that now has capital from jump capital alameda uh three hours you know the holes and then and then pump that thing pump that token until the narrative's done and then you rotate back into bitcoin and eat all right i think we'll we'll i'll add that to the bankless pitch deck we'll we're making an off-brand layer too good idea all right lightning network it's still there it's still doing stuff uh 30 million dollars or sorry lightning labs just raised 70 million dollars to bring stable coins to bitcoin that's the thing that uh they were trying to do over at lightning laps any thoughts on this i didn't know that that was possible um elizabeth stark who is the the woman that you see on the screen has been just relentlessly working on on lightning network big open source developer big believer uh has been the ceo of lightning labs for forever lightning labs has been around for forever so definitely deserves to like raise a bunch of money i don't i do not know how stable coins become a part of lightning network that is new information to me they're trying they're trying uh maybe we will investigate that a little bit more as that matures and actually we see some stable coins that's the first step you've got to see it right uh press release is easy crypto data firm coinmetrics i love this data file we love coinmetrics they just raised 35 million dollars in a funding round uh so i was trying to find the valuation they didn't mention the the valuation yeah um so that that part is hidden but cohen metrics has been around for a long time a very useful website to get very accurate and true data about stuff i use it all the time if you have not yet tinkered with coinmetrics you should definitely try it out it's uh nick carter's startup yep he was yeah he was involved in this finance.us they just raised 200 million dollars in a seed round as well that's a 4.5 billion valuation not be not to be confused with uh other finance which is like global binance i guess this is binance.us with its own 4.5 billion dollar valuation it's going the ipo route david at a technical level there's actually no formal link between binance us and binance except for that actual binance licenses out there branding to binance u.s no way i didn't know that i think there's actually no legal link between these entities oh wow yeah okay other than like i'm pretty sure cece owns like a significant share of binance us which is like linked through the man himself never i've never used it never used finance site us okay let's talk about near so this is i think the last one in our raises a lot of raises this week they just raised 500 million dollars after their latest funding round i don't know what the valuation of this is uh in the billions for sure certainly certainly big war chest 500 million well i mean it's a live token right so you can just see that see the the valuation based on the time yeah they got a little i'm sure uh vc's got a little discount on that and that's kind of how it works um you know this reminded me of the 15 billion dollar total tbl or it's not tvl uh fully diluted valuation 15 billion uh remember this chart we were talking about this with vitalik earlier it's from his post this is a chart if you're on youtube you can see those major public chains launch date versus insider allocation and it's funny like the chart is basically showing the early chains had the lowest amount of insider um insider allocation of course bitcoin had zero unless you include the the early insiders who are like mining the thing of course which you might include that but uh ethereum very low insider uh insider allocation he's probably just talking about the 10 million dollar pre-sale right yep and then even cardano and tezos and eos like fairly low insider valuation there were other like flaws with eos for example but uh low compared to today like we look at um near it's like over 50 60 insider valuation and here's even here's even more right another private round uh with a larger larger valuation of insiders i guess now the token is public so you can you can kind of buy that and trade that but it's just interesting over time that this is uh consolidated to a lot of early vc raises before the tokens have launched and that's also true of layer twos we can't say that's not true of layer twos so this is a product of the sec small clarification on this one near protocol didn't raise 500 million they have 500 million dollars in cash after they raised 350 million on april 6th so they raised 350 they have 500 million in cash uh led by tiger global ftx ventures block change ventures dragon by capital um and then previous rounds by three hours capital alameda a16z what are they gonna do with 500 million dollars like they're gonna uh they're gonna hire they're gonna talk about jobs 500 million dollars i don't see near hiring on this jobs board ryan yeah i mean um look they're definitely going to hire people what else they do with it i've got to go to marketing i'm sure there's also a future development i'm not sure i'm not sure what an l1 does with all this money uh i think we will see though in the in the months and years to come they're not going to go broke that's for sure not at 500 million bear market immune yeah well on the topic of jobs and hiring which is maybe where near is going to spend some of its money get a job in crypto yep this is our weekly reminder to you that there are jobs awaiting you in the crypto ecosystem in web3 and you can have them you could see them you could see more at bankless.palette.com jobs i'm going to read out a few that okay you're sitting down i don't know if you can dance like that but i've done it once before all right solidity architect number one aloo marketing manager mesha ux designer prometheus research labs that just sounds awesome a community manager the dj dogs club world can you get a job at the djn dogs club a co-founder for innovative omnichain d5 primitive we're just talking about the omnichain that's a tbd thing it's in paris blockchain engineers at missouri software engineers market data masari operations manager syndica senior product designer smart d5 senior go rust engineer syndica senior full stack engineer syndicate senior software engineer airdrop labs product manager crypto nori bankless web developer at bankless and a bankless editor at bankless still looking for those positions we got some cool candidates we want to see some more too for those who are going to amsterdam this is how i'm going to be dancing at the rave that's happening there's a robbery in it because there's a rabbit happening in amsterdam yeah what's the story they can't have these on u.s uh territory right no i think they've just chosen not to okay i understand that like europeans get all the good things plus their parties are better [Laughter] you want to move to news sure yeah let's do it ethereum news uh remember the axi bailout david we were contemplating we thought maybe it would happen there's the biggest bridge hack in history 625 million something who bailed him out finance finance uh but they didn't bounce just didn't give axee 150 million dollars that was a 150 million dollar funding round so we're actually still talking about raises finance gave axi uh they didn't they didn't uh the details on it what actually gave them or undisclosed there's probably some like ron tokens some axs tokens uh maybe a bunch of strange love potions i don't know uh but they got 150 million dollars raised from binance which is going to help uh plug the hole for the users that lost the money uh and so i mean it's not a complete bailout because they lost 620 million and i don't think i haven't heard any news about like the fallout for where that money has gone i think nothing's happened with it uh you mean like the the people who the hacker were missing the money oh oh oh that's like yeah where is that money gone i don't know i don't hear anything about i haven't heard it haven't heard a thing but anyways they are making amends their community by raising this money uh so anyone that lost money with axe infinity now has this 150 million dollars to tap into to get some of their money back that's cool thought this would happen yep and uh certainly the big capital pools are you know using this opportunity to get some more some equity some more share in these crypto networks uh this is interesting backed just inked a deal to offer bitcoin and ether buys uh and sells to american bank customers so american bank is a community bank headquartered in pennsylvania what's interesting to me is now the banks are licensing crypto companies to sell their customers crypto right how far we've come when banks going from like oh this is a scam like kryptos now they are actively trying to find ways to sell crypto to their customer when wells fargo what are you guys doing this right i mean if they hadn't if they had thought more openly about crypto like in 2017 2018 and actually started to build in the bear market like the rest of us they wouldn't have to actually go through other people's services in order to now provide crypto they could have just done it themselves but no they were close minded david not even one bank did that even one bank not even one it's all crypto native companies that are dominating the new crypto banking industry it's not not even any of the old legacy ones and i'm surprised to be honest we haven't seen an acquisition of a legacy bank like acquire a crypto native company yeah probably because crypto native companies are like no fu guys like we have all the goods we're going to buy you guys and two yeah we don't need you we don't need you well i mean sbf came out and said that he was like yeah we're going to buy goldman one day i don't know if that was uh you know if sbf could buy goldman he would buy goldman i think he would do uh all right this is what you were talking about earlier what's this tesla and maker dow yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so maker dow is pioneering into the world of real world assets and so they have these legal structures that are formed that allow them allows the protocol to mint die based off of collateral from real world assets so tesla is getting a 7.8 million dollar loan from maker dow to finance tesla repair facilities uh around the world and this is just the first of what could be many many deals coming out of tesla like this uh i think that the next iteration on these are 12 million dollar deals uh and like a series of them so this is tesla getting their feet in the their toes in the water with getting loans from maker dow just because it's an advantageous place to get a loan from when it comes to tesla's balance sheet which you know that's a delicate subject tesla's balance sheet is a delicate subject for tesla and getting a loan out of maker dow is really a great opportunity for them uh and so this is actually not maker dow's first foray into real world assets this is them using this legal structure that they've created to allow and scale out the onboarding of real world assets uh and the cool thing about this like so people might be thinking like all right isn't this centralized right like this is gonna be some sort of trusted centralized entity managing this loan and you're right you're you're totally right the thing is if there's a thousand of these things there's a thousand different instances of centralized trust managing real world assets that is itself decentralized there isn't one trust there isn't one organization that's managing the real world assets for maker dow each individual deal is its own uh it's its own centralized deal and when you add on like a thousand of these things well then you have a thousand centralized deals kind of makes it decentralized uh and so maker dao was pioneering into aspects of uh just crypto economics and and uh adoption that no one else is doing uh and so that's always why i get really excited about what they're going up uh what they're up to at maker down i feel like there's way more meme potential in this than we actually saw like elon just took out a loan from a d5 protocol right it's like the meme headline and i didn't see that anywhere like people aren't talking about this that's because maker dow takes themselves seriously and they don't play in like the narrative meme wars and that's why everyone thinks they're a boomer but they're just heads down grinding all the time i tweeted this out like last week where of all the dolls that are out there maker dow has an order of magnitude more number of labor hours being contributed to it that are also effective labor hours than any other dow and it's just because they're their heads down building bruh interesting there you go well you you are the maker bull uh among us um all right four points by that sound i think that makes one of us look man i read the bankless alpha report and it's neutral on maker so i get i'm i'm neutral right now on mkr all right um stable coin wars this actually leads to the staple coin wars though because die is of course a dominant decentralized stable coin on ethereum right now but ust and luna is really looking to change that they're looking to take over they're looking to come into d5 and take away market share explicitly from dye and how do they do that the curve wars that's what the four pool is can you explain some of the uh the background on what's going on what the four pool actually is and how it's significant to the stable coin wars so the current status quo with curve is the three pool which is a combo of dai usdc and usdt the curve wars has deemed that it's appropriate to incentivize this pool so there's a lot of liquidity between these things so do quan has proposed the for pool which is adding ust removing dye and then also adding fracs and so for instead of the the three pool of dye uscc and tether we now have terra usd which is non-native to ethereum although it is a decentralized stable coin adding fracs as well and then also the usdc and and and tether stable coins and so this is do quan first off getting ust into curve so that is getting ust into the stable coin liquidity ecosystem curve is basically where stable coins get liquidity so it's really really mission critical for stable coins uh and not only is he submitting a proposal to inject ust into curve at the same time he is proposing a pool without die and so if the curve wars decides to vote that this is where they're going to incentivize sable coin liquidity this would uh this would be a knock against die liquidity inside of defy die has other liquidity sources so it's not only in curve but like losing curve does suck uh and so this is this is tara taking an active stance protocol wars stable coin wars against maker doubt yeah it's interesting and like working directly with frax to do that right and i think we're gonna see more of these like cartels that try to like team up and dominate it's just a lot of game theory going on with these adversaries as they're as they're chomping to try to get uh to get stable coin market share and it's also it's not only that it's also like um not only alliances but it's also like narratives that that like we're we're seeing this in the in the phase like there's a lot of vitriol between these communities dye versus usc i don't think i fully realized that that was a thing and that these were like bitcoin and ether level like crypto conflicts the communities had a lot of beef with one another until uh until after that episode that we just did earlier this week well no you're totally right that wasn't a thing until this is starting it this is formalizing the the wars right yeah i was in the maker doubt discord and they were hispanic like using that the uh i don't think about you at all gif um uh like the jon hamm from right yeah he's like yeah it's like why is why is tara so obsessed with maker and moving out die because dai doesn't think about tara at all we'll see if that is a viable strategy like can maker doubt just be heads down building forever and just like kind of just focus on fundamentals which i think is admirable but also can you is it winning is it admirable i don't know i don't know if it's the winning strategy yeah that's uh maybe that's why the alpha report is a neutral on memkr it's c to be d on what maker does next uh nft news let's move to that pudgy penguins they just tripled their floor price i thought this project was like dying dead going closer abandoned yeah abandoned by the founder what happened here the the pudgy penguins floor was kind of more or less trending towards zero but then zoomed up to i think at like 2.5 eth for the floor because the team has announced uh basically a road map of sorts including a metaverse game an air dropping a token kind of taken the board yachts club playbook and saying hey we're going to do that too uh and so then as a result of that the floor place mooned um i still have my penguins but um it's interesting to me it's like you know what kind of opportunities there might be in the future for investors you know how like private equity firms would go and buy struggling companies replace management turn them around like boost up the value and then sell them that's what private equity is basically tons of firms like this i mean you could do the same with nft projects as well right you take a struggling nft community uh put in new leadership create a compelling road map buy it cheap and then flip it uh i wonder if that's a little bit what's going on but it seems like opportunities for investors in the future that's exactly right uh teenage mutant ninja turtles they are coming to an nft collection near you spring 2022 unbelievable man for people's childhood did i ever expect us to be discussing teenage mutant ninja turtles on bank lists but like with nfts anything is possible yeah we used to take ourselves way more seriously now it's just uh turtle's all the way down um nice looks rare they just created a chat button in their marketplace uh using etherscan we we talked about this ether scan chat a little bit this is ethereum address to ethereum address messages almost like an aol kind of chat feel and now looks rare is incorporating it which is uh which is pretty cool i really like that actually because etherscan has never people just like link to ether scan this is the first time i've seen etherscan actually integrated into somebody else's framework that's a really really cool move by by etherscan and i kind of want them to keep on doing stuff like this because etherscan is the one thing in crypto that like i just 10 out of 10 on just what the product also just like it's it's always up like i can we all take it for granted how awesome ether is scanning we do and i i'm very like solid team from what i can gather like i would love to see what happens if they start to like you know start to get a little bit more suspicious with what they can do yeah yeah yeah they could do a lot for sure uh this is an nft project that was really big this week vaynersports which is gary vee's brother apparently uh they just launched a vaynersports pass which is an nft they sold out super quickly and that's part of the story the other story of this is um like it spiked gas fees for a period of time fairly significantly now such that a lot of the transactions to purchase mint these nfts actually failed and so looking at this tweet david a total of over 7600 eth was spent just on failed transactions failed and uh successful transactions on the vaynersports mint and so uh that is 26 million dollars of gas spent to try to mint this thing and to actually succeed in minting it in some cases for a total of eight million dollars in nft sales so people spent 26 million to mint 8 million in value sort of weird yeah yeah so the takeaway is that why didn't they do this on layer two like they've already done like uh yeah gary vee has already done nft minting on a layer two and so there was uh let's see 20 there was 26 plus eight so what is that 34 million dollars worth of demand for these things and vaynermedia only collected eight million dollars of that and so they if if people were willing to spend 34 million of which we know that they were because it's provable and on chain they could have collected 34 million dollars instead of eight million dollars by doing this on a layer two like immutable or or something like that uh and like you know that you wouldn't have had the congestion uh but instead they did it on the layer one which we know is a bad place to make nfts even though people like their nfts on layer one um you know they should a question mark on that one um and meanwhile uh 4 000 ether got burnt from this inside of just like not even an hour it was like inside of one hour four thousand eath got burned i think the largest single block of eath burn was 150 eat inside of one block wow pretty crazy that's a lot of money spent a lot of money wasted you would say on on this so thank you for your contributions to the security of ethereum i can't continue though can't continue gotta start minting more on layer two uh let's go to bitcoin stuff of course microstrategy weekly update that they just bought more eth 190 million dollars worth of eth so michael saylor just continuing to dollar cost average in we say this almost every week and uh this is this is this is such a sassal tweet anthony cesano says sailor started buying bitcoin in august of 2020 and so far has accumulated 129 000 bitcoins worth 5.6 billion of which he can sell whenever he wants the ethereum network started burning eth in august of 2021 and in that time has burned 2 million units of ether worth 6.6 billion which can never ever be reintroduced into the marketplace and then i follow up saying and ethereum has basically infinity ammo whereas michael saylor only has so much more ammo left in the tank we've got the infinity ammo michael saylor buyer always buyer of ethereum uh i guess always buying and burning that we don't even appreciate the protocol the protocolized version of michael saylor in eip1559 well it's funny how the michael saylor stuff makes headlines every single time when he occurs now yeah but the the bitcoin burning is not the same like burning yeah yeah they exceed burning it's quite lightly happening behind the scenes just burn brain burn burn silent burner uh other bitcoin news there's a big conference going on david and bitcoin miami conference is is that what's happening mayor 22 in miami yeah the mayor of my miami just unveiled a bitcoin bull is that what we're looking at here yeah there is a new like which is an allusion to the bull on wall street uh there's now a miami bowl because uh miami is like really uh taking the charge on uh just crypto in the crypto industry especially the bitcoin industry and so now there is the mechanical goal for miami to go along with the the metal bowl that's on wall street that's interesting are a lot of bitcoiners moving to miami like nick carter moved there isn't anthony pompliano in there too maybe he's am i wrong about that no though yeah but yeah has taken in a lot of those like tech entrepreneurs being very pro crypto uh being like a bastion for crypto especially for bitcoiners because it's the right culture for them i think let's talk about um some regulatory stuff so the uk is getting bullish on crypto the uk's finance minister just said it is my ambition to make the uk a global hub for crypto asset technology pretty pretty big words coming out of a government official and maybe they have some proof as well so they are minting nfts david a royal mint this is an actual graphic out of the uh hm treasury what's hm stand for her majesties her majesty treasury the the royal mint nft the first ever minted nft by the the royalty of of the uk uh this decision shows the forward uh forward-looking ambitions or forward-looking approach we've determined to take towards crypto assets in the uk the first royal nft all right all right that's amazing i never did i think i would ever see the uk government actually minting nfts that's uh that's where we are royal royal nfts right royal nfts thank you yes not not regular nfts not your average ninja turtle nfts these are royal um i do think that every jurisdiction is is going to be fighting for um crypto like fight fighting for crypto legitimacy in the coming future and uh it's starting to happen because i think i think governments are realizing that crypto is a winning proposition that it's going to be an engine of the future economy and they want to be part of it this is this is the tailwinds crypto has and why i think long run we win the regulatory battles all of them uh so we're starting to see evidence of that let's talk about uh elon musk david what's he up to oh you know just being elon just chatting into nine percent of twitter oh i got ahead of myself okay so elon musk last week tweeted out free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle and then he had a poll yes or no he followed up with that poll saying the consequences of this poll will be important please vote carefully no one really knows knows what he meant anyways like i think 70 people said no to that question so people think that twitter does not function 70 yes uh 70 says twitter does not rigorously adhere to the principles of a functioning democracy with regards to free speech um later we would discover that elon musk bought nine percent of twitter nine percent of the whole entire company and then is getting invited onto the board of directors this is a parag agarwal from twitter saying i'm excited to share that we're appointing elon musk to our board through conversations with elon in recent weeks it's become clear to us that he would bring in great value to our board he's both a compassionate a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on twitter and in the boardroom to make us a stronger in the long term welcome elon and then elon responds to that and says um looking forward to working with prague and twitter board to make significant improvements to twitter in the coming months elon has got some opinions as to how twitter should be and he's buying nine percent of the company in order to express those opinions wow well he's a twitter super user i'd say like he's one of like the top point zero one zero zero zero one percent of all twitter users so i guess it's the the buffet adage of buy what you know like he clearly loves this product because he's on it all of the time but um what do you think like what do you make of this do you think he's going to advocate for more free speech and how does that actually happen on twitter i mean there was jack dorsey always talked about turning twitter more into a protocol and less of an application but it never actually materialized do you think that's the direction elon takes this in it's hard not to take a web 3 framing on this but also at the same time i just don't know how elon would do that of all people like elon's not yet into the world of web 3. like he's not yet web 3 pilled he's getting there he's getting close um i do not know what he's up to ryan elon musk on the bankless podcast maybe sometime this year david that'd be amazing love to see that last thing before we get to the takes uh virgil griffith this is a sentencing of virgil griffith right now we can talk about the sentencing in a minute but could you do a quick recap of the story david yeah virgil griffith i believe he worked for the ef he's been an ethereum developer for um a long time but he's also been in jail for a little over a year now i believe he was jailed for going to north korea and giving a presentation on crypto and blockchain um what was in his presentation was common knowledge um uh from from is what virgil griffith is claiming what people around him corroborate um so it's not like he was giving north korea a secret like blockchain alpha it's stuff that you could learn on youtube uh but the act of going into north korea which is not an illegal act um but then giving a presentation about blockchain tech has disney uh been deemed to be like uh i'm not sure if it's treason that's the charge but treasonous activities-ish by virgil griffith sanction evasion for sure sanction invasion yeah uh so he's been in jail waiting to have his sentencing and here's his sentencing uh today i don't know if this is official ryan is this official uh i i believe it is um i haven't read through the full the full document though but i i think the headline is between 63 and 78 months of imprisonment in addition to a one million dollar fine and we'll include a link to the documents you can read it uh it has this image though which i did scroll down and see which is virgil giving a presentation you can see on the whiteboard i'm sure the government kind of used this in their case against him no sanctions with the smiley face uh oh government kind of making their case here yeah but once again the first thing you learn about when you learn about crypto is that you can invade sanctions like is he getting trouble for writing that on a whiteboard i mean no it's a bad look virgil it's a bad look but also at the same time there's something new here it's also true in a way like no censorship no sanctions uh you know again uh readers can read the entire report in the case of the government and uh and draw their own conclusions here but um be very careful what you write on whiteboards and especially if you're in north korea yeah well just maybe just don't go there uh it's the first bit of advice guys we will be back with the takes of the week and of course what we're excited about but before we do we want to thank the

arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas feed if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit arbitrum.io developer to start building your dap on arbitrome if you're a d-gen many of your favorite dapps on ethereum are already on arbitrary with many moving over every day go to bridge.arbitrum.io now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defy nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free hey guys we are back with the hot takes of the week the first one from nick uh one confirmation he's a venture capitalist since genesis in 2015 it's ethereum genesis ethereum has led every bull market in 2017 icos 2020 d5 2021 nfts 2022 merge bled every single bull market that's the take what do you think i've been arguing on my older show which i don't do anymore pov crypto which is me and then the bitcoinmaxi he was always trying to say it's like it's the happening cycles man it's the happening cycles and i'm like what do we call the 2017 bull market we call it the ico mania like that was ethereum's bull market like bitcoin went from like once it wasn't the happening mania it wasn't the happening ethereum bitcoin went from like 1 000 to 20 000 but ether went from like like 30 to 1400 uh and and then every other like the the the bull market for 2020 got kicked off with yield farming we had the inflation narrative in the background so it's not like bitcoin couldn't pull its own weight but like it was it was known as defy summer man not inflation summer uh and like it's been nfts and now and now what nick is now claiming is going to be 2022 is the merge hype and so like like i wrote in that market monday a while ago like if bitcoiners think that bitcoin happenings can uh trigger bull markets what do you think a triple having in ethereum will do especially when ethereum is bigger than bitcoin ever was at any other previous happening except for the most recent one it's going to be good for bitcoin too because all of these bull markets being led by ether also you know number go up for for bitcoin so bitcoin you're welcome you're welcome bitcoin that's what we're saying you're welcome yeah you're not secure and of yourself but you know with a with ethereum we'll pump your number up so you can be secure for a longer amount of time bring a friend you want to do this take oh yeah i know this guy ryan john adams tweets if you get into crypto to make life-changing wealth overnight you'll probably fail but if you get into crypto to make life-changing wealth over a decade you'll probably succeed ryan why is it easier to do over a decade than it is overnight oh you don't even have to think man you just like buy hold stake that's it three things you don't have to you don't have to sell you don't have to like figure out what to ape into what to trade um i i do think that the problem with a lot of people in this space or the problem that they're going to have in this space is they just think uh too short term right i want to buy this thing because like what's the next thing to do 100x like uh you know some token or next nft project and i don't think most of the people i've met in the space that have done really well have just been people who've been in the market for a long time and bought and held and uh it's it's i think it's so attractive to try to play the the trading game but most people are not going to make money that way and thinking short term is like the way to lose in in this market so that's all it's just a reminder of if you're trying to make life-changing wealth and cryptos actually not that hard the things you need to do are not difficult in terms of complexity the the only difficulty is you have to have the long-term time horizon and that's more a temperament discipline type of thing than it is like yeah then it is like actual intelligent it's not really that hard to buy good crypto assets and hold them for 10 years and if you do that uh i think you will do well it depends maybe life-changing wealth you know it depends uh what that means to you but that's certainly the way to do it the uh people really get fomo in this industry obviously because that's what happens when you have provable scarcity people don't get fomo over dollars because they'll just print more of them in the future but as soon as you have like a supply cap with bitcoin and you have like the eth burned the deflationary of eth then people start to get fomo right and then they also when you get into crypto everyone feels late that is the first sensation that everyone feels after they start to have their aha moment about crypto they're like oh i'm late what do they do they take leverage they they go down to risky moon tokens that are short-term thinking and then they forget about how this is the largest wealth transfer event ever in human history and they forget to be patient and they try to catch up with the ogs by taking leverage and doing really risky stuff then they lose their money and then they're even more behind so the best thing to do is just buy hold and have patience and listen to bankless totally agree uh okay let's do uh let's do this take this is from hasu why don't you read it out yeah oh ryan once upon a time debated hassu about a similar subject back i think in like 2019 or early 2020 hazu tweets uh well first off there is a a twitter thread by a bitcoiner alex thorne who says bitcoin fees are at all time lows the craziest thing fall 2021 was the first uh the first bull run not accompanied by a major spike in fees how is that possible what does that mean here's a thread explaining the most confounding and awesome chart in bitcoin uh and then he makes a thread about like explaining like why bitcoin fees are going down even though when price is going up but hazur just says uh ignore all that and huddle just says it means bitcoin is effed long term but okay keep brainwashing people with ridiculous positive spins so this is less about hazu's take even though i think both ryan and i agree with this take it's more about hazu once upon a time was taking the other side of this argument like ryan and hazu had a debate on the delphi uh the block crunch podcast and ryan was of course arguing pro ethereum hazel was was a bitcoiner at the time i'll say hauser was a moderate bitcoiner um but the difference in opinion that hazu has now about bitcoin sustainability is just night and day from where we saw it in 2019 yeah and i will give hasu some credit for this too so we had that debate and then it was kind of like later he actually did some due diligence and some research and he came out with a paper i don't know if this was 2019 2019 or 2020 about basically the lack of uh sustainability here it is on common core uh the paper i remember reading this 2019 yeah so uh the lack of sustainability of bitcoin's block subsidy he was still like bullish bitcoin at the time but i think he recognized this issue and i think this is haasey reflecting hey three years later this hasn't changed like there's no fix it's getting worse it's getting worse the bitcoiner is saying the the crazy thing that fall 2021 was the first run not accompanied by a major spike in fees that is an uh-oh moment for a bit yeah you should be like you should be prepared where's the fees coming from there's no block space demand with no block space demand you don't have security like we've talked about this forever like just to just to underline this and make this clear because some of you guys haven't you delved into this but bitcoin's issuance is going to zero over the long term so no more blockchain subsidy what do blockchains have to do they have to secure their blockchain either through issuance or transaction fees so bitcoin is moving to zero issuance only transaction fee defense right like military budget so what does that mean the military budget is going to go down unless and this is the argument always given by bitcoiners about the fixed supply cap and why they're bullish unless transaction fees will rise to compensate for that they are not rising they're going down why because bitcoin blocks base does not have high demand why because it only does one thing move bitcoins from one place to another no defy no nfts no other sources of demand for this block space commodity and so net this is not sustainable and at i guess at worst it's the entire chain could like collapse that's probably unlikely to happen but what's much more likely to happen and seems obvious will happen is other chains will succeed it and have far higher security budgets and there is a thesis out there of which i'm sympathetic and probably subscriber that like the highest security chain will win the network effect for this entire industry and become the money for this entire industry so so go security so go bitcoin value proposition and moneyness and store value and so like what are you building the foundation on so lots we've been pointing this out other people have been pointing this out but it doesn't uh invade the um the mean bubble i think of bitcoiners yeah uh bitcoin issuance dropping to zero bullish bitcoin fees already dropped to zero more or less like it beat issuance in running to zero yeah i think ethereum had it's like over the week it was like uh 20 times more uh revenue from blockchain transaction fees over the last week something like this it was like yeah 15 to 20 x 20 20 feels like low i mean it depends on the week right but it's just a lot more uh and it was there was a period of time where those two networks were neck and neck in a transaction there was a period of the majority of my our time in crypto bitcoin has been in the lead up until up until the end of 2020 when the bull run really kind of started getting you know what's funny david is you know who kind of taught me the value of uh revenue from blockchain sales was it nick carter it was nick carter yeah wasn't it carter yeah he taught me that too he totally emphasized that uh opened my eyes to that in a big way and um yeah it's uh it made me more bullish on ether so anyway bitcoin has four percent the size of ethereum's fees four percent four percent twice advanced ethereum has 25 times higher fees than bitcoin here's advanced spencer take why don't you read it uh 2021 narrative alt layer ones have solved blockchain scaling eth 2.0 is too little too late 2022 narrative alt layer ones haven't been able to scale most and all of the most or all of them have structural issues eth 2.0 plus roll-ups are the most viable way to scale a blockchain in the near near term and he finishes with funny how things change um l222 do you think that's the narrative yet i haven't seen that propagate as a narrative i mean yeah i have not seen that propagated but i think i think he's calling it like we're still pretty early into 2022. um and i think also it's indicating that people are starting to understand deep protocol uh true truisms that are in this industry and how some of the alt layer ones have violated those truisms and therefore that's like the structure i think he's talking about how people are starting to wake up to this well we'll see if the market catches up to that and wakes up to that as well um this is a take from david phelps incredible to realize that web 3 kind of has to be desktop only to avoid extractive fees from app stores we might look back and realize the success of mobile apps killed mobile apps because nobody can afford their taxes apple is a state web 3 is an anti-state think about that it's a really interesting take like uh the apple store don't they take 30 of revenue yeah of all apps uh like all app profits right and like web3 is you know disintermediating it is anti-state it is anti-middleman uh it is anti-intermediate and uh so web 3 kind of has to be desktop only i've never thought about it like that but i guess it's true or like mobile browser only the app store model just doesn't work it's too closed yeah i don't think that's why web3 is desktop only but i'm open to that argument but i kind of think it's just because like i don't want to use my ledger with my phone [Laughter] that's weird yeah absolutely okay here's a take from lenny rachitsky sorry for butchering your last name uh there are roughly 27 million software developers in the world only about 18 000 of them or 0.07 work on crypto or web 3 every single month those 18 000 active engineers have created two trillion dollars in market cap across the top 100 projects 112 million value per developer uh and we have only 120 million dollars per value about each developer we only have zero seven percent of them ryan are we early ryan is that what this means uh i think the sweet means we're really yeah david yeah i think that's my conclusion look at all the all the engineers are getting all the credit what about the educators huh what did we where's my 112 million portion of that two trillion had to be educators right yeah i want to believe that a little bit what are you excited about this week man uh at the end of this week sunday i hop on a flight to new york because of brooklyn specifically because i'm going to be moving there at the end of may that's the plan so i'm just going to dabble around yeah get a feel for it explore the the brooklyn crowd apparently the metaverse is being born in birth in brooklyn that's where like the epicenter of the metaverse is everyone is everyone who cares and is interested in web3 and the metaverse is all in brooklyn all in williamsburg apparently specifically so i'm going there for an airbnb for a week while i plan my move and figure out where i want to live in williamsburg and then after that taking a flight straight to amsterdam for dev connect for east amsterdam uh which is going to be the nerdiest conference i think i will ever go to so far uh and like all the core protocol developers are there vitalik's going to be there danny ryan's going to be there anthony cesano i haven't seen him since denver 2020. he's going to be there it's over two years since i've seen that guy he got out of australia huh he got out of australia yeah so like all my friends are going to be there so i got a pretty fun two weeks ahead of me starting on sunday so are you going to brooklyn because like uh you want to live in new york city or is this about a little bit about crypto like you want to immerse yourself in crypto culture and have more kind of like in real life crypto friends around the the the latter the latter that one i don't care about new york city any of this like this and i probably wouldn't be made to weather yeah i just hate the density yeah claustrophobia but like the number of friends that i have that are all in brooklyn and manhattan is just like growing through the roof uh and so like if you want like like i do want to be around web 3 crypto defy ethereum stuff 24 7. like i love san diego i've been i loved living here but like the crypto scene is just not there because l.a has a crypto scene don't they but it's an nft scene and it's it's like it's the nft scene that which you know it's it's the culture scene it's the pop culture side of crypto the nfts it's not the protocol side of crypto like i i like i like to defy the dows the protocols and and the people that that are have the entrepreneurial spirit so if you are in brooklyn if you are in williamsburg i'm going to be there for a week starting on sunday come say hi there you go i don't know where i'm going well like brooklyn for ethereum web 3 and i guess miami for bitcoin and that's how it's going that's a little bit right that's a little bit right yeah be good to have you on the east coast man get on your time dude you're gonna have to uh i might take the train up hello you're gonna have to have to deal with my ridiculous sleep schedule because i'm getting up at like 6 30 every single morning i know you're afraid you're pretty early to rise though right um i'm early-ish but like uh not that early dude i'm not i'm not cranking by that time so we're gonna be yeah everything about bangladesh you're probably gonna make me wake up earlier that's what'll have to happen all right ryan what are you excited about uh i'm done my taxes dude what a pain it was just a pain you get the applause for that one brother all right i guess so i just it's um tax isn't crypto for anyone you guys have done this uh it's just it's just such a nightmare it's such a pain in the ass like tracking every single transaction um i can't believe you know some of crypto isn't actually treated like a currency like a money like the euro or the yen or the us dollar right trap cap capital gains in and out like your gas transactions that's like your capital gains long term capital gains on gas fees yeah yeah how do you manage when you like put liquidity in a uniswap pool is that like a tax event what about like uh you know staking and eve you know how do you recognize that and it's just so nft i haven't even talked about nfts that was um you know that's probably why i didn't do as much in the nft world is because i was like ugh every single thing is like talented right no but even buying them if you buy nfts with ether that's a tax event bro but like it's a normal normal crypto tax event where like it's not any of the nft complexity yeah but just tracking all anyway i'm done and i'm so glad to be done and i am hopeful for a brighter future where some of this stuff can be like automated figured out and all of the data is on the ethereum blockchain like yeah like the irs needs to have like a push button here's your number we'll be we also need like better tax laws like not every jurisdiction the us where all of this stuff has to be like tracked um i mean there's some countries in europe where like you know crypto crypto does not trigger a tax event um that would be amazing too anyway well ryan congratulations for making the the lamest i was excited what i'm excited about that we've ever had how terrible you were like don't do this ryan i'm like i'm gonna do it because that's honestly what i'm excited about cannot lie in the show um hey i'm excited about this though too meme of the week you skipped to the end though we have to start at the beginning oh yeah go ahead we need the context for this uh how did this come about okay here it is we talked about it with vitalik so this guy tweets out i don't actually know him he said we're canceling each other over food takes today post your cancelable food take your cancelable for take and uh he said ir i was already canceled over my ice cream plus balsamic take which is gross you should be canceled for that no ryan it's so delicious vanilla ice cream and balsamic vinegar oh it's not even like raspberry balsamic vinegar and it's okay oh dude you don't know what you're missing vanilla ice cream balsamic vinegar i know you've got some in your house you've got to try it all right i might try that but i don't know if i'm brave enough to try this this is vitalik's cancelable food take i generally don't drink alcohol stuff but mixed green tea plus red wine 85 to 15 ratio is underrated my man vitalik mixes green tea and red wine what's up with that yeah i mean i'm sure it's underrated if it has any ounce of just like being good at all people are definitely underrating it because no one thought about that combination and so the meme for the lint bankless listeners is that meme where somebody's dual pressing two soda streams at the same time green tea and red wine and then in going into the same cup and then the caption is the merge question mark i actually am going to try that though so this is this is now the new me this meme is going around crypto twitter of just like th this is called now called a buterin or a vb so you can go to your local bar if they don't know what this is just tell them and so that this is now the new thing uh i think this is actually just what a bougie version of a four loko is i don't know if you remember four locos right yeah but they're ba uh they were basically they were like what high schoolers would drink if they didn't have a lot of money you would basically like pay like four dollars for one it would kind of get you wrecked because it was both caffeine and alcohol and just like syrup at the same time i got it so like you know get the alcohol the caffeine from from the green tea you get the the nice red wine mold wine flavor i guess you're selling me but it's only 15 red wine and i was like thinking about what color could this possibly make in your in your cup or in your glass right you got that the green tea look plus red wine that's got to make some kind of like gross looking brown no it's got to be like because green tea can be like mostly water i think it's closer to a rose well maybe uh bankless listeners you guys can uh try the vb special i think it's going to be fake a hot topic at ethan amsterdam i think everyone at ethan amsterdam will definitely be drinking the buterins when we do the live stream cause you know we're live streaming the merge when that happens we are all going to be drinking vbs oh my god that's exactly what we're going to be doing it's going to be like seven in the morning and we're drinking green tea that's a great morning drink if you have to drink alcohol i think green tea and a splash of red wine is a great way to wake up okay but you can't say that until you've tasted it you can't say that dude it's called the vb i'm gonna love it all right guys this is uh been the meme of the week and this has been bankless of course none of this is financial advice it's not drink advice beverage advice either please do not cancel us that was vitalik who said this but of course eath is risky bitcoin is risky you could definitely lose what you put in all of d5 is risky um so are your beverage choices but we are headed west this is the frontier it's
