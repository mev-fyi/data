we were like we have to move fast because i know that the other players you know whether it's disney or riot games or whoever they're going to end up getting on board with this eventually and we need to move fast and so we just went all in [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today on the show i am joined by the one and only tom bilyeu tom is a mega entrepreneur he was the founder of quest nutrition which he sold for i think a billion plus dollars several years back and he is now the co-founder of impact theory which is a web 3 media and production company that is building across non-fiction content with tom's podcast and series of web shows it's also going heavy into fiction content tv film gaming animation comics i mean what he's building is vast and he's doing it all with web3 top of mind front and center integrated into everything he's doing so we talked about a lot in this conversation tom's background which was really fun for me to learn more about i've followed tom for a while now but really didn't know that he has a background deeply rooted in storytelling so we talk about storytelling about the role that plays with nfts and web3 and what he's building now we talk about how tom thinks nfts and web3 can lead to a resurgence of the middle class which we all know is is really struggling so we get sort of philosophical on that on on in the fall of institutions and and what that's leading to in society and also what the future will look like in web 3 i think tom has a couple really awesome very specific concrete examples of what we have to look forward to in the next call it several years with nfts and ar and vr so that was fun to to really have somebody like tom paint a picture of the future for for us for me uh and then we talk about some of the specific projects that tom is building out with impact theory with his nft program and um and what lies ahead for for him and and for that project so i really think you're gonna like this one we talked for a long time he was so generous with his time and uh just has so much to say and his is a wealth of information and um and just a joy of a human being so very grateful for this time with tom i hope you enjoy it we are gonna hear a word from our sponsors and then it'll be on to my conversation with tom bilyeu polygon is ethereum's largest and

so excited today to be joined by tom bilyeu he is the co-founder of impact theory which is a media and production company that we are going to talk all about they are heavily in nfts and web3 you have probably seen tom talking on his own podcast or somebody else's podcast or twitter or instagram uh he's got a sprawling empire that we're going to talk all about and he was previously the co-founder of quest which we may dive into a little bit here as well tom welcome thank you so much for being here thanks for having me i have seen many many an episode of your show so i'm excited my gosh i'm so flattered to hear that well let's kick off for for folks who maybe you know don't don't have full context on you like give your your little bit of a background uh and i'll i'll start off with this sort of teaser line which is you are pretty on the record about saying that you are now trying to build like kind of the next disney which i love a big kind of teaser to get everyone pumped about this conversation with uh so with that lead in why don't you give us sort of your your background yeah so i'll put it in a really brief nutshell and then whatever you want to push on we can go deeper so i went to film school and consider myself an artist first and i graduated from film school and thought i would get the three picture deal but i didn't and i was really quite hopeless when i graduated i had no idea how to break into the industry and this is the late 90s so there's no youtube there's no you know like cinema grade camera in your pocket it's it's really crazy how far things have come and so i really did feel lost to jumble the timeline a little bit but to make it easy for people to understand i wrote a screenplay it got turned into a feature film i was traumatized with how it came out i had met these two very successful entrepreneurs and they were like look man if you want to control the art you have to control the resources so why don't you come with us and get rich and i was like yes that is exactly what we should do and uh you know we we all of us thought it would take about 18 months and so i pitched my wife it's going to take 18 months i know it's weird but like you know this is going to be amazing we'll control the resources it'd be great and she was on board and i went in and 18 months turned into 14 years but 15 years actually but it did end up working and so it was you know this radical journey that i never could have predicted it was absolutely crazy changed my life changed my mindset um really was a very difficult journey but i'm grateful in the sense that in the beginning i didn't have a why and so i loved movies i loved tv and film and knew that i wanted to do it for the neurochemical response but i didn't have like a grand sort of nietzsche and why if you will that would allow me to fight really hard and you know as as nietzsche said a person with a strong enough y can endure almost any how and i didn't have that and so going through the business journey did lead me to that um and so at quest so i guess back up when i was in college i ended up big brothering for this little kid that grew up in south central l.a and ended up big brothering for him for like eight and a half years it was supposed to be eight weeks and became this whole like just incredible thing and at one point i was the guardian that helped him into the foster care system long story why but like that was how integrated he was in my life flash forward 15 years later i've got a thousand employees that remind me of him and so it just gets me thinking about this idea of frame of reference and how impactful that is so i mean this is something hearing you and andrew yang talk about this that really matters to me is you know when you think about doing things that are anti-poverty there's a huge frame of reference component to it and if you grow up with a certain level of thinking that doesn't propel you to um believe you can do it then you won't even try because you're convinced that you'll fail and so i became obsessed with the idea of right now your zip code is the number one predictor of your future success more than your iq which is terrifying to me and so at first i thought i could attack the problem head on and just say all right look i've radically changed my life through these sets of ideas i took myself from literally scrounging my couch cushions to find enough change to put gas in my car to building a billion dollar company and nothing special about me it's just there's core ideas um that are it's the physics of being human basically and if you understand these ideas then you can take control of your life and so i tried to just give those in what i called quest university it impacted two percent of the people that encountered it changed their life forever i still get phone calls and stuff from those guys it's and it's really gratifying but for me it's like well what about the 98 and so that led me back to storytelling and getting beyond the sort of logical centers of the brain and so that was when you know while i'm building this protein bar company i'm like wow this really now has given me this why for if i can actually pull this off when i build the studio that there'll be a real strong emotional component to why i want to do it which is to make sure that nobody gets to the age of 15 without encountering a growth mindset at scale through story and so that's the the nutshell of how we've ended up here it's awesome and it's i've heard you give sort of versions of that before and it's funny because i think we have a a similarity around that i i've said the story to people before publicly i think but i don't know but but i don't say it often which is the reason i actually joined andrew yang's presidential campaign in 2018 was i was a ubi fan and i was working on i feel embarrassed saying it because it was terrible but like a pilot script um about a woman working at a think tank who was researching ubi because my thinking was can we like trojan horse can we mainstream the concept of ubi through entertainment and through a show that sort of like feeds it to you with sugar instead of like some academic policy thing and and that it was while i was doing that that i heard andrew on a podcast and was like oh this dude's also trying to mainstream ubi i went and saw him speak in person and actually like went up and was like by the way writing this like screenplay thing and then of course instead abandoned that and and when it worked on his campaign um but but that's sort of exactly what i hear you describing your your why now for telling stories as to how trojan horse these principles you've learned and these ideas around um call it how to succeed you know but but not just in the professional money sense i think it's you know fulfilling life means a lot of different things so um that's sort of what i i take from what you're trying to do is that right right on the money absolutely yeah um okay awesome i have to ask what was this screenplay that sold that traumatized you is this like a film we can all go watch and like traumatize you with please yeah please do not uh i i will tell you the oh god what was the original title no the you can look it up it's starring michael madison's called the brazen bowl uh i do not encourage people impact theory gang let's do it yeah really sweet people behind it i actually have a lot of love for the the people that made it it just didn't come out the way that i wanted it to um yeah so again because you didn't control the articles you have to control the reasons okay and then my other quick interlude question before we dive into where we are now is what was this 18-month get rich quick scheme a get-rich-quick scheme but it it seemed possible so this would have been 2003 where it was a tech company and so security software they um the guys who ended up becoming my partners but at the time were just my employers really had what felt like a super novel idea around security software and so it was like you know we're almost done we're about to hit the market it's going to be huge and then you realize that whoa a technology takes a lot longer than you think it's going to take and then on top of that getting like public adoption of something that's brand new takes a lot of time and so it always felt like it was 18 months away and so it was just like i remember just telling my wife like 18 more months 18 more months 18 more months and then at like six and a half years i was so unhappy uh and she pulled me aside and said look this is now damaging our marriage you're so unhappy this is really a problem and so i went in and quit or i should say tried to quit and so then that begins to change things and that ends up becoming a big part of why we founded quest was you know i was the first one to say look i'm profoundly unhappy and i need to make a change i want to feel alive again but when i said that to my partners they were like you know we actually feel the same and so you know what could we do to keep working together after that we decided that we were going to sell that company and start something new based on passion based on building community connection i kept saying i just want to be myself now of course we would say i want to be authentic but yeah that was like the big thing i just wanted to i had realized that the struggle was guaranteed but the success wasn't and so because we had been like we thought this was so cool we're like the question everybody needs to ask themselves is what would you do if you knew you couldn't fail and i finally realized no that's the wrong question the right question is what would you do and love every day even if you were failing because unfortunately failure is the most likely outcome especially if you're trying to do something big and so living your life where the outcome is the thing that matters like uh it's a super dangerous way to live so i was like look whatever we do next i know that i can't guarantee that i'll be successful but i am going to show up every day and fight and so the fight needs to matter the fight itself needs to matter and so that became my obsession was what would be something where the three of us overlap because they weren't they didn't necessarily have all the same feelings that i had so it's like it's a venn diagram like what's that thing for me where i can show up fight for somebody that i know and love and build a business at the same time and so that ended up being nutrition so we're like cool let's do this and because i wanted to get back into storytelling from the jump i was building essentially a media company inside of a protein bar company which back in whatever we started thinking about in like 2008 2009 and that was so weird like everybody thought we were crazy it was like very strange to be focused on social media it wasn't called social media at the time and so going really intensely on that building out you know a large media department creating all of our own content ended up working tremendously well because we just got the timing so right but it was all very counter-intuitive at the time and of course all such precursors to everything in this space now building community being authentic you know like making sure you're creating more value for at that point your audience now what would be your like active participants almost um so i'm excited to get into today and sort of that thread i want you to break down for folks now did you you exited quest you sold quest like a billion dollar exit you're one of those those folks you finally got there you control the you control the art now man exactly that's true for better or worse that is 100 true and you're now building impact theory which would you call it a media company a production studio what's what's the like what is it yeah so i would call it a web3 media company well okay amazing this is my favorite topic of all time so can you break down for us i think folks maybe don't really know the scope of impact theory like it has this non-fiction arm which is the show you do etc etc and then you're building out this this fiction studio which um looks vast okay just kind of break down what the the kind of business is here we're talking about we'll get into the web3 side of it yeah so to understand the decisions that we're making as a studio in terms of the breadth you really have to understand our goals so our goal is all about i'll call it mindset but really more accurately it's frame of reference and so your frame of reference is formed by the things you believe to be true about yourself and the world and if you get your frame of reference right it will move you towards your goals if you get your frame of reference wrong you'll either stand still or move away from your goals or you won't have goals which is honestly where most people live and so like i said at first i thought you could just tell people hey think like this act like this and it will improve your life and i realized that probably would work if they were your kids and they saw you modeling that behavior and you know they wanted to emulate you and they see what you're doing with your life and so there's a lot of emotional connective tissue there and you would start them thinking like that when they're very young so just be a part of how they view the world but when you're hitting somebody with that when they're in their mid-20s or later it was like a very small number of people could transcend the societal pressure that they were living under so to give you an idea i began honing these ideas when um the employees that i was working with on a day-to-day basis all grew up in the inner cities like hard carly hard like crazy stories um one guy held his father his stepfather while he bled to death from a gunshot wound to the head another guy hid under a car while his best friend was about eight inches from him trying to hold his intestines in because he had been shot point blank in the stomach with a shotgun another guy his sister was shot to death in the heart with an ak-47 in his front yard i mean it was just like story after story after story and i was like god i mean i used to think that i used to tell people i grew up poor and now i i realized fundamentally i did not grow up poor i have seen poverty now up close it is very different than the way that i grew up and that was like oh my god like these are incredibly smart people but they're not doing anything with their life because nobody's taught them to be optimistic about their future nobody has shown them that the human animal is designed to improve and so even if you're not educated today you can get educated and so i was like okay hold on a second i'm meeting these guys like some of them were drug dealers some of them former drug dealers because i have a belief that it doesn't matter where you start it only matters who you want to become and what you're willing to do to get there and i used to say that all the time and then here i am confronted with these extraordinary people that are going nowhere fast in their lives taking huge risks as gang members or drug dealers and i'm like would i consider employing somebody that has felony convictions and so i was like well if that thing that i say it doesn't matter where you start it only matters where you want to go if that's really true then why wouldn't i and so we put the word out that we would consider people for employment even if they had felony convictions and people lined up around the building to be interviewed it was insane how did you put the word out can i ask that tactically speaking like what was that what did that look like like on youtube yeah the kit well unfortunately that didn't really exist at that point so the kid whose sister was um shot with an ak-47 he was of the streets there's no better way to put it and so we just told him hey if you've got friends that are like you they're hardcore they want to do something great with their lives like we're growing fast we need people tell people even if they have felony convictions we'll consider them because that was like his first question was like hey most of people that i know have been to prison and so we're like yeah we'll do it it's all good and so he just started telling people and so you know it was friends cousins things like that in the beginning but then ultimately we had bloods and crips working on the same line it was bananas but there was like we weren't talking about it that wasn't like a thing it wasn't meant to be like a halfway house or anything i was like i want hardcore people i want people that that really want to go somewhere in their lives that want to improve you know that really want to do something and so we got amazing people but there was one guy to give you an example and one day i really hope that the statute of limitations ends and this guy can really tell his true story because it's insane but he um he had for sure felony convictions but was so driven and wanted to be better and originally took the job because he needed a front for the money he was making as a drug dealer but he had to be able to tell his parole officer where he's getting the money from but he ends up coming inside the companies this incredible guy and i was like look you never have to lie to me just tell me what's up and let me see if these ideas can be useful to you and so he told me the truth what was going on and you know i was like look you need to start reading like that's a big thing so he starts reading and he ends up getting in a fist fight with a friend in his neighborhood because they were like oh you've changed like you've started reading these books and i was like this is a big part of what i'm up against why the it's two percent and not 98 because there's so much societal pressure to stay the way that you are and there's that great jay-z quote you think i work this hard to stay the same and it's like but there's all this pressure for them to stay the same so i'm trying to like come up with these ideas like how do i help them and just realize that a key priority is to get these ideas to people when they're younger before those kind of pressures take hold yeah yeah and before yeah before you start to kind of like get get more set in your ways i know your whole theory is that you can always change and i get that but yeah but it gets harder as you get older it gets harder no doubt i mean there's brain science around that i wish there wasn't i wish that we were equally malleable at 98 as we are at eight but the reality is we're not we're not so this is where you have you have a podcast and a youtube series like a web series show called impact theory and and i know lisa runs women of impact and you sort of all sorts of different programming that's on that non-fiction side that it sounds like falls in that category of you'll hit two percent of people with that who just need to hear the lessons and then maybe we'll go we'll go do something about it but but majority in fact that was where i started so so we've got this funnel right so if we're trying to get people down here frame of reference really prescriptive behavior do this think like this but i know that i have to like get past the intellectual centers i have to deal with the reality of any pressures you might have grown up with so at the top we have entertainment so games movies tv okay then we have the middle layer of the funnel which is what we're known for now which is the um the non-scripted content the interview series the things were i'm bringing on people that are just presenting ideas nakedly there's no inter i won't say there's no entertainment value but it's not like a movie or a video game if i you know i'll be honest uh and then at the bottom is our university called impact theory university which is literal like coursework around think like this act like this so at the top we introduce you to ideas but in an entertaining fashion and the way that i always explain that is star wars changed my life and the way that star wars changed my life is it introduced me to yoda who's basically just quoting the dao de jing and then when i was 16 a friend of mine was like hey you should read the daodejing i read it i was like oh my god this guy loudzo sounds exactly like yoda and so that was my connection point and taoism ends up changing my life quite profoundly and so then as i get older the dominant metaphor for my life becomes the matrix and so and then obviously i'm pursuing film as a career at that point and so i'm just obsessed with how you can get these ideas across in that way so we introduce them to the ideas but then we take them deeper into that prescriptive content so that means already that we're going to have a bifurcated strategy between fiction and non-fiction uh but the the it bifurcates even more as you go but rather than you know give a running diatribe i'll leave it at that for now yeah i know that that makes total sense so it's like you get people in with sort of the the more candy-like stuff and it becomes more like vegetables as you move down the funnel you know depending on on what you like some people love course work i'm not trying to compare your coursework to vegetables and just uh you know but the funniest we use that we we talk about that all the time we don't want to be a company that's trying to make your vegetables taste better what we want to be is a company that's like we want to make compelling experiences that happen to be good for you yeah okay and this so this we haven't even gotten to the nft part of the web three part which we we fully will i promise that to everyone but i'm something i really wanted to talk to you about is storytelling how you source content because that is such a part of your background and it's something i find fascinating so when you're looking for when you're building your animated series or you know your comic or your games like what is that identifying the stories you want to tell look like and do you start with okay here's something that's entertaining and now let's figure out how to weave these lessons into it or do you start with the lessons like how does the the green lighting content process work for y'all so it always starts with the theme and i would say and look it's it's intertwined where sometimes it'll just be i'll have this image or an idea like i have this story called coyotes of the air gap which is about it's it's my version of the matrix so i tried to get the rights to the matrix we can talk about that later they rejected me and so i thought okay cool like if i were going to create something inside of a similar framework where you're inside of a computer construct what would that look like and so it's about basically like a detective agency uh that has to bounce from server to server to solve these puzzles and there's one overarching puzzle which is this kid named oliver who is very mysterious and nobody understands why he exists on this like prison server and so our uh protagonist group basically when they realize there's this one kid who's on a server all by himself like what is it about this kid and they go and get him to try to figure out like what's going on and so like that the idea of crossing the air gap if you know what an air gap is it's where computers not connected to the internet and so why would these guys think that they could ferry people across the air gap and so i was like oh that's a really interesting idea okay now i need to anchor myself around what's the theme that we're going to deal with well the whole reason that i love the matrix is because it comes down to in a computer construct it's really you're no longer beholden to the laws of physics and so it's about what you believe to be true and your ability to understand the construct well enough to manipulate it and that's really life and so once you understand the way the world works and how much of it is just belief systems i'm not saying you can violate physics because you can't but like when you have the right belief system you get into what i call the only belief that matters which is that you can learn something and get better and so now okay we've got that theme and now how do we build a story around it because that's going to influence what characters what story arcs um what are the characters weaknesses so we created this thing we call the story info sheet the story info sheet is like basically all the things that i learned in film school so you know who's the character what what is their um their wound their emotional wound what is their as they call it the want and the need and so you just go through these things so we've got the theme you've got the log line you've got what the characters emotional wound is who the antagonist is why they're the perfect kryptonite for your character based on their wound and so once we get the story info sheet nailed i'll green light that and then we go into actual like outlining and scripting wow and so that's an example obviously coming sort of straight from from your brain are you also sourcing content from other places like are you do you have or is it mostly right now like tom's brain well we're open to all of it so if there are any gifted writers out there trust me we want to hear from you um it's just we exist only to tell empowering stories and so if you have an empowering story and you're a talented writer definitely hit your boy up because we are always hungry for writers um so right now i'd say about 85 percent of what we have in the pipeline are ideas that we've developed in-house but we do have some things that are out of house and then we've also approached some different anime properties uh for the rights to their stuff so one of the ones that we're pursuing now uh is proven to be very difficult but is a story called vegabond which is about the samurai swordsman musashi and so that would be incredible vegabond is is one of my favorite if if not my favorite manga so yeah there are things that like that where it's just so spot on and the matrix was the first thing when it was considered a dormant franchise we tried to get the the rights to that how many years ago was that you tried to buy the matrix that would have been 2016. you can ignore this question and we can cut it out if you don't like it but how i'm already going to answer it i can just tell you that how rich do you have to be to be like i could buy a matrix or like how much you have to i didn't go in thinking i was going to have to buy it that's a crazy thing and so and this plants the seed for what becomes my obsession with web 3. now keep in mind in 2016 i had not heard web3 nothing i didn't know what the blockchain was nothing but i i put this whole presentation together and my thing was now it's their phrase was dormant franchise i am not making that up that is what warner brothers told me to my face when i went in to pitch so they were like look we consider the matrix to be a dormant franchise and you know very interested in what you're pitching and my whole pitch was look don't even let me mess with the canon characters i won't touch morpheus i won't touch neo trinity none of that let me just boot up another server and i'll tell stories within that framework but let me leverage the name this is like the most important story in my life i love it so much like i really think that i could do it and you don't have to give me any money i will fund the development myself entirely which i would would have been a seven figure investment on my part to give you specific numbers but i wasn't expecting them to say oh give us money just have the conversation i thought they and i gave them like every way to quarantine me i was like look i'll do it only in comics you can have the right to disapprove if you think that i'm doing something wrong or whatever like i'll run it all by you but let me spin up this you know this other server and tell these stories within it and then i'm happy to sing for my supper if it's good and you guys think whoa like these guys really know their way around story then i would put my hat in the ring to produce a reboot of the franchise and again this is 2016. so this is way before anybody's talking about rebooting the franchise and they said that they would need an obscene amount of money to even have the conversation and i was like uh-huh so now they don't know who i am and fair enough like to them i'm some guy off the street but for me it's like i just built a billion dollar company i you know have been very successful in the world of entrepreneurship and i'm willing to front all the capital myself and give you the ability to kill the project and you're still not even going to let me try and so i was like that just doesn't make sense to me and so i came back to the team and i said look mark my words as we get this off the ground we're going to become the easiest company in the world to get a license from now you have to protect your licenses it's not like as simple as oh anybody do whatever you want but we created on the back of our nft project the founders keys for the highest tier key we have something called the right to partner which is is exactly my response to the way that that exchange with the matrix went where i want to flip it instead of having to pay 500 000 to have the conversation we want the person doing that to collect the first five hundred thousand dollars free and clear without us making a dime and so and that was like that was sort of all the stuff i was thinking about before web 3 came along and then as nfts happened i was like oh my god this is the technology that lets you do all of this okay this is a perfect segue let's let's get into the nft component this because there's i think there's a couple layers here there's this impact theory nft like the the legendary the keys which we need to talk about and then it sounds like there's also nfts that you'll be issuing or that you issue as part of content that that comes out and i think those are somewhat separate categories that i'm sure interconnected is that the right framing of this okay let's start then with the the impact theory keys break that down for folks a little bit you've got legendary heroic relentless when did those kind of come out in the journey of impact theory and what are they okay so when we founded the company in 2016 i said to the team our job is to stay alive long enough meaning to stay in business long enough to find our moment of disruption i could not have told you that that was going to be nfts but of course that's what it ends up becoming now a year before we founded i actually met a guy who's still in the nft space and he pulled me aside and he's like yo you have to see this thing i call v adams and i was like oh wow man this looks amazing i was like i remember saying to him that's gonna change my business forever and he was like yeah it's the future and then i promptly forgot about it because it just wasn't ready right there was i mean in 2015 this would have been so it was like uh i didn't know what the blockchain was and no one was using it in any sort of appreciable way now of course i wish i hadn't ignored it because oh my god it'd be a lot farther along than i am now but as soon as i heard in what early 2020 so this would have been february or january of 2020 i heard the letters nft put together for the first time when i looked at it i was like oh my god this is that v adams thing i was like this actually ended up happening so because i had already thought through it the second i saw it i was like we're in the technology's here it's ready and so 72 hours later my wife and i who's my co-founder at impact theory we'd allocated millions of dollars in development and we're like we're pivoting the company immediately we are now full on in this this is that moment of disruption that we were looking for and the only way to take advantage of the moment of disruption is to move faster than the incumbents so we were like we have to move fast because i know that the other players you know whether it's disney or riot games or whoever they're gonna end up getting on board with this eventually and we need to move fast and so we just went all in and so that's when we started thinking okay we've got this company we've got this you know tri-layer approach how do we bring everything together because to me the core idea and so this is where getting into your the interview you did with andrew i have the chills just thinking about what this is going to mean so let's put all this in context and if i get too far afield bring me back to the the keys but i think this will be more interesting for the audience so covet happens i'm already wealthy i don't have to worry but ah i worry about a lot of other people for whom i fear this is going to be devastating and i have an existential crisis by proxy and really at the beginning of the pandemic i was really i was really afraid and i thought oh my god this is gonna this is gonna mess people up and i didn't have a sense of like uh printing money or anything like that so i'm just thinking yo we're about to get hit by a meteorite in the economy and this is going to be devastating and already we're getting the polarization because of the discrepancies in wealth so i'm like all right i have to do something i start trying to interview like every financial thinker that i had access to because of the show and none of them could like bring it down to what the average person should do right now today and so i really was like getting super uneasy about where this goes and i start really researching ray dalio and his ideas around the principles for dealing with the changing world order i have andrew yang on the show and i'm just like man where does all this go and the more i look at how history goes through the cycle that we're in right now and you end up having war revolution bloodshed and i'm just like i can really feel less and forgive me if swearing it's not allowed i can really feel this going to like a super gnarly place and i was just like man what's going to be the bloodless way out of this and then totally separate nfts come along i'm getting super hyped about it and as i learn about the technology i start trying to predict the future because you know um ralph paul who said if you want to be a macro investor you have to live in the future and look back at the past and say how did we get here and so i thought oh that really works in technology as well so i was like let me step into the future now that i understand web3 technology look back at the past and say how did we get here and so as i start to understand the tech i'm like wait a second because of the ownership component of this if legislation doesn't mess everything up this has a chance of bringing back a thriving middle class so i was like oh my god like not only does this give me the moment of disruption but it also answers this existential dread by proxy that i've been having for you know the and if i'm honest it's people that i know and love right so i'm just thinking like whoa there's got to be something and so this brings them together so now i've got storytelling which is just my natural passion i've got the understanding of where the technology is going which has me excited as a storyteller because i'm like this is going to be a whole new thing and then on top of that i've got the technology also is the only thing that i know of that when i run the thought experiment i think this could bring back a thriving middle class so now i'm like amazing business opportunity amazing creative opportunity an amazing opportunity for the world and so i'm like yeah we gotta we gotta go hard on this so um so bringing it back to the keys so i'm like all right the goal with the keys is to put 90 percent of the economic value the long tail economic value in the hands of my community and i thought this is going to be a psychological breaking point for most old companies they won't be able to do that like they're just too wired to try to get everything up front and so i thought okay this is really interesting if we can pull this off what i want to do is create an umbrella or a foundation however you want to think about it but a foundation upon which all of my future endeavors because to me you know the idea of web 3 is forever whatever name it ends up going by it's this idea of having ownership and a deeper level of engagement okay so everything is going to be built on that so how do we do that in a way where anybody that believes in us now and takes that bet is is going to be able to get that value in an ongoing fashion forever and so i didn't want to tie it to a single ip because even as big as um fantasia may have been back in the day or steamboat willie i would rather have a piece of uh frozen you know what i mean so it's like but there's no way 80 years ago they could have predicted that that was going to be a thing and so i just thought okay can we create something that we can then have so that the key holders are able to get value on everything that we do moving forward and so look obviously there's caveats there'll be things we do with partners and things like that but on on a rough basis that everything that we do moving forward and this is of course why we call them the keys because they unlock everything in the future of impact theory it's amazing there's so much there can you break down in kind of a specific terms as we can get like how does that how does it do that how do these keys give you the access to future value to your future frozen what does that look like uh so as of right now today there's seven categories of um access for lack of a better word it could be free access it could be um early access could be exclusive access could be direct access to me it could be partner perks discounts so there's all these different ways and so if you have the legendary key that's the easiest one to talk about so if you have a legendary key which is our highest tier um then every like prime drop of nfts that we do so like our first one was merry mods then you get one of those for free so uh as we do you know our future drops like avatar which is our upcoming project um you would get things that get all kinds of things for free there but there like every time that we do that we have another secret project coming up they will get a free drop from that and so there's and that's like this is the stuff that we're doing in the first 12 months right so the keys came out like four and a half months ago so it's like when i think about what we're doing in a year or five years or 10 years it's like it's crazy so the the seven categories of access are what exist today but we're always looking for ways to add value to our key holders everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axiomfinity decentraland eluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse unstoppable domains is the number one provider of nft domains with domains ending in crypto dot x or dot nft unstoppable domains that lets you replace your long complex wallet address with a human readable address using unstoppable you can verify the ownership over your nfts log into web3 apps and join tens of thousands of people using them as their twitter usernames with unstoppable domains you can have all of your crypto addresses registered to one single domain so it doesn't matter where crypto payments are coming from or where they're going by registering all of your crypto addresses to your unstoppable domain all of that is taken care of in the back end better yet with unsolvable domains you don't have to worry about gas costs or renewal fees because you own it buy your domain and you can show it off as your new twitter username so you can get your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com you've given an analogy in a number of other interviews it's not even an analogy you've painted a picture and i think it's great and so for for folks who haven't maybe heard it uh i think it's your like secret door um you're like sort of secret story of as you talk about you put your head into the future and then look back and how do we get there i think that's a really good future vision and helps explain why somebody would want a legendary key or any of these other keys um tell that that sort of thing right so i i am obsessed with this and this will explain why we're doing um code name project avatar it's not the real name of the project it's just what we tell people until we announce it but so like you said i'm in the future and i'm looking back and i'm saying okay what's going to be possible knowing the fundamentals of what i know and carly i and maybe i'm just missing it so forgive me if if i'm um if somebody else is talking about this and i just don't know but people aren't talking about the thing that to me makes web3 utterly captivating as a builder as an entrepreneur as a storyteller for sure is that now based on what you have in your wallet i can customize an experience to you so that if you so i started thinking about it in the real world and so i was like all right guys i know the following is going to be true you go to a shopping mall it's not true today but it's going to be true although you could do in fact everything i'm about to say you could do you just have to use your phone but in the future it will be with your ar glasses you go to a mall and i put on the mall a qr code you look at it your glasses detect qr code boom it loads an experience invisible all of a sudden on the floor you see like a dotted line and an arrow and it it's directing you to go somewhere you come around the corner and there is a a mech from our story so we so many stories that i do end up having mechs in them but i did a story a comic book called neon future with steve aoki and in it there's a mac and so let's say that that mech is there you come around the corner and boom there it is and it's holding in his hand a quest bar a virtual one obviously only you see it your friend doesn't see it because he doesn't have a founder's key in his wallet so this is tailored just to you you go up you grab that bar and then you take it to a gnc or whatever and get a real quest bar in real life right that's going to happen then we started thinking okay if that's the kind of thing that's going to happen in the real world what's going to happen in the metaverse as we march towards that and i don't typically use the word metaverse because i think that triggers some people something that's like nine to ten years away but things that we can do right now today is you could be walking in decentraland sandbox or our upcoming avatar uh space and a door appears to you because let's say you have one of our poe apps and it's targeted specifically to people that let's say have a legendary key and a certain po app and uh you know have completed a challenge in impact theory university right and so they've got all those things which we will of course give them nfts that are in their wallet i detect that it's there and a door appears that you see but your friend is like what door what are you talking about you're like no there's a door right here you don't see the door and then you open that door and you go inside and now you can have a completely customized experience the only people that have that in that case you know trifecta of things in their wallet now get this customized experience and so like when i think about hires that we have to make and things that we're going to be building it's like these experiential people that are creating these incredible experiences and if those experiences have emotional resonance which is the key right now uh and is that one of the things that's really i think it's the future and i'm sure a lot of people are working on it but right now that's some of the energy that's missing from the part of the phase that we're in nfts right now which is largely a trading mechanism it's you know people are treating it like an investment vehicle and look that's amazing and it's brought all the money and infrastructure and excitement and all of that and i'm standing on the shoulders of those giants i'm deeply grateful i just know that if this ends up feeling like d fire the stock market then it will become the stock market it won't become you know the the entertainment portion that i'm interested in that i think will bring the long lasting emotional engagement that i want for this space so that ability to create those kind of highly customized experiences and then what we're trying to be really thoughtful about is i think web3 has a it's a mind virus in the best and worst way possible and if we're not careful as an industry we're going to see a mental health crisis the likes of which we have never seen before that started with web 2 i think is being exacerbated by web3 it doesn't have to be that but the way that we think about it is if you're winning at our gamification and impact theory you should be winning in real life and so we're creating something that actually spans the real world and the virtual world and so we're effectively creating i should probably stop talking about this until we actually launch it but i can't help but stop we're creating a crm that allows us to intake all this um interactive points things that people tell us that matter to them and then are able to reward them in the game that we're creating in the game world i should say because it's not like a video game it's a it's a game world it's an experience that's tied to again both the real world and the things you do in the virtual world and so like that's how we are thinking about where this all goes in the future but the key to web 3 is i didn't want a binary like okay we're going to sell the keys and then we're going to go dormant for three to five years as we build out a game i wanted something where it's like hey every you know four to six months we're doing like a major release and we're just stacking these bricks and everything is modular right so first the world is this big and then it'll be this big and then it'll be this big and it'll have you know this ip in the beginning but then it has this and this and this and so we're trying to make sure that we build this virtual hub that is intercompatible with where i think everything is going so we're betting on unreal engine just because i don't want to create the next sandbox or end another thing that's fragmented i want to create something where it's like there are already an insane number of creators like to give you an idea and then i'll take a breath i've got like six questions embedded and everything you just said finish your thought and i'll start once once we announced to our community that we were building the avatar experience inside of unreal engine they started creating things to like show what it could be what their predictions were and that obviously hints at what we're going to be able to do in the future because there are so many people that know how to create these experiences and so that brings you to the whole web 3 level of engagement anyway i just get super hyphy when i think about where this is going and look you and i are recording this in sort of a bear market and people are not like feeling great but if you're in the tech side and you're talking to other builders carly like they they're they're pot committed this stuff is getting built yeah bear market bull market doesn't matter right we might lose more than we otherwise would if it were in a bull market but like the number of people that are building incredible things so yeah it's going to be rad but what everybody has to think about is i hope not not this right we don't want isolationism like how do we build on a foundation that's as open as possible i get nothing for recommending unreal engine i'm not tied to them associated with them in any way shape or form but i'm a huge believer that right now today and this could change but right now today that is the platform that makes the most sense to build on because it's the most like what will happen is we'll all create we'll create like this archipelago where it's like these little islands but someone even if i have to push on this on my own side is going to create the tcp ip of video games and then it's like look not everything will be able to port over it's only going to be certain things it'll be able to connect because of balancing and things like that but like as we create these what i call game like experiences where i don't have to balance weapons or anything like that you really could like create a way where with some coordination where people could teleport from one space to the other so anyway that's how we're approaching it a lot there i have several questions i would like to follow up with but i i'll say i think you and i i i i relate to i think some of your sensibilities i love the story thing you know i'm more of like a words story movie person than i am like sort of art or even more music to some extent than like your kind of traditional art world so like i've talked on the show i've gotten excited by like the the julian assange pack drop which was like words like or or there was an epo heroes drop where you could type in words and then you know your your kind of a character would come to life out of that so what to me is most exciting is like when i'm entering content worlds right when i'm going places and my favorite movies or stories are being told like that's gonna get me into the central end of the sandbox more so than um then maybe even the gaming side to some extent um and so i love you painting this vic this kind of vision of um of where this could be because i do think that gets lost sometimes in the day-to-day of just trading jpegs which is so not the bigger picture the bigger context here uh my first sort of question is you know how far out are we do you think from your follow the mecca and get your quest bar thing i know you're saying technically we could do it now with an iphone are you tracking really closely like ar development to to understand when that's going to be very much so yeah so that particular example you really could do today the reason that we're not actively pursuing phone-based vr is that it feels gimmicky people aren't going to do it consistently so it's a fun way to get show people the potential of this stuff and it's definitely getting better and yes we are constantly taking meetings with ar and vr studios um and there's some really cool stuff happening but it's still like bang for buck isn't quite there yet and so we're focused more on a browser-based experience which i think has more bang for the buck but ar glasses are going to be beholden to the tech companies that are creating them and so i'm going to guess realistically ar is probably four years out from things where you're like you're having that first beginning of the app store feeling uh so first you'll have the tech it won't quite be there it'll be cool it'll be like the iphone when it first came out but there's no like deep app store then you'll start getting the app store people start creating experiences then enough people will be developing for it the cost will come down and then it will get interesting and if i had to guess and it's like yes but if i had to guess you're probably about four years away from that okay okay now i want to jump to the piece you said about the crm and again you can stop me because i know you're like we're not fully built out i shouldn't be talking about this at all but just to to see if i understand this it sounds like what you're describing is you have this this massive community and and then you have a sort of subset of that community that are token holders and you're building out the crm where you can understand them better map things like oh they care about this aspect of their mental health or they have that goal for their life or i don't know if that's exactly describing but things along those lines that you can then map back to maybe like their eth address for example and now you can create gamification programs etc where you're rewarding them if they're logged into headspace and doing a meditation that you can reward their eth address is that what you're talking about when you describe the crm yep so if you take this to its natural conclusion so we're already setting up meetings with like wearables companies and things like that so we can pull data so we can see like hey uh are you doing your meditation you told us that matters to you right you set a goal and so now we can see are you actually living up to that and if you are then we can give you experience points that then level you up inside of the avatar experience which then get you access to um you know nfts for uh free so let's say that at level five you get a free nft so it's things like that um but that's that's i think a much sort of farther in the future that's gonna take years to develop to convince the companies to open apis and things like that but the stuff that's going to happen near term i think is even more exciting and i will not reveal what we're doing but i will say that people show affinity for certain things an easy way to say it would be all right so i'm a um a holder of board api club right so let's say all right your board api club holder boom we detect that and now you can access board ape land inside of the avatar project but nobody else can or there's a specific uh mini challenge for board ape holders that we can do and so being able to and we have far more sophisticated and interesting things planned i'm just not going to reveal them yet but if you show me through your wallet that you have an affinity for something then i can build an experience for that and so we are partnering with some cool entities that will take time but we're partnering with some cool um things that will we'll be building uh some neat experiences around so tell folks what the avatar project is you've mentioned it a couple times i know it's it's big in terms of what you have upcoming yeah so originally it started as we knew that the keys weren't a cool pfp picture and so part of the road map was we're going to give you an avatar for your key and then the more i learned about the technology the more i started thinking about what we needed to do as a company to bring that vision into uh a modularized stair-step function that would take us to being able to create a aaa game seven years from now but didn't require me to you know raise 250 million dollars to try and build out a triple a game now and as i started thinking about the avatar project was the perfect way into that because you know one of the cool things about the moment of in time that we're in is that we're all going to be able to reinvent ourselves as we step into the digital world and look nft people already know that but nft people are the world's smallest subset of humanity and as we think about you know expanding this and inviting more web two people to the web three party it's when i went to so when i was in high school i wanted to be a stand-up comic when i got to college i was like i'm in a new city i don't know anybody i don't have to keep making fun of myself i can be whoever i want and who do i want to be and that moment was so profound and that's what the virtual world gives people a chance to do peter diamandis who i'm sure some of your audience will have heard of but not everybody really extraordinary guy built a company called um xprize and has been instrumental in like helping launch the space flight industry just really really an extraordinary thinker and he said the way that the internet has functioned we have unintentionally created this like permanent record that when you were you know 50 years ago if things just went south for you in one city you could move to another city and have a clean slate and so the virtual world in many ways gives us that opportunity to try on different identities to um just be playful and to have that ready player one moment where you can create a space that you decorate in whatever way you want with things that you have an affinity for to show up however you want looking like yourself looking like your aspirational self looking like a dragon whatever like that moment is so cool and so avatar is meant to give people that ability to come in and to build yourself piece by piece into whoever you want to be and to have this really fun game like level up mechanic where you can level up based on things you do in the real world based on things you're doing in the in-game world and by doing that hopefully gamify important things in your life as well as purely entertaining things oh that's cool it it even just the the idea of like a forcing function to kind of pause in your life for a second and take that moment to say like am i the person i want to be are there what are the aspects of me that i i would like to maybe work on like we most of us just move through the world not in any way actively thinking about the person we are becoming because we are still becoming somebody at every moment even once you're an adult like this becomes this really interesting way to reflect on that in real life as you're reflecting on who you're going to become in the digital world no doubt and if if we can make this as fun as we think we can that's it's a game like you're in you're playing you're having a good time and you know again going back to that idea our goal isn't to make your vegetables taste better or to hide them in food our goal is to make something that's truly entertaining that many people will engage with it just for the entertainment factor and oh by the way it happens to be good for you it's introducing these you know empowering ideas and so the lore of the world is that it's you versus you and you are both the antagonist and the protagonist and so and i mean such is real life and so if we can make that fun um then i think we've got something really special and then you know like i said this is all modularized so it just builds out and we've got these you know very expansive plans but we have ways to to make it a stair-step thing so we are you know not going dormant for two years while we'll build something out very cool okay so that gives i think a little bit of a picture and even more context into the the key side of uh of impact theory and it it just gets you the access to this whole ecosystem and that's being built you said legendary all these these key holders have a certain amount of um access now to this avatar program on the other side so you you did something like mary mods for example was your first piece of programming i think that really came out and there was a whole nft collection around mary mods i i'll ask you about kind of merry odds but my first question which is maybe a a weird way to start out but i heard you in another interview you obviously loved the matrix you talked about how like very early moment you're in the theater at the matrix and there's like this crazy cool moment in the beginning of the movie and like if you could have you would have like left the theater and like got and bought that moment as an nft and it got me thinking my moment would be in legally blonde l woods as whatever she walks right she's like i'll show you how valuable ella woods could be and that would be the moment in cinema that i would buy is like that el woods moment and it was getting me thinking you have sports cards you you have these collectibles around sports but there's never been like i guess you have action figures but like you don't have like collectible moments in the same way exactly around film why not and does that now change with nfts for some reason where we now want to have these collectible moments if it doesn't i will be horrified but in the early in the early days of me seeing the nft thing and and being able to quickly see where this goes um i have connections to some very um successful people in hollywood and i got them on a call and i said look i hope you guys do this because you're the right people to do it cause you have access to a lot more people than i do uh but if you don't trust me someone is going to you need to build moments for all of the and of course i was like look at nba top shot look at how they're doing this and build these moments and if there there are i don't know 25 moments in cinema history that that are so indelibly a part of like who i am that i would desperately want to collect those yeah and so i i think it is an inevitability that companies will begin doing this um it will take some organization now the the industry that i pursued most aggressively is the anime industry so i've um anybody that's followed me for any length of time understands my obsession uh with anime and they're they're going to do it but there's so much coordination with who owns the rights and like do you have to get actors permission and you know you've got um the oh god what's it called when when somebody's deceased their a state whatever the the name is they're a state thank you yes so we have to go and like convince the estate to let you do it so i don't know how many rights issues there's gonna be uh and that could be the thing that ends up tanking this as an idea because the anime industry is being very cautious and very slow for that reason um but i it just seems self-evident that this will even the most die-hard opponents to nfts 10 years from now will take it to self-evident that they need an nft strategy it's one of those things we have to go through this very awkward uh time right now but yeah on the other side it is a guarantee how would you rank or do you have thoughts on how some of these legacy institutions are doing i know you saw this moment of disruption we're like this is you know this is when we can beat the disneys in some capacity right how would you say you think the disney's the wbs or the warner brothers whatever are doing right now yeah like disney i wish they were doing worse like they're actually moving pretty significantly behind the scenes like guys come on uh no i'm actually impressed and so you know they got a lot of criticism for what they did with vv yeah because people were like oh they could have done it better they needed to try something yeah and so you know i'm very impressed that they moved as early as they did i'm very impressed that they're making hires you know for the metaverse i think the head of the metaverse or something is the title that they're looking for mike white i think was his name they just hired um oh i didn't know that they had made the higher so they've made it higher and i'll give you something else because john rogers swept out on the podcast worked at disney for many many years at a pretty senior level and he always keeps me abreast on sort of his analysis of what's going on so i think it was a guy named mike white they hired us this like head of metaverse hire who reports into um basically their head of content distribution so john's analysis was like they're putting somebody really senior on this who is sitting sort of across everything so they're they're taking it quite seriously disney i think maybe even more so than any of the other companies but um leading the way so i i think that they will adopt it faster than we think it's gaming is where the real failure is happening and so there it's like a civil war so you can see the companies want to do it but the player base is really protective and i actually understand where they're coming from but it's i think what i would love to see is instead of their stance being don't do it being hey this is amazing we get to own it but we want to do it in a way that's protective of mental health that's protective of the game experience so that this does and just become you know something where it's about grinding to own the nfts you can sell uh like i get why they want to make sure that the game is fun in and of itself um but i would love to see and and it will happen but i would love to see that leadership voice start to come out instead of right now where it's just like if you do this like we're going to burn this place to the ground and so that i don't think acknowledges that owning something is better than not but there right now they're making the assumption that the only way to own is to destroy the the integrity of the game experience and i don't think that that's true i think it could i think that people could do it poorly i don't think they have to i know a couple i know one i guess again through through john my my mole to all these companies um it was big into gaming have made some really senior metaverse hires and they just aren't you know like can't publicly say it i don't even think it's on the person's linkedin like they just have to like stealth mode do this because they're so afraid of the backlash that's coming but they are you know i think in private building this stuff um what do you think are your where do you see your advantages lying i understand you're like disney's moving faster than we want but you were like moment of disruption this is our moment uh what are what are the advantages you feel like you all have well one we from uh a web 2 company we already had a big following and so [Music] transitioning from audience to community that's like a big thing for us and so we're going really hard one that for us internally to learn the different rhythms because they are very different that's a big win so we came into this you know 8 million strong and so being able to launch an nft project being able to get people to pay attention to what we're doing that's hugely important to us not having the sort of drag of like a gaming company where they have to first fight the civil war and then uh you know be able to move forward we can do everything out in the open plant our flag be a voice in the space um that's been hugely helpful and then we're totally committed so we're not uh you know web 2 company doing web 3 things on the side we are a former webcum web 2 company that pivoted entirely to web3 and so i think that gives us a lot more momentum and because of that we've been able to hire away from some of these big companies um some pretty key players from some very large companies and so we'll be making some more announcements around some of our key hires here shortly um but yeah that's been really helpful and then honestly the thing that i think that we have going for us the most is the today more and more people are waking up do they want to work for a company that has a mission and the fact that we only make empowering content is how we've been able to get just obscenely talented people that we have no right to have we literally hired a guy and i said to him i know that were it not for what we stand for i would never be able to hire you uh so i am extremely grateful uh because yeah these are you know we're we're now able to be the employer of choice for people that could work anywhere and anybody that's been an entrepreneur for you know any amount of time comes to one immutable truth and you are only as good as your team and if you can't attract high caliber talent you're dead in the water what does it mean and maybe like it's helpful to explain this in like in terms of how it lives in the org charter like the this distinction between we're not just a web 2 company that's starting to integrate some web 3 but like we're all web 3 we've fully moved from web 2 to a web 3 company like what does that mean in terms of like the way meetings are run like you know like with the conversations help spell that out yeah so the best and worst thing about running a company is people so they they are the only thing you have and they're all individual people with individual hopes and dreams pulling in slightly different directions and so aligning everybody is very very difficult and so if you are a web 2 company but you believe in this web 3 thing and you're kind of pushing on both it's like you will end up getting a divided company versus getting everybody together and saying hey i want to walk you through my vision for the future i want to walk you through why i think this is important you talk about things like bringing back a thriving middle class you talk about why this is the best way to achieve the mission of the company which people came on board for that and if it's real and that's actually true and that's why you're doing it everybody can see it in the movement and the motion and the way things are working that's like whoa we're really able to do something we weren't able to do before now you get buy-in when you get buy-in you get momentum and so that's really the important thing for lisa and i was we needed to get everyone in the company to understand what this is why it matters and then how to do it well and if it was part of the company because it's crazy like we only have what 46 employees and so it's like even at 46 employees like you already feel like the man you got to like keep everybody focused bring everybody back get them laser targeted on what we're doing and so as you get bigger and you've got you know jesus what does disney have hundreds of thousands of employees and so when you have 17 of them working on web 3 it's like it just gets bogged down right so they're making the right moves to make it important but they have layers of bureaucracy to deal with that we don't and so yeah getting everybody on the same page is critically important and you can look at like how microsoft had a hard time with the internet and then mobile it's like just getting your whole company to to um have a divided focus is tough you need to get everybody pointed in the same direction how do you think about distribution this is something i'm always fascinated with with content and nfts disney obviously hit with a content creation creators that got so big they own the distribution and now they can have disney plus what does that look like for you do you think about you have a web series on youtube are you trying to get things on netflix like does nft's web 3 change that are we all just going to watch in the metaverse how have you thought about the distribution piece of your business yeah so this will change over time but right now so merry mods for instance we are pitching that to traditional hollywood and if we could end up on netflix i would be a very happy camper so that is you know us acknowledging so i always tell people don't deal with the world the way you wish it were deal with the world the way it actually is and as of right now today being on netflix or disney plus i mean that's you're gonna get a hundred thousand more times more eyeballs than you would get if you were just doing it yourself so yeah i think that nfts are a key part of the launch strategy they're a key part of how you get that groundswell of attention and promotion but ultimately we're trying to go mainstream and right now today mainstream is netflix disney plus hulu uh amazon like those are the you know your big players and so that's ultimately where we want to be right now today now do we see that changing in the future certainly could so we'll be watching very closely you know if somebody launches um like a decentralized version of a netflix although i actually have mixed feelings about decentralization which may get this episode burned to the ground in the comments i do too i've said that a little bit so hopefully my audience they haven't burned me yet so nice so yeah i think that some projects will benefit from decentralization and amazing things will be born of that but i don't think every project will be decentralized and i don't think that they will benefit if they could i think some projects just will make more sense with a centralized thing like when i think of you'll you won't be able to decentralize apple like that just that's tough so but there are things like wikipedia which are just these incredible juggernauts so you will get things like that that require decentralization certainly are made better by it but some things won't be and i think storytelling is one that does not benefit from decentralization yeah i i agree i talk about this and i ask a lot of people about it about how they think about balancing centralization and decentralization uh poopy the co-founder of doodles and i talked about it a bunch cause he like went into that being like i'm gonna be totally decentralized and then was like oh well the reality is like we need a certain level of creative vision here and uh you know and they've done a good job of they have a doodle bank like they involve the community as much as they can but i think yeah there's incredible ways there's a new balance decentralized there are incredible ways like we're building out tools we're even working on a school to help people in our community learn to create within unreal engine but at the end of the day like you said there needs to be creative vision you need to create something cohesive there will be elements of the story that we would love for people to create fan fiction or to create uh like if if a fan fiction author gets upvoted enough by our community we can give them a branch of something like go do your thing oh this was a question i was going to ask i'm glad you just said that have you heard of story verse no oh my gosh okay this is a connection that i'm going to make justin uh waldron who founded zynga back when he was 19 and of course mafia wars and and the whole thing he's working on a web three they've launched now i mean they're launching in stages i think but but basically that where it's a it's a they're building i think with unity right and it's again they've got a game engine underpinning it so that members of communities can upload their nft characters create stories with them using this sort of very friendly game engine thing and he's partnering with the projects so that the rest of the community can upvote certain stories and it's like on okay you guys are gonna talk because you've talked about canon and having the the community vote about what gets to be canon and this is literally he's trying to build the tooling exactly for that um i love it so so yeah very cool and obviously um a good person to bet on in general in life he's super super sharp so this thread of and ties into this decentralization because there's there's there's also a difference between decentralization and a certain level of like distribution of benefits and gains right like you can be a sort of you can be sort of centralized and be the the core creative leader and visionary for impact theory but try and distribute the benefits of impact theory which is what you're doing with your your key program and your nft program um and is that where you see this resurgence in the middle class could potentially come in now if you're somebody who's passionate about tattoos and you can buy nfts for your favorite tattoo artists that are worth something in the future that's not something goldman that's something you as an individual can probably do better than goldman sachs like is that if you're a big believer in tom bill you and the stories you're telling and you have these community members they can now reap the benefits and the value you can create for them is that the story you see playing out for for this middle class resurgence yeah so i'll tell two examples of how i think this can play out so you've got something like the keys right where you buy the keys and i'm over here you know pouring blood sweat tears and capital into making sure that those things get value you have to be so careful with the words you use because i cannot guarantee that they will go up in value but that we're delivering value over time and you're going to get a lot of people doing that because it aligns the selfish desires of the company and the community and that's what we want right you want to be in a position where the more selfish we are as a company the better it is for them and the more selfish they are as a community the better it is for us and so we're truly aligned and that gives people the ability to you know to go out and say oh man i love what they're building here i love this story i love this artist whatever you get a piece of that and now as they build their career your you own something that hopefully the value reflects their ongoing increase in value as an entity as a person as an artist so that alone is going to be huge then you've got something like a musician where let's say that i am i can't make music but i know good music when i see it and the example i always say is when i was a kid i was growing up like an hour away from a town called aberdeen washington now there was a little band born out of aberdeen washington called nirvana and had i found them when they were a small band in aberdeen washington and they had an nft project and i could bet on them and then my thing is i'm a maven i'm an influencer right so people pay attention to me because i have good musical taste i can't make the music but i can help build the awareness and attention around this span and so now because i have one of their nfts as i push and promote and get people to pay attention whether i have a show on spotify or a show on uh youtube and i just talk about who's that next hot upcoming artist just as a random person but i can go find them get their nft and be like yo i'm a tastemaker these guys are incredible now i'm putting them on and i help the band and because of that ownership i'll still help myself and you're gonna get like all these niche audiences and i think niche is the future we're working on a project called renders which is anime focus it's an anime focused um nft marketplace that is on layer two so that we can actually make things accessible because right now it's like everything's expensive and when i'm looking at nftr like yo i don't know if i can afford that that's where i know there are a lot of people out there like whoa i really like this artist yeah like so we i have this whole diatribe on what happened to the western comic market super thumbnail sketch the western comic market there is a single title in japan called demon slayer that outsells the entire western comic market combined batman superman wonder woman x-men iron man all of it teenage mutant ninja turtles the whole thing all put together is outsold by a single japanese title now there's a whole host of reasons that that happened but one of them is that the western comic market stopped aiming at kids whoops so now you don't have any new people coming into the ecosystem and so i'm like kids cannot afford a fifteen hundred dollar drop right so i'm like somebody needs to make some of this accessible and so like focusing on that making things more accessible so that more people can get in this stuff so uh making it more accessible some more people can get into this stuff i'm sure we have the local recording of whatever you just said but that that was sort of the thrust was like how do you target kids for with comics in the red restaurant okay uh we're we're almost at time here so i think building off of this is sort of maybe i'd love to hear your kind of closing philosophies and call it still in this thread of like different versions of decentralization that can exist and and in this theme of sort of going into these very niche communities um i'm fascinated by these sort of macro dynamics that play in like the fall of institutions and the rise of the individuals and i've heard you will you know sort of mention this or allude to this in the in the past and i think about it all the time and now the world thinks about it all the time i think but i've been thinking about it for a while which is like your joe rogans and and people now realize how big his audience was but i think like three years ago i was listening to people like sam harris and people had no idea how big i think his audience was relative to cnn um but there's still this dynamic and this sounds like i'm saying it's a bad thing and i don't know that necessarily is right where there's so you've got this fall of institutions but you also still they still have the credibility if you go on wikipedia and at the bottom the source is cnn you're going to trust that in a way that if it says the sources like the joe rogan podcast even if you love to rogan like that doesn't feel like that has the same credibility do you have any broad philosophical thoughts about this i mean it's true for you too right you have this huge audience you get you know way more people watch you than watch you know cable tv um about where the end of this sort of plays out um again not not a hard question here more like a general philosophical would love to get your thoughts on this sort of fall of institutions rise of individual creators and where that kind of ends in all this okay so that that to me is a very big and somewhat scary it has scary implications i think that the rise of the individual in the abstract is like the greatest thing of all time and i have obviously benefited profoundly from this i worry though that what we're witnessing is a deep fragmentation that leads to division that in the late part of the macro debt cycles as ray dalio talks about them we're in stage five and so anybody that's read principles for dealing with the changing world order uh radelio outlines that civilizations go in these six phase things and and it just they constantly rotate through and phase six is essentially bloody um implosion right and we're in five six is bloody implosion and not only are we in five are we mid five because we're not beginning at five we're either mid or late five because of all the like money printing and the populist rise of populism in the u.s and so and the growing tensions between the us and china and as you and i are recording this there's a war going on between russia and the ukraine which some people think is giving cover to china to consider an invasion of taiwan certainly to test the waters to see how the west and the us react and so it's like there's real implications to being divided and so even though i really believe in the rise of the individual and i am in no way shape or form interested in going back to you know the the organizations i really really really think a lot about how do we bring people together how do we find a way to connect how do we find a way not to get isolated into our bubbles like the first time i encountered the the ferocity of the gaming community's hatred of nfts i was like whoa like i didn't even know what was happening and like everyone i listened to was like nfts baby nfts like i'm going to change the world like this is amazing and then i was kicked in the face by what was happening in gaming and i was like whoa i did not see it coming and so i was like man like i really try not to get into a bubble and yet here i am having no idea that this is like just despised by the gaming community so anyway look as as we get these deeper and deeper like fragmentations because even i so i have a fairly robust social following but it represents like this really narrow band of human humanity that happens to respond to my style right and so when you get i mean how many people are there there's so many people now that have millions of followers it's crazy so anyway i think that it is incumbent upon all of us to look for ways to come together to reconnect to feel love for each other i don't think it is beyond our ability to do that but i do not think it will happen by accident and so i think people need to be very very very thoughtful that the um the same algorithms and uh loosening of the institutional grips that have brought us to this amazing place can also create some pathological outcomes and we need to be super thoughtful about how we move forward uh i need to catch up on the ray dalio stuff oh yeah i it the book is so intense carly i for a long time i couldn't read it in the mornings it just set my day off on such a funny place i had the reverse with andrew yang's book the reason i joined his campaign after i heard i heard him whatever on a podcast and sam harris's podcast whatever and then got his book and i did the reverse which is if i would read it at night i would get so worked up i couldn't fall asleep so i could only read it in the morning that was the war on normal people which also is a little doomsday and spells out i think you know kind of similar uh you know decay of of things that end poorly um okay well this was amazing thank you so much for joining me you know i don't know if any final thoughts things we didn't get to touch on uh about impact theory the nft programs you've got 10 trillion things going on and coming up so we'll have to have you back on at some point to give us the the update but uh doing the heartbeat but no man this is wonderful nothing else that uh i need to say cool well thank you then we'll close this out and and if this was a chaotic recording in the beginning to everyone we uh we had to switch recording platforms here it's been a little bit of a we're talking about the metaverse while we can't get we can't get like zoomed to work so um but uh it was it was a total pleasure tom thanks a lot was
