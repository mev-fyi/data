hey bankless nation welcome to another episode of state of the nation this is a weekly episode where we take you through something big that is happening in crypto i am really excited about this episode i have so many questions for our guests why don't you tee it up for us david yeah we got dc investor who i tweeted out a while ago uh he thought nfts were cool before you did uh and then he corrected me and said well there were people who thought nfcs that were cool before i did but there's always someone who who's earlier than all of us but dc was earlier than me he was earlier than ryan here into the world of nfts and was buying nfts because he thought they were cool before the market proved that that there was going to be global liquidity and global demand for them so we really really want to pick his brain as someone who has been in the middle of this storm that has happened before the storm even arrived and in the eye of the storm as it came what it's like to transcend both the pre like market mania side of nfts and now what it's like to be on the other side of like almost like a global acceptance of nfts as like an asset class and so dc has this very very just awesome portfolio that's tagged on his uh twitter account and his bio if you guys want to follow along on that but we're going to just be asking him some questions about transcending pre-post uh nft manias and also what it's like to just be an nft curator yeah it's it's super cool i you know i always thought nfts in and of themselves were cool like the primitive but i had no idea how valuable they'd be david that's where i got tripped up is like uh how do you separate the value of this thing from that thing right and like dc's ability to see these things early has been really key to his nft game i think i think he's got one of the best uh nft portfolios in crypto so this is going to be like a guided tour like his personal museum we get to see this online as curated a selection so i'm super excited to dig in and ask a whole bunch of questions guys we have some new things going on in the bankless nation as always as well we had an episode with kathy wood chris chris breninski and you've seen another analyst on the ark invest team these guys manage 75 billion in capital absolutely crazy to have them on bankless and that was a fantastic episode just released that yesterday coming off of that episode uh maybe all-time high down downloads it's going to be close we'll see might be um also david we've got a panel on loot tomorrow you want to give some insight into what that's going to be about yeah we all know the loot phenomenon has taken the the nft world by by storm and so we kind of want it and it's moved so incredibly fast so we're bringing on three loot experts who have been deep into the weeds jackson dame anish from from paradigm and and also daryl lau uh who will be joining us so we can ask questions all about loot and what is going on oh excuse me not daryl will palpa pepper the guy who uh minted the adventure gold contract so all these guys are contributors towards the loot ecosystem and we want to ask them just like get their insight in perspective as to what that means that's also another nft but like a different type of nft like a virtual inside out yeah super interesting story there and the markets have cooled down but like not that much and there's so much more to this loot story that i think requires unpacking so exciting stuff also guys uh permissionless conference tickets bankless is co-throwing the world i think this is gonna be the biggest d5 conference ever we're doing this in 2022 super excited about the panelists we're working on the guests we're working on all of these details the thing is um tickets come available like 250 tickets come available every 15 days or so so like twice a month and on the 15th of september a new tranche is actually going to be opened if you are a bankless premium member you get notice of this first so you can get your ticket first they sell it quickly the last one sold out just a few hours once people realized it was open i think this will as well the other thing about it is prices go up every 15 days it was kind of one of those fun crypto experiments right it's like you buy now or you have fomo and you buy at a higher price later right this is like crypto so tickets are now 275 dollars they're still gonna 10x over the next few months uh leading into the conference so now is the time to get them once again if you're a bankless premium subscriber it's 80 in savings right off the bat so become a bankless premium subscriber if you want in on that conference feels like a no-brainer uh david we also um are talking a lot about so rare these days uh and what they're doing in the nft space so uh what's going on in fantasy soccer land right nfts have the ability to be custom fit for any sort of project or application or a product and so rare is doing fantasy football that's soccer for you americans out there using nfts on arbitrom on layer two so we can save on gas fees and you can pick your squad you can compete for prizes uh and it is just a one of those cool awesome pink is proud to be one of those cool awesome like legacy applications that is being ported over towards ethereum rails and d5 applications to do all the same things that we know and love but now on crypto terms you're muted ryan what i love about this too is it's all on layer two so like no gas fees right this is like a layer two success story so they've they've sold i don't know 130 million something like this in uh so rare nft cards uh just this year alone so super exciting to see what they're doing bringing fantasy sports to ethereum so thanks to so rare for sponsoring this message all right david um i think that's it before i ask you the question i always ask at the beginning of this which is what is the state of the nation today sir state of the nation is curating we are curating the whole promise about nfts and what all people have realized in the in the last few just like you know there was the first nft media and then now recently the second is that some of these nfts have the power to be like some of the deep cultural artifacts of the actual internet itself uh and so uh i i know that's that that perspective is one i've gained from dc himself and so while we are perusing dc's gallery alongside with him shoulder shoulder in just a second we are all curating we're all curating part of deep internet culture history hopefully uh our picks our curations are actually the right things to pick so we will pick dc's brain about how he thinks about curating nfts no longer dc investor it's dc curator i guess right that was my joke by the way i stole it all right guys we will be right back uh after these sponsors with dc investors stay tuned bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dals have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave.com that's aave.com hey guys we are back with dc investor talking about the best nft portfolio in the world dc investor probably needs no introduction to bankless houston eath bull he's now an nft legend he's an investor and advisor in the community as well previous bankless guest dc great to have you back on bagless how you doing i'm doing really well thanks thanks a lot for having me on ryan and david i'm excited about today's conversation well usually when we have you on we talk all about eth because you have such great thoughts on eat the asset but now we're going to switch things up um because you have this fantastic curation ability in uh nfd world as well we want to pick your brain on nfts um and maybe to kick things off as we said in the intros you saw nfts back before a lot of people did back before as the kids say they were cool right um what about like what about nfts grabbed you when they did and when did you make your first nft purchase was that in 2018 can you describe us describe that and give us a timeline when he first got interested in this asset class sure sure thing and i think you know the nft journey for me has been a long one and it's been a progression i would say because when i first started off um learning about nfts as a lot of us did in around 2017 2018 time frame the exemplar at that time was cryptokitties which um those who have been in crypto for a while and in ethereum for a while remember we'll remember cryptokitties primarily because um they quote unquote clogged up the chain at more than one point um and and and that what happened in that situation was people were buying these cryptokitties as collectible assets but they were also assets that were being used like in this breeding game and so people would be doing these cryptokitties breeding moves on chain if you will to create more kitties to sell and so it kind of became this thing that you know all of these transactions are hitting the ethereum l1 main net and it was just kind of overwhelming transaction capacity but people were doing it because they were selling these kitties on the back end of that and so there was profit to be made there and so from my perspective at that time i kind of viewed nfts more as a novelty although well let me say this i understood the long-term trajectory of the technology even then um i didn't really think about it from an art perspective though i was thinking about it more as like well can we tokenize land or house deeds and stuff like that and put it on chain and then use it as part of a programmable stack it didn't really occur to me in a serious way that like art would become a primary use case of nfts at that time i know that people were creating art um you know non-game art but i never really like took it that seriously back then because i didn't really understand the vision fast forward a little bit from there and we're seeing even more game items come out so a lot of people remember axe infinity or no actually infinity and god's unchained so i bought a bunch of those assets because just because i thought well yeah i can totally see the gaming use case you know anyone who's ever played any kind of online rpg or even like a trading card game like magic the gathering understands the value of like unique assets that you can trade with one another and you can create an economy around so in my mind that was just a use case that clicked for me immediately still did not really get the art side of that but that was kind of my early journey in nfts really up until i would say the beginning of this year in 2021 or i would say the tail end of 2020. do you see would you say there was like a moment where you were like i want to be an nft person or was it more of a slow slow like oh slowly my portfolio becomes more and more and more nft denominated more than it does like ether defy token denominated when did you decide that you were really really going to care about nfts or was there a moment like that there was never a moment like that david and while i care about nfts a lot i still care about ethereum and just decentralized networks a lot and that's to me it's all one and the same thing and i think nfts are a really valuable addition in terms of an asset class to the decentralized ecosystem and i know that in previous episodes that i've been on with you guys i talk a lot about the censorship resistant value of ether as a collateral asset i think nft is actually you know something that isn't being talked about enough is that when nfts create this new value on ethereum they're expanding actually the economic bandwidth of ethereum even further they're expanding the size of the ethereum based economy so i view this as like the first product market fit of like decentralized economy beyond just like mindless like token flipping you know which is which was really probably the first element of it but now this is something that's a lot more participative it's visual it's interesting it has this cultural component but there was never a moment when i set out to say well i want to be like this nft guy it just kind of like happened i still don't really view myself as that i view myself as like a decentralization guy and i see nfts as being a core part of that to be honest dc let can we go through your thought process back in 2018 2019 before nfts really had proven to the market that there was going to be like global demand global liquidity for these things uh i i want to ask this before and after question so the same question twice but back in 2018 2019 what was your thought process like about like how you would vet or analyze or decide that you wanted to purchase an nft did you think that like oh i'm gonna buy this now and sell it later or i like the art like how did you what was your like curation thought process back before nfts were what they are today so most i will say that most of my nft collection was actually purchased in the early part of this year which was still seems like ancient times by the way okay and we can go through that progression a little bit but when i was buying those game assets in 2018 2019 timeframe really during the bear market one it was kind of a distraction from the prices of ether and the other tokens that were just like going down so i was like you know i could at least like have some fun playing these games i was playing gods unchained and stuff like that but in my mind like the value proposition was clear in that you know if these games take off and if these economies take off then these assets will be worth more and i can also use them to play the game and they have like rare version of cards same thing with axe infinity you know there are some axes that are more powerful than others and so i was really buying them as bets on like these games taking off right and if you look at like also if you look at games like magic the gathering and like the trading card space so magic the gathering actually pioneered basically that entire genre of the trading card game and early magic the gathering cards are now worth like a ton of money you know like a black lotus can be bought for several hundred thousand dollars or or higher depending on the quality of the car so i saw a value in kind of being early to some of that some of those things haven't exactly played out yet but i will say that earlier this year is really when i got into like the nft art scene and it really was a byproduct of the fact that like as i as you guys know i was a career management consultant i spent 15 years doing public sector consulting and i left that job in february early february and so starting in january i just started to open my eyes more to other things that are going on within ethereum to include and obviously we were all very immersed in like the early ethereum stuff that really defy stuff but getting into nfts was something i never really had like the mental space to do i saw people though who were very passionate about their nfts on twitter and i always pay attention to this stuff i really do try to like sense what people are talking about and why they're talking about it is it just bla blind bag pumping or is it is there something else there and with nfts i saw these people who are just like rabid collectors and i saw it first actually in crypto punks and i saw it like relatively early so really in like that was probably around january when crypto punks were still like a couple of ether each you could buy you could buy a crypto punk for a couple of ether but i kind of tried to unpack the psychology behind that and there's actually a really notable paper by um i don't know if you guys recall this it was by um foo baszler crypto diario and alex gausman just talking about the crypto punk like fat thesis which was like talking about how crypto punks would absorb all this value i think the paper is probably like a year old now well ahead of its time okay i remember reading it when it first came out and i was like well maybe you know i could maybe see that happening but then in january or february time i was like okay these are still cheap it makes sense to like make place a small bet on this and i like the collectible aspect of it so i went out and i bought my first couple of crypto punks and that was really what kind of led me down the rabbit hole to be honest i think that's true for a lot of people it started off in like that collectible aspect but then progressed on into the art aspect can we talk about that so like this is where i kind of um got off the ride um pc like in my own in my own kind of like so i totally saw what you saw um with like nfts being a really important cr primitive with cryptokitties right and then i also saw it was very obvious to me as like a former gamer that um like the the virtual gaming gods untrained cards axes would be a big deal right but but then i didn't like i totally missed the um the crypto punks thing and then i miss like the broader art thing and like now i see it but like now he has a turtle as his profile picture that's just to make fun of david um but but i like what was it when you purchased your first uh krypto punk that like i guess put you over the edge into uncovering all of these other art pieces and then why did you like what did you see in these other art pieces at that time yeah i mean i think and i think the signal for me was when i saw people were using them more broadly as profile pictures and there were a few people doing that like all along you know they weren't they aren't necessarily like big name profiles that you would recognize but when i saw people doing that it kind of clicked for me people are like identifying with these assets and i was like that's like a super powerful driver and i was like you know what's it gonna take for someone who's using this as their profile picture to sell one and then my the gear started turning there right um so i got i bought a few crypto plunks and i was actually really involved with the crypto punk discord for a while and i was just kind of chatting with people there i was like hey what do you guys think are cool attributes why do you guys like them and they're like oh we like hoodies and the big beards and stuff like that and so i bought i bought that's one of the reasons why i bought a hoodie punk and i thought they look cool of course so i bought one but from there i really started to talk to more people within that discord and they kind of clued me into this on-chain generative art space which is the space that i'm like really like falling down the rabbit hole pretty hard because i'll tell you like and i'm not saying like the one of one art is like not a good market to be in because i own some one-of-one art myself but i never really that value proposition never clicked for me as much because you can have like that jpeg like anywhere right but i i get that one person owns it but that value proposition didn't click for me as much as the on-chain generative art and i think some of your listeners will be familiar with on-chain generative art and when i talk about on-chain generative r i'm really talking about these um when when you have these minting of pieces on chain using a generative algorithm and basically when the user submits a transaction the hash of that transaction provides the source of randomness for that art algorithm and so that outputs basically a fixed number of pieces depending on what the artist has specified that was like a light bulb moment for me because i was like oh now you can have this like uni this art form that had existed before now produces these unique outputs and now they can be collected and traded now i kind of like needed that i think to like really get it and krypto punks um but that's really when i kind of fell down the rabbit hole and i started looking at all of these art blocks pieces and i can talk to you guys about some of the ones that i bought early on and why but that's kind of how i fell down the rabbit hole we're about to open up your portfolio and actually take a peek here in a second but before we do that i do want to just get your perceptions as to like the before and after the compare and contrast of like you know the the pre-adopted state of nft markets and then the post-adopted state of nft markets right like crypto punks were dormant for like three years before they really got going our block saw success really really quickly but our blocks are also relatively new but as someone who's like straddled the pre and post liquid phase of nfts has your thought process or curation strategies or just buying process changed or evolved or adapted at all now that we are kind of in a phase where nfts have kind of seen more adoption than d5 in some sectors of the world yeah it it has a little bit for sure because when i got when i went that period when i was describing to you in january february time frame when i got that generative art concept in my head i realized kind of this could be like really big and and propel the entire mft space forward so i kind of went into like a land grab mode and i think a lot of people thought i was like crazy at the time and you know like i was chatting with with some of my friends including you guys and you guys weren't the ones who are giving me grief but some people were like what the hell are you doing why are you spending so much money on this stuff and you're not just spending money sir you're spending each let me remind you well at the time and i will say this was like a policy of mine was for every nft that i bought like i was actually using d5 to help me finance the those purchases so and i don't recommend this necessarily but one of the things that i said was look i'm not going to give up my ether to buy these i'm going i was borrowing against my ether and other assets and then i used that that kind of capital that i was borrowing to then buy the nfts right and i was like eventually i'll pay off these loans in some way but it was actually defy that allowed me to do all of this and it allowed me to take that kind of controlled risk and i didn't have to lose my exposure to ether if i couldn't have done that i probably would not have bought as many nfts and i know the value of some of my collection has swelled a fair amount but like when i bought some of these they weren't like nearly as expensive i'm not saying they were cheap i didn't get in on some of these when they're like bargain basement but that that was my calculus as i kind of got into this pretty cool ryan should we uh pull up uh dc investors portfolio i think we should i'm uh i'm anxious to dive in here so um i'm pulling up this website which um i think i've seen this before maybe but this appears to be a curated gallery so this is not necessarily all of the nfts that that you own but these are nfts that you have curated to be displayed on this gallery.so website is that correct that's right yeah it's a lot of them and it's funny because some people will use the term um portfolio i view it i i consider it more of like a collection than a portfolio okay yeah which is kind of like a distinction and i get that people are now viewing them more as like investments but at the time i was like i want to collect these because i view them as pieces of that internet culture which david i think your statement at the top of this episode kind of nailed that idea which is these are pieces of like internet history so i my thought process has always been like there are only going to be so many pieces of history to go around and if i want any of them i better like get them and i collect them so i will i will sell some of them like eventually but i didn't start off with the mindset of i'm doing this as like a for-profit venture if that makes sense i think that's such a good distinction see my mind is still in the kind of like we've got assets and there's like finance and it's defy and these are stores of value but like thinking about these as cultural collections i think is the right language to use for this sort of thing so um we're taking a peek how many how many items are in this curated list dc oh it's quite a few to be honest i couldn't give you an exact number but it's probably like a couple hundred or maybe a few hundred in here and um you know not all of them are like super valuable at the top of this list you'll see top of this um gallery you'll see my auto glyphs so these were actually the very first on-chain generative art so after i bought some of those art blocks pieces that i talked about i started to like talk to people and learn more about all the stuff that was happening like during the bear market basically in nfts when a lot of us were not paying attention and they're like oh yeah autoglyphs were actually the first on-chain generative art so i tried to buy as many of them as i could they were already quite expensive but in my mind the significance of these first on-chain generative art pieces um could not be duplicated basically and so i'm wondering as we as we scroll through this dc what's the best way to look at this should we do it by timeline and find some pieces that you bought kind of early and work our way backwards or like what do you think david where should we start here well i think the first question i want to ask dc is when using the uh frame of reference as deep cultural artifacts of the internet itself which uh which of the assets with the nfts in your portfolio do you think most resonate with that framing is it the autoglyphs i think it's probably the crypto punks and the autoglyphs for sure both of which were created by larva labs who have kind of i'm going to scroll down to the crypto punx then yeah go for it and um you know i bought a few and wedged in between them are a few avastars and so that that krypto punk in the middle right there with the eye patch is actually the first one i bought and by the way almost all of these are floor punks and one of the things that i do is um i'm kind of like a ruthless floor value hunter like so so here's an interesting thing about nfts which you guys may may appreciate from what you've seen in the space right a lot of crypto people are like mathy type people right so they get really hung up on like the rarity of different um attributes and stuff like that especially for these randomized pieces and when i look at them i was like okay i guess i get like the random attribute perspective but there's nothing that replaces for me like aesthetically how does a piece look when it like comes together right and to me this guy with the eye patch was just like it really and still is like the perfect for crypto punk it probably shouldn't have been a floor he's got an eye patch and a five o'clock shadow too i mean yeah exactly it's just like this and like the crazy hair it's like this is like perfect i couldn't believe there was a floor and then but then as i uncovered like the collector psychology at the time everyone's just focused on attributes right very few people and i think i think that for a lot of crypto people that is easier to do and they feel more comfortable doing that than actually trying to make like an aesthetic assessment right yeah you people like especially people people like objectivity right and so they go and say oh well there's only like x number of this attribute and that number is really much so much lower than all the other attributes so therefore it's rare therefore i feel secure in my investment where dc what you're saying is like well this guy looks cool and i like that and exactly so you're saying that maybe perhaps in the long term that people are discounting too much uh something that just straight up looks cool i think so 100 and so that's why i got that eyepatch guy the second crypto punk i bought was actually the one to the right of that which was which is this funny guy like smoking a pipe and i was kind of like this is like my bear market alter ego right here so i was like i just thought i just thought you smoked a pipe in real life no no i don't but i just think this guy is absolutely hilarious he's like frowning he's smoking a pipe he's got his glasses on he's watching the charts you know it's i was like i thought he was a great compliment to that other one and so i was like okay i'm done now but then i kept to like buying more that's kind of my nft story is i got addicted to buying them i bought that guy in the lower right the guy the the guy with the mohawk yeah that guy and then from there i actually like so those were all four punks right and i was like well you know what i kind of want one that's like i would like to have as my avatar it could be that pipe smoking guy but this is when i i guess transitioned into a quote nft identity and that's when i bought that um the the hoodie crypto punk right and at the time i bought this one for 10 ether which was probably around 20k at the time and i just thought it was like i was like this guy looks kind of badass he's kind of like chill i love the big shades just everything about him was like i loved it so i was just like and and i actually i did i had bid 10 but the seller wanted 12 and i remember exchanging messages with him i was like would you sell it for less and he's like oh no sorry you can't sell it for less than 12 and i was like all right i better just buy it if i want it and so i bought it and then i set it as my profile picture and i think the rest is kind of like history after that because that's that's kind of i feel like that was a moment when things started to blow up not because i changed my profile picture but you know just kind of coincide with that there's this quip that i hear often from people who are really into like tattoos is like after you get your first tattoo you can't stop thinking about just your next tattoo i feel like that is exactly what just happened to you dc where you got your first like crypto punk and then you just became like a crypto puck maxie it's like well now i need all of that it's so funny because like when i was buying them the people in the crypto punks discord i was just like okay this is my last one and then i come back like they see they see the sale spot go off i bought another i just kept buying them and you know i will say like unlike a lot of people speaking of crypto punk maxies there are people who are like crypto punks are like the only nf2s that are really worth much there used to be more people like that a few months ago and i never subscribed to that because i was just like look there's gonna be other nfts that are interesting so i could have just bought a bunch of crypto punks at the beginning but again that wasn't really aligned with like what i was trying to do for me it was more interesting to pull together like this collection that i'm excited about and it's kind of like a reflection of my taste if that makes sense uh dc have you ever sold one have you ever flipped one or have you only bought i i basically only bought so far and like so so that's why i'm not buying like a ton of new nfts because i don't have like infinite liquidity but my mindset was always like i'm putting money into this that i can afford to lose and i want to hold on to these long term and then over the past few months more so it's been like well you know what this is actually like an asymmetric bet on culture it's kind of like binary either these things like 50x to 100x or they like go to zero and i say zero hyperbolically because i don't think that anything will ever go to zero so i was like i don't really i don't i don't need to like realize the profits from these so i'm not going to sell them the only thing that i have sold was actually some land for maxi infinity and you guys might not be aware of this but within the axia infinity game there's actually land that you can use for the gameplay i bought several partials of it during the bear market and i wasn't really playing the game but i was just like i just want to kind of support the creators of this game and i was like you know so i bought it directly when they were being offered and i ended up selling some of that for like uh 200x profit or something and i actually forgot i had the listing up it just kind of like sold and i was like okay that's cool but that's the only nft that i've sold so far and it's some some of these like i mean could you ever sell this one with the hoodie that's become like your nft identity there's somebody in the youtube chat that says that that crypto punk has become iconically tied to dc probably it has so like and that's an interesting that's an interesting thought process because like can i sell it i could right i mean i could sell it and it might even have someone who's like a fan of mine or wants to support me might even put a premium on it you know like they might want to buy that um there might be others who say oh that's dc's punk i don't want to use it as my own identity for me i putting on dc's face right exactly i mean for me it's kind of like one of the last nfts i would ever sell if i had to like sell my nfts if that makes sense so can i ask you this because this is interesting on kind of nft theories like i would also say um because this has become so iconic with you dc right and like because you've been you know a core part of this movement as well you've also made this nft more valuable right so there's something to like the the uh i guess second order effect of somebody purchasing an nft that has less value and then because they assume it as their identity because they use it in all of these places because you know they build kind of their reputation in the digital world or the non-digital world they make that nft more valuable i feel like you've definitely made this nft more valuable is this a commonly talked about uh understood thing in nft circles i think it's starting to be more understood and right now it's just because i think a lot of it is like us crypto nerd types who have been like in on this but now you have like actual like celebrities who have nothing to do with crypto historically coming in and buying crypto punks like jay-z has a crypto functions his profile picture you've got several athletes that are doing it does the fact that they have owned one of those crypto punks make it more valuable almost certainly right and even like the attributes of the ones that they're selecting right might make them more valuable and even like i i've heard people and i think hoodie funks are the coolest personally i wish i had more of them but like you know you see a lot of people using hoodie punks as their avatars you know and and people associate hoodies now with them and now they want a hoodie that has definitely happened and that's raised the floor prices of hoodies but i think the phenomenon you're talking about ryan extends beyond just the avatars into the art pieces as well because now you're starting to see a lot more recognition around who's collecting these pieces and why and at the time when i so when i put together this gallery page there were not surprisingly there were not many nft collectors like creating galleries like this they just kind of had them in their open sea a lot of them were they were flipping you know to be honest so they didn't necessarily like want to advertise that this is like something they own when they're gonna sell it next week but for me like i all my vision was always to create some kind of like 3d metaverse gallery and the technology is not like there yet for me to create an experience that i want to do there so i was like well let me just start arranging them in 2d and i found i ran i tried a bunch of gallery sites um and they just didn't work for me they were like a little too garish they're focused on the price too much they're focused on all this metadata and i just want i was like i just want to arrange the nfts the way i want to on a website and i came across gallery.so and and i've now become like a huge supporter of theirs i'm an angel investor in them and i work with their team as well and i just started laying them out here and i was like oh my god i was like now i can finally like experience my nfts in a way that i'm excited about and and i can go and share with other people and i actually visit my gallery frequently just to kind of like tweak things here and there and just to kind of reflect on what i've collected and what i want to collect next and so the more that people create galleries like this that will also i think confer value on certain types of pieces because you're signaling like hey i'm holding this i think this has value in the way that humans are they naturally look for social cues around what's valuable and what isn't and i i mean i try not to like abuse i don't consider it like a power it's just like a consequence of like collecting these things and holding them but it's something that i don't like abuse like i don't i'll never like take an nft for money and like put it in my gallery i will only buy and collect things that like i actually like and not all of them are going to be valuable but i don't i don't really care well that's why definitely that's why we called youtube maker dc curator right yeah yeah yeah decentralized curator but yeah i mean like for me it's just like i'm just curating my own gallery i don't have like an ambition beyond that i'm not trying to like pump these pieces or anything like that because i'm not gonna sell any of them like anytime soon okay like i'm not gonna sell many of them anytime soon let me put it that way and so for me just the value of being able to pull these together has been huge and it was somewhere along the way like back when i was doing this in the early days like no one cared like i would be like hey guys check out my nft gallery it's like okay cool what are these and now people go to it and they're like holy crap like do you know how much this one's worth and that one's worth and i was like look when i started putting them in here they were not worth that much and now like some people associate with like a status symbol or whatever i i think the flag like i put out a tweet once and i was like the flex is not like the monetary worth of them the flex is like your taste right and i think like if you're collecting nfts like have it be a reflection of your taste not like your net worth you know and i think that's like that's something really like fundamental that i would suggest people think about i actually wanted to take that transition and go into the art blocks conversation uh because dc you're talking about how you bought floor punks based off of their aesthetics right uh and so i wanted to apply that same sort of lens to art blocks and how you think art blocks might be valued based on their aesthetics rather than just like their price right like some art blocks are really highly priced and people are still trying to like figure out how the market is pricing these things but you have a really awesome set of fidenzas that you have as a three by three and ryan i think it's further down south on the page uh and i think it's one of my favorite sets that you have here on this page uh on on your gallery and you've curated them so that like there's the green pink ones up at top we got the multi-colored ones with it with the same backgrounds in the middle and then a similar set of three down at the bottom can you talk about the role of aesthetics when it comes to art blocks and also the again like just double down on the whole like set generation side of things as they pertain to art blocks yeah i think that so for me with all of the art blocks i've collected almost without exception um it has been aesthetically driven for me right there have been a couple of land grabs that i've made which i'll talk about in a second but like i have really focused on and you can just see this so i actually bought a lot of these art blocks pieces before i had this gallery but in my head i was always buying pieces thinking about how how i would physically arrange them like one day and it kind of started with like okay these two would look good next to each other i was like okay let's add a third and i was like you know what what if i have like a two by three and then or what if i had a three by three like visual and so it just kind of like expanded from there but for me with art blocks aesthetics is always like number one i like the the whole attribute rarity like i don't want to say i don't care about it at all but i care like very little about it but for some people that's all they care about and i'm not trying to tell any collector like what they should care about i'm more just saying like what's important to me is being able to like display these pieces and i think the other thing that people miss is like everyone's focused on rarity but fast forward to like 10 years from now like there's only going to be a thousand ringers there's only gonna be a thousand fidenzas like is it that important that you have like one of those that's like some super rare attribute just having even one of these pieces might be like a big deal at that point yeah i mean it's kind of a big deal now i guess but like i feel like people get wrapped up in those dynamics instead of just buying pieces they they like and they spend a lot more so almost oh so by the way all of these fidenzas were floor fidenzas 100 of them and i just and and i bought them when they're cheaper um kind of right before they went completely parabolic i guess but like i was able to like assemble these sets i just bought them all very quickly in sequence i was like okay these three would look good get together buy them um but i think like i think the story actually if you want to go back up towards the ringers ryan because i do want to kind of point out how i thought about some of this stuff in earlier days and actually go slightly above the ringers um there you go right here uh yeah if you scroll down just a tad um so you see there okay um these pieces here these five around this x copy this is from a set called genesis on art block so this is one of the day one releases um at art blocks and the piece that you're hovering over right now that red one is actually genesis zero so that is the first user minted art blocks piece ever created there were a few created by like snow snowfro and jeff davis who are like the the guys that were running the site they they minted also some squigglies which are a day one set and also construction token which was a day one set by jeff davis so snow fro did crummy squiggly um and and and so this genesis zero piece was the first user mint and when i saw it for sale i was like this was like actually the first art box piece that i bought and it was kind of like a land grab because i was like okay everyone's like i spent some time in the art box discord and in the crypto funk's discord everyone was talking about it like people who like i feel like we're the genesis of this community i was like i gotta buy some of these and i bought genesis euro just on the spot so it's not my favorite piece like aesthetically but i felt like it was like a really important piece of history and that's kind of how i got into it from there though i very quickly kind of discovered ringers which is below this and that's when i like really fell down like the rabbit hole because for me i really like kind of the more abstract art style a lot of these have like the way that i talk about is kind of like an anthropomorphic or zoom morphic aspect to it so if you scroll up to that red one um there ryan like that one looks like a moose you know like actually dimitri shernick calls that one the moose the one on the left looks like a raven and you know so each one of the one under the raven looks kind of like an angel you know it so i feel like those are like things that kind of they're kind of evocative of something and these are pieces that make you think but when i realized like mental it took me a second to like make the leap these are all based on like an algorithm they're created at random during mint and there's only like 1 000 and the artist could not curate the outputs i kind of saw the value proposition of the genre immediately and so that's when i really went on my like generative art buying spree and on that note we know that uh uh three hours capital bought a ringer that famously looks like a goose and it totally looks like a goose and there was an insane premium attached to that uh dc i want to back up really quick and and go back to like the whole aesthetic question about art blocks you you said like you don't really play the rarity game on art blocks too much you you kind of prefer the aesthetic game uh and you also said like you know there's only a thousand like ringers there's only a thousand x do you do you think that like the reason why different art block sets are priced differently like fidenzens are really really highly priced ringers are really really highly placed do you think that is because of aesthetics as in like the markets like oh yeah fidenzas everyone generally agrees that like fidenzas look really really cool and so like maybe it's like the sets themselves are priced based off of the aesthetics and then like maybe the rarity inside the sets reprices individual uh units inside of that set um according to rarity how do you think about that so i think that so the pricing of any nft set i think is an extremely complex formula and i can't it's really hard for me to like distill down like what makes one set more valuable than another i think what is interesting about nfts versus other kinds of art is the ability for them to like develop this mimetic or viral value like on the internet in a way that has not really been seen in traditional art right if you go back to like early like hundreds of years ago right a lot of artists would die before their work became famous and by extension they became famous now an artist can put out a set and it can go viral or like if the right people start collecting it then other people want it and i think that is we've already seen that in the internet generation or in the internet world for a long time but now you can apply it to discrete defined ownership of these visual assets and so to me i do think aesthetics is an important component of that are there aesthetic sets that are not aesthetically like balancer is a powerful platform absolutely i mean so it's not enough that it like looks good there are other like ineffable qualities that i look at and very often by the way guys i'm not like minting these projects on day one i'm normally buying after they've been minted i'm buying on secondary because i want the pieces that i like i like to see how the market reacts to them i like to see how the collectors are reacting is that like a risk strategy you like just don't want the level of minting risk yeah i mean partially absolutely i mean there are sets that i have minted and i do like the minting but i also don't like getting into like dash wars and stuff like that so i for me like i would there's no way i would have been able to randomly mint the set of nine fidenzas right the only way to build something like this is to buy them on secondary the pieces that you want i might have been able to mint like one or two and then build a collection around that and i've done that for some sets but also like there are sets that don't gain that traction and then i'm kind of like well i don't want to put a lot of money into something that i feel like won't necessarily develop that cultural premium right and i think that cultural premium is like that's the ineffable part of this that's really hard to understand because you're kind of making a bet on what are people going to find interesting today what's going to influence artists of tomorrow that's being created today and how are collectors going to look back on this set are they going to look back on it with fondness are they going to view it as overhyped and i don't i don't claim to like know the answers to those things but that is all of those are factors that go into my own calculus when i'm buying a set like because i i think like just as important as like what's in my collection are all the things that are like not in it right there's a lot of things that i could have bought and there and that's not to say they're bad like i think i do think every collector needs to have a circle of confidence they need to have like something they're interested in and that's how you build a collection otherwise you're just buying like a little bit of everything and you end up with nothing that you're really excited about at least that's how i approach it oh yeah you muted ryan but uh yeah sorry i'll go dc this has been super cool so far honestly i want to like uh come back after the sponsors and camp out in your in your museum a little bit more in your collection a little bit more because there are so many other pieces i think we should cover so guys we will be right back with dc touring his collection but uh before we get back we want to thank the sponsors who made this episode

his famous portfolio uh dc i want to turn the uh conversation to one of ones which are uh people that uh a side of nfts that are very very important that actually are like the most alike towards like the legacy art world right like when a painter paints something there's only one of that and so we also have we have the world of one-of-ones also in the nft space so when it comes to a one-of-one strategy how how do you change up what you think about or or how you invest when it comes to one-of-ones so i i am definitely not i'm probably one of the least sophisticated one-of-one collectors out there and i i generally will prefer sets just because i have more comfort in what i'm buying there's normally other assets that are like you know what we can call comps or comparables and so when i buy something from a set i can see well this one just traded at that price so i have a pretty good idea of that however there are a bunch of like really talented one-of-one artists and i wish i could like own more pieces by them but like i'll point to one of them and this is this like flashing tank one there so that's an x copy and that's actually it's actually ironically part of a set of six but each one of the six was hand created by x copy and is unique so it is a unique piece and this was probably the first one of one that i spent like a serious sum of money on um and it was this one was definitely quite expensive but i recognize that x copy is a really important nft artist and xcopy is one of these like true ogs along with coldy and a bunch of other guys who are creating nfts through the entire bear market when guys like us we're not paying attention to the stuff at all they were cranking out these drops they were putting them on super rare people were buying them and so i wanted to have at least one one of one by x copy but the calculus i think for these really has to be on more around the artist and you really have to think about what who is this artist what is their place in kind of the milieu or the popular culture and how are they going to be looked back on in in decades from now that's how i think about it but you can see these other x copies i have which are all of the slightly epilepsy triggering caesar seizure one they should have a seizure warning on them really with all the flashing but i just thought like the art aesthetic was like really cool and actually the other ones are all like part of a set right so like this the one next to that tank one to the left overlord that is number two of 20 of that series same with the one to the right of that so these are all like sets of 20 but if you think about it that's still like super exclusive there's not a lot of those you know and like there's definitely not enough x copy to go around for all the people who want x copy so i have no problem buying these like one of n sets you know i think like some of my favorite pieces are these one of n sets um versus the one of ones um so i don't have like a ton of like one of ones that i would really say like i'm super proud of um i will say like maybe we can talk maybe we can jump to the end of the gallery for a moment ryan because i do want to show you you have some beeples too i've heard oh yeah yeah we can talk about those on the way um well here before we get there i'd like to dc right before we started going live here you tweeted out you don't realize it yet but many nfts are actually artists social tokens can you elaborate on that tweet yeah i think that so there's really two layers to that the first is when you buy a piece of art from an artist an mft and if you're buying it as something you're holding you know i think most people are buying one to support the artist but two as a collector like myself i don't buy just to support the artist i am buying with the expectation that it's gonna go up in value or at least a lot of it will because i'm not gonna i mean like if it's something cheap if it's something relatively inexpensive i don't have a problem like spending a little bit of money to support a creator and just being like okay i think you're doing cool work i'm gonna buy something if i'm spending like five figures plus on something though i at least want to have an expectation that i'm not like destroying the value that i'm putting into that i wanna i to have some confidence that i might be able to sell it again if i want to even if i never sell it and also that's just part of the mental stimulation for like a collector um i think people and i've collected other stuff in the past like magic the gathering cards and things like that i didn't do a lot of physical collecting because you need a lot of space to like take care of that inventory so nfts are kind of like a perfect fit for me in that regard um but while we're here and we're talking about these people so um these peoples were just ones these were some other like notable pieces that i bought like that had already like appreciated a lot but i feel like beeple is going to be remembered as a pretty important creator in this movement as well as someone who because he's like a great story in the sense of he's a creator that has been creating this work for years right the guy's been creating like a piece every single year and posting it on instagram for like a really long time and he's developed a huge following but he never really had a way to monetize that and now he has a way to monetize that in a way that's very significant so the one that you've got up here which is the politics is one um i eventually picked up one of these this is people's first ever nft drop okay and he sold these for one dollar each okay that was like each one of these were sold for a dollar and my god yes it's kind of crazy he released this october 29th 2020 i'm reading here yes and so that was that was like ancient history and nft time but i remember when it dropped and i was kind of like i heard about it and i was like everyone's like oh people's doing a drop and i was like okay i didn't pay a lot of attention to it but then i tracked the price on these things i was like wow people are really buying into this and these are still trading at pretty high valuations and so i decided to pick up one of these eventually because i was like what's people's first drop you know i mean like and i would love to have some of his one-of-ones but they're outside of my price range so i didn't do that um alongside these if you want to go back ryan um to the to the gallery so there's two others here there's into the ether and bull run and i think these pieces are also like these pieces resonated with me for obvious reasons because they're like the crypto theme and i love it i mean i love this into the ether one this is so cool it's really cool yeah and there's like a print i i don't recall the exact number of this but i think each one of these has like between 200 and 300 um open edition but that didn't really matter to me i was like these are still like for me for me again going back to what you said at the top david it's all about like the cryptoculture that we're creating and what is like more iconic about the cryptoculture than like artwork that's about ethereum and about bitcoin and so i wanted to like buy some of that and these these pieces actually came with physical editions also and i don't have them like in front of me but like people ships this to you with like a digital frame with the art that you can like plug in and it displays the art he sends you like some weird stuff like a hair sample you know like it's just like other stuff you got like a little certificate a sample of his hair yes it's a sample of his hair in a vial he's kind of an eccentric guy but you know we love it and so so anyway i just thought those were really cool and um i know one of the points that you guys wanted to hit on was around like physical and digital nfcs and maybe we can just talk talk about that for a second here because i think that with so this is a case of nfts where when you bought the nft you also got a physical with it right the problem is these things can become separated over time so in general for me like i don't typically buy stuff like this because i don't want to have like physical and digital inventory i'm managing for me it's almost like a halfway step between going like fully digital like in the example that i used recently that i was talking with tom chan especially from delphi digital about was like do you guys remember the castasius bitcoins like those little brass bitcoins that you could buy totally these are like actual coins actual bitcoins irl that you like own right yeah yeah and it all what it all it was was a brass coin with a private key inside of it and you just hope the creator like deleted his copy of the private key basically right but like i remember in 2013 when i was trying to buy my first bitcoin i was waiting for coinbase to like approve my deposit and i was going on ebay and i was like maybe i should just buy one of these kassacious bitcoins because in my head i was not ready to like make that transition to digital and so i was like okay if i buy this coin then i have something physical in addition to the digital and it's kind of weird like i and i know that sounds like silly to us now probably but think about like newer participants coming into the space like they might care about that they might be like well i want something physical i don't just want something digital i actually think long term most of the value is going to be on the digital side of these collectibles to be honest so that's just my view of like digital nfts now now would i ever have like physical nfts or physical art based on nfts absolutely i mean i would be i would love to like get prints of them i don't have a ton of space in my apartment here in dc area but eventually as i have more space i would love to like get signed prints by some of my favorite artists of pieces that i own i'm going to put them up and kind of decorate my home with some of them let's scroll down some more dc um toward the end you wanted to get us to the end for some interesting things so um yes stop me anywhere i'm just scrolling through some of these yeah and you can just keep going and a lot of these um so there's a few axes there yeah i actually i actually wait you bought you bought one of the uh mark cuban yeah i did this so this was one of those nfts when i bought this it was kind of like i splashed a fair amount for it but i bought this one because mark this was mark cuban's first nft and i just thought it was cool i was like he only made 10 of them i think i think it was 10. and i was like you know mark's like an early guy one of the early like prominent people who got into ethereum and d5 so i bought one of them like shortly after he released it he was also very very bullish on euler beats so i think you've curated a mark cuban section in your in your gallery right kind of yeah i just kind of like the juxtaposition of him doing the shoulder roll with these spinning discs but yeah these are all the oiler beats that i own these are the prints of them i own two of the ogs as well um but yeah these are prints of all of those um which if you go to the website you can listen to these generative music samples i was gonna say because they're it's music too right it's not just the uh nfc art and that's right okay now we're getting to the original um cryptokitties here yeah we got it yeah we got yeah so that one on the left is like actually it's not like super rare to be honest but it's like uh that's a generation zero crypto kitty okay so it's one of the first like general but it's like first in like the first like 500 000 or something but i was just like i won a gen zero kitty and this was like the most boring sad looking one i could find so i bought it and so i bought the other one i think to like get it crypto kitty's like still a big deal dc or they seem to have faded a little bit and like they didn't hold up the way uh crypto punks did i'm curious if you know why yeah i mean this is really a question of supply and demand and and when you talk about supply and demand we're talking about um there were i think there were like over a million cryptokitties well over ah and there's just not yeah exactly now i do think some of like the early founder cats might be like worth more and i know some prominent collectors who own some of those i don't have any and so it's not something that it's not really a rabbit hole i want to like go back down but you know different people want to collect different things um now this photograph here in the middle i think is one that's super interesting and this is by a prominent um photograph photography artist called justin aversano and he's kind of become a pillar of like the photography nft community and the nft community more broadly i've spoken with him a few times and so this is one of i think there's a hundred twin flames and each one of these is unique he went around and photographed a hundred twins and the whole genesis of the project was when he was born he had a twin that like passed away and so he wanted to create this set and i just thought it was like this is like the perfect melding of like on-chain art you know you've got these defined pieces for like 100 piece set each one is unique and a lot of like prominent collectors have at least like one twin flame i'd love to have more but i can't have like i can't afford to have like an infinite number some of these because the prices have appreciated a lot but photography nft users are another area they're taking off like massively it's not like an area of like competence for me so i don't collect a ton of it i'd like to get a little bit more into it but i recognize that this is like anytime i see like something that i feel like is pretty certain going to be a piece of history i will i may just try to buy it just because i'm like this is something that's important as an artifact even beyond the art that it represents so as somebody who uh funded my life my life during college via photography i'm really optimistic that the world of nfts can come and help uh add further and further like monetization and financialization layers upon more traditional art forms right like we saw this with people um and and that makes a ton of sense because beeple is a digital artist a 3d digital artist seeing it also enter the world of photography is fantastic really really awesome and this is how we go from just like weird esoteric deep corners of the internet where you find crypto punk speculators to actually changing the world the real world that's outside of ethereum right ethereum is now changing the dynamics of photography dc as we come to a close here we still have a few more questions but i want to ask you a question just a very broad question is how do you think broadly nfts are changing culture not just inside of ethereum but outside of it as well so i think the impact is starting to be incredibly profound to be honest um to the point where i think cryptoculture is going to become a dominant culture in our society and i think nfts are going to be a prime like propagator of that in a way that people couldn't have expected why is that because now you're giving creators the ability to earn money for digital art creations and that has been like super difficult before right if you're a digital artist you're basically relying on like you could have a patreon maybe you're selling prints or some of your work but now you can sell these nfts and those nfts can create value um you know beyond what you created in addition to that there's also a royalty payments that you earn so every time one of these nfts changes hands on these marketplaces there's a royalty that the smart contract if it's enabled allows you to earn a residual income from that and that allows these creators to continue to create so what does that mean that means the quality of talent that is flooding into the space right now these aren't just like pure amateurs these are like people who are going to be really good you know and you're actually going to see people aspire now and to develop these skill sets so i think i do think i know you guys had that like renaissance episode like that resonated with me a lot where it's just like i feel like we are on the cusp of this digital renaissance and we and i think it's going to be realized as we kind of transition more and more into this concept of a metaverse so dc i think we should ask this question to almost everyone that that tinkers around with the metaverses because we're all trying to figure out what the metaverse actually is so what does the metaverse mean to you so i think the metaverse i think it's actually fair to compare and contrast it with the internet that we have today so i think we're in a in a sense you could say we're in a metaverse now which transcends our physical reality and we interact with one another digitally often in ways that are like disembodied from who we are personally like we're doing a face-to-face interaction here but a lot of times we're interacting through texts uh text-based chat sometimes through voice chat right there's different ways that people are interacting with each other that has been going on since the internet in like the early 90s when people were in irc chats and stuff like that the missing formula to get to metaverse is the ability to economically interact with each other in a frictionless way that i believe needs to be decentralized and you can't just have it all run on these decentralized rails where i'm paypaling you money and stuff like that right it's not just about me paying you or tipping you it's about us transacting with one another in economically important ways and i think nfts are like a huge part of that right nfts are arguably one of the first like digitally native economies that we've ever seen beyond just like token flipping which we've seen a lot of like this is people buying these pieces they get utility out of them and they're collecting them and they're using decentralized currencies like ether actually primarily ether to buy these pieces that is huge so i think the metaverse is emerging actually in earnest we're going to look back at 2020 2021 as the birth of the metaverse in my opinion and it's not just gonna be one like ready player one thing it's gonna be like all of us interacting with each other online in various ways the vr part isn't even here yet and i don't think it like has to be like here for us to call what is happening here at metaverse that vr component i think will start to emerge heavily in like the next few years what do you think just closing with two questions i guess here dc so one is uh what's next for nfts and the second is what's next for dc investor do you see curators yeah what's happening so i think nfts are going to continue to go even more mainstream we're going to look back at them as one of the most powerful um powerful center of gravity is in terms of attracting people into crypto overall they will become the first entry point for a lot of people into crypto and i think we've seen absolutely nothing yet both on the art side which is gonna you're gonna see like big institutions and big players come in and museums and things like that recognize this as a valid art form you're also going to see a huge takeoff in terms of in-game items and the the designing of in-game economies which are designed to work in a decentralized way where you're swapping assets so i think that's going to be huge as far as what's next for me my goal is just to continue to kind of help to support the decentralized ecosystem and i'm really i'm really focused on ethereum today i'll probably continue to be focused on it for the rest of my life to be honest because i view it as the most um the most kind of decentralized network that we have so far that allows this kind of activity but but that journey is going to take me wherever decentralization goes because i think that undercurrent of decentralization and kind of what it means for our society is so huge that it's it and i think it's going to take decades to play out so i'm just excited to be a part of the space both from the ethereum side the defy side and the nft side so we have a panel tomorrow on the whole loot phenomenon but the youtube chat is blowing up wanting your specific take on loot and all of that like mania what do you have an opinion as to the whole loot thing or any thoughts on that so i think loot is actually a really interesting phenomenon that i can only assess in hindsight i think right now it's just a very interesting idea and i want to see what actually gets built on it in general with nfts my philosophy is i like i don't want to make the mistakes of like the ico times when like everyone was betting on things for like future promises and loot actually itself doesn't make any promises it's other people kind of implying that things will be built on it so i respect that um but i think like everyone always needs to be like mindful of the fact that hey if you're if you're buying something hoping that something else is going to be developed you just want to be cognizant of like is that going to be developed is there an incentive for that development to happen so i'm very open-minded to loot i'm interested to see how it plays out but like most of the nfts that i have don't do anything and that's kind of by design but but there are some exceptions to that like my punk's comic nfts which like allow you to claim like the meadow heroes that i have my collection so you know we just need to see how some of this stuff plays out well dc it's been an absolute pleasure to have you i don't know how many millions of dollars worth of value in nfts we just witnessed that's an impressive curation impressive portfolio and kudos to you for recognizing this early getting in on it and then taking the time to educate everyone else on it really appreciate you and your leadership in this space yeah thank you guys and i you know i always say by the way if i get close with this we don't want um don't ever invest anything or buy nfts put more money into it than you can afford to lose because like everything in crypto there are booms and busts and so we just want to be mindful of that buy to collect and buy what you love there you go actually that's a better risk and disclaimer than i had dc they were i just i have to get through it uh none of this was financial advice folks of course eat this risky defy is risky nfts are risky as well you could lose what you put in make sure you are buying to curate and collect and what you like yeah buy what you like but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for
