but what do you bullish on in spite of all this David So DC investor put out a tweet and said do you think the people that bought ether at 120 are inconsolably upset that they did not buy at 80 no Source me ether bounce between 100 and 300 like four times between 2018 and 2020. so I say all of my sub 300 buys between 2018 and 2020 just blur into that one big dip I bought and what I am bullish on Ryan is that same thing happening all over again between one and two thousand dollars I think ether will bounce between one and two thousand dollars perhaps a couple times over the next 12 18 God forbid 24 months but then that period of time will just blur into that one big dip that we all bought as we all stuck through the bear Market together before it either goes to finally ten thousand dollars and Beyond
