Elon musk's ex obtains license to store transfer and trade Bitcoin and crypto maybe step back a little bit here and give some context Elon did payments in Bitcoin for Tesla right that went nowhere no one wants to use their Bitcoin as money well then has Elon learned from that maybe he has and what what are they going to integrate into this payments kind of platform when it comes to crypto exactly stable coins PayPal just announced their own stable coin I definitely think that stable coins are the more likely candidate yeah maybe you will be able to do Bitcoin as well but I highly doubt people are going to be using their Bitcoin for payments your Bitcoin Community is so funny like they've told us how valuable Bitcoin is never sell your Bitcoin and then they also want like Bitcoin to be used to buy a Tesla I don't encourage anybody to spend their eth on anything it is a store of value Asset all right
