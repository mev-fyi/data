bangla station welcome to our special edition podcast series this is the road to permission list we're talking to some of the biggest companies that are going to the permissionless conference david for people who don't know what permissionless is they are out there what is permissionless can you tell them oh permissionless is the cultural event of the year ryan you and i have worked tirelessly curating the best best conference content i think i've seen ever in a conference and ryan i've been to a lot of conferences there's three tracks there's the defy track there's the metaverse track and there's the institutional track populated by some of the best names in crypto we've got stani who's coming in we got uh ryan and i are gonna meet for the first time uh mariano conte is coming kevin o'walkie uh josh rosenthal from the crypto renaissance podcast episode he's gonna be there got evan mcmullen from disco we got people from the boys club uh gosh i could go on but it's some of my favorite people all in crypto who are the some of the uh have the just the best the speaking skills and i think it's gonna be some real good content out there and can't wait for that to to be and just about a week from now so that could that could just roll on up or over here pretty damn soon yes and there are some data analytics panels as well uh one of which i think nancy is going to be speaking on that is the guest we have today we have alex who is the ceo of nansen um they've grown since starting covid to a 120 person company which is absolutely amazing and the way they've done it is by analyzing on-chain data and creating a user interface and an app that produces alpha for people we actually get a chance to see that app demo today and i haven't been through a full demo it's pretty eye opening for me i know a whole bunch of people on the bankless team are like down deep into nansen i haven't yet had the pleasure so this was one of my first experiences with it and it's blown me away man this is the capabilities of it and how much you can glean into the on-chain data that's available so we are having that conversation with alex today on the road to permission list of course there still might be some conference tickets for you to go to permissionless if you are a bankless premium member there is a 30 discount and link in the show notes you can click and get that discount applied to david anything else before you get into this episode no i think this is going to be a great video for people who maybe they're on the edge about exploring nansen you'll be able to see what you can do with nancy nance and alex has i'm sure done the tutorial a number of times before this and so he's very very good at it now but this is what you're about to get you're about to get the dancing tutorial and you can see what people are clamoring about with dancing all right guys well with that let's dive right into our conversation with alex from nansen hey bankless nation welcome to another road to permissionless episode wow we're just counting down the days now it's uh getting really close and we're super excited to introduce you to the ceo of nansen which is uh one of my favorite analytics companies in the business alex svanovic he is the ceo and uh we're gonna learn a little bit about nansen and uh you know alex i want to start here maybe uh first could you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about the nansen story where'd you guys get started yeah happy too thanks for having me guys um my background is in ai i graduated from the university of edinburgh back in 2010 which says something about how old i am compared to a lot of people in crypto um i started my first ai company in 2010 before ai was was a thing that failed i would say not not a dramatic failure but it was an interesting lesson learned so i moved into management consulting for a few years did that for a while in very different industries everything from like seafood to banking insurance luxury retail then i worked in data science for a while after that as a data science manager and in 2017 i discovered ethereum so um i've been ignoring bitcoin for many years ethereum was the thing that kind of sold me on blockchains uh in particular and so it took a few months before like going from buying my first ether to diving down the rabbit hole and packing up moving from barcelona to hong kong to work full-time in crypto and uh yeah so i worked worked at a startup there for a while built out of data team uh again that sort of didn't work out so well uh so i started working a bit with xerox in 2019 when most people were feeling very gloomy about the markets and the end of 2019 is when evgeny lars and myself decided to co-found those which is a blockchain analytics platform which i'm happy to go into and actually maybe give you guys a demo of afterwards yeah i know i can't wait i i i'm curious because i gotta ask this point what grabs you about ethereum that um hadn't previously you know excited you about bitcoin i think um there are a few different things crypto is an interesting mix of intellectual curiosity and creed and so i think it was the there was like the ico boom uh happening in 2017 where uh i i guess from an investor uh perspective my my reasoning was that with bitcoin you don't know if you're betting on the wrong horse like you could you could believe in blockchains you could believe in crypto but how do you know bitcoin is the one that's gonna make it at the end of the day and become the dominant uh cryptocurrency with ethereum i i was thinking well this is a platform so it seems like you know statistically it's a higher chance that someone will create something on a theorem which is valuable and presumably some of the values are going to accrue back to the base layer that was just the investor perspective that immediately made it more interesting to me and the other perspective was that you could create uh applications permissionlessly which i i thought was a fascinating idea which i don't i think i don't have to i'm preaching to the choir here on that point um but yeah that's the other thing that i found really interesting and fascinating how you could you know just ship an application without asking anyone for permission no one can take it down and i could see that there was this incredible rate of innovation because of that property where people were building on each other's work um forking and you know all that stuff so i think those were the two main things the common combination of greed and uh and also or the investors perspective to put it more diplomatically and also just up the possibilities of what you can do with the theorem when did it become obvious that data analytics on a blockchain was the right play uh data people that are good at data generally have a good time in ethereum or in crypto at large um but when you got in during 2017 2018 the sophistication of on-chain activity just was not as crazy as it is today with like you know on-chain liquidity dex's swap wasn't even a thing so i was wondering like at what part in ethereum's history was it obvious that like nansen was gonna work out and that you should totally go start it it started as a project yeah so i think that's maybe the third point that attracted me to the blockchain space in particular that there was just so much data available and it was a nice mix of a lot of data that you could access but very few mature analytics applications or platforms at the time uh in fact i think the only thing that uh you know people sort of knew about in terms of on-chain analytics was chain analysis right which is used for more regulatory or compliance purposes but i always felt that you know this is something that the man in the arena should have access to that too as well right it's something that crypto investors should know about what's happening on the blockchain and so i think initially from as a data scientist i was looking a lot at just the apis that were available for market data i remember doing uh you know very very basic but still profitable arbs on like kraken versus coinbase just from using like the apis which is kind of ridiculous in hindsight that that was even possible doing like 10 arbs trading litecoin on kraken versus us versus coinbase um but i think the the the one data source that was the most fascinating was the on-chain data and that felt very unexplored i think people started with the market data because it's very analogous to the stock market you know and commodities and all that stuff you can sort of take your existing uh tools and frameworks and apply them to market prices and market data but enchanted was this kind of new thing that people were very fascinated by and this is something i learned after i started working in crypto so i think from a career perspective the intersection of crypto and data was fascinating because i had the data skills i had about 10 years experience well eight years experience working in data at that time and uh then the crypto part i figured if i can get good at the crypto and blockchain part not a lot of people can be very good you know at both of those things and work in intersections so just from a career perspective it seemed to make sense um but then the enchanter is the part that fascinated me and like as i worked in my first company in hong kong we were trying to create this crypto market intelligence platform that collected data from you know market prices social media and some enchanted but the enchantera was the part that again fascinated me and that's also what a lot of people were interested in when i was speaking to them if i was speaking to like a market maker a trader or even individual investors they were very often fascinated by these like mega transactions happening on the blockchain and they would often go viral right people would tweet about there's like a 100 million dollar transaction which is like almost seems like peanuts these days but back then it was huge right and so i figured you know how can you create a sustainable business on top of this as well and the thing that sort of finally clicked for me was that i think you do need to have some degree of proprietary data combined with the open public data and so that's kind of how nonsense was born with that insight that why don't we create a real world contextual layer on top of the on-chain data and just 10x the utility of the on-chain data itself because if you see the 100 million dollars that you know an unknown entity sent to another unknown entity that's less of a story than if you see alameda sending it to binance for example right so that that i think was the the the impetus for for creating uh nonsense and at the end of the day it's something that people wanted uh and we started small and there was a lot of interest very early on which allowed us to kind of just double down as people were happy to use our product and to also pay to use it to be honest one of one of the cool things about crypto is that it makes uh data analysis out of all of us uh i mean even just exploring ether scan and following tracks and seeing behavior there is a little bit of data analysis no matter what um but before we go exploring even more into nancy and what it can really do who is nansen4 is it for experts who like need like deep analytical tools or is it for casuals like me who just want to explore what people are up to with a particular nft like what is the average client base that nancy is building for a lot of people assume we built for the institutional base but i would say our sweet spot uh would be people like you guys people who have been in the space for a few years you have a sizeable crypto portfolio uh to the point where it makes sense to actually spend a bit of money on better tools to you know sort of level up your own investing or trading and so i would say something like 95 of our customers are basically people like us here in this call so um they're more sophisticated than the average uh i mean we could give debate whether the two of us are most of this than the average but but um but they're you know they're not the people who bought you know ether on coinbase first time last week right that's not our core audience right now so i think of it as kind of three main segments there's that kind of individual sort of power user and power investor if you will but still an individual investor that manages at least maybe a hundred thousand dollars worth of crypto and then over time i hope that nonsense will expand out into two directions and we have started uh doing this one is into the kind of longer tale of retail investors so that we can make nonsense more accessible to more people that's a common complaint that we get that is expensive and so on we want to make it more accessible in different ways to more people over time and then the other direction is to make it available to institutions as well and to uh provide them with different interfaces because many institutions they simply can't use our product today in a productive way because you have to go through the user interface so if you're like jump trading or you know you're some kind of uh highly professionalized trading desk you want to consume the data programmatically so that it can integrate with all the other systems right so those are kind of the two directions we're expanding into at the same time but traditionally it's been kind of the degen crypto investor that we've been focusing on alex i i'm wondering like because i would i would love to actually take a sneak peek into dancing maybe you give us a tour of it but uh before we do can you can you give us the i guess the value proposition of on-chain data or the new superpower that it sort of unlocks so david and i have a lot of conversations one recent conversation we were talking to a um a traditional investor who uh basically designed all sorts of analysis models for equities you know back in the day um got awards for this like you know national recognitions uh for some of the models that he designed in the equity space what's what what's striking is uh he came to us and said well there's not a way to assess crypto from a fundamentals perspective right as there is with equities and what's so striking with that is like uh are you sure about that i want to say to the traditional finance people because we are so early in the crypto journey but there is so much more data that we can actually analyze to actu to understand what the what the quote-unquote fundamentals of the future might look like for crypto and it strikes me the equities world they're just looking at a very tiny subset of data just kind of like the the market price trading type data whatever you know a 10k filing reveals but in crypto we get to see far deeper than the tip of the iceberg we get to see the entire thing like all of this is on chain can you make the case for what this really unlocks for somebody who's trying to understand an asset and some of the new models we might make based on on this in the future like what is it try to talk to the traditional investor who's just spent their lives trying to analyze equities and open the world to them to to what you can do with crypto data yeah so it kind of goes back to what i said uh when i started working in crypto in 2017 most people were using say traditional methods looking at market prices and so on but engine data is a very different type of data that you cannot really find an analog to in traditional finance so fundamentally engine data is literally just what's happening on a blockchain right so you can see which transactions are taking place in real time and so i might actually just share my screen here and we can take a look at what this looks like in practice can you see my screen now yes okay cool so this could be a little bit overwhelming to some people there's a lot of stuff on the screen here but um i think before i start poking around because there's a good chance we'll fall down some kind of rabbit hole as we look into some something here um i i would say fundamentally on-chain data helps people discover new opportunities because it is really the kind of primary source of crypto data it's what's literally happening on the blockchain in real time so discovering which d5 protocols people are using which tokens people are accumulating which nft collections people are flipping that kind of stuff comes directly from the blockchain because that's where the activity takes place that's the first part to discover those opportunities the other part is to perform due diligence so if you know about these let's say you know you're looking at azuki so maybe i can start looking at some of the stuff here these are just some widgets that sort of highlight stuff that you might be interested in right and so hot nfts that's something a lot of people care about and these are just the collections that have been traded the most in the last 24 hours across different nft marketplaces and so okay now i know you know azuki is the most traded uh collection um you could you could in fact drill drill down here and look into nft paradise and we could look at uh sort of a more complete view of the different collections that are traded a lot in the last 24 hours it's a pretty red day i think across all markets today to be honest it's a bit of a mayhem going on um on multiple fronts but azuki is number one here in volume measured in e and sometimes you can discover new collections here like this one pxn ghost division this smart contract was deployed five days ago so it's a relatively new collection that many people might not have heard about well now you've heard about it because you can see it just here on the screen popping up directly from people's trading activity right so that's the the first part just to discover new opportunities and you can also look into things like what people are minting so these are new collections uh looks like there's no fomo level high collections being minted right now but you can look into the different collections here and see also uh you know who are the different addresses that have been making the most profit uh minting nft collections and then selling them later on and so before i before i go further uh one distinction between nonsense and pretty much all other uh onshore analytics platforms is that we don't only have the transactional data that you can get out of the blockchain we also have more than 120 million addresses labeled up in different ways which gives you this understanding of which wallets are actually making money flipping nfps and maybe you should follow that maybe you should set up a smart alert which will give you a notification every time this address does something which you can you know tailor uh as you want right and so um this is kind of how i view onshore data it just gives you kind of an x-ray vision on blockchains and you can keep drilling down right if you look at azuki what's actually going on there there's a lot of volume it looks like on that so i want to figure out what's actually happening with the price action i think that looks like the price has actually been going down a lot i saw on twitter that uh one of the founders uh people found out that they've been involved with a few other nft collections that uh effectively did not succeed but you can actually see here how did the market react to that at a very granular level right these are individual trades of azuki's happening in the last few days and you can see a lot of people it looks like started selling uh around may 10 12 and the price has been going down right so there's one high purchase up here at 61e and we can click into this i'll just leave that for afterwards but we can look at what that 61 purchase actually was but we see smart nft buyers so these are nft buyers that typically have made money you know investing in nfts it looks like a lot of smart nfp buyers were actually scooping up these because these are showing the buyers right so they were scooping these one up these ones up while others were uh dumping them at a relatively low price compared to where it used to be by the way this is the this is actually a spirit it looks like spirit azuki so we don't have to go too down the ra far down the rabbit on azuki's but this kind of stuff just immediately right we started at the top here we spotted azuki and you can go all the way down and figure out that hey you know this uh this spirit where azuki was traded at um at 61 ether recently and also that some smart money are buying the dip let's say on azuki no no investment advice here do your own research um but this is kind of an example of what you can see and this is not you don't just do this with nfts right you can do this with with tokens as well and there was one i don't know how how far we're gonna want to go down that rabbit hole but i can show you something i was looking at just the last night um i think we're on the same page here this is data i want to look at yeah so it's pretty interesting with um with uh what's happening with uh terra us usd right or ust uh right now uh i think in real time the the peg is kind of all over the place and one thing that i wanted to look into was just these curved pools where people are trading effectively one stable coin for another and you can provide liquidity for them right and so this chart uh is showing um the balance of ust and also the price of ust uh and you can see the price has suffered a pretty brutal drawdown way off the peg at this point and you can also see how to some extent how certain entities have been uh interacting with this pool like how much of the funds have been coming in from actually via other platforms too like one inch uh other curve pools power swap which is an aggregator but then also certain market makers like wintermute uh you see funds like block tower and so on and you can see like the largest transactions happening um you know uh some of these are most of these are like above one million dollars because we filtered out the largest ones here um and you can see just certain elite uniswap v3 liquidity providers um basically dumping this is uh wrapped ust so it's you know wrapped terra usd into this into this pool anyway so yeah there's a lot of rabbit holes you can go down but it helps you understand what's actually happening on the blockchain instead of just seeing what people are talking about on twitter so i think you need both perspectives to succeed in crypto you need kind of the social network and people's expertise and to be honest uh some of the panic and euphoria as well but you need to understand what people are actually doing on chain and that's what entre data can help you with so how much of nansen's data comes from you guys manually with your human brains identifying addresses as in like the name of this nft collection is azuki so we'll type that in versus nansen crawling through the blockchain and saying okay this is an nft being minted and they are the the app just like processes that data ahead of time so how much of this is manual and how much of this algorithmic built into the product yeah so you know more than 99.99 of the labels are uh automatically uh collected three different methods um there's no one silver bullets it's not like we have one algorithm just that just magically does this it's more like we have um a pool of different heuristics algorithms techniques that we can use and those feed off of each other as well like if we can figure out hey this wallet belongs to alameda then we can look at the transactional graphs of alameda and often tag up addresses that they have interacted with right so it's really a combination of different methods some of the tags technically you can pull them out from the blockchain data itself so for example sushi suave pool unisoft v3 pool we just looked at the deployment events of those smart contracts because each pool has a smart contract and we can figure out which tokens are in them right and then we can tag them up through heuristics that we get the data for through the blockchain data itself but a lot of this stuff comes from say off-chain sources right so there's nowhere in the blockchain that it's written alameda so like how how do you know that right or there's nowhere directly in the blockchain that you find uh first mover staking um label so this is there's a comment conceptually there's a combination of two things here one is like entities so alameda is an entity uh we would also say unit swap as an entity and then there's behavioral tags like first mover staking so this is someone that put a lot of funds into a staking pool shortly after that statement pool was deployed which indicates that they're kind of on top of their game when it comes to being you know first into things maybe taking a lot of risk as well um so it's really you know mostly algorithmic but importantly there are some addresses that you you just can't figure out automatically you need humans to label them and of course you need humans to make these algorithms and heuristics too so we have a team of close to 20 people and also collaborators in different forms something we call nonsense scouts who are helping us with labeling and we have a whole system of kind of combining the automated labels with the manual manually curated ones and there's a whole qa process that goes into it and all that stuff so it's really a combination of man and machine um is the summary that's where your ai uh ai skills come in i imagine alex you developed yes yeah but but i would say we we've really only scratched the surface when it comes to ai powered labeling so uh so yeah my background is an ai right and i know that you can very quickly dive into ai powered methods too early and my two co-founders are data engineers as well and they had seen that mistake being done many times before so we decided to spend a lot of time building a really good data infrastructure and it's actually only now that we we're starting to use more ai powered tools uh or techniques in the product maybe one thing i can just briefly show you without getting too excited here is if we go to nft paradise and you go to price prediction we have um we've trained machine learning models to predict the price of different nfp collections so each model is trained on each collection and it looks like historical transactions and also it looks at the traits data so if you wanted to look at doodles for example we would be able to uh although now i just realized i might get confused on where we go i think i can go on nft uh profiler and then we could go into doodles i don't know do number 69 and this gives you kind of an overview of the doodle itself and like the trading history but you also have this price prediction tab uh which breaks down like the estimated price that the model thinks uh this is worth and also it uh highlights what are the traits that are most impactful in making that appraisal and so 60 of this appraisal comes effectively from the fact that it has a blue blue nerd here uh so and you can see how the price of this has evolved and the green price here is is the floor price of the blue prices for this individual nft and this is like powered by machine learning we don't have like a team of manual appraisers in the back end this is all like machine learning power yes this stuff is so cool i i feel i feel sorry for people with their bloomberg terminals do you know like trying to like it because what you've just showed us and all of this is available on chain but i i think what you said alex is like your target market is is basically sort of the amateur crypto investor and i can already see like about a hundred things you can do with this data and something like nansen that you can't do in in the traditional world the traditional finance world right imagine being able to trade like follow the all of the warren buffett's all of the the top investors and see the moment they purchase something what they're actually buying imagine being able to cohort them and seeing like what actions they're taking imagine if you are um in the market for a particular nft uh like doing the analysis on what's a good price so so many times i go to the nft market alex i'm like i don't know how much this thing should cost i have like no idea it's all very subjective and arbitrary but you're actually putting hard data around it so i could see that something like this would be a tool in the tool belt for any amateur investor who's doing anything in the space like you save i don't know a few thousand dollars on an nft and this is more than pays for itself or there's a an opportunity alert in nansen and like what's your roi on that 5x10x i i'm curious how much something like this costs we haven't gotten to the pricing but you've piqued my interest how expensive is this you know you said it was for the amateur investor but what does that look like yeah so so first of all every anyone can try uh to use the live version of monster for free okay so you just go to nonsen.ai and you you'll find a a button there a button there to to sign up uh but if you if you want to pay for standard which has pretty much you know everything we've looked at so far it's 149 a month so some people look at that it's expensive i think that their baseline is like netflix which is a consumption item right but this is like an investment that should help you with the with investments and i think um a lot of the others other people who work on the more institutional professional side they're like you guys have to raise your prices because it's like it's too it's too accessible almost right so it depends a bit on your on your uh frame of reference but i think it's definitely worth like obviously it's worth trying out the free version and of course i would highly recommend people to test out the standard version which has pretty much everything we looked at for now there's also a vip option which gives you things like downloadable data you just more smart alerts it gives you advanced filtering uh as well as early access to new features and there's also an alpha offering which is kind of research research community in addition to the vip plan um which yeah so those are basically the pricing plans we have a few other things on the horizon like there's a programmatic uh offering as well nonsense query uh which is more interesting for like institutions and so on but uh yeah those are the different options you have i'm blown away this is really cool how are you guys handling uh layer two and the proliferation of all of these various chains are you gonna be able to bring all of those into nansen as well yeah so um you know a few years ago i think when i was also following uh you guys on twitter uh and i still do follow you of course um i i was of the belief that ethereum is gonna be kind of the only train uh ever and i was kind of like i was i was i'd say i was like an idea of maximalist uh i think i've changed my view in the last few years where i think that there's room for different chains for different use cases that make different trade trade-offs and so um initially with nelson we were 100 focused on ethereum and then it was always clear that we have to move into layer 2 as well to support different l2s and then i think you know we started realizing there's a lot of edm chains uh for example avalanche a c chain b and b chain you know polygon and so on and we decided to add support for them uh afterwards but we do have uh some l2s already so we have arbitrary for example support for that and we have some side chains like um ronin phantom polygon um polygon i don't know if there's we've settled the debate if that's like a side chain or l2 um but but regardless i think this is a trend that's happening it just makes sense that people will start using different chains whether it's you know side chains or completely different chains like terra or solana uh or if it's just um l2s right so if you look at arbitram we do have support for a few things uh already now so you can look at nft trading on arbitrary uh for example so this is a similar type of view that we looked at earlier and here instead of open c actually with the theorem of open c looks rare uh x2 y2 and a few other marketplaces but with arbitrary we have treasure which is the main marketplace for arbitrary so you can look at things like small brands um and you also have things like you know token god mode if you wanted to understand like hey what are people you you saying what are they doing with their usd coins you know what are they farming on on arbitrary you could look into that and see where all these like usdc uh all these usdc's on our bedroom are actually sitting so the top balances looks like stargate uh usdclp token is the primary destination of usdc on arbitrary so this to me is also very helpful if you are not that familiar with an l2 or another chain you can sort of just poke around and look at token god mode for example for a specific stable coin and see where people have parked these stable coins so like gms incredible is another one yeah so token god mode basically means like everywhere usd is you're seeing that in one in one kind of dashboard everywhere usd is on on arbitrome you see get to see all of the like the supply syncs for it pretty much and so you can see the top balances here and so like 70 percent of all the usbc on arbitrary sitting in stargate wow uh 12 is sitting in gmx right um 4.2 percent and curve and then you can see balance changes in the last week where do you see the largest changes so i can sort this and this one is like an unknown one which we you know if you wanted to drill down on that it's like you know we don't have to go too deep um but you can right click on stuff and you can create smart alerts and drill deeper um you can also see bridges right like multi-chain any usdc and so you know let's actually let's open that because it's kind of cool um evo d5 i'm not sure what that is maybe some project and then another thing you can see here is you can look at multi-chain different multi-chain dashboards so another perspective which is a bit more sort of bird's-eye view is just what kind of applications are people using on arbitrage right so usdc is actually one of the uh one of the entities that you see a lot of activity around um treasure which is the nft marketplace is actually the second most active smart contract uh if we just look at how many events it emits after rap ether gmx is another big one that we saw already in usdc sushi swap is big so this is it's a good way to kind of just navigate uh the the world and like that's one of the value propositions i think where nonsense becomes more useful in a multi-chain multi-layered world because it's going to be harder and harder to keep an overview of all this stuff and i think the way we want to take the direction we want to take nonsense is to effectively build the information super app of web3 and so if you can have good coverage of the different l2s the different chains that people use it's going to be a lot easier to understand flow of funds what people are doing if you have all that stuff in one place if you have to jump between like 20 different uh information providers for 20 different l2s or chains i think that becomes really hard it's a it's a healthy thing to have alternatives of course but i also think that people want to have a unified view to understand the flow of funds between different chains between different layers i think it's so cool like an episode david and i recently uh did was where we compared sort of ethereum to kind of like you know a nation-state level economy and all of these layer twos and other side chains it's almost like states within within that economy and this is like being able to like right-click view source see all of the industrial stats of like the state of california what you're just showing at manson and it's just like incredible that we have the this level of window into into a digital economy this way it's it's completely unchained invisible and the way you've you've laid it out it's very easy to get the high level of okay what are the major commercial industries in this economy what's actually fueling it what's new what are the successful applications at this point in time you know how many how much funds are flowing through it at any given time very interesting to see this yeah i couldn't agree more i always find it fascinating that like why don't all economists just like drop whatever they do i don't care thank you why why don't they yeah it's it's it's weird because it's it's like you have the cleanest data in the world yeah and it's like a toy at this point it's like it's a toy economy but it's become so big that it's actually a real economy like you know the cryptocon is larger than most countries economists at this point right depending on depending on how you measure it um so yeah i mean i i love that analogy i think it makes perfect sense yeah and as a as you said as there's there's going only going to become more data on every single chain and it's also only going to become more and more chains uh and so as our ecosystem improves and actually can do cooler stuff i would imagine so can nansen uh interpret data better and provide more and more useful information so eventually we'll just be able to have a a single front page for just global commerce uh which will be pretty damn cool yeah that'd be that'd be really cool uh i do think that you know that nation building analogy it makes a lot of sense also i want to pull this back to the uh origin of our name which uh nonsense actually comes from a polar explorer and they they actually the there's a kind of a the analogy goes goes kind of further in the sense that he was a polar explorer he went to the north pole further north and had anyone had ever done his ship also was used to reach the south pole for the first time by another polar explorer and i kind of look at blockchains and the metaverse as almost like a continuation of that into the infinity right because it's we're kind of discovering we've discovered all the let's say all the land on on earth right but the next thing with the metaverse and so on is that we're actually creating new countries right and blockchains are kind of the economic financial fabric of these countries and you want to have the right tools with you on that journey on that expedition into these new places and so i think there is that analogy makes a lot of sense like countries economies and it kind of is tied back to this to the name of our company which is about exploring all these new countries all these new economies i'm looking at this nancy guy he looks like a total badass right here yeah he was pretty badass like i recommend reading um this is his boat this is the boat that's that's it actually that's a tiny boat to go from poland i was thinking like a shackleton's boat which was a lot bigger this does not look like shackleton's yeah oh yeah so i mean without geeking out too much on this stuff his theory was basically that we can take this ship and build it in a very special way so that it's so robust that it can get encapsulated into the ice and the ice will carry us over the north pole over multiple years so he convinced you know 12 guys to come with him on this journey and they just it actually worked but they drifted a bit off course so we have to do like the last leg skiing with his dogs with one of the other guys but yeah he's pretty much amazing well uh we we're a big fan of exploring metaphors here on bank list and so as we go to explore permissionless alex i think you'll be joining us in that exploration as well what's nancy's goals for a permissionless who are you guys looking to meet uh what talent i'm imagining you guys are hiring what talent are you looking for and what kind of relationships are you looking to build over at the conference yeah so namsan was actually launched uh right after covet started so it's a very much remote first company and i look at conferences as you know primarily a way to connect with the rest of the community in in real life right so but but secondarily it's also a chance for the team to get together right and i think it's similar for many crypto companies you can hear that ryan yeah david are going to get together for the first time so we're pretty excited oh man so you've never met in person no we had the covid story too and then uh david's been journeying and we haven't met in person but yeah so plus one the whole the whole company's getting together permissionless as well yeah that's so cool my two co-founders also have never met in person not just me david so uh yeah so that's actually a huge reason like why we why we we travel there but also just meeting with like uses of nonsense i think it's always really fun going to conferences sometimes people recognize me and they'll be like dude i made so much money flipping nfts using them and it's kind of hilarious it's hilarious every time and then you know we want to uh we do we are hiring actively we will cross 120 people very soon um so it's becoming like a decently sized organization which means we can do more fun stuff together uh and yeah we're hiring like engineers analysts um yeah pretty much uh all over the space i would say engineers and analysts are the two prioritized roles that we're heading for yeah what's that like are those hard roles to fill i would imagine those are scarce resources these days oh yeah absolutely i think in particular engineers is very very hard like it's there are just so many companies that have raised a ton of money and um i think the only way you can really compete is by well not the only way there are two ways you can compete as an employer let's say or a workplace number one it's just really focused on creating a really good workplace and we explicitly have as one of our three company goals to create the number one workplace in crypto so that's something we take very very seriously um the other thing you can do is of course to just one unique thing about nonsense if you're interested in crypto data like having all this data at your fingertips is really fun so if you're like a data engineer or you have a data science background or if you're a software engineer who is excited about data it's just really fun to just get the chance to build these prototypes for things internally um so yeah it is very very competitive but i do think that you know there are different ways we can be created about trying to attract the right people well alex i'm looking forward to seeing you and meeting you for the first time i was joking with you when we hopped into the stream that you were one of those people that i've seen just around the twitter sphere and around just the metaverse i can't actually remember if we met in real life or not but uh sounds like we will be meeting in real life down in the conference so i look forward to it my man alex uh thank you so much bankless listeners of course there may still be time to get your permissionless ticket by the time you listen to this but it's 98
