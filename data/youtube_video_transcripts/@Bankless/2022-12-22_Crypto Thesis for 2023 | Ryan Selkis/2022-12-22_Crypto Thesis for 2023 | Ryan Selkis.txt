foreign [Music] is bringing on his crypto Theses for 2023 in today's episode fantastic way to end the year and look at the next year David what are we talking about today every single year Ryan sulcus comes with a massive document that is a fantastic way to snapshot the year it always feels like this uh document that comes out every single year out of Missouri that Ryan selka spends weeks producing it's a great way to tie a bow on one year and look forward into the next so while this is a snapshot of 2022 it is also Ryan's 2022 crypto Theses and so this is just for all of the the tunnel vision that we've got focusing on SPF and FTX and contagion this is a nice way to zoom all the way back and talk about just the trends across the industry which I'll remind the bank listeners it's very Broad and wide so Trends in Bitcoin Trends in ethereum Trends in D5 Trends and nfts Trends in C5 uh and gotta unpack we do have to pack the the regulatory landscape the the grayscale and dcg landscape and a number of other different uh topics such as who to pay attention to in 2023 uh if you were on that list that prior list who to pay attention to in 2021 and 2022 uh it was either a very good or bad list depending on who you are yeah exactly guys uh speaking of who to pay attention to uh we think you should be paying attention to our friends and sponsors over at Kraken David this is a crypto uh platform that didn't rug people in 2022 and they've been at this for like 10 years providing secure solid service well uh it feels like everyone else was a number of of other competitors were getting distracted by the newest bright shining object in in crypto Kraken was just serving the industry without fail and it's really remained a a rock during 2022. what should our listeners know about Kraken David yeah after interviewing uh Jesse Powell and investing getting a little bit more into to Kraken the ethos behind what crack it is really aligns with me and and makes me feel good about having them as our strategic sponsor moving forward into 2023 so this is going to be a long-term ongoing relationship uh because the way that they are building that exchange is I think the product that the crypto industry deserves especially with their emphasis on user verification of exchange liabilities is aligned with the ethos of crypto where we use cryptography to empower individuals to verify don't trust and so we think this is a great strategic sponsor for Bank lists moving forward into 2023 and we're excited to work with Kraken moving forward and if you would like to learn more about Kraken there is a link in the show notes to go and get started with Kraken also kraken.com okay David in addition to uh the Theses that we go over with Ryan selkis there's also a kind of a bonus section to this episode where uh we ended the episode we finished we we hit the stop recording button but there I there's one question I really wanted to ask a question about crypto media uh and this news about uh the block which is a crypto media publication being secretly owned by SBF so we get into some of that as well in a bonus episode that will provide for bankless listeners but apart from that what else should folks be aware of going to this episode yeah it's just a broad Trend download so it moves pretty fast Ryan's got some very broad takes and because of how ingrained in this industry he is he can connect so many different parts of the industry to other parts of the industry and that's really the way to get a broad snapshot of what the hell is this hit of crypto at the end of 2022 and moving forward into 2023. we talk about CZ and Brian as the last in the remaining exchange leaders we talk about Anatoly and the state of the Solana Eagles system we go through the anatomy of a crypto credit crisis and selkis calls the grayscale trade cryptos Widowmaker there's just so many topics to pay attention to and just as you are listening to this listener remember that all of these topics in crypto hyper thread with each other and it we are one industry where this is one spot and so the trends in C5 relate to the trends in D5 relate to the trends in nfts so as you are paying attention to this make sure to connect all of the dots to all the other dots that we are talking about as we go through this podcast all right guys we're going to get right to our episode with Ryan selkis but before we do we want to tell you about these tools to help you go bankless arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum one producing flourishing D5 and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social adapts like Reddit are also

we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own main specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network bankless Nation we have Ryan selkis on the episode today and we're diving into his crypto Theses for 2023 super excited to get into these topics I've been reading these since forever since I've been in crypto always jam-packed full of insight information how many pages is this one Ryan uh this one's a beast I think it's uh 168 but that includes the you know the cover and the disclaimers and you know all the other garbage so 168 Pages yeah uh anyway welcome to bank list it's great to have you on again um okay a word for the year David and I were talking about this uh but like you got 168 Pages a lot of words if you were to summarize 2022 and give it a word what word would you give it well something that pops into mind right now well I think that depends if you're looking forward or looking backwards I think if you're if you're looking at the urine review it's let's Look Backwards 2022 won't work yeah okay full Mr T mean right um I think if you're looking forward um I don't want to call it relief but I I think optimism is is a pretty good starting point um and we'll get into that I think the big thing that happened this year is the core crypto thesis remains unchanged over the next 10 years um one thing that did slow pretty significantly is is you know the institutionalization or the the wall streetification of crypto um and that's got its its benefits and and its drawbacks but um I think uh most of the damage most of the pain this year was certainly uh in the latter Camp versus the the true decentralization uh and and and you know some of those core projects that uh that are going to be the backbone for this economy David I like that word we were debating some words back and forth uh contagion you said yield was another hubris uh shortcuts but I think pain that gets right to the point my God 2022 is painful it's it's a it's a good word because I think it's you know obviously from the economics of it it's been a pretty disastrous year for investors but um you know I remember listening to your your podcast when when this turmoil was really uh hitting its peak and uh and just listening to David like I could feel I could feel some of that up of like we've been building here for so long and it's just so disappointing right what's going on right it's like the the the the the parent like being you know disappointed not mad uh we were past the anger phase at one point and um and I think everybody you know had some type of Moment Like That of a dejection in the fall um and you know once reality settles in and you realize okay this is you know just another con artist just like anyone else uh the industry is is going to be just fine and and yeah the core remains then you can you can get to rebuilding and have some optimism for the new year Ryan uh Mr sulcus uh one of the reasons why I like these crypto Theses at the end of the year is that it's such a cohesive and comprehensive snapshot of where we are in time uh it's a moment to reflect it's a moment to look back on 2022 and to take to make informed takes as to what happens in 2022 and how is it going to determine what 2023 is like and so you've created a number of different overarching themes and so looking at the table of contents I'll just kind of like read out the themes uh the top 10 narratives and investment themes top 10 people to watch top 10 Trends in CFI top 10 Trends in policy Bitcoin and crypto dollars top 10 ethereum and layer 1 Trends uh and then it continues into the second page top 10 Trends in D5 top 10 Trends in nfts and decentralized social top 10 Trends in Dallas and web 3 and then of course some bonus content as well uh and so uh I I think uh we're definitely going to be touching on the SPF contagion and all the content that bankless listeners and everyone in crypto space has uh hammered gotten hammered into their heads over the last few months but I think what we also want to do is kind of get back to Our Roots let's talk about the trends in D5 let's talk about the trends in nfts and so using the your Theses for 2023 and Beyond I think we should just get back to some of the basics as to what is at the very root of this industry using some of the uh the the trends that you've identified here so to start off this conversation going at the from the top top 10 narratives and investment themes there's two sections I wanted to pull out uh you open the section with winter is here it's time to build and then also a section crypto is still inevitable and I actually remember I think almost every one of your these documents has a section like this which is the crypto is inevitable section uh and it's just a nice refresher to remind ourselves that yo this technology is coming to steamroll over the world it's different now because of what's happened happened in the last year so Ryan while you were writing this section about why crypto is still inevitable what was different this year that really bolstered your confidence to be able to once again say that crypto is still inevitable inevitable why is after all of 2022 why is crypto still inevitable to you well I think my favorite slide that we've made as a company is is this one that's in the deck or in the presentation in that section uh which which really lays it out in full detail and uh it basically outlines uh Three core drivers um which is uh you know generation change you know we kind of evolve you know one year at a time uh to a more digitally native Generation Um the second is just the in the influx of talent that we've seen this cycle and the level of talent is you know at a significantly you know a higher Mark than we've seen in any cycle previous and in terms of business Talent legal Technical and then there's just dry powder right like real dollars that are on these balance sheets for for different projects whether it's infrastructure um you know related companies or whether you're talking about the projects themselves and their treasuries that wasn't the case last time around right like a lot of these icos they raise any they crash and eat well or they're raised and had these big kind of native token treasuries but they didn't really have much dry powder and so you know a bunch of projects you know fell by the wayside and then more than anything you've got a number of uh stepwise you know uh you know upticks in in Innovation and like zero to one progress in defy in nfts in Dao's layer 2 uh kind of scaling the ethereum merge another cycle of you know Bitcoin kind of proving its its yeah Bona fides as as a a a very censorship resistant digital commodity that can be a form of money for people and and you know uh that need a store of value that they can you know secure in their head and move across borders with um and then stable coins which continue to have record months month over month right so um both the kind of derivatives that sit on top of of crypto rails and then any of the crypto Primitives themselves um have just continued to see you know pretty tremendous growth cycle over cycle and even though the dollar you know values are down and now some of the volumes are down it's still a higher low versus the previous cycle number one and number two there's sturdier foundations uh because of the capital talent and and just you know compounding growth of Open Source so um it's um it's I guess it's like a crypto Twist on uh you know Jeff Bezos quip on on the stock market and I think the Bezos Warren Buffett you know maybe it's a a few folks you can attribute this to about the the market being you know a voting Machine versus a weighing station right in the long term versus the short term they're two different things and um and we're certainly seeing a lot of people vote uh for the exit uh right now but the weight of crypto is still getting heavier and heavier right and and I don't think that that's going to change it's going to be very difficult to displace um so that's one thing that I come back to and and for someone that's been through multiple Cycles it's somewhat easier to feel a little bit of relief uh right now uh because you almost feel like the air is near fully out of the balloon and you can kind of get back to okay where now that the tide is has kind of washed out you you see you know not only who's swimming naked but where all the dead bodies are and and now you know you know what what was real and what is going to have some staying power that you can build around for the next cycle and we've seen that in 2013 and 2014 in 2017 and 2018 and we're going to see it again in 2122. um so I I think you know that's you know glass half full I think a thing that makes you know crypto um pretty powerful and on that note of looking backwards as to some of the things that we've said previously in previous Market Cycles I just wanted to pull out this quote from the surviving winter redo Redux uh and uh you were citing yourself that you had written at the top of the bull market I just want to pull this out here in addition to eating big paper or real losses you'll see people having breakdowns go bankrupt due to over leverage or poor tax planning quit otherwise promising projects turn nasty depressed or apathetic and generally lose sight of the longer term potential of crypto at the same time the Grassroots crypto herd will thin out because it's tougher to wage war when you've lost 90 of your savings and need to find a real job this was actually not a part of your thesis document this was a you citing an earlier thing that you wrote at this top of the bull market and then you continue in your in this thesis for 2023 and you ask the reader do you still believe if you're reading this report there's a good chance that you do but are now wondering how to best navigate a prolonged winter the answer is as simple as it is challenging and glamorous built in many respects it's easier to build in Bear markets and bull markets there are fewer distractions real product Market fit becomes easier to identify without the noise of a token and the weak and Flaky contributors wash out of the market Ryan I can tell from this section in this uh in this document and just knowing you uh bear markets excite you and maybe you could pass a little bit of that excitement onto the listener why should they get excited to build during a bear market and why is this just another part of the crypto cycles that that uh people that have seen a thing or two like you uh just know what's up well I would phrase this slightly differently I'd say the um uh the slope of Enlightenment excites me right I don't I don't take any Joy uh in seeing my personal net worth go down or seeing people get blown up or you know yeah exactly like I'm not I'm not like some of these Twitter space hosts right that are are just like you know Doom pouring uh the yeah just shamelessly and and and you know kind of uh capitalizing in the situation I think um I I think it's uh it's you know somewhat disgusting uh it's for for people to get you know some some pleasure out of this um so I certainly wouldn't say that like that part of the bear Market the Steep decline right this this you know catastrophe that we've had this year is enjoyable but when you do find a bottom it's not going to be a v-shaped recovery and some people are going to get apathetic and they'll wash out but for the rest of us that's when it feels like okay we're we're on more stable grounds all of the folks that we didn't really you know think were going to be here for the long term have washed out um and yeah the people that we were you know jiving with and and that we thought were going to be long-term Builders and and contributors and and you know we're doing things for the right reasons and really excited about them for the right reasons they're still here and by the way now they're getting a lot more oxygen and attention um that's that's I think the exciting part and um and and if you kind of come in with that mindset there's plenty of problems to solve uh within the industry and every single cycle the biggest problems from the previous cycle tend to be solved and the solutions uh providers uh end up having the next unicorns that and in the cycle that ensues so um it's uh it's it's a pretty good entrepreneurial feedback loop actually if you're looking for ideas and and if you're you know actually committed to the long term I think that's worth uh just emphasizing is that this product feedback cycle and being able to build inside of a bear Market where you have so much signal is unique it's a unique opportunity during the parts of the Cycles uh during that you don't get that in the manic part of the cycle what you do get in the bear Market is a lot of signal for product Builders to understand that they are actually building something inherently useful and to also take some of the idealized features of what made a Mania a Mania nfts for example and actually execute on that while shedding some of the the short-term uh things that only actually last in the in the peak of a bull market all right so celkis um 10 people to watch all right we're we're in the in the bear Market in this build uh season of course um who should we be watching right now I I noticed uh one of your picks were two exchange operators uh CZ and Brian Armstrong and uh you tied them they're tied for the number one leaders of the two largest Central exchanges left the central exchanges left uh can you believe SBF would have been on this list a year ago probably now completely gone but coinbase and binance so why these two why are they two individuals uh to watch particularly coming out of this year well it's interesting you say that because last year in the report I did refer to coinbase finance and and FTX is the three biggest exchanges to watch maybe um so we were watching it collapse we're definitely watching for uh for all the wrong reasons um I think uh you know looking backwards FTX probably had the most hype institutional momentum and and political momentum out of the three that's obviously come crashing down and been exposed to be a house of cards the other two remain but the other two are front and center for I would argue the right reasons and that's because of their volumes uh and trading dominance being finance and then their custody um uh market share being coinbase right because you know coinbase is a mega custodian in its own right but it also custodies the grayscale uh trust so you know has 11 um of all the Bitcoin in circulation yeah 16 of all the eth you know 11 of maybe the other uh you know Camp of of uh cryptos so it is um just a massive uh Market participant which everybody knows but just to put that in perspective you know you are talking about um 10 of the economy uh and crypto essentially is is safeguarded by coinbase so um how those two CEOs you know kind of navigate the next couple of years I think is going to be you know pretty critical um and for CZ I think the challenges are really going to be headline risk related and Regulatory and legal in nature um I think that there's a lot of uh fear uncertainty doubt around binance right now we've seen this in the last couple of weeks uh really pick up steam and my um my Nuance take of of whether that's good or bad is I think it's overblown I think the the fud is overblown but I think it's good if it reduces that market share and it disperses some of that trading volume because it is I think unhealthy for the industry to have that much Reliance on on your kind of one centralized Exchange um and I would actually argue that for binance they will be healthier if there are several other you know very large competitors that are kind of going back and forth to them in terms of the volume lead um with coinbase you know it's somewhat similar um but I think their fate and and really their their success is going to hinge um on the U.S regulatory situation and um and how effectively you know they're able to uh thread the needle the next couple years assuming that we don't get comprehensive legislation I don't expect that we're going to get comprehensive oversight uh legislation you know basically until we we have a new Administration um and we can maybe get into that in the policy section the next character that we wanted to pull out of this section is that that was number one number one tied for first with CZ and Brian Armstrong I want to skip over to number five Anatoly yakovenko and the quote that I really liked here was that I saw firsthand how hard it was to kill Anatoly and his team in the last bear Market in my eyes that's the leading predictor of long-term success in crypto as such I'd expect the Solana core team and ecosystem to persevere once again but can they ascend to new heights Ryan sulcus could you unpack a little bit as to how and and why you put Anatolia in Solana as the number five person to watch in 2023 I think that they were the largest alt they were or are the largest alt L1 community that is an evm compatible right um so in terms of other you know base layer blockchains um that are using a fundamentally different design than ethereum um I think uh Solana has been the project to watch and and it certainly attracted you know arguably the the second most developer attention outside of ethereum um it had a an absolutely you know crazy parabolic run in 2021 but there's also been quite a bit of innovation um uh around that community and interestingly they've made a big effort in Mobile right I think what they're doing with the Solana phone and and the Solana mobile stack um is a differentiator and and it is you know pretty pretty interesting uh in attracting developer Talent if you're excited about you bringing like crypto to the masses you know through through handheld devices because you can't just necessarily trust Apple and Android are going to let those apps through so I think for those reasons it is in a league of its own in some respects you can look at where it stands from a market cap ranking now and it's obviously you know slid pretty significantly especially given the the size of stake that FTX had a lot of those early investors um you know there could be some some overhangs some some sell side pressure that's still kind of embedded in that in that ecosystem when you just talk about the token but when you're talking about the developers and the tech um I would say that they are you know the the leading Contender for the second crypto operating system if you will um uh Cosmos being you know kind of similarly situated uh maybe maybe slightly behind um and and traditionally that's what you've seen in Mobile and the browser Wars and PC operating systems you've seen you know two major players and you know this duopoly and then a basically you know a pretty steep order of magnitude drop off for the the other players after that um so will they be able to consolidate some of that market ownership around this second you know uh alts L1 stack so on this uh people to watch thing right um what what's interesting is how quickly people in this industry can go from like hero to villain right and you know um so last year uh on your list dokwan actually made number 10. uh and these are people to watch these are not necessarily people that uh I know you are saying like yeah this is like the S.I curse or the Madden Curse but also but but but but also um you know Sam was on it two years ago Barry was saying two years ago Zuzu Kyle samani what do you make of this right it's like it's just this whole people to watch there's an element of yes I totally agree Brian Armstrong and CZ are people to watch we want to understand kind of what they're saying and also a major mistake I feel like we've made this this um uh bull cycle is we paid too much attention to these demagogues and to these you know Icarus hubris types of individual individuals who who kind of rallied uh uh rallied you know populist messages and and you know Twitter armies all of these things um so I agree that we want to watch people but also like what what do you make of that Dimension should we be not watching people should like the actual people to be watching should it just be the protocols or what is this interplay between you know people and and code and the tech and how much this industry is led by leaders versus um how much we want it to be in the hands of individuals and and completely decentralized it's just a thought for you because like it's so interesting to see how quickly in this space people you thought were Pinnacle right I mean SBF coming into 2022 um this guy was Unstoppable this guy was somebody that Brian Armstrong wrong CZ could not stop and now where is he he's literally in jail as we're recording this how the mighty Falls so quickly what are your Reflections on that well don't do meth um is number one um and the other um or whatever amphetamine he was on I don't want to get sued for for mislabeling the drug here again um but um well it's it's interesting so I have a couple I have a couple thoughts here one um if you're talking about relatively static Tech or or static ecosystems um and I know the the Bitcoin Community is going to secure me for this but then you don't need leaders uh as much right then it is much more Community Driven um I think you know Satoshi was able to disappear and Bitcoin is is operating just fine and it has had some major upgrades over the years but it has not truly had a leader you know since he disappeared right um ethereum has decentralized this community is vitalik is still the figurehead and the leader and the person that people look to he's kind of the culture you know uh standard Setter for for that community and still sets the Vision in large part and I think you know when you when you look at you know people to watch is is you know pretty much shorthand for you know uh what does that person represent right um and and Brian and cz's case this year it's like okay the two uh exchange operators that have the biggest you know Targets on their back um and and they're holding the the greatest weight of the industry on their shoulders right so I think thematically they fit as like the people to watch as the canaries in the coal mine um but I I think looking backwards at like who's who's risen and who's Fallen um it is I think good to uh draw lessons from history right so you know SPF was on the list um dokwan was on the list in in Prior years um suzu was on the list but they flew too close to the Sun and they overextended or got greedy or made some catastrophic error in judgment or you know and and you know in some way shape or judgment you know ethics or business or otherwise um there are other people that have been hit hard but it's just because the market corrected viciously right you so you mentioned Kyle um you know CMS Holdings you know that they were they were in that same category of suzu look I'm sure they like us probably lost a lot of money this year but they didn't get extinguished right because they weren't over levered and um and and they're still operating I'm sure they're going to get through this cycle and and and still be here for the long term um so it's interesting just to kind of draw lessons from like okay who who flamed out spectacularly versus who was just at such a high that they basically had nowhere to go but correct in the next year those people I don't really think are targets for dunks the ones that were on a pedestal had everything the world in their hands and then got knocked off from their own hubris big difference right fair game and and I think it's good that we have those case studies each cycle so that you know people can point to priors and say you know this person is reminding me I'm I'm pattern matching a little bit too much with this new person that looks and feels a lot like Mark karpeles did or looks and feels a lot like SBF did or dokwan did or you know whatever and um uh and we're but because our history is speed run right we don't even need to go to the outside world for for examples we can usually there's there's like a crypto equivalent that people can tie back to I'd really have another another person by the way I'd really love to get your thoughts on later in the show is Barry silbert because he's he's sort of somewhere that's not maybe somewhat in the middle of these things right um well I'm not going to comment on him in particular uh for for different reasons but I'll I'll comment on on the situation at dcg let's definitely get to that later but David's moving that actually is exactly where we are going next because uh the next section here is top 10 Trends in C5 and what was 2022 other than contagion across C5 lending desks uh and Ryan uh sulcus you uh the first section that you bring up is uh called anatomy of a crypto credit crisis and it's got this great graphic that I'll show on screen here in a second the quote that I really liked that you opened with is the grayscale trade the gbdt trade we've talked about this a little bit on Bank list the grayscale trade AKA kryptos Widowmaker was integral in helping create much of the crypto contagion we saw this year star starting with grayscale and gbtc can you walk us through this flow chart that you've put into your thesy stock that we're also looking at on screen can you walk us through this autopsy like what what happened in 2022 well I'll start with the punch line which is this is all the sec's fault and I truly mean that but um but uh so basically grayscale came public and and offered these trust products um was able to raise money from accredited investors those accredited investors could create shares of gbtc by sending greyscale Bitcoin and um they took those shares public through something called Rule 144 and and it's kind of like a side door ETF with an ETF you can create and redeem baskets of shares daily right so these synthetic instruments these Shares are going to map basically one-to-one with whatever the value the Bitcoin is it's in the trusts through rule 144 you had this bifurcation of the market where accredited investors can create shares but then they have to wait six months and then they can sell them and that's when retail investors can get their hands on them for a while there was more demand than supply for the shares because people wanted them in their 401ks or there just wasn't really Public Market access to bitcoin exposure for a long time and so you know for years you had a 10 20 30 50 premium at times I'm gbtc shares versus the underlying value some funds including three hours capital and block five saw that and started to think Hmm well we can just run this trade you know over and over again and clip the premium every six months and then in 2018 there were some you know the introduction of the crypto lending desks um and and that included Genesis Capital which is a sister company of grayscale and all under the same dcg umbrella but basically we got into a situation in 2021 where three areas capital and block Phi borrowed you know or created new shares of gbtc with leverage whether it was with uh outside lenders or with Genesis capital slammed this trade and then all of a sudden the dis the premium started to slowly collapse and as soon as it started to come down it fell off a cliff because one of those entities or some of those investors that were hitting that trade decided to offload their entire position in February 2021 that premium went from about a 25 premium to a 15 20 discount in the matter of like a week um so it essentially killed the trade and again it turned this grayscale trade which was a profitable trade but not Arbitrage because you were taking duration risks time risk um and it turned it into what we call the Widowmaker trade at that point 3ac and block Phi how to combine about four billion dollars worth of gbtc shares so now those levered positions are underwater versus the underlying trust assets but again because this isn't an ETF the only path to liquidity is through the shares right it's in an ETF you would be able to if you had a discount like this persist redeem those shares for the trust assets that doesn't happen through rule 144 uh it hypothetically could that's a longer more detailed story for that's that's kind of buried in the report but um but the the long and short of it is now you've got these lenders um or these these borrowers in size that borrowed a ton of money to create this grayscale trade now they're impaired to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars the only lender in the market perhaps that would have looked at them as somewhat credit Worthy would have to be an entity that's related to grayscale because from their perspective Dennis's Capital it's money from one pocket to the other right they know that their sister company has the Assets in the grayscale trust they know that whether it's six months from now five years from now grayscale controls the Redemption mechanism so they would be able to look a little bit more favorably upon gbt share gbtc shares now as collateral instead of the underlying Bitcoin and so this is where the spiral started because three arrows capital um I think block fire to a lesser extent but especially three AC began to basically just roll the trade over um and say you know what we're going to just roll uh all of this all these underwater shares with Genesis capital and if you're Genesis Capital you're like this is this is great business because you know if you charge in three AC five percent a year on two billion dollars uh in shares yeah that's a good line of business and that's basically an annuity it's like a hundred million dollars a year guaranteed and captive as long as that discount persists unless and until like an ETF is approved and that that window would close so it created this really kind of you know uh weird dynamic um in the market I think it was one of the first things that that really set off um some risk for uh for 3ac now having said all that I don't think that there's anything um that this is really kind of a comedy of errors or just like a perfect storm right that this the sequence that happened because that by itself would not have been enough to do in three arrows Capital right they had to make another couple of really bad toxic you know synthetic bets in lunatara and then in stake D thief in Q2 of this year that ultimately set them put them under but remember I mean they they were in avalanche they were it seemed like they could do no wrong with all their other crypto related trades and investments in 2021. so even that big number 100 million dollars uh a year in interest if that's what it was right I'm just using it as a ballpark that would have been you know easy to absorb in the context of of what people thought was a 10 billion dollar fund but you fast forward and you get to Q2 of this year Luna collapses it turns three AC bad and then the bad credit really starts to just line up like Domino's one after the other that ultimately creates um uh you know forces Genesis to reclaim or kind of call all the collateral the gbtc shares that you know 3ac had pledged as collateral in this trade uh it it you know ultimately still leaves a hole in the Genesis balance sheet there's a crisis in confidence and block five at the same time there's a run on block fi Voyager has a bunch of exposure to three ACS you know some of the other lenders you know kind of all go under like one one after the other after the other and then we have a little bit of a breather right um so it looks like all the bad credit is washed out in Q2 but um we come to find out months later that that wasn't quite the full story because um we still had to deal with this backstop between digital currency group and Genesis when Genesis had this billion dollar hole blown in it from three AC's bankruptcy dcg absorbed the liability and then they had an inter you know company loan and now that's you know kind of created some issues in the the aftermath of the FDX collapse and some withdrawal rapid withdrawals from Genesis on the part of their creditors um that's that's created a run of the bank with with dcg or sorry with Genesis which could impact both Genesis what do you think is going to happen to that Ryan the the dcg Empire I mean that's kind of the the last thing people are well hopefully the last thing people are trying to figure out from this massive contagion event of 2022 is dcg going to be able to make it like and if so sort of how um you know people still can't if any retail listeners listening who deposited into the Gemini earn account they still can't withdraw their fun ones and that's all wrapped up into this too do you have any takes on how this might unfold I think it's actually pretty promising that we haven't seen any bankruptcy filings or proceedings or or anything like that in the last few weeks that you know we're outside of uh the 30-day window that's kind of standard and some kind of cure periods um for you know depending on the the lender you don't know what the specific agreements were between you know Genesis and its creditors or dcg and Genesis like all that's a little bit of a black box so um you know we'd run some analyzes just based on um public information on on dcg and grayscale and then what we knew about uh the the Genesis fundraising needs and um and and basically you come out to a situation where you know dcg could either recapitalize the business but at you know a 90 reduction in in equity value versus where they raised money last year um or um you reach a a resolution with the Genesis creditors directly and at this point um given the market softness and and you know how multiples are coming down and how people have cooled on crypto and this being a distressed situation I think you know the path to a resolution here uh probably swings on uh whether the creditors are able to make a a good offer and there's there's able to they're able to come to a resolution where you know Genesis creditors um take some partial liquidity today and then maybe roll some of their exposure into dcg or otherwise have you know kind of upside and and and you know can be made whole through the other um uh healthy businesses and healthy assets that are are you know Under the dcg Umbrella so you think they're going to make it you think the probability is that you know they they could make it through this I don't want to speculate so I'll be I'll I'll be coy and I'll say 50 50. I think it's a coin flip you know the the issue is um remember you know if right now dcg has two different options one you try your hand in court and try to limit the liability that you have with this bad subsidiary and you basically let them go bankrupt um the other uh so that's kind of like the hardball play it's very risky because dcg was itself a borrower from Genesis so they you know are one step removed from owing all these creditors you know Capital um the other is though there's you know some resolution with the creditors and and so it's a little bit of a game a chicken chess whatever you want to call it um but it's it's not as if a resolution with creditors is a Panacea for dcg because it's still going to create a new you know massive either liability or preferred you know uh you know instrument at the at the holding company level that you know could hypothetically wipe out a good chunk of equity value if things go sideways the next few years for for dcg so I think that answers a big question that I kind of had which was is this whole potential dcg bankruptcy going to overhang the crypto industry kind of in the same way that mount Cox did for so long and in a way still does and from what I'm I'm the tone I'm hearing from you is it's not really going to overhang all that much maybe there's some some bad stuff but uh for like overhanging cell pressure not that much I I uh I think that there are some similarities in the reaction not in the structure right like these are totally totally different you know stories but in terms of the the damage that is done um potentially in the worst case scenarios of this resolution are somewhat similar to the the worst case reactions that we saw after Mount Cox right like Mount Cox was not um it actually wasn't that damaging at the time because from a market pressure standpoint because the funds had been slowly LED away over the course of years right um and people just didn't know that the funds weren't there so as a disaster for everyone that that lost money right but but um it was not necessarily like uh you know a situation where you just saw you know uh hundreds of millions of of Bitcoin hit the market and kind of instantly become sellable because they were hacked um with this situation and and then in the aftermath of Mount Cox we get the bit license and we got you know a bunch of jurisdictions become hostile to crypto and and you know took took quite a bit of time um for uh for for us to make progress after that um I think with uh with the dcg Genesis situation you know one of the one of the issues that we're confronting with this and one of the reasons I think we need like a good positive resolution is um you've got Gemini is one of the primary creditors Gemini earn customers are owed about 900 million so now you're pulling in U.S retail there's another similar urn-like program that I think was just reported on last week through a European exchange bit Volvo um where they have 300 million in a similar earn like program so that could potentially pull in the European Regulators right and um you know we're running out of bodies right now to enter like warm bodies and leaders in the industry and you know dcg is extremely well connected they've got you know Larry Summers is an advisor they've got Glenn Hutchins these golfing buddies with Obama you know on their board um and uh and and then you know Gemini you know is one of the best regulated you know uh uh exchanges and custodians uh in the U.S so you're starting to lose just like one too many chess pieces on the chessboard in terms of like the adults in the room if you can't figure out if there can't be some you know kind of adequate resolution here so I don't think about it as as economically damaging in terms of like there's more credit contagion risk still on the market I think that's probably mostly washed out but now we're at the part of the cycle where you know the black guys are going to be potentially permanent in nature if they get encoded into law and I think that's the biggest concern right now and the reason everybody should be rooting for some amicable resolution here okay so I guess so this is the top uh Trends in D find just a gift gift wraps C5 excuse me the top um Trends in C find just to wrap this in a bow you called the grayscale trade the Widowmaker but he also said this was all the sec's fault all Gary gensler's fault could Gary have really waived a magic wand and just convert that gbtc thing into an ETF and this whole Arbitrage mess crap all the Fallout would have been solved I know that doesn't help FTX necessarily and all of the other contagion but uh would that have made the Widowmaker not make any widows if we had a spot ETF none of this would have happened none of it what do you mean none of it three hours Capital wouldn't have over leveraged Sam bankman freed would have had been a fraud or like what specifically I mean think about the impairment the three AC had right you know you're you're talking about um Mid nine figures worth of impairments um plus all the interest payment that they had um as they had to continue to borrow against these shares uh over the course of the last year so this was a significant you know kind of deadweight loss for them um but you know the flip side is yeah I'm sure they made money and money on it in the beginning um the fact remains that uh this this asset being you know publicly tradable I mean at its peak it was a 40 billion dollar trust right um that the retail investors are are able to uh to invest in and it's just become like hot potato collateral for for you know some of many of of the entities that have blown up or faced significant distress this year and at the end of the day who's holding the bag it's a bunch of folks that are holding gbtc you know in their retirement accounts right there almost a million gbtc shareholders that would benefit from the conversion to an ETF which is the equivalent of a snap of the fingers of the SEC it just has to do with with treating spot ETFs the same way they treat these you know insane you know cfdc derived derivative ETF these Futures ETFs that are garbage do you think do you think Ryan that like again so looked at this and was just like you know I don't know evil villain in kind of an armchair somewhere and just like Let Them Burn that's what crypto gets like I could fix this but I won't is it is it that sort of nefariousness going on here do you think he really has it in for the industry or is this all bureaucracy and you know just couldn't get to the ETF I'll I'll I'll give the the the like you know conniving version uh and then the um uh and then from like the regular the the most charitable version I guess for for someone like chair gunzler the most charitable version is um we are not going to break policy which is we don't have oversight of the exchanges that are are trading these you know spot instruments and we're certainly not going to reward bad behavior right so just because this trade existed and it created a bunch of problems like that is that is not our doing right this was a loophole that was exploited you've made your you know you've made your bed in LA in it um that's I think you know the one hand and and essentially it's just default no um the other is um that you know this this you know setback and this continued pain is is you know arguably a good thing because it shows uh it it backs their position and it it just shows um the other policy makers that they're trying to convince look this is how unwieldy this crypto Market is we need full oversight of all the centralized players and these things are either Securities or having an impact on the Securities market so it makes sense to empower XYZ regulator that already has this oversight responsibility and these other adjacent areas with with the same power so we can clean this up um and so yeah I mean unfortunately like I don't really see there being a resolution anytime soon um but now you've got a situation where you know gbtc shareholders are 50 50 underwater um and the only people that win um are you know counterintuitively it's it's dcg through grayscale right because they're still making their you know 300 million dollars a year on these trusts and um and the SEC because they're able to play hardball and use this as a negotiating trip for the their long-term position well I think this underhands us right into this policy conversation the policy section so wrapping it uh tying a bow on the 10 trends of C5 we're going to go into the trends in crypto policy and there's a number of sections in here all about SPF and The Insider baseball uh without giving too much of the juicy details away uh Ryan sulcus can you kind of just like I know you you are very involved with policy in Capitol Hill and and like that whole world can you kind of just like summarize this The Insider baseball that was going on that we are still learning about to this day yeah like what happened yeah what one for what like yeah what no seriously like I mean SPF wrote that post it was talking about dccpa we had him debate on Voorhees like on the podcast defending that position and 11 days later he turns out to be like a short 10 billion dollars like what happened well I think that's the last 20 of of of the the write-up because this really started uh in in the fall I think you know even um folks within kind of DC policy circles um for a while underestimated how far the FTX team had been able to push dccpa right this um this stabbing out Bozeman Bill and um it it really started to become more apparent in September we actually is it a policy dinner around mainnet and and you know supposed to just be you know kind of a celebratory dinner look how far we've come since the infrastructure Bill we had a bunch of speakers in town that were from the policy side so um uh you know someone you know Dropped a Bomb during the dinner and essentially said you know can we just talk about the elephant in the room you know uh Sam's trying to sell out the industry and and create a monopoly for himself and wow it was yeah I mean it was It was kind of it was it was wild like it was uh you know you could have heard a pin drop type of moment and um uh but it ended up being very healthy because you got a lot of people talking you know for all for all reasons right like it was you know it was it was a an interesting night after that but um uh in the aftermath of that I think you know people kind of woke up to you know how close uh they were getting and um and you know several people myself included you know started to push Sam and um and the FTX team to to start being a little bit more open with with some of the other groups um particularly those in the D5 side and so there was a number of of you know meetings that uh you know the the Casual like armchair Observer on on you know Twitter is going to say oh it's a smoke-filled room or it's this or that or the other thing it's like no you had a situation where where one entity was making enormous strides um because of all the political Investments they'd made and um and a lot of people were not necessarily you know in in tune and a lot of those other people that that you know were able to get in touch and start um uh comparing notes with FTX after this dinner and after these meetings were representatives of major D5 projects or some of the other major trade associations um and uh and and the Hope was that we were we were going to be able to make some progress on the defy language and and dccpa as drafted then when things leaked um you know all hell kind of broke loose Sam couldn't stop talking about it and the circle re-tightened um and what I think you know there's you know there's I'm not going to name names but there's a couple people in the industry that are Pat themselves in the back for you know basically like oh it you know it took took down like SPF by you know doing this or you know we we stopped the dccpa um uh because you know we we kind of blew the whistle on this and brought the brought the fight to crypto Twitter I'm telling you right now that's nonsense the thing that stopped the dccpa is the FTX bankruptcy it was it had nothing to do with the leak the only thing that the leak did was tighten the circle of people that were going to contribute from that on out and it could have been pretty damaging if this had gotten pushed through the lame duck so we dodged a bull we got lucky I think with FTX um and I'm not going to really you know spend much time arguing counterfactuals but um I had a few people call me out uh and so I decided to do the full post mortem since I was in some of those rooms and uh and that's what happened yeah I haven't read all of that and I want like that's so interesting to me but but like zooming out was SPF really just kind of a puppeteer trying to control the the strings in DC and like benefit his his own exchange over D5 was he basically pulling up the ladder um after he you know it climbed up it pulling it up for everyone else uh was there something nefarious going on here or you know is that not the case it's it's just very tempting to look at everything he's doing now under that lens and be like wow this guy is you call them political in you know Investments it's yeah it's basically don't campaign donations right yeah look I mean I think he was playing a game right and and by the way he was playing it very well right regardless of of you know just like a Machiavellian type game yeah he's a very Machiavellian uh type game I think that he was looking out for you know his own self-interest but every single company that lobbies right or and every single company you know that is is kind of advocating for themselves on the policy side is doing that out of self-interest right now there's operating out of self-interest and then there's operating out of self-interest and only self-interest right and I think that's a difference with some of the other big crypto companies you know you've you've seen Brian Armstrong tweet abouts um you know not pulling the ladder up on defy right like we have to predict like he has every incentive um to make sure that good exchange oversight legislation gets passed because he is the incumbent coinbase is the incumbent but if that's going to be at the expense of all the long-term innovation in in the industry I think you know he he recognizes for instance that um uh that that's the long-term detriment of his business as well because you're talking about the growth of the industry FTX was a little bit different because they also had this relationship with IEX and then you know Tom Emmer's been all over this um you know you guys should listen uh to uh to the the interview that that you know uh representative Tom emmer just did with uh with Nick Carter and the on the brink podcast but he goes off and I mean he it sounds like he wants to you know go after chair against their heart and in the new year but essentially you know saying you know okay there's all these self dealings between this you know Securities Exchange you know IEX um and FTX was you know were they basically lobbying for FTX to have cftc oversight and then IEX Dev and Monopoly over the crypto Securities market and then these two would be joined at the hip they'd have uh de facto Monopoly on the whole thing um and yeah there's there's that's definitely you know I don't know maybe that's a possibility my point in writing this is there was not a single piece of of Sam's business that he didn't know exactly was going on he is extremely smart he thought that he knew like he he thought that he saw the entire chess board you know he he seemed to have his finger on the pulse of of kind of the politics of the situation and and this particular Bill and you know when he was in meetings with his policy team the policy team was The Supporting Cast he was the one predominantly that spoke um and kind of led the discussion so it's not like he was kind of following the advice of like the folks in his policy team um I'm sure he was right but he was also very much leading these discussions and and he he seemed to just enjoy it so I I find it hard to believe that you know he was uh so detail-oriented and meticulous and and 3D chess 40 chess oriented in this regard but you know somehow you know missed everything else uh in his eight billion dollar balance sheet hole and I remember I I would imagine everyone in DC is just like who's been associated with with him is just kind of running in the opposite direction now trying to distance themselves is that what's going on maybe distance themselves from crypto who knows it's maybe some of the clouds yeah I mean we got like long-term damage control right so you know I think um the only thing that's going to help that is time now the the most important win this year in the policy side is that this this didn't become law the next couple of years I think unfortunately are going to be a little bit of a war of attrition right it's going to be trench warfare a lot of legal fights um warding off you know uh enforcement actions and regulation by enforcement from the the from the SEC in particular but also potentially from the cftc in some cases and um you know we might not get you know comprehensive legislation um for exchanges or for like what constitutes a token versus a security or commodity uh until we have a new Administration in place um uh the one uh exception you know potentially I think could be in the stable coin realm that maybe we'll see some some positive stable coin action um there's always a chance uh that that something more comprehensive gets done but with the Republicans uh in control of the house and and Democrats in control of the Senate still uh it seems you know more likely than not that this is going to be gridlocked which by the way is probably a net positive right now versus the alternative uh for for you know some of the folks that have it out for us certainly well the idea that SBF was a leader and knew everything and was playing the board is in stark contrast to his public speaking tour after everything I don't know a damn thing about my own company which was definitely the vibe that he was trying to get off Ryan we have so much more to cover we got Bitcoin and crypto dollars top 10 ethereum and layer one Trends Trends in defy which I if I'm reading the lines you are calling the D5 bottom I got my own story to tell you about that one we'll see if see how that works uh Ryan so much more to come in the second half of the show right after we talked to

that's d-e-s-o.com Ryan I want to start off the second half of the show with another quote out of the Bitcoin and crypto dollar section in your 2020 Theses report and the quote begins with we will debate bitcoin's role in society for as long as it is it for as long as it exists as Bitcoin grows I don't expect the powers that be to ideally stand by without a fight as it's been for a decade Bitcoin spends best defense will continue to be its inability to be held hostage by one charismatic leader and it's a volatility and boringness will deflect attention in different ways Ryan looking forward into 2023 how do you expect the conversation around Bitcoin to unfold I really like this line we will debate bitcoin's role in society for as long as it exists uh what are we going to debate in 2023 how what's bitcoin's role moving forward here well first off uh I don't even remember writing that paragraph uh so I'm like I'm like partly like you know uh terrified that I plagiarize it and the other half is like maybe I was just like writing it in like a Stephen King like Bender mode um but uh yeah I look I I think in in you know kind of going forward um Bitcoin has benefited greatly from its boring this cycle to cycle right like it's uh you know people just have such ridiculously short memories that um every single passing cycle it's the same exact thing people underestimate Bitcoin all the excitement's over here all the application development is over here you know this that the other thing and it's just block by block by block the fees are relatively low the community is crazy so no one really pays attention to them there's no one to go there's no one to go after right you know um in terms of like a figurehead they're you know the core developers truly are decentralized and extremely tough to like pin down for for you know any type of uh um you can't really put that much pressure on on anyone it knows exactly what it wants to be when it grows up I mean it's just and it's it's it's it's a borderline miraculous Tech right and and I think that's going to have staying power um as a money um and we can you know argue about whether ethereum will surpass it or or you know or Bitcoin Bitcoin will remain number one but it will have staying power for that reason almost by itself in in a really chaotic uh global environment so you know just like we saw you know in in the last cycle I expect that people are gonna you know uh underestimate Bitcoin call for the flipping maybe maybe not you know maybe this will finally be your year guys [Music] I think that if you as a country or you as a company are going to put your um are going to think about like a uh a currency hedge not an inflation Edge but a currency Edge um then I think um and I think Bitcoin Still Remains like the First Choice and then ethereum has probably moved into that number two um spot yeah I certainly remember going through the 2017 to 20 2018 uh Mania and on the end of 2018 I definitely had more respect for Bitcoin than I did at the start of 2017 that's for sure and it's a little bit after the chaos of a uh collapse of crypto of the collapse of the industry the the appreciation for one block every 10 minutes definitely hits a little bit harder when we are down in the depths of a bear market so I will give that one to you uh I want to also however move on to the ethereum and layer one Trends and I just have a broad conversation oh wow we're going right over all the good stuff in the Bitcoin section no surprise that's actually what this actually isn't even diving into the ethereum part specifically I just uh from your perspective from the outside of the ethereum community uh which Ryan Myron and I find myself ourselves very in the middle of very frequently how would you describe the landscape of smart contract chains going into 2023 like who are all the relevant players and who's showing strength and with all of the all layer one landscape can the entire uh alt layer one landscape hold a candle to ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem what's your take on just a smart contract landscape in 2023 well I think um you have to look at market cap market dynamics and then developer activity um yeah I think you have to look at all three for for signs of strength so so I know that apps don't necessarily follow price but price is what ultimately secures these proof of stake networks and [Music] uh and that's also you know kind of an indication of of Community Health right it's it's the one barometer that you can kind of look at you know it's not perfect but it's directionally correct in terms of like you know order of magnitude importance of the different ecosystems um and then you know kind of the 1A to that is the market Dynamic right so this would be the changes to ethereum Supply right and and the new issue and schedule on the post-merge economics of ethereum and I think if you just look at those like that one and one a etherium is just so far ahead of everybody else right like in in a kind of a class of its own right now as a layer one that you're really looking at as I alluded to in the Anatoly you know comments and earlier you're looking at ethereum and evm compatible chains whether that's Roll-Ups whether that's you know kind of this modularity thesis for different types of of uh blockchains um or whether you're looking at other evm compatible like layer ones like Avalanche and and others that have these Bridges um I think no matter what uh that is going to continue to be one of the dominant ecosystems and probably the dominant ecosystem you know for for crypto not name Bitcoin for the foreseeable future right [Music] um everybody else is kind of playing for a second uh especially post merge right I think last year you know when we had this conversation um as you know my quip on the merge was always take the over right whatever whatever the date was take the over and for a while that was money good you'd make money hand over a fist if you just always took the over when it came to like when people answers be the merge would come but the fact that it came the fact that it was that it went off without a hitch I mean it just miraculous just one of the most impressive technical achievements um you know of of you know my my career my you know kind of professional life um that I've seen and um and uh and it's it's something that I think solidifies you know ethereum uh for the long term and in terms of not only it's it's uh the stability of the platform but I think the its attractiveness to other outside developers right um because that was such a hard problem to take on in such a a a tall mountain to scale I think um there there should be quite a bit of confidence that like other equally tricky problems would get will get solved over time um in a really thoughtful manner so I don't underestimate that at all and and I think um uh you know just vitalik uh and the other core devs that have spent years on this just you know there there aren't the people to watch just because I didn't want to curse fatalik I was worried about the The Siam right like so is that not that I you know uh I think Anatoly could probably not have much of a worse year than this year so I I think you know he's he's probably transitory yeah exactly but I I think that those guys I mean that just the the bright spot in a really bleakier uh for sure so Ryan can we just do this all right because we've had two cycles of the meme eth killer ethereum killer like something is going to come kill ethereum right is that dead now is there are we gonna have another eth killer cycle the next cycle and oh my God repeat this whole thing not to say there won't be competitors but like killing is different yeah I I think the eve killer cycle like now everybody realizes it's not enough to kill eth because the fees are high right um and you know it's not enough to kill eth because it's proof of work right or it has this looming technical upgrade that's a bunch of smoke and mirrors and uh um and and you know this became this um perpetual motion machine that's the road map like that's done right like that's that's in the rearview mirror now there are still some challenges that need to be you know tackled like the the potential sensor ability um issues around yeah Mev and and those are all on the roadmap I but I think that those are significantly less challenging than what we just saw uh in in terms of the merge um so you're gonna have to compete on you know fundamentally new use cases so you know I'm not a I'm not a a very deep uh deeply technical person but would some of these move uh oriented blockchains right the ones that spun out of the the Facebook DM project um like Aptos and sui you know are they gonna you know introduce some interesting applications is Solana um going to introduce um some interesting applications that just run better faster cheaper and and you just can't do them on ethereum maybe um and then the other one to keep an eye on is you know will the Cosmos app chain model ultimately attracts you know more communities more applications uh because of the the customizability of the app chains themselves so dydx like watching that experiments the next year their migration from a ZK roll up to uh to an app chain on Cosmos is is probably going to be the most important project for you know ethereum Killers uh you know proponents to why watch because that would be one sign that maybe some of the interesting use cases and some of the really scalable crypto apps are actually not going to be built on ethereum but maybe they'll move to something like the cosmos dab chain model I don't know what the right answer is but I would say um those are are either the three that are covered in the report in depth ethereum Cosmos Solana and then everything else is you know is is referenced and we cover you know probably about a dozen uh different layer ones um uh and and you know layer 1.5 or whatever you want to call polygon which had a pretty monstrous year on its own right in terms of some of its wins but we cover all them on a quarterly basis so you know those those are alluded to in reference but I only I can only write so many pages I did my best but I know that there's going to be some communities that are pissed off I already know that like you know goon is gonna uh he's gonna DM me and be like you didn't cover Avalanche again and just you know whatever I love you goon but you know come on then I wrote 170 pages in two weeks give me a break I do want to drill down on that app conversation because that brings us to the trends in D5 and there's one that I really wanted to pull out specifically because it hits home for me and so I'll read one of the quotes here ethereum transaction fees are way down this year and the competitive Dynamics with dapps have shifted unit swap Lido and openc the three largest ethereum-based apps now generate more monthly fees on a combined basis than the entire ethereum layer one Ave and uniswap launched their protocols on various emerging networks this year and it can came quickly to dominate their segments in terms of volumes and TVO this shows that the shelling point for most users isn't around chain-specific native versions of lending in decentralized exchanges but of the top applications by user just as binance will likely steamroll the first top domestic tie Exchange in Thailand upon entrance into the country Ave is also likely to dominate in whatever digital country AKA a layer 1 it enters interesting so right yeah and so then Ryan concludes this section Mr selke says why then does defy still sit at all time lows versus eth I'm bullish on D5 dominance versus appear theorem in 2023 absent ham-fisted new regulations Ryan selkis are you calling the D5 bottom is that what's going on you've been saved so because it's coming to save your your calls yeah I mean but I said it once not like three times yeah I mean um I I think um look I I would I would I personally own both right um is the way that I'd frame it um I think the uh the reason to be bullish is because of the dominance and the feed generation of some of those defy 1.0 apps if you will right and and you know their their ability to I think accrue value uh for themselves and their communities long term um the reason to be bearish and kind of take the under on that is there are going to be significant regulatory headwinds still right um and and so that creates that's like a Known Unknown um so you've you've got like those countervailing forces um the reason I am uh much more relatively bullish maybe on defy than ethereum though has to do with my mental model for both right so defy is you know about 0.1 to 0.2 percent of the market cap and tvl of traditional financial services so do I think that you know um uh decentralized finances penetration in the real world is is you know going to be more than one two one three thousandths or whatever of of you know the uh um uh the the traditional Financial system I think the answer is yes um with ethereum it's a slightly different uh calculation if people's mental model of ether starts to change right so I made the point in here you know we're going to talk about the the either ether's money in which case the sky's the limit right or ethereum is a platform like the cloud computing platforms or like a distributed Bank right now its economics as a platform look a lot more like a distributed Bank than they do a distributed cloud computing platform in terms of margins in terms of sustainability the fees and and whatnot and and it is a transaction fee based you know kind of model that ethereum has you know if you kind of net out like all the staking rewards so um if you if you think about like ethereum is like the The Meta decentralized Bank of crypto um and and financial settlement platform then uh you know its ceiling might be a little bit lower than the most bullish proponents think and defies you know ceiling is probably significantly higher than I think a lot of people currently handicap for um so you know I uh I think uh if if we can get some resolution and some like sandboxes around defy uh in the next couple of years and in the US and Europe um it yeah we could we could be close uh to the bottom here uh David and and and one of these days you might just be right so he's hoping for it uh Ryan this has been great and uh look we couldn't cover all 168 pages of this but we'll definitely make sure that folks have a link in the show notes um at the end but um we can only touch upon a few things is there anything that really jumps out at you from the report that you just really were like guys we should have talked about this um tell us about about that thing what's uh what's something that you'd like to pull out for us uh toward the end of this as we begin to wrap up well I'll do uh I'll do a buy sell for uh for nfts uh and then dowels which are the last two sections that we didn't get to so uh I I think in like the the nft and kind of metaverse space um I am uh I'm pretty uh pretty bullish on decentralized social applications and identity and um and pretty bearish on individual nft projects and GameFly game five I think is the most overhyped ridiculous Trends that's cool a strong opinion interesting an absolute Capital incinerator uh for for years to come wow um van Spencer would like a word and I think um I think NF I think nfts um are uh you know best thought of in aggregate versus as particular projects right so I think that the picks and shovels businesses around nfts will continue to do well but um the point that I make in here is you know Bitcoin in 2013 to 2017. if if you do the digital gold versus physical gold comparison right you could see it's kind of steady March upwards and and it's market share you know kind of capture reflected the value of Bitcoin nfts I don't think the same thing is going to be true I think that that we will see like a 10x in the nft market but it will be because of a 10 20 30X increase in the number of projects and the number of the number of supplies so so you want to bet on the category on like the Collectibles category rather than the beanie babies right individual projects yeah well I I think that's right but I'll I would also say that as a consumable primitive right I I think it's it's really important but I just don't think that people should be thinking necessarily about nfts writ large as an asset class it might be better to think about them you know very specific niches like digital art as an asset class um the example that I've used is um is you know your physical wardrobe right you buy fresh kicks or you know a new suit when you're ready to sell that thing it's going to be 20 cents on the dollar if you're lucky um and I think that give it to a thrift store you know it's basically exactly exactly right so and and so that's kind of the the model that I have could be wrong we'll see I but but I I don't think so and then on the um uh on the on the the Dow side I'm still hyper bullish on dials we could do a whole episode on that but um uh so I'll I'll gloss over that but the um I think the one um uh you know kind of critical area of investment next year I expect we'll see an uptick in as uh as what we call depend decentralized physical infrastructure Networks um Cloud uh infrastructure companies are about five trillion dollars of market cap you guys want to guess where d-pin is right now if you include filecoin rweave helium live peer some of those projects okay give us the numbers again so what what was um 5 trillion for cloud yeah what is the crypto equivalent this is under five billion I'm gonna say oh yeah I was gonna say under 10 but I'll go under five because that sounds uh that sounds right about two about two and a half wow okay yep so um if you think about both the pressing need to decentralize our dependence on on some of these big platforms and Hardware networks um and just the the just enormous um Revenue opportunity and the very clear unit economics here too by the way of these projects I'd expect that should be a a good uh kind of Tailwind for the industry the the question is you know how quickly will demand pick up for those decentralized networks because the supply side is largely figured out through token incentives but can we continue to see good kind of steep growth like we have the last few quarters even in the teeth of the bear Market um and and usage of of some of those decentralized physical infrastructure networks so that's a small sampling of the 95 and I appreciate being able to run through with you guys no it's great and maybe just to close us out Ryan um can we talk about 2023 so uh where do we go from here you had this section uh somewhere in the report that that talked about 2023 is the time we need to get back to crypto back to crypto in 2023. I think that's a good theme if 2022 was pain back to crypto is a great theme for 2023 and and you said you want more personal wallets from my cold dead hands rather than exchange margin accounts which is bad you want more privacy it's none of your business what I do then institutional adoption we could slow that process down and you want permissionless financial and social applications a Live and Let Live policy versus Ponzi economics the frauds that we saw in 2022 so you want the real manifestations of this crypto Vision not The Fakes um wrap this up for us what what can we expect in 2023 what does back to crypto mean well first off I did a final place of web3 anywhere that it accidentally slipped through the cracks in this route so it's killing it if I I killed it would you replace it with crypto crypto yeah okay um and uh and I think there was one or two that slipped through the cracks in the graphics which I'm not too happy about but that's that's my that's my fault um wait so we're putting web 3 in the grave uh I just well I don't I'm not gonna tell other people how to live their lives but it's got bad juju for me I'm not calling it web3 anymore okay all right every every ever since we all said started saying web 3 we started getting high on our own Supply and believing so many people that are full of so I'm gonna hate that I remember reading the a16c report that came out that said that web3 pulled well with people it was the best polling a term yeah how's it pulling now David that was the absolute top of web three it was down only from it [Laughter] all right so back to the basics back to crypto in 2023 um Ryan that's amazing hey action items for you bankless listeners of course you can do Go download the report we'll include a link in the show notes any special instructions on how to download and access that Ryan oh man I should have the uh I should have the link handy but it's uh it's gonna be right on our home page so if you go to missouri.io it will be on our home page when this drops live amazing guys I hope you enjoyed this We snuck this in before the holidays and you appreciate Ryan you you hanging with us all right Ryan here's my only regret with that conversation is uh we forgot to talk about the block crypto media so I know like I saw some of your tweets after this my brain just about exploded earlier this month when I saw that it's basically the news that SBF had a controlling secret interest the entire time in one of the the largest crypto media Publications in our space and here's why that hit me so hard is for so long I've been kind of preaching like and David too and I know you have is the answer to our really shitty um Financial media coverage of crypto is crypto media and here here we are here's this this uh entity who's caught up and involved in the this uh this corruption this SPF thing and I look I know it's not everyone there uh there are tons of fantastic people at the Block that goes without saying who are not aware of any of this but um to see it kind of seep in I don't know my jaw hit the floor what were what was you what's your reaction to this because I wanted to talk to you about this for a while since it happened um I I feel like with anything like that it it had to have been an extremely small group of people that knew about this if not a group of one um because stuff like this always gets out right um and I just don't really think that you know there's any reason to to suspect that the the vast majority if not pretty much the entirety of the the editorial and research teams of the block really adding any idea that this was the structure um I know that like the uh the the blocks founder Mike dudas like had was completely blindsided by this right like you know I think you know he had said that um he thought that um you know Mike McCaffrey's you know the source of funding for his buyout of the company was was just from you know family money and um and so it seemed like this you know kind of took everybody's surprise and and was you know very much an isolated um uh group of people that knew about this so you know in some respects I think it's you know it's it's unfortunate it's tough that a good chunk of the team is is going to be um maligned over this or you know have their integrity called into question I don't think that's necessary um and I think it just also flies in the face of their actual coverage on some of the stuff right um there are I think much more pernicious uh you know issues with uh with you know pay to play uh within crypto media that is outside of you know coindesk um and the block you know coindast you know broke the story that unraveled FTX and has now you know turned around and created contagion in his parent company right so I think um you know the the the the the uh coindesk and and you know kind of the block editorial teams um are you know two of the best decrypts you know another one up there you guys obviously do do great work but in terms of like traditional like news like journalists uh you know heavy Outlets we are not journalists at all I think yeah I think I think those three are are you know definitely kind of pillars of uh of the ecosystem and so you know I didn't really spend a whole lot of time in like the the schadenfreight of it um I just thought it was you know like another whatever can go wrong will go wrong this year because that one was more of just like an own goal that's going to look a lot worse than it really is I think in terms of like the the outside world because I think we know some of the folks that are over the block right and uh you know I I would be shocked if you know Frankie Scoops had any idea of something like this I mean it yeah his reaction was like you know someone that just got stabbed in the back and the Heart right um so I think that's unfortunate and and maybe unfair but I think there is a bigger question uh in terms of should we have like an Associated Press of crypto right so something that is a little bit more open and that is focused on doing the journalistic grunt work but where the information is ultimately like a public good okay let's talk about that because that's that's very really where my mind went so and and by the way we hopped right into this question with Ryan because he's totally up to speed but for bankless listeners who aren't aware the block large um crypto journalism news uh institution and crypto turned out that their CEO was getting um loans from SBF and Alameda um that that entire thing and was using that to buy up a majority stake of um of the block so in in some shadow type pseudo way SBF in the Alameda was actually the owner of the block uh and the question of does that team coverage what what were the intents behind this also the CEO former CEO of the block is obviously he's no longer the CEO and owner he's also given like uh apartments in the Bahamas as as part of this as a reward so it's just some shady things anyway that's the background that we're going into but like what um what Ryan can we do to not become like the Legacy Media how do we make this corruption resistant SPF won't be the last that tries to bribe out and buy out a crypto media publication how do we develop some armor for this uh the next time around and and that maybe goes to the idea that you were talking about like Associated Press so dig into this what do you think the solutions are here I actually think there's a pretty good case for a Dowell uh and and the reason I say that is like I ran coindesk for a couple years right like so you know the the acquisition and restructuring that we did at dcg um in uh in in 2016 you know it was it was me that that led that turn around and like a team of six right like it was like Pete Rizzo uh Mike McSweeney who's now over at the Block uh and like an events team like that our editorial team was down to like two people and like one one contract you know uh like you know uh European that was doing the night coverage and and helping on weekends and um and so I know what controls we put in place um in terms of like editorial firewalls just so that you know coindesk was was not perceived to be like you know just a mouthpiece for dcg like we physically moved out of the office you know we had these like firewalls and this kind of you know code Code of Conduct that that me and Rizzo worked on and and you know I didn't get in his way and vice versa I stopped writing for 18 months like that was the only time I didn't write uh basically it was it was the 18 months that I actually ran coindesk um and I think uh that model works if you trust me and that is kind of besides the point right like you you shouldn't trust that um I was you know not getting calls from Barry and then funneling that you know in a conference room to Rizzo essentially saying like if you write about this you're fired right like that's um that's something that you know I I think you know gets taken for granted because I think you know coindesks your body of work uh sit on its own two feed people had a lot of confidence on like the Integrity of the editorial team that we had and and that we wouldn't do something like that but um stole leap of faith and you can get unfairly maligned you know by association just because that construct exists and I think the same is true with the situation with the block where you had a business focused CEO not really in the editorial uh you know function not really in the research function doing something totally outside of both of that that is going to make them look bad and now it you know kind of impugnes the the Integrity of the rest of the group or or you know at least the um the brand right and so um if you think about what a dow could be really good for you know it could be good for funding a sustainable operation uh for journalism uh that is truly independent where the content itself is ungovernable but the funding source is secure right so you know one of the issues that you always have is you want good news but you never want to be the object of bad news um and that can create a bunch of you know kind of gnarly you know incentive problems when it comes to you know running a commercial business you know I can't tell you how many folks um on the uh uh on the coindesk side we're like we're not coming to consensus we're not supporting you like this is a garbage publication because there was a negative article about them because they did something you know shitty or they had some like mishap and the journalist covered it um so I think there are ways to monetize a business like that and and basically automate the business operations uh of of like a decentralized media outlet and we might be at an interesting moment uh in in kind of crypto's life cycle where combination of uh a recession layoffs some of these you know uh kind of brand issues at um well let's forget the brand issues some of the change of control issues that might exist at both the block and coindesk since the block is probably going to have to restructure based on McCaffrey's ownership coindesk is rumored to be on the Block because of dcg's other issues that it's it's other subsidiaries so you might have a perfect storm where there's going to be a lot of talent that is potentially looking to hit the market could you spin up almost like a constitution Dao but for funding sustainable like crypto journalism and then organize a business unit just like you do like you have a centralized like editorial desk and crypto could you have like kind of a hub and spoke model where you have a centralized editorial desk and then like a freelance kind of Dow model kind of like what you guys have done with bankless Dao as some of the the kind of specialist contributors um and I think if it's ever going to happen like it's probably going to happen soon so you know maybe you guys take it up uh and then you know just oh my God shoot me a tip if it works I was gonna ask you to do it well okay well I'm probably you know I I wink wink I don't wanna I don't want to get in trouble because my team's like you have too many ideas but yeah people I I hear you yeah so we have and we have to focus so um uh but I I do think it's really interesting the other thing uh the other thing that I think is really interesting about this idea at this point in time is I think the economics of the journalism business have been totaled dog for forever um and that could potentially get flipped on its head with things like gbt3 um in the coming years the reason I say that is with more automation of the writing process you're still going to need the fact checkers and The Architects of these stories and like the investigators right so even though you can do the write-ups it's like a scientist right like doing the write-up is the easiest part you got to design the experiment you got to get all the controls right you gotta you know basically set everything up and then you know if the experiment is well constructed then you read out the results and then the write-up kind of that's the easiest part is just explaining what you did but the the concoction building everything itself that's the difficult part and I think um you know with something like gbt3 if you started recording all of your interviews right or you started like just inputting all of your raw notes uh in into you know a an NLP engine and um and then more importantly you had a trove of historical data and historical stories and Historical Notes that your entire desk had done now that model gets more efficient and smarter over time and can make many more lateral connections and maybe break stories like FTX far sooner because that model would say okay we're looking at all the market cap info for these assets over here we know that Alameda was doing these Investments we know that the market corrected here we know that this press release went out then we know what ftx's volumes were and then and then they have a billion dollars to bail out blockfi and they have a 500 million to bailout Voyager and they've and you like it could literally just slam all these together and say something's broken here right there's there's something that doesn't add up about these numbers and now you've got like your Smoking Gun that's just one example but you could potentially do that you know at at with with any combination of things and really kind of glean Insight uh from the noise of most of today's news by having that Source material and you do need the source material to put into these models otherwise you're going to run into copyright issues so I think um I think the economics of the news business are more interesting I think doing a decentralized way is more interesting given the incentive mismatches and you know every time I talk about it out loud I kind of want to do it so yeah my team's gonna my team's going to be pissed at this in the bonus but it's well it's exciting guy and like so so the last thing I'll say because um Dave you've been with us for for a while and I just wanted to get your thoughts on this and it's been very helpful is um uh you know I noticed number I think number four on your top people the watch list was citizen journalists and I look at that was actually success in 2022. if we look at like you named Molly why autism capital and autism capital is doing all these things about SBF another one that comes to mind is that Twitter account Zack xbt just doing deep due diligence on like crypto influencers and surfacing the grift and just being like hey look at this guy like so if we can coordinate and unify some of that citizen journalist energy in some sort of a dow structure I mean that starts to get really exciting I don't know what that looks like Ryan I Dave and I certainly don't have time for it right now but um we are cheering on whoever's listening to this and and wants to start spinning that up and thinking about it and uh yeah thanks for weighing in on this um appreciate it that's your bonus episode right there thanks guys happy holidays with that we are done this time take care bye as
