when I think about decentralized finance and like what we're trying to achieve right we can't just kind of like iterate in our like small world like we have to like kind of innovate and push Beyond it I'm extremely bullish amms as like a market structure but I think that there are also other Market structures that like could you know exist in the future and I think we also want to discover them and have them be part of the uni swap ecosystem it is that time of year again eat CC the ethereum Community Conference in Paris France all the teams all the projects all the protocols save some of their biggest announcements for each CC except for the ones saving it for permissionless of course you might remember last year ECC was marked by the time in which three teams all had the first ZK evm yeah that was that was a year ago at ECC and today the day I'm recording this Sunday the day before ethcc begins we already have a massive release out of uniswap labs a brand new protocol called uniswap x a new half of uniswap that complements the rest of the unit swap protocol the yin to the Yang of uniswaps V one through four something brand new that fills in the picture of the uniswap project seriously the the best way to describe this is that it's the other half of uniswap it's the half of unit swap that is meant to make uniswap the best place for swappers two swap tokens today on the show we have Hayden Adams the day before he gives his ECC main stage talk releasing uniswap X Into the Wild what is uniswap X I'm glad you asked your swap X is a protocol for competitive order execution in D5 is a protocol that exists on top of unisops one through four as well as all the other liquidity sources in defy that ensures that the market produces the best possible order execution for anyone looking to swap tokens using uniswap X the idea behind your swap X is that it maximally protects swappers ahead of Mev extractors ahead of arbitragers ahead of Front Runners to ensure that the average Joe who just wants to swap some tokens gets the best possible a deal that the market will allow for in this episode we with Hayden we go under the hood of uniswap X what it is how it works why it's needed so you'll learn about unit swap exit how it uses a Dutch option to maximize swapper returns how this Dutch auction mechanism also ensures that Mev is maximally retained by swappers also how uniswap X massively reduces Bridge risk and almost entirely abstracts away bridging altogether freeing up Capital to not have to be stuck inside of bridges where it's vulnerable and also how uniswap x formalizes a new kind of player in the game of making trading in D5 maximally efficient as a disclosure of course uniswap is a sponsor of Bank list and banklist also does hold some uni tokens which you can see all the details of as well as all of our other disclosures at banklist.com disclosures so let's go and get talking to Hayden Adams all about this new uniswap X protocol but

held back app development and stifled user adoption the internet allows anyone to create and exchange information what's missing is a value layer that lets anyone Exchange store and program value that's where polygon 2.0 comes in polygon Labs has unveiled a series of innovations that will radically alter the polygon ecosystem and web3 as a whole by leveraging groundbreaking ZK Innovations such as polygon ZK evm the next iteration of the Best in Class plonky 2 proving system and a first of its kind ZK powered interoperability layer polygon 2.0 will give users and devs unlimited scalability and unified liquidity right now there is a polygon Improvement proposal regarding a potential ZK powered upgrade of polygon proof of stake if approved polygon proof of stake would become a layer 2 ZK evm validium so make your voice heard on this proposal by joining the polygon on Discord today you have a chance to help the polygon Community give the internet the value layer it deserves bonjour bankless Nation it is the Sunday before ECC and I'm here with Hayden Adams who has yet another announcement out of the uniswap ecosystem Hayden what's going on man how you doing well sure great to be here first time in Paris um and first time at ECC uh but yeah you know you swap we are keep keep cranking out the hits you know um been pretty busy hard at work and you know most recently we announced unit swap P4 which is new version of the unusual protocol and you know being currently being built in public and it you know basically it makes it easier for you know people to create customized liquidity pools we talked about this last time Hooks and you know what you start to see is uh there's this thing called the routing problem and you know as amm's um you know get more uh flexible and basically what happens is routing gets harder over time and routing was already actually pretty card so today we have hundreds of thousands of tokens we have four versions of the protocol we have multiple chains uh we have you know other liquidity sources and then you also start to think about things like Mev and you know trade-offs between slippage and latency and you know best execution and it starts to get really complicated and definitely the you know with the smp4 and hooks it actually gets even you know one step more complicated right and you know traditionally today we've had a we have a our current like open source we call it the auto router which optimizes routing across unusual P4 uh V3 V2 um and you know what we've been working on today I guess a long build up is what we call uniswap X which is a Dutch auction based protocol for routing uh and and aggregating liquidity and you know we think it's really powerful and we think it will help provide it basically you know one you know improved prices but also has a bunch of ux benefits uh allows for gas free trading uh you know no no slippage on failed transactions uh it starts to internalize uh you know some Mev and provides a bunch of other cool features I don't know maybe I don't know if I say the the next the other big one uh we'll we'll get to every single bit here and for the bank list listeners out there that aren't familiar ECC is the place where you announce things is where announcements comes to be and like I said this is the Sunday before so we're going to be uh seeing a slew of announcements coming out and we're getting the first one here with uniswap X which is this new thing this is the thing that unit swap is announcing this thing called uniswap X but I want to actually set more of the stage and you did a good job but I want to make sure that we we are talking about the problem being addressed here unit swap is cool because every single token gets its own exchange it gets its own pool same thing with unify V2 V3 made it even more complex if you will with this concentrated liquidity and then when we had you on not too long ago like four weeks ago or something about unit swap V4 that whole thing unified V4 was even more expressivity in uniswap pools more complexity and they're really the big takeaway I called it uniswap's uh hook Centric roadmap to go in parallel with ethereum's roll-up Centric roadmap where ethereum is doing this thing where it's pushing complexity to the edges it's like hey roll ups you do all the execution stuff and we will just settle and uniswap's kind of doing something similar with its Hooks and unit swap before it's hey there's a world of expressivity and features and different ways of constructing a pool that we want to enable uniswap pool builders amms to be able to build and what you're what you're I think you're leading up to is like that's all the great we have as much expressivity as we need in uniswap pools except we're still left with a bunch of complexity even though it's been pushed to the margins and unit swap as a base is simple the complexity still exists there's so many pools now pools are different there are different standards of pools and so uniswap X is a solution to harness all of that complexity would you say yeah and I'd say also you know when I was on last time we talked about different ways of achieving decentralization and you know there's like the the most pure form of decentralization is like Automation and you should automate what you can automate and with immutable smart contracts and then the next level of you know achieving decentralization and we talk about this more in the lens of governance but the next level is just like incentivization and then in markets and if you have like a competitive market structure where people are incentivized to do what they should do then that's like more decentralized than something that needs to be governed uh which is like the third tier and for that you achieve that through just like greater distribution of governance rights right um and so what we're talking about here is taking uh you know the the routing like we've done we've already talked about this in the context of the protocol which is highly decentralized and what we're trying to do is uh you know do that for the routing problem uh which is you know you could it's people tend to think about like amms as you know both like routing like both swapping and routing as well as liquidity provision all you know bundled together routing swapping and liquidity different things yeah but like are well you know swapping you know how do you route the swaps right through liquidity um uh but people think of it as like okay you have the amm and you try to find the best price to it but I think um you know you you can start to unbundle them a bit right because like you know today most interfaces have like different strategies for how they route uh through pools right and you know there's various aggregators and they're they're trying to like you know find every possible liquidity Source um you know there's the unisoft UI which today basically just like has like you know trust discover across uni swap pools um and you know what we're trying to do here with uniform X is create a competitive Marketplace for routing all right you know it's almost a way of like decentralized achieving more efficiency through decentralization right like the more people that can participate in in finding the best routes um discovering the best routes uh discovering the best pools you know the better uh discovering all the different liquidity you know the better prices you can get um in the long run if you can create a competitive marketplace right and so what we're trying to do with uni swap X is create a competitive Marketplace for you know routing across liquidity and that liquidity can be on chain uh it can be off chain uh but yeah that's essentially what we're trying to do here creating a competitive Marketplace for routing so with this explode like uniswap even at you know as early as days and V1 was an explosion of pools the cool thing about uniswap is you can list any token and that only got furthered with unison V2 V3 and V4 now we have pools all over the place and so the routing problem maybe to define the routing problem is that with all of these pools and all these different sources of liquidity getting the best price for your trade is a computational problem because there's so many pools out there and so what I think what you're trying to do with uniswap X a Marketplace for competitive order routing is you're just giving that up to the market and saying hey Market instead of this one instead of the unit swap router being the thing that manages all of that complexity you're just giving it up to the marketplace and allowing routers to come in and service that role to make sure that Traders and swappers get the best liquidity get the best offer yes and I think the thing I'd add to that is that because we're you know doing this on a blockchain it starts to touch on a bunch of other problems in in complexity right we have like you know like you could you could do this in chat five like or like you could you could think if you thought think about purely and chatify terms and it's like just like optimizing you know routes but we also deal with things like gas and then we deal with things like the fact that you know uh validators exist and they get to you know choose the order of transactions within a given block right and that starts to take us into you know what people call I guess I didn't I only found out recently that it was rebranded from minor deductible value to maximal extractable Value but then you know it takes you into like Mev territory uh you know gas gas optimizations and latency and there's all these other things as well um another thing is that like there's also you know another area of like price Improvement is you know batching people talk about batching all the time like if people are trading in the same direction at the same time if you just like route it through a unit swap pool in the back then you can swap pool right then like that's less optimal than like netting it all together um so by creating like a kind of a competitive Marketplace for it um in where people are competing in an auction it basically forces people to you know find the most sophisticated strategies um uh that you know offer the most price Improvement and so sometimes it might mean like you know executing multiple transactions at the same time uh and in that way like you know you're saving some gas costs and you're also uh maybe internalizing some of the the price Improvement um to for swappers um but yeah I mean look the real goal is to like you know deliver the value to users at the end of the day and so um and then the other thing I'll mention is that like again because we're on blockchains there's a bunch of like ux implications of um you know like uh just like gas right so with uniform x uh orders are off chain signatures that are then you know so you rather than like signing transactions that are sent directly to the chain usually assign off-chain signatures that you know Express their intent right as as is a word of the moment in in crypto um and and that is you know sort of an auction of you know a price decaying auction and then people are competing you know as soon as the price hits a point where people are willing to fill it you know they the the fillers a new class participant are submitting it to the chain and those fillers look you know similar to The Block Builders of today um and you know likely will be a lot of the uh of overlap or or similar to like the trading firms and arbitragers um and uh because orders just start off as you know off-chain signatures you also get benefits like if if your transaction is going to fail it never gets submitted um uh and also just like being able to abstract away gas for users so if I want to swap you know usdc for die I don't want to think about like eth uh as an input um right today when you saw USD for a die your eat balance goes down a little bit here you know with unit 12x you just signed a message someone else pays the eth and that's reflected in the price that you get um so there's a bunch of other benefits as well but yeah there is the first thing you said as well yeah yeah so there's there's a lot of things under the hood there that I want to unpack like the gas the nav all that kind of stuff but really just to start at the very very top how is this different and just to make sure that we're we're setting the table appropriately how is this different from like a DEX aggregator or some of the other liquidity Optimizer services that are out there like if we take a peek under the hood like what what how should people think about this in in its new form yeah I say that like you know for most Dex aggregators and photos where there is prior work and there's other like teams that are attempting to do things that like are categorically similar but like in terms of like the traditional model for for a deck aggregator uh you know what people are doing is just like like you have like a single team that is like integrating liquidity sources one by one right and you know in in doing that like you're you're hoping to get as much liquidity coverage as possible that was like a kind of traditional Dex aggregator it's definitely like you know various experiments you know like like Casper infusion and stuff that like get into closer territory to what we're we're doing with unusoft X um but here you know rather than like trying to like manually find all the liquidity sources here uh we're basically saying anyone can do that and they're competing against each other right um and so it's it's a Marketplace um it's a little bit more meta than a DEX aggregator so a DEX aggregator that was a name on the there was a unisot meta was one name we considered but same thing with hard uh you know and I think meta kind of I think meta kind of ruins meta is now taken that box has been special sadly so okay so a DEX aggregator provides a singular solution to getting the best liquidity and that that is their solution and what you're saying is in order to improve that product the teams behind every decks aggregator needs to serially manually one by one integrate with liquidity pools and in order to prove to improve their product and what you're saying is uniswap X is not that it is actually a place for all of those solutions to compete in the marketplace yeah and maybe at this this point complexity around uniswap is so large that knowing that the correct way of producing the best outcome is perhaps impossible which is why you need to leave it up to the free market yeah that's definitely it and there's also like other liquidity sources that can start to be integrated um there as well I'd also add that like signed off-chain order based auctions are like a really powerful primitive let's let's dive down into that so like the current if I go to unit swap I sign a transaction I broadcast it to ethereum in 12 to 24 seconds it gets included in the blockchain that is the current unit swap user experience that people are used to with unison X we have this new thing can you unpack that a little bit Yeah I think that something that's funny is that actually every or like you already have an auction happening every transaction right because there's like an option for Block space um but people are like competing to like you know there's like um I'd say that like one thing that's interesting is that if you imagine there's like a price curve and then there's a gas price curve um and today like whether or not your order gets included is based purely on the gas price curve not the asset price curve and so like this combines everything like you just have the price like the nice thing is it kind of like combines like the gas and the price into a single thing um which which is like which is part of it um but yeah like user assign off chain orders they're broadcast and they can be broadcast in a variety of ways and signing off-train orders as opposed to signing agents people have talked about these for a long time like meta transactions or sponsored transactions all these it's like a similar category of things um but we're like bundling you know the gas the gas auction of it getting included in a block with the price option of trying to optimize your price into the at the same time and so that you know there's like a nice efficiency thing there where sometimes for example in the past and it definitely thinks improved a lot with 1159 the AP 1159 but sometimes in the past for example like you know the the ga like your transaction would wait until like the gas dropped a significant amount to get included but in that time the token that you were selling also dropped and so it would have been better for you to pay more gas sooner but your transaction has no awareness of like like there's no like and that's where when people talk about like Mev awareness like if the if the you know if the fee that you're paying has no way awareness of the of the transaction that you're doing then you're like really not optimizing um and so part of this is around that there's also just like a gas like there's like a ux benefit like people don't like thinking about gas you know when I'm trading you know usdc for die I just don't want to think about ease right and it's confusing and that's something that confuses users a lot I think something that maybe it makes uniswap a little bit unique in not not totally unique but like like somewhat unique in like how we are able to develop and design things is we just have a lot of users and we hear a lot from them and you know some of how we approach solving problems we're like okay like what is holding us back today like why why what are our users struggling with right now and that part of what like led to us creating a wallet is our users we're struggling with wallet ux and you know it's it's part of what led to some of our design decisions here is it's like you know people it's just like how do we how do we continue to you know push things forward I want to drill down on this uh off chain order thing just a little bit more because I think it's a great um microcosm for the solutions being put forth by unit swap X as a whole to begin with so in this in unitop in its current form like I said I sign a transaction I broadcast that transaction the gas fee that I pay is hard coded into that transaction and that is independent from the trade that I'm that I'm making and so these are two different variables that are not talking to each other and can produce sub-optimal results because maybe the like you said the token moves against me in the time that I tried to save two dollars of gas I lost 15 off my trade with assigning an off-chain order which is signing a transaction but not broadcasting it and just leaving it for somebody a filler a taker to to take and fulfill that they are allowed to combine the computation between optimizing for gas fees and optimizing for the actual swap yeah and so they take that complexity and do that computation to produce the best best outcome and because it was left off chain it was assigned an off-chain order some sort of off-chained service provider some filler who's managing this order routing and all the other complexity they're able to manage the complexity between the gas and the swap to produce a better outcome for a user and that's just like one piece of many pieces of combined complexity that allows for a better swapping experience for sure something I'll add is that like that might be like oh there's an option like like what does that mean for decentralization but just I think it's like worth noting that like today the way it works is it's not like it's not actually there's no like magic like user signs it goes straight to the chain right there's like we have like mempools we have block Builders we have like we have all these things in between um and what we're trying to do is say like let's optimize what's in between uh to like you know optimize for the best outcomes for users um because today like you know Mev you know block Builders aren't optimizing to give users the most money they're optimizing to take the most money for themselves and and often and actually you know funny enough a lot of that money is going to eat holders through efficient Mev auctions but so actually etholders are making a lot of that profit but we you know ultimately want to give give a lot of that value back to spot first I know we like youth but um yeah we also like ux and and value value retention by by end users yeah I also mentioned that like you know I mentioned like off chain order like signed off chain orders is like a general permanent like uh I I think something that's like really empowerful with you know swap X is it actually opens up a world for like cross chain swapping as well um so you know today we're launching a A or today is uh oh it depends on when this gets hopefully on Monday yeah Monday Monday uh the United States time yeah July 17th something like that um the uh you know there's gonna be like an opt-in beta people can sign up to to or people can like opt in in the UI to start having some small percentage of their orders route through this we're starting small we're we're you know it's only for certain pairs for certain trade sizes Etc um and it's gonna you know so that we can continue to like give time for more fillers to come into the ecosystem and continue how optimizing how we parameterize the system um but you know starting that like today we'll have like a version that's just like on Main net on ethereum um uh but in the long run we can really make this cross chain and you can sign orders that are you know this this method of like signed off chain orders is like a really powerful and expressive and allows for you know really uh good user experience um and an efficient cross-chain swapping as well and so you know not today but maybe like hopefully like later in this year uh we'll see like cross chain trading um and and that will also be really cool I want to try and Define the landscape of what uniswap is now because we have on chain on ethereum and the layer twos we have uniswaps one through four uh which are amms uh and then now we also have uniswap X which is an order routing protocol it's another protocol uh and so this is a new protocol this is not an amm this is actually something completely new compared to all the you know unisots one through four this is not a uniswap five this is something completely different this is a parallel and complementary parallel and complementary like the pieces fit really really well together but I really want to kind of carve out what the definition is of uniswap X I'm going to do my best and you can correct me because I'm only good so far uh unisoft X is a protocol an open-ended protocol for service service providers fillers trade executors to come in fulfill the best trade according to the parameters of a swapper so as swapper comes to unit swap X and they say hey I want to do something and unit swap X puts that into a package that fillers can all compete on and so it's like a protocol we'll do protocols do they bundle things in easy to manage packages of information so that other service providers fillers swappers liquidity providers whatever in the ethereum ecosystem can all come and compete on that Vector of providing that one swapper the best swap possible and this is again complementary with unit swaps one through four but is so completely different protocol correct yeah I mean look uh yeah you could start to think of like amms as ways of creating liquidity uh you know building building on top of liquidity as a building block um right there's like you know on-chain Integrations uh uh and it's just a really cool expressive an efficient on-chain way of providing liquidity um but I'd say that like naive routing Solutions through IMS in the long term are not gonna make it like you kind of need your routing solutions to be aware of things like Mev aware of you know kind of more expressive in user intents and so the the you know you could think of this as like we already have a routing layer we already have this thing we call the auto router we also have this thing we call client-side routing so we have a vert like in our in our web app today you can actually toggle between two types of routing I don't know if you know that but like there's a client side which basically turns off the API entirely and just speaks directly to the chain that's like maximally like provable and uh but then we have like but like to make it like better for users you kind of need to have you know uh smarter routing and so we have this like smart order router you know Auto router thing we call uh and and that is like a little bit faster and discovers more routes but there's an API behind it but uh and it's open source and and so the goalie and I would think of this as like a protocol that lives in that domain not as a protocol that lives in the like amm you know so like we already have this like like the routing side of the system already exists and we're and we're um we're just kind of like you know updating it with a a new protocol and I'll also mention that like Dean swap X does have like this like on-chain smart contracts that settle orders they're immutable actually open source real uh GPL um GPL open source and uh then there is you know uh wait you just have and then you have like front ends that broadcast orders um fillers that have to like discover those broadcasted orders um and uh yeah and then the fillers basically can submit them directly to the smart contracts so I think what unit swap X is really doing is they're um enabling a new type of player in the uniswap arena so we have we have swappers already uh most people listen to this or swappers some people listening to this might be liquidity providers and they are providing liquidity into the amm so we have the amms which are the unisots one through four we have the liquidity providers we have the uh swappers the trainer the traders who trade on unit Swap and but now unit swap X is enabling this new type of player called a filler yeah I think it's worth noting that like they're not new we're just have a routing system that is aware of them right legalizing them we're formalizing them in a way that can put constraints on them because right now what they do is you know you can think of them as today as like the people that do like you know the most advanced trading strategies the people that do a lot of the Arbitrage the block Builders the Mev extractors right and what we're trying to do is like put constraints on them and take value that would go to them and give them back to the swappers um so the the players exist we're just formalizing them and we're we're you know having them compete with each other uh in a way that tries to drive as much value back to swappers as possible so swappers the people who trade on you and swap just trade tokens uh meme tokens usdc ether are now going to be pointed towards uniswap X so to trade on uniswap now in the future and now with unusual X means to be trading through uniswap x correct well you know first like there is like uh the the routing system we're going to build is like you know direct your order wherever it thinks it will get you the best price and so you know especially at launch with the beta like a lot of orders will just drought you know through our existing routing system um I'd say that like over time probably more volume will go to unitopex but I think that over time also most unusual X volume will go through UNIF swap the amm protocol right so unit swap X people will trade on unit swap they can use uniswap x and then uniswap X for as in its nascent time we'll just say oh you know what's most efficient the unit swap order router yeah but as it develops and grows and matures it might find a better pricing and better better just sources over time yeah and but but for what it's worth like that sort of already like we're already in that world which is which is you know like today like if if you don't get best prices going you know going to unisa often people will go go somewhere else and so like there's always like other liquidities like I think they're like you know the goal of the unit swap the amm is to have like the you know the best liquidity and the most assets possible and I think that you know units about before it's like a really really powerful way of achieving that and I'd say that you know uh it's so funny the uh you know one thing that's like really interesting is when I was developing us about V1 you know way back in the day there was like um the framing the the like the mental framework was like do amms have a place in this world uh the frame wasn't like you know um was like I'm gonna build the best amm that's gonna take over all the liquid it was like like this is like a new way to do like liquidity creation and like I wonder if it will like work and like have a place in the world and and I think we saw that it does and it's like a really efficient cool way of creating liquidity and unlock some really powerful new things like the ability for anyone to create you know liquidity at like sort of any like it's sort of you know anyone can create liquidity not not anyone can create liquidity as efficiently or effectively as Citadel but anyone can do it at some level right and that's why a lot of the earliest you know pools that were big on uniswap were like these like longer tail pools that were struggling to get exchange listings Etc um and you know like mkr and I were like very big in the early days because they were like it was like the only place to trade them and so like amms are like have these like new unlocks they're like oh look anyone can provide liquidity it also has like on-chain Integrations which are like a really like like money Legos it's like a really big unlock um I I think that like you know in the like when I think about decentralized finance and like what we're trying to achieve right like we can't just kind of like iterate in our like small world like we have to like kind of innovate and push Beyond it and I'd say that like I think that like amms are like a gonna be like you know I'm extremely bullish amm's as like a market structure but I think that there are also other Market structures that like could you know exist in the future and I think we also want to discover them and have them be part of the uni swap ecosystem right um and and have them be like complementary and so like you could think of this as like oh some you know some volume might go you know elsewhere but like that one you might go elsewhere anyway because if uniform isn't offering the best prices right and so uh I'd say that like you know other liquidity sources are gonna exist whether or not we we you know are aware of them and look for them and and so you know uh also worth mentioning that like today you know new swap uh has like a pretty like it's the funny things that we've actually seen this play out in aggregators like uniswap still is like the largest liquidity source for every aggregator that's out there even though they all have like private market makers other liquidity sources um and I think that like the the sort of network effects that can build up around V4 will also be like really helpful um so what you're saying with all of that is that uniswap X is not a uniswap maximalist protocol uh well it has the word unicello I'd say that like it's it is I'd say that like I don't want to go that far like I'm pretty am Maxi in in many ways but I'd say that like um it's like expressive and starts to push the uni swap ecosystem to go beyond strictly amm's um but I'd say that like it still is like also the best way to Route across amms which is I think really important like you could like like for anything that is like lost to other liquidity sources there's like also gains I think in like routing efficiency um and also uh really importantly when you start to think around like uh you know when we jump back to like that hooks problem like one of the biggest questions that we got after the sort of announcement of our vision for Unison P4 was like okay I'm a team I create a hook and how do I make sure that people like you know front end like one of the nice things about unit swap is I create a pool I know that like routing is going to be discovered in like routing engines like if I create a new hook that has some new like you know like let's say it has like t-wam in it twam if you're routing through a t-wan pool you need to be aware of like the T wam component because that affects the price you get you can't just look at the liquidity um or if I create some other custom hook like how do I know that my you know maybe people are afraid that it will like you know it's not safe and they have to audit it and they take some time to audit and they don't care about me and if they're like how does my liquidity get discovered and this is like the solution to that right it's like if someone creates a new custom pool uh a new custom hook you know rather than needing like uni swap Labs team to audit their hook and integrate it into our front end you know which is which is like uh you know a a not the idea like it's not the ideal process uh right and like let's say they're like maybe we're gonna be in a world where there's a million hooks right or I'm telling you know a million like like right now we already have hundreds of thousands of pools we're gonna be in a world that has like Millions probably eventually hundreds of millions of pools and you can't like have a single kind of team just does routing and so like you can think of this as like now all you need is to find one liquidity one filler who's willing to integrate your hook and then that hook is like represented in the liquidity that you find in front ends like you even saw front end so when you know when you go so someone can like not only create their liquidy pool on uniswap they can like you know find one of any filler in the world or crit um that's willing to like you know include that hook uh and and then you know from day you know immediately that liquidity is represented in the unisoft UI and so I think that like you could think of it as like like uh adversarial but I kind of think of it as like almost like strictly required to like make it work in the long run um and so yeah you know pretty pretty excited metamask has something

on Twitter at Xerox mantle I think this is just overall a really good elegant lesson as to how markets harness complexity really really well there's been no way where one single player could manage all of this complexity with all these different pools in in versus the competition of just like how just like oh this is too complex just deal make the market deal with it um I I want to run through how uniswap X actually works I mean we've talked a lot about the Contours of it but maybe we can run through the life cycle of a transaction and how uniswap X actually ensures that that transaction gets the best actual output of whatever it's trying to do possible so like maybe you can run it through yeah unit swap X under the hood yeah so I mean I guess we can start with like the Unison front end um for for swappers in the install front end it actually looks and feels very very similar okay um you know no new skills are required here no new skills hopefully fewer skills in the long run but um you know when you go to you know you you choose the tokens you want to trade you like kind of like you know you click like swap um the the big the first difference is actually that you'll see that there's no gas for your swap there is still I'll caveat that like there is still like One initial approve per token of like the permit contract we created these permit contracts that you've probably seen that'll like basically allow any signature to do signature any token that you approve on this contract can now do signature based approvals forever for you so that's like what what permit is and this is building on top of that so you do have to do an approved transaction every once in a while for new tokens that you haven't traded and that does cost gas and there's no way to avoid that unless the token itself includes gasless signatures or you're using a smart contract wallet but for tokens that do have you know signature based approvals uh eventually but um anyway like once we have our token approvals uh which is our you know from from that point on right you you make a swap and instead of uh paying gas and instead of um you know signing a transaction you know in if you're using metamask it looks a little different you saw while it looks than a regular transaction it just says you know you're trying to sign a you're just like signing a signature so you sign find that you sign a signature and then at that moment it feels very similar you know it then goes to a pending transaction State for the user um one noticeable difference is that when you sign a transaction you can immediately go to etherscan and start like waiting for it um uh here it's just an off-chain signature so the order hasn't been executed we don't know what the transaction hash will be yet right um at this point it's not even in the mem pool yeah it's in the pre-memp pool yeah at this point the uh you know the order is broadcast to like a network of fillers from the from the front end um and and there's like a kind of like a yeah um there's an API for that and then uh you know it is similar to like our our autoraders there's an API and um so orders broadcast to a network of fillers and I'm going to start with the base case and then mention that there's like an optimal there's there's an additional like ability to parameterize through RFQ but just like the base case of the of a good order if you sign an option order it's broadcast your order is basically like a decaying price auction so like at the moment you sign it you're like willing to accept 100 you know like one price and then the price goes down a little bit over time yeah and so you start at like you know maybe it starts at a little bit above the price you expect in the decays over time and what that does is you know it the moment that it's worth it for someone to fill they will and so that's like what creates a competition right and that's why in theory produces the best possible outcome because so long as somebody is some rational actor is saying hey that's profitable I'll do that you'll get the first profitable actor that'll do that yeah the first you know the person who's willing to take the lowest margin or has like the best strategy um and and they're competing against other people and they want to make sure they get it so they try to get the best price um now uh and then and then you know then at that moment the filler not you submits the transaction meaning they're paying the gas and then what that does is it pulls your tokens out of your wallet you know you've approved it you know and and there's a smart contract that you fill through and it enforces that they can only take the tokens out of your wallet if they send you the required amount of tokens based on the moment at which it executes right because it's like a time stamp component um and that's that's about it right you sign an order a filler you know the first filler that's willing to fill it takes it and some committed on chain and pays the gas and that does the transaction um I think that's something that you know starts to happen here is as you think about like transact like latency uh so back in the day pre 11 59 UNICEF transactions used to take like a few minutes sometimes people are like the gas markets weren't very good or very efficient right um today with you know today it's a little bit faster about 75 of unit swap trades execute in the first block um after they sign it and about you know 90 in the second block by the end of the second block um and you know so I think that there's like definitely a need for the the auctions to happen very quickly um and so to you know there's an optional component for this system um uh you know like option on a smart contract level right you guys can do whatever but um that allows you to like layer an RFQ on top of it which basically means you use an RFQ system right request for quote they're called where you ask a bunch of people what is the best price you'll give me and you use that to inform what the actual market price is rather than like guessing at the when you're parameterizing the auction um to incentivize people to like give you their best quotes you do have to like um you know give uh give them some something sort of in return and so the way that that looks in the smart contracts is if you use the optional RFQ uh parameterization then you can then basically there's like a slight priority given to the RFQ winner for the first you know maybe a few blocks so what it looks like is like I signed my order I I get I if I'm doing uh you know a transaction with an RFQ I I ask you know the best quote I signed an order that says this person can fill at their quote um anyone can fail if they have real price Improvement they can fail and they can come in before them um but there's like some margin of price Improvement that they have to offer so you can't offer like one way higher it's like you have to offer like you know maybe 0.5 higher right something like that so there's still a public auction component where someone can come in with price Improvement and out compete the RFQ winner which is important um but there is like a for a few blocks a slight priority given to RFQ winner which allows you to basically get you know very efficient very fast price Discovery um and you know in that way you know maybe most transactions are filthy that include the RFQ can execute maybe in like you know one to two blocks as opposed to if you weren't using the RFQ maybe it would take like you know five to ten blocks or something like that um yeah with this model uh this uh decreasing price auction which is a Dutch option which has existing from the 1700s which is why we know it's really like a primitive you know where it comes from uh the Dutch yes but do you know I was from tulip auction yeah whenever I think Dutch I'm like was it the Tulips yeah it was the Tulips yeah it was flower auctions we'll put a pin in that one first tulips now dogs um you have the option of extending the time and the or slowing down the decreasing price for a very long time like you know you could go up to 10 blocks or you could go up to 10 days for whoever wants to do that for whatever reason what would be the advantage for extending that period of time like why would someone do that yeah I'd say that you know you can so so one thing is if you don't want to like depend on this R you know this RFQ system or the RFQ system is not like Optimal for whatever reason for your trade some people might just be comfortable make happy like part of it is like you know there's sort of an assumption in what I'm saying that users need their transaction to execute in the same one or two blocks and I think a lot of users that's really important and it's like a reason that like that's like like you know when we when we build things at use pop we have like we have to be able to consider what our users care about and and so uh you know having this like rf2 component allows it for users who want their trade to execute in like the next block um it allows that but if users are like comfortable waiting like a minute or two you you might have um there's definitely the you know there's a lot of debates you could get into about whether or not it's like there's price Improvement it probably depends on like the size of the order all right if you're making like a large order giving some people time to like Source liquidity can optimize the price SO waiting a little bit longer giving more time for it to propagate more people discover it et cetera there is risk that the the price moves like that the price moves against you during that time and not like you know this they sort of like so you you are like if you haven't ordered the executes more slowly there is risk um that you are taking on like price risk that like maybe the like the trade will like go down uh you know the price will go down not up for the token you're selling and so it's not like strictly better but it is um it does let you like remove the rfg system and it also you know I say that like you know waiting one to two minutes like you're not really expecting too much price movement and it might actually like optimize price a little bit uh but it's it's I don't want to like it's like such a kind of a interesting design in trailer space that it's like um I I'd also mentioned that you know one reason that might that might actually be is that like batching within the system is like if you have orders execute slowly maybe someone else makes an order in another Direction within that time and then it's more efficient to net against them uh something that like maybe I'll I'll people ever know is like the story not everyone but most people know the story of like Carl and you know my first friend in the space and he gets me into Ammons I don't know if you know my second the second person I met the first three people in order that I met in the space were Carl then Phil die in and then um then Dan Robinson that's a pretty good lineup good good lineup the second person I met in this space was Phil and you know the the founder you know co-founder of flashbots um and like Mev inventor of the term Mev I believe um discoverer of Meb yeah uh yeah uh yeah and you know uh he released like the flash below his 2.0 Paper yeah all right and so we've been talking about this like design space since like well before and like you know the first like you know the first kind of version of unit spot right is like oh I mean like yeah like this like leaks me kind of I mean we didn't have the word Mev yet but yeah and he sent me a paper uh by this guy Eric buddish um called like uh feature it was something like um frequent batch auctions uh uh uh the the the the something trading arms race you know frequently like basically gets into like the whole like Flash Boys 2.0 and like basically like postulates that like if time is continuous like if you treat time as like a continuous thing then like these like hft games are like inevitable right um that like there's always people they're like front running is like inevitable it's like time happens in order and like that like the only and that like to like create fairer systems that don't favor like you know like like a like an arms race you kind of have to like break time up into discrete intervals and do batching within those intervals um and so they sort of like you know can we and and definitely like they were like have been earlier attempts at it in ethereum but I think there's like often like ux issues around it so I think what we're partially trying to do is like experiment with and explore this like this this trade-off space of like how do we like create fairer outcomes that don't have this like this like like maximized power in like in like the most sophisticated traders in the world purely um and I think part of that is like starting to like enable things to be executed and batch and starting to be like more aware of things like Mev and and so um I don't even remember a question you asked at this point I'm kind of just ranting but um we were going through um how did the just the life cycle of a token yeah and then also just the time for why someone would extend out a long long period of blocks yeah all that to say like users have their preferences for like how they're ordered like if someone really cares about executing their order immediately they probably are going to get a slightly less optimized trade because they have to kind of like rely on like like like you can't very efficiently discover the op like auctions allow you to like efficiently discover the the right nice um but the slower like it's slow like if the auction is too fast it's not very efficient it's hard you have to like know how to parameterize your auction and you don't know how to and like and so like the faster you need it to converge like the less in some ways there's like less time for optimization and so like having like yeah um slower orders over time like like might just let you like get more optimal prices where you feel better about like they're not being someone who's like extracting some value from your transaction if you don't care and you just want to order to happen right now you know like then like you're always gonna then like things like um you know we can do much much better than today but like um there's going to be some trade-off space of like if you want the instant fastest transaction you might have to pay a little bit more in the long run than people who have slower transactions right what about Mev how is Mev as a mechanism Inc like stock how how has Universal X stopped the leakage of Mev yeah I say that like nothing you know I don't want to use phases like stop the leakage of Meb because there's like such a like there's even like different ways of like thinking about it some people say like oh Mev exists no matter what it's just like you've internalized it or some people or it's like gone to a different party it existed and you just you know if you generally think about it as like you know someone wants to make a trade you know like that creates some value somewhere and like uh you know like there's a lot of forms of Mev right people have talked about like sandwiching front running back running you know reordering transactions reorgs uh I don't remember Time Bandit attacks okay I'll rephrase that question answer how has zero swap X changed yeah the way Mev is expressed yeah yeah no I think that like generally what we're trying to do is have value that today leaks out to block Builders and validators through Mev markets right right now when someone makes a trade like it is actually also broadcast publicly it's brought like right now basically you know someone makes a trade on you swap like people are just like competing with each other but they're not competing with each other to offer the best price to the uniform user they're competing with each other to extract the most value from the unit swap user that's what like that's what current Mev markets are and that's what current like block building networks are and what we're trying to say is like can we change how we encode transactions such that that competition that like that like rather than like two sophisticated a bunch of sophisticated people competing to like extract value from swappers like the competing with each with each other and as much of that value is humanly possible like some of it like some value will always have to be go to ethereum minor or valid validators some value will always go to like block Builders but like how do we just maximize the percentage of of the Mev that goes back to the swapper because they're competing with each other right like if if they're competing right now they are competing with each other but they're competing with each other to take all the money now we want them to keep compete with each other to like have most of that value go back to the swapper um so it just has to do with how you like encode your transactions and having like you know an auction is a way of of doing that because if they're you know today like a unit swap order is like executing it like basically like a you know it says like I will make this trade as long as I get better than the minimum slippage my slippage tolerance what that means is like a validator can like front run the order up to the slippage tolerance and take that money for free if you're mining a block right um and we don't want that and so by having like a price Decay over time as soon as it's probably like like as soon as it's profitable for someone to like to like include that transaction they will and and so it I guess one way to put it is that like today like depending on the size of the trade like it can be profitable to like front run up to your slippage tolerance and this one it it doesn't go to the minimum price because it usually actually like your slippage tolerance is still expressed that's like the minimum price of the auction but the order is filled well before it hits your minimum price and it can't be hit your minimum price until the end of the auction by which time it's already been profitable so the first moment it's profitable that's when it's filled and so you don't like just get like front run up to your subject tolerance which is kind of how it works right this is the beauty of the mechanism design of a Dutch auction where just the mirror system itself of making sure a somebody fills that order at the first profitable opportunity is the Mev protection mechanism yeah I I'd say that like also like you know so that's like the mechanism of production I said there's like other ways that like like it's it's improved and like like things like just the fact that like if you have a bunch of transactions at once that are off chain order is like one filler can like discover all of them and complete them all at the same time and that means that like it can be it's about like that means it can be profitable to fill them all even earlier in their life cycle because like like someone might have an order and on its own it's not profitable for the filler to include it in a block or like a block Builder but like if you if you you know have another order that's going the other direction then maybe you can and so like when you think about that as like the earlier up you are like the higher up you are in your Dutch auction like it's a decaying price the higher up you are the less value has been leaked and so we're trying to like you know the more optimal that you know of that we can like make these filler networks um and the better we can parameterize these orders like the less value will be leaked okay are we ready for the bridge conversation cross chain that cross chain swapping yes costume swapping how do we how do I enter this conversation yeah what's the point of entry here I I can start and and um uh basically you know when you have orders expressed as off-chain signatures um we initially like started this Pro uh project kind of thinking about what we might want to do in the aggregation space and and I think that what we just governed in the past is like if you especially order this off-chain signatures there are like other things you can do and I think one thing we discovered is that you can actually do very efficient um very you know powerful good ux cross chain swapping um and you know so instead of signing an order that says I want to swap this token for this token on ethereum you could sign an order that says I want to talk Swap this token on optimism for this token on arbitrum or this you know swapping you know across chains and the the sort of beauty of it is that from a swapper's perspective the user experience is exactly the same and even like the the like the like the the ux of like you know it actually can feel very quickly and the the you know these fillers that are filling orders on you uh that we've already talked about they actually can handle like the complexity and latency uh of using Bridges um and and figuring out settlement and so uh you know we basically think that like the the cross chain version of this is is really powerful I guess one way to put it is that um maybe a few of the benefits that you might see is one it allows for like native asset swaps so like right now a lot of value currently lives in like when people are doing like moving funds between chains and making trades across them usually what you're doing is like you're bridging an asset then you have a bridged representation of that asset on another chain um that is like sitting in a passive look in like a liquidity pool um and then you're swapping in that liquidity like you might like bridge to maybe it could be more concrete like you might bridge to polygon and then swap your polygon eth to um to uh to Matic tokens on polygon or I guess they re-randed their token um soon yeah something like that with approval yeah something like that um but uh but you know in that work you know and you know bridges are like I mean look we've we've looked at this world of Brit like we've had so many Bridge hacks funds that passively sit in bridges are just like you know risk for the industry more or less look the more you know obviously like some bridges are much better than others and like we've had like these L2 Bridges have been have held up pretty well so far for the most part um but what you can do with uniform X is you could just say I'm gonna swap Ethan mainnet for Matagon polygon and you know a filler basically you know uh I I should I talk to the life cycle maybe maybe that would help yeah but like you know so like a swapping my sign in order that says like I want to swap Ethan maynet for formatic on on polygon and a filler and then and it just like the the previous you know version like you have like this decaying price option for how much you know Matic you need to fill to you know to get that the input eth and uh the order is actually completed on the input chain as well so the filler when as soon as there's a price at which they're willing to fill they like you know they they initiate a transaction that like claims the order and they they transfers the user's input you know tokens into a kind of like an escrow contract and they put up a little Bond and uh now you know they're basically responsible for sending you those tokens on the output chain and so the next thing that the filler does is they send you those tokens on and output on the output chain and uh you know now the filler from the swappers perspective they like have just like made a cross stream Swap and then the filler basically has to like prove that they did that to claim the user's input tokens on the input chain and if they don't do the proof eventually it would go back to the the swapper because they you know never proved they filled um now how do you do a proof you can you know do any like any possible Bridge right um so that's one of the really cool things about it is that like you just have X cross chain variant basically can support any possible message you know Bridge messaging or like any like crochet messaging protocol or even like any other use system for how you settle these cross chain orders uh it's like kind of completely agnostic to that uh but you know we have initials some initial smart contracts which I think will probably be going open source around the same time as as uh that basically allow you to um that work for like the you know the canonical optimism arbitrum and polygon Bridges um uh but yeah basically like you know the the filler has to proof through a bridge or they could do it optimistically like you know one way to do it it's like it's assumed the filler fills unless someone challenges it and then it kicks off eight the fourth to to do it through a bridge it's like a similar design space to like optimistic Roll-Ups or something where like um but but that shouldn't happen in most cases like because you have bonds to prevent that uh but generally speaking maybe I'm you know user signs often order uh that that is an auction uh filler you know uh initiates a transaction that puts their tokens onto the uh into the escrow contract then filled in the output chain and does the proof and that proof can be an optimistic proof which means that like it's assumed that they do it unless it's proven that they don't um and then in that way you have like very you know fast good ux cross chain swaps and like definitely if you go to a challenge period then it might be like like if you have you challenge a swap where you need to prove it through like the you know the optimism or arbitrine Bridges which are seven days then you have a seven day lockup period of the the input assets but that only happens if if a filler lies and then they lose their bond and so you have to like parametrize these bonds to uh to be such that it's not incentive it's no not optimal to to fade to to carry this through with one of the themes I established at the beginning which we talked about with all unit swap V4 and one through four there's all these pools and all this complexity and so this beautiful elegant mechanism of an off-chain signed uh order an off chain order that doesn't just solve the complexity problem of pools it also solves the complexity problem problem of bridges and bridges and pools are kind of similar in that in that regard and so since we are just signing these transactions signing these messages of these off-chain orders that say I have this token and I would like this other token on this other chain all of that gets abstracted by the same service providers the same the same fillers and so they they can manage the bridge complexity they can manage the the timing and the latency of that and just provide the swapper the thing that they want which is the maximum number of tokens in the place that they want it yeah and all of that complexity is just again once again the whole theme of this seems to be left up to the free market left up to the fillers yeah and there's like smart contracts on them like the input chain that like enforce that this swapper actually gets what they wanted right uh because you do have to choose like what is your source of Truth for whether or not the order was filled and that's specified in the order as it's being broadcast and so like it's likely that like will you you know in our UI once we have this um live in our UI like you'll probably use like mostly canonical Bridges so like you know uh you know for swaths between optimism and may not maybe we'll use the optimism bridge and you know you can use the optimistic pattern to make it so that like you know you don't actually have to have seven day you know delays and I I'll also mention like one thing that's kind of cool is that it's not just for like like you can think of it as like also like for like Fast L2 exits you can use this right some people who are you know some people might will be willing to like pay you if you have you know uh Ethan main net and want Ethan optimism someone who's on optimism who wants to exit might be willing to pay you a little bit to do that right um and so you can use this for fast exits as well um I'd say that like definitely the like reduced amount of one thing that's like a little bit different is from like most existing kind of like bridging protocols is most bridging protocols have passive exposure to bridge risk passive exposure to bridge risk what is that so like if basically like um liquidity providers in them are like like it's like you hear about like Bridge hacks like basically like that like yeah we do yeah yeah like you hear about fish attacks all the time there was I think there was a billion dollar one like last week or something oh last week I thought so maybe not I've been gone for 10 days this is the first thing I've done and yeah crypto the last 10 days well I have some catching up to do well we don't I don't know if we know how much I think it was like minimum I don't know it was like anyway we don't need to get into specific but um but yeah like you know Bridget Bridge hacks are a thing um and it's because people are like have like they're holding you know they you deposit a token on one chain and it has a rep and then at that point the bridge is kind of like almost like a multi-sig holding all the fun those tokens and they have representations of those tokens on other chains um and the the sort of like Risk and and for as long as those tokens live on the other chain in any form and if you want to have like liquidity for people to like make trades then like liquidity providers need to hold those like bridged representations of tokens on the other chains and so like Ethan another chain is always going to be worse than Ethan may know and you know uh there's this maybe one exception like usdc on any chain is probably like equally the same which is kind of interesting and that's why it's interesting that they have a bridge and by the way we did do an experiment that that made it so that we could use like the circle usdc Bridge as a settlement system for the cross chain variant of unusual X um but that's sort of an aside um but you know yeah it again speaks to like you can like basically have like I think we're gonna eventually have a world where like most assets live on the chain in which they were originated or originated or like whatever in whatever chain that they're like most secure or is like most canonical for that asset uh there might be some assets that are like on multiple chains like things that are common stores of value and like you know currencies so like you know top stable coins and maybe eth and a few others but like um but generally speaking like allowing you know if you're a liquidity provider just letting you kind of like hold most of your like like let's say that like you know I want to feel and like I could have like some native tokens on each chain and like if I want to fill an order like let's say I do a cross chain swap from some to some random native asset to optimism from from mainnet like even if you don't have like like there might be amms on optimism that are between like you know the optimism native tokens and other optimism native tokens and a main map between Mana native tokens and so like the filler they can basically just like maybe they have like they're holding op tokens on optimism they buy some other optimism native token fill your order on and fill your order on optimism and then they like never ha and then like they just like receive Ethan mainnet and they never at any moment in time had to have like fun like they never had to hold like eath wrapped on optimism or it just like reduces the amount of like like the size of these Bridge honey pots and lets people just like swap between native assets well it seems to really minimize the use of bridges in the first place like rather than have Bridges being bridges for ax assets bridges are in this model are simply just used to pass the final message data not assets of approval that the bridge was actually the the trade the swap was actually executed appropriately right and so it's one small use of a bridge to pass a small packet of data right rather than having hosting long-term liquidity inside of these Bridges and you don't even need that data packet unless the either this like the SWAT like the filler is lying like like if the filler like actually fills your order you don't even need to pass that data is it fair to call it minimum viable bridging yeah we're basically like trying to minimize the amount of like assets only live in bridges you know like there are assets like users are only exposed to bridge risk while transactions are in Flight once like you know like the swapper has their like once a swapper has the output tokens and the filler has the input tokens there's like no more Bridge risk for either party unless those tokens are happen to be like wrapped bridged assets but they don't need to be um so yeah we're like minimizing the the extent to which people need Bridges we're also kind of like abstracting them away a little bit like like this system can kind of support any possible Bridge it you could think of it as a bridge aggregator it's important to like know that like the the you know when I've the bridge used for settlement is like different from like like fillers can use any Bridge they want to like move liquidity around um you know they can use centralized exchanges they could use Bridges whatever um but then like each trade does have a specific Bridge or or what you know what we use we use the term settlement Oracle right which is which is can be any Bridge it could also technically be any other system you could technically use like a multi-sig or a governance system or a single party if you wanted if you wanted to you could also trust the filler if you like are like I trust the filler and then like you could trust them to be and they could be the and then you say anything that they say it happened like technically you could do whatever you want right um you just need some system to say that yeah yes that said that trade that swap was fulfilled and this protocol is like completely agnostic to that system it like can support any possible system we have like you know initial smart contract designs that like work with like uh you know as I mentioned like the the main app to you know like the canonical uh L2 bridges for optimism overtone polygon we have a design that works with like the circle Bridge um but it can really work with all the other every bridge you hear about in the space like theoretically you could have like an adapter that could use that bridge then bridges are competing on like offering security and latency for like passaging passage passing messages and not like you know having like billions of dollars of liquidity stored in them passively which is like real you know which is like a security risk and we've seen how that plays out I I just again the the theme of this whole thing is seems to be harnessing complexity and uniswap X the naming also I think is intuitive because we have unit swaps one through four right which are amms and again UFO uniform X is not an amm it is a order router an order Optimizer and so we have all of this expressive liquidity protocols that we call amms unitops one through four and then we have this other expressive order fulfillment service called Unit swap X it really kind of seems to be like a yin and a Yang like two sides of the same coin where if you smash these things together now you have unit swap that is uniswap right right yeah I'd say that like this is definitely like a moment and it's not the first moment but it is a moment where like you saw you yourself as an ecosystem can like step slightly Beyond but it's done and you know and kind of continue pushing into to do territory but like yeah definitely my Frontiers please New Frontiers yeah um I I say that like definitely the you know the the end goal right is we want to create like decentralized markets and we want you know um today right people use decentralized markets because they are decentralized but they don't but there's like a trade-off right like the user experience is still a little bit worse like they still like it's still not as efficient they're still not as much liquidity it's still you know like you you kind of like people use it like despite the flaw the the the the but we think that like in the long run like decentralized markets can actually be like more powerful and stronger and like have better user experience and you know more efficient market structures um right like you know we speak to like like even like when you think about like a market-based approach to something versus like a single company that's trying to like you know optimize for you know for you right like moving into these models we just think that like um you know and using also like all these like new tricks that we've learned in blockchains and with crypto you know new novel cryptography and eventually we'll have like the you know better ZK Tech and like that's going to be part of the story like this is like a first step that's that's a really important thing I want to get across like like building like we want to build like the ultimate kind of like Phil you know decentralized kind of order flow you know Network and there's like a broader industry around us that are all is also working on these problems we want to do it like collaboratively right like teams like you know like flashbots Etc like there's like all these other teams that are also working towards like how do we like decentralize order flow and and this is like part of that story but I think it's a really big moment for the industry because uni swap is because in part because like of how dominant unuswap is from a like you know in terms of like volume and users right like something like probably like 30 plus percentage of all gas on on ethereum is uniswap trades and it's a and I guarantee it's a higher percentage of Mev right um because you know unit swap trades generate more MVP than transfers and so it might you know and so like like having you know uh like I I think that like you know like us kind of stuff in the space like and like is like really important for kind of helping push the industry forward and also like having users and like being able to like learn from them and and kind of optimize and improve you know for real people that are really transacting like is like really uh useful and important uh and and uh you know again we're like really excited to do it collaboratively and like um and you know if these other kind of like models also end up working out like things like Suave like could like you know be directly tied into things like you know use of X like they're they're not like also automatically competitive we're all kind of like working towards like decentralized order flow um generally so what's the rollout plan for uniswap X how does it gets started today Monday the 17th yeah today Monday the 17th uh it's actually Sunday but for us but for you guys we're hearing this on Monday uh what's what's the rollout plan how does this actually launch yeah so today what we have is the the you know single chain mainnet variant um is in like an early kind of opt-in beta stage meaning that when you make a transaction you know when you go to the uniform web app you can go into settings and you can turn it on you can also just like make transactions and if there's a transaction that you know the the interface thinks you will get a better price if you use uniform X or or if not a better price like it's like or and I I think again it's like this is like the the first like it's sort of like an early Beta And so it's like um uh yeah you know it will suggest it to you and you can turn it on even once you've turned it on it doesn't mean 100 of Trades will route through it it's actually going to be like a probably like a smaller percentage of Trades only like certain tokens only certain um you know trade sizes only certain pairs only certain you know like it's it's this is again like the like the earliest bait of our lot we want to really like test the system before we you know rolled out to more user to like a full user base uh and for like you know all orders and so and you know so so you know today what we have is a working system for the mainnet version um and the ability to opt in and have some percentage of your trades execute through it uh when you do you will see that your order is now no longer cost gas there's minor ux tweaks that show like this or that there's like no gas being paid uh it will be a signature instead of a transaction um when the transaction is pending you don't can't go to easy scan because the transaction hash hasn't been created because it's just an off-chain signature so there's like a few things um it's kind of like a slow rollout we really like you know it's like a big moment and a big change in a complex protocol we want to like optimize parameterization we want to time for you know a competitive Marketplace only exists once people join it actually participate and so we have like some you know a little bit of work to onboard some initial kind of uh fillers as to help like test the system but like we really want to give time for more people to onboard and interact before you know before it becomes like the full thing and so this is like an early version and now in terms of like the cross chain variant um unclear we have some art contracts right now like stuff like parameterization you know how long it will take fillers to start to integrate cross chain um they're still probably gonna have to wrap their head around the single chain variant and that will take some time um as well as like the front end um considerations of cross-chain trading there's like some other changes that probably need to be made to like let you swap you know between different chains like in terms of how we handle network connection and other things so we're starting to like work on improvements in our web app today that like make it more multi-chainative if you look at our wallet our wallet is very like handles multi-chin very cleanly and our web app is like not quite there and so like as we're like optimizing the single chain variant we're going to start like optimizing our web app to be better for for multi-chain generally and then you know hopefully like later this year um we have you know the the cross chain variant uh in our web app as well and people will be able to make you know trades but uh yeah what uh service providers or or what other people infrastructure is needed in order to actually get this thing up and rolling like who do you who do you need to hear from who do you need to get onboarded yeah I'd say that like you know a lot of it already is like like you know swappers just need to use the web app as normal liquidity varieties just need to create liquidity and even thought protocol as normal um I'd say that like what's new is there are definitely fillers and uh they're sort of you know initially like uh there's initially just like an API that broadcasts you know orders and and so in integrating that and being able to like fill orders uh you know there's already like there's all these like people that do block building that can start tapping into that so we need fillers to start discovering orders also um you know for the RFQ variant uh definitely there's a need of like people who provide quotes up front um [Music] that's about it I'd say that like probably like wallets having like good ux around signature based orders will help yeah they all have signatures and like all other sites have done like signature based orders before but the more like the wallets can be aware of like the ux implications of this the better um uh you know that's about I'd say that like people can start like you know looking at the Crossing smart contracts and thinking about how to build adapters for other Bridges if they wanted if devs want to get involved in that um uh generally like infrastructure around you know alternative like uh so a cool thing is that like when a user signs an order they're incentivized to like broadcast that order as broadly as possible they want as many fillers to discover that as possible similarly if you're a filler you want uh to discover as many orders as possible and so having like redundancy at the like broadcasting layer like you know like today we have mm pools and whatever for ethereum transactions like having like alternate like you know apis for hosting signed orders stuff like that can could be helpful or interesting but I think over time they'll be like it won't just you know it won't just be like one API for hosting these signed orders right and that's not the goal so you know things that like help further the the decentralization and um I guess is also desired um but yeah I don't know that that's it's a bunch of stuff and so that's a lot of that's a lot of uh surrounding infrastructure uh again a lot of moving Parts a lot of complexity but also protocols that harness complexity is kind of a Core theme of not just the unit swap in the last year or so but really crypto at large I would say uh Hayden it's been a crazy year for uniswap in 2023 you got the mobile wallet you know swap V4 now unit swap x uh is there I mean we're only halfway through the year are you going to be on again before the end of the year I think I'll be on and I'm expecting two to three more times in 2023 probably oh my God what else is coming you know we gotta we got some we got some things lined up um I can show you uh privately after this after this podcast all right well apparently Bank location you can hold your breath because Hayden Adams will be back for more unit swap releases uh just the absolute Juggernaut in 2023 Hayden thank you for being just such a strong bear Market Builder and really pushing the space forward thank you uh thanks for having me on and you know always love coming on Bank list and yeah we you know we're trying to decentralize finance so yeah yes we are yes we are and we're doing a little bit jet lagged at the very start of ECC uh both Hayden and I landed uh coming from the East Coast uh just a number of hours ago so uh that's it being into ECC with the podcast Hayden thank you so much for joining me on Bank list today thanks for having me on Cheers Bangles Nation you know the deal crypto is risky defies risky uni swap X it's a brand new protocol it's probably also risky too just because all things are you can lose what you put in we are headed west however it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bank this journey thanks a lot
