welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a fantastic episode with no other than balaji who is a pleasure to talk to you he's one of those people where i listen to every podcast i can that he is speaking he's kind of like vitalik in that category and the premise of this episode is the rise of what he calls the network state this is a cryptography empowered country we're going to dig into this but the tantalizing prospect is this what if online communities could use crypto to form their own nations belagi says not only is this possible it's actually the way forward for humanity the network state as the successor to the nation-state that we all live in today so a few things to take out of this episode number one the inflation the wars the protests the populism we see blasi goes through the common denominator to all of these things number two how a discord community can launch a country we go through an example for the bankless nation what that might look like in bellagi's framework number three the one commandment bellagi says for launching a network state the thing you absolutely have to have number four countries in the cloud let's talk about some of the critiques we do that in this episode including are these cloud countries just for the rich and number five some action items as always to walk away with what do you do if you want to join one of these digital societies where are they how can you start one david fantastic episode love these conversations with bellagio we've got to do this more we had bellagi on back in november of 2020 which was really at the very beginning of his thinking around this like network state idea and it's been lovely to see him fast forward almost two years later and just have a seeing how much it's been refined or being like sharpened and being able him being able to articulate much more with much more clarity i really really enjoyed that and this is something that this is a concept that we are super aligned with bellagio on this is the concept of blockchains or chains or tokens or online communities being enabled to produce currencies and then organize in other ways is something that has captured my attention as one of the early promising ideas that crypto can bring to the table is we can we can provide the structure for 10 000 nation states but not states just nations to exist in the cloud and start to organize around new sets of ideals rather than just the geographic boundaries as to where humans and people tend to be living but instead around ideals or values or shared goals um first in the cloud but perhaps later also in real life um ryan if you if you were a part of a network state what would be the uh the shared shared value that you would want to be a part of david i'd i'd have to say going bankless would be the same value yeah perhaps perhaps we should create a bankless nation if you will right ryan sounds like a good idea and we actually explored the logi how to do that as i mentioned the cool thing about this of course is crypto technology is at the bottom of this the network states so cryptocurrency of course but uh social smart contracts to enforce governance crowdfunding on-chain consensus it's all here in bellagi's idea so we're going to dig right into this there's some visuals that accompany this episode as well so a lot good news you can actually see the visuals on spotify now spotify has partnered with bank lists to do video so we're bringing bloggie tv in video format you can get all those videos if you if you're subscribing via

fiction free bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you yet again to balaji srinivasan he is an investor he's a founder he's the former cto of coinbase general partner of a16c and more recently the author of the network state which will be the focus of our podcast today bellagi welcome back to bankless thanks for having me you know it's been almost two years since we last had you on and uh things have gotten weirder since then all right we've got inflation which is now a household topic global macroeconomic topic there's a war in europe protests over food and energy increasing distrust in our institutions our election process our central banks there's this increasing rise of populism that has just trended upwards is there a common denominator between these things bellagi can you draw a line between all of these things um yeah so uh my world model is um i mean this many other people have talked about this but the ending of the post support order and so you have the post-war order of 1945 or arguably the extension after 1991 with the end of the cold war and it's it's that at the same time as you know the prize of the internet and an industrial revolution that you know with automation and the rise of crypto and the rise of china and the rise of india and um you know the relative decline of the west and so on and so forth like there's many things that are all just going like this and this at the same time right and um so so yeah i think like that that older world is ending and a new world is beginning and um you know all the top gun infinity remakes and the you know 70 something year old presidents and the geriatric congress and um all this stuff is sort of an attempt to kind of hold on cling to the past as it's kind of slipping away and people don't have a vision yet for a positive future and in so far as they do have vision for the future it's often a black mirror style dystopia or what have you because they envision the future getting worse um and so a big part of the book is on potentially a way that you or one personally can make the future better that is not simply trying to prop up or fix this in my view failing broken hard to fix if not impossible to fix existing system but to build something better i really like that analogy about the state of culture when it comes to our movies like we're where we we're bringing backwards uh or bringing forwards action heroes from like the 50s and 60s and also you can hear it in our political slogans right like make america great again or build back better depending on like which color that you align with we're trying to like restore the past uh and and we're fearful perhaps uh xenophobic of the future uh but uh i think there's a reason why bellagio you are a crypto person is because of all the populations all the people all the communities out there the crypto people of the world are one of the few populations that's actually optimistic of the future so it sounds like your solution for this is to not try and restore the past that tends to not work in history but uh there's a quote from i think winston churchill that i always love where if you find yourself going through hell keep going like don't stop get break on through to the other side uh is that is that the future that you are trying to herald for us here i'd say 75 yes let me give the 25 that is different right the 25 is i am not um anti like okay so for example let me let me motivate this in one way have you used undo in the app yeah you've never used undo in any app oh oh every single day command z okay so you can have david calls it command z i was like whoa this guy never misses a keystroke right okay all right so you've used undo are your programmer if you use git revert nah no i have not okay so git revert is basically like you probably you know the cons somebody introduced a bug and they have to revert it and go back you know right so if you think about undo you think about previous file versions you think about backup and restore you think about um you know that kind of stuff it actually is useful sometimes to rewind to move in a different direction it doesn't mean rewind to go quote back to the past and stay there but rather we took a wrong turn and so we need to take this other turn right and if you agree with that on a microscale of undo right you actually probably agree with it on a mezzanine scale because companies actually spend a lot of money on backup and restore right to be able to back up your data from a week or a month ago right and in fact blockchains are about in indelible history in many ways that's a big part of their value proposition like property that can't be seized from you has that past that history that base right this is what i call the relationship between micro history and macro history micro history is a history of measurements on a system macro history is like you know what we think of as history like uh you know pottery shards and records of ancient rome but those things relate with crypto history because it's the um it's got the the aspects of micro history like individual measurements but it's the scale of an entire society because it's the entire economy and it's every communication it's all the users we're just built like history is beginning in a sense in you know the year we're in year 13 anno satoshi okay like the true start of written history was maybe you know a thousand years ago the true start of crypto history was 13 years ago okay with that kind of framework you know things don't necessarily always just get better you know uniformly things are more complicated than that prices sometimes go down before they come back up you sometimes need to undo and go back you don't make the exact right turn every time we're not infallible because we're fallible we need to have metrics that say when the past actually was better to take a step back and then move forward in a different direction right and if you actually look at for example the renaissance right that was inspired by antiquity right they rediscovered all these things from classical like whoa those old guys did some amazing stuff and then with that they were able to push forward they didn't have to reinvent the entire wheel in a sense one point i make in the book is with physics for example we think of physics and science and so as being totally different from history but there's actually a relationship and what that is is uh do you guys know any physics do you need like like you know definitely okay basically all right so the equations of physics um are written as like f equals m a or you know where f equals dp dt you know maxwell's equations those actually are a distillation of lots and lots of experiments of essentially the history of all of these investigators and rather than having all of their verbal stories and whatnot rather than trying to reinvent the wheel and and redo hundreds thousands maybe millions of man years of experimental work you encode that in one equation you move forward from there right so you take the lessons of experimental history encode an equation and that foundation that foundation stone allows us to get to mars right we we don't realize that in science because it's like mathematical but that mathematics did not just come out of nowhere it came out of a distillation all this past stuff and the same way understanding like sort of the physics of human beings and how they collide into each other and unders having some sense for history you know it is possible i think to build better systems when you can benefit from the life experience of millions of other people and that distillation just like you can from physical law let me pause there so that's why i say i'm not a completely the past sucks kind of guy at all actually um i i'm definitely future oriented and whatnot but as i gave some arguments for i think it's useful to think about a rewind and then like a repositioning to move forward right yeah this reminds me of uh back to the future two or three where they go into the wrong future and then they have to go back to the old future to go to go forward and this is just you know basic respect for the lessons and that we've learned throughout history right and so humans we experiment with things we learn new things uh we try and go and forward in one direction and then we learned that we were actually off base so we have to rewind and go one step backwards to like go back to our core foundations so we can go forward in like a new direction that we actually learned was better exactly progress is a vector it's not just a scalar they say it's not just we're going forward or back it is we could go forward but on a different axis we're just you know we're moving to space as opposed to you know like you know another society might be all about the oceans right another human society might have been like the number one thing is to figure out what's at the bottom of the ocean everybody was obsessed with that and so and so forth you can imagine different vectors for what progress looked like right right and this is something that we uh talk about on bank list all the time the american constitution is a great piece of just like fundamental what feels like political science right definitely is political science uh but the current manifestation of america feels misaligned with that basic foundation and so i think the idea perhaps this is where we can start talking about the network state is like let's go back to some core principles uh because this current direction is a little bit off the rails so let's go backwards a little bit so that we can go forward in a new more refined direction that takes our current context our current global macroeconomic context into account uh because we've gotten off track and it's actually like i'm going to go ahead and guess balaji that the network state is your proposed next vector for humanity well you know it is it is a toolbox not a manifesto right and so that's actually like a really important thing is um you know there's different ways of decentralizing something right one way of decentralizing something is you know the way satoshi did it with physical decentralization and actually pseudonymity is another form of decentralization why because he wasn't using the centralized state identifier where he could be looked up in a lookup table and knocked down a pseudonym originates from a different source it originated from his computer or whatever so it wasn't connected to that main graph pseudonymity is actually also a form of decentralization in that sense very important one um and use various other kinds of techniques um but there's another kind of technique for decentralization and that is like open sourcing everything right obviously satoshi did open source it but you know imagine if satoshi had put out the concept of the blockchain and um tried to get lots of folks to build implementations that may or may not have worked right he may have had to do it first party but that's an alternative approach to decentralization right and uh insofar as you know the the network state is sort of like it's a toolbox where uh you don't have to agree with my problem statement or my solution here my problem statement is i think we're vectoring towards what i call american anarchy and chinese control my solution statement is i think that um rather than just centralization versus decentralization i think we are going to need to see recentralization on the other side not in the coercive sense of you know top-down control but consensual re-grouping around hubs just like you know when people exit a burning building when it's on fire what do they do there's an assembly point right they re-centralize and even if the building is being burned down they're going to build something else together again right that is different than scattering to the four winds everybody running through their life and never seeing each other right there was value in having that group together but if that building's on fire you decentralize then you recentralize and so my proposed solution is if these existing central points especially the u.s establishment in china are getting much worse and we have this decentralized technology then we can build new societies and eventually new states now a lot of people will disagree with some part of that problem or solution they might say no look you're so bearish on the u.s oh biology everything is going to get better don't you know like we got through a civil war and a world war ah this is nothing but comparison there's a lot of arguments like that and i acknowledge that i might be wrong in the book i say you know the base raider fallacy fallacy just because something is normal doesn't necessarily always mean it's false though that's nowadays increasing the way to bet um so i acknowledge that might be wrong on aspects of problem and solution nevertheless i do feel that there's parts of this that you can take and you can make your own it's a tool and you don't need my permission or anything as to which pieces of it to to use i'm just trying to put it out there and it's free online by the way um and yeah it's the best seller despite being free online how about that you know anyway let me pause that's fantastic and i think it speaks to um the need for this this tool set and so what you're saying bellagi is even if people you know disagree with the problem statement as you put it american anarchy and chinese control you might have a different problem statement i think a lot of people realize that we're on the wrong vector and that we do have a problem in some shape or form so let's open up the toolbox if we can let's dig into what the network state actually is i'm going to read out the um tweetable definition here sure the one sentence version yes the one sentence version that you have and it says this if we're defining a network state a network state is a highly aligned online community with the capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states the online community capacity for collective action crowdfunding territory gaining diplomatic recognition from pre-existing nation-states let's dig into this a little bit the first question i think on my mind when i see a definition like this there's one thing you missed though highly aligned online community highly aligned online that part is really important actually but let's talk can we talk about the online community piece so sure in its simplest form somebody reads this they might say balaji are you talking about a discord room or a subreddit is going to found a nation state they're going to create their own country is that literally what you're saying here so so what i'm saying is um a message board created their own currency right right so they say satoshi go it went and posted on the crypto hackers message board or whatever i forgot the exact was like uh it was some crypto message board 13 years later it's a sovereign currency of el salvador and of you know central african republic and probably more it has led to every government in the world reacting to it with cbdc's even if they don't like bitcoin they've been shaped by it obviously led to ethereum and um you know our whole community um so yeah like there's there's let me first level set with that right the suspension of disbelief um you know even 10 years earlier the concept of a kid in a you know who from a dorm room could build a three billion person communications network we are in a sense in a time of miracles um that we don't realize that or we or we take it for granted in some ways right that hyper growth that insane growth from something extremely modest at the beginning is as possible and we've actually seen it um you've seen it multiple times and so uh the thing about this is um you know that margaret mead saying like uh never doubt that a small committed group of people can change the world indeed it's the only thing that ever has right all the you know when you actually get into history and you're and you realize all these nations these countries that exist today did have founders you know um they they were founded and in fact the founding fathers you know how old they were i mean many of alexander late 20s early 30s right 21 some of them were 19 yeah some of them were quite young right so in the time and place right when the conditions were propitious when there was a frontier and when you know like the man met the moment it was possible to found new countries right in fact it's done within a human lifetime you know like all when the soviet union fell there's estonia and all these countries that were set up then in fact the founding of estonia ushered in this whole new age of governmental innovation they're the most advanced technology technology advanced state in europe right so so that's kind of just i want to like put that out there for some degree of suspension of disbelief a other human beings have started new countries b we've seen recently people have started new companies and new currencies within our lifetime people we know see what that means then if people argue against it they say there's no path towards a change it will never be changed the current system is eternal and immortal right and this is actually implicitly the east coast slogan right oh this time it's different huh lol right and they'll say that and what that's actually doing by the way it's quoting something out of context this time it's different um it comes from some sort of pitch that didn't hold up but of course the opposite of this time is different means nothing ever changes but something did change for blackberry or blockbuster or barnes and noble something changed for them the market changed and they're no longer right this time was different for them right so this time it can be different change does happen it's not like you know everything is constant for all time so that just gives another approach on the problem right now to the specifics basically let's just start with the the definition the nation state itself do you guys know the difference between the nation and the state actually i haven't yeah i haven't thought about that deeply it's actually really important and i've talked about is the nation more kind of the the cultural human side of things and sort of the state more the protocol like the rules the constitution the law yeah is that sort of very close that's right so i mean really that's that's a good paraphrase the nation it comes from the same root word as natality the common birth common descent like the japanese nation this is kind of a more old-fashioned way of talking about things but you talk about uh you know this this group that has common ancestry culture ethnicity language various characteristics and then the state almost like a tribe it's a tribe exactly that's right that i okay now you can see the overlap right or perhaps like online community yeah exactly that's right so you're you're there all right but the state is the administrative layer that this nation sets up okay now there is a perennial argument that's actually very similar so the argument over currency as you're probably aware is between um the sort of uh for lack of a better term i'm gonna call them the libertarian progressive models okay because it's approximate the libertarian model is that uh people started producing and then uh barter is how money arose and it started with production right that is you know a common model that you'll read in like various you know libertarian texts okay the progressive model like a david graber style model says oh actually no that's a very independent kind of thing actually money began with the state and with debts to each other and that came first and actually everybody's kind of downstream of that right and there is an interplay between these two views okay i lean towards the barter model but i agree that there are aspects of you know for example money only arises when there are two people it's inherently a social phenomenon as opposed to an individual phenomenon despite as as individuals as money uh is it's like it's like language you're right you um you have to communicate with folks so uh the in the in a similar way there's an argument just like there's an argument about how currency arose there's an argument or how the state arose what came first the nation or the state right the people that gave rise to this administrative unit or did the ministry create the people at first it seems totally obvious just like the libertarian model is like well how could you have the state come first you have a people it's a tribe a primitive tribe or something and they start setting up some formal government and some laws or whatever and you know kova hammurabi like you know uh that that's not a totally primitive tribe but like a written set of laws that's like a state you know and a bunch of guys to enforce them okay how could the state come first well when you look at nation formation it's not quite that simple for example uh around the time of the french revolution most of people in what we now think of as france did not actually speak french they spoke various other dialects and languages and it was the initial french-speaking group that invoked the sense of nationalism built this powerful state that went and propagandized all of these people into speaking french and um you know basically imperializing them eric hobb's bomb talks about this um and you know similarly if we the the thing we think of as germany that's a bismarck creation the thing we think of as italy that's a creation of garibaldi right these are giant unifications uh where the state in a sense did create the nation of the people we think of as german or italians or french who think of themselves as german and retaliator french right so there is an interesting feedback loop between the nation and the state even if i would argue the nation comes first i agree that there is a a ladder here right the state can create the nation and vice versa just like i agree that there is an interplay between the libertarian progressive theories of money okay now why do i bring all this up well it's of i think extreme importance to crypto people because um if the question the 2010s was what is a currency i think the question of the 2020s will be what is a nation okay what is a legitimate nation that is both uh deserving of and capable of some degree of self-determination okay and we think of the question of what is a currency now you can rattle off the definition of a currency you can rattle off it's like medium exchange store value unit of account we've all seen that most people could not rattle that off in the late 2000s why have we had to rattle that off because the constant of you know the us dollar as a currency and obviously that's not something you can innovate on became a variable suddenly there's usd and btc and now usdbch blah blah all this long list of things right and when a constant becomes a variable all the certainty is especially something that's a really deep constant when that becomes variable all the certainties go away right there's a huge time of chaos volatility upside and downside blah blah and one constant that's becoming available is the concept that america is a quote nation state it's not it arguably never was but it definitely isn't today it's at a minimum bi-national where there's two groups that literally don't inter-marry anymore democrats only marry democrats right so that's the thing is you know people are it is progress yes in a sense it's progress of course that folks will marry across you know racial boundaries religious boundaries and so on but you know where they don't marry across they don't marry across party boundaries so you know what happens in like one generation ideology becomes biology democrat republicans becomes like sunni shiite right and you just go back to the future it becomes a tribal thing where it's literally biology like you you know this people are they're the bad folks and you don't marry them and like racism returns in a sense right because it becomes like you know it becomes biological it it it takes some time for that to iterate out don't get me wrong okay but you're you're in the process that you're talking like 80 90 of people it's like very strong like you know taboos on this now right so when you have a binational state that's a recipe i mean uh either for a crackdown or for like a yugoslavia bosnia type situation where you have a bunch of different nations that are angling for control of the state that's a recipe for conflict in fact the entire concept of the nation state was the idea that each nation gets its own territory and its own laws so that each guy in a box or whatever right that's initial the ideal abstraction that abstraction is actually not typically reached um japan is the largest probably single nation state out there you know china or india are not really nation states or civilization states because there's many different ethnicities especially within india china is more monoethnic you can argue the han or like 90 something percent right but they also do have lots of different ethnicities in there lots of different regional tensions and stuff but many other countries are really multinational states and you know the opposite of a nation state in a different sense is the concept of the stateless nation okay so can you name a stateless nation you ever heard that term a stateless nation so this would be sort of a group of people um palestinians possibly okay right that's the most famous right and but you could take you know the kurds uh you could take the um the catalonians the you know some of the armenians the basques right mormons these are folks mormons in uh utah uh arguably yeah you could i mean it's you could they they're certainly influential in the utah government but yes you could that would be something you could think of potentially as a stateless nation um and in fact one way of thinking about the world is once you start actually really putting a magnifying glass in that word nation right you see some really interesting things for example the term multinational really should be like multi-state or multi-jurisdictional because it's not like this company is interfacing with um you know all these nations of people it's not like doing a deal with the uh the catalonians and the basques and so on it's doing deal with the spanish government right so it's multi-state multi-jurisdiction rather than multination the reason for this is uh you know you also hear terms like national security or you know it's a national matter uh national has to mean all of us right um when it's really uh you know you might call it federal it's it's a bit of a misnomer right because it's trying to this is the state using language to try to make the nation and the state the same okay which i understand it kind of helps with legitimacy but it's also a stolen base and another version of this which is actually quite important is the term the united nations really we should think of as the selected states because most nations are not in the united nations there might be like 600 legitimate nations in the world this the kazakhstani president recently said if if all the nations of the world were able to get self-termination nation in the sense of the japanese nation the catalonia if all the nations of the world were able to have self-determination we'd have 600 countries in the u.n not 190 something right yeah i think there would be a lot of african tribes that would be unaccounted for in a nation-state model yeah whenever whenever you see lines like straight lines on a map that is that is almost never what uh you know like actually reflects what the ethnic groups and language and history and culture was it's an imposition by the british now as i said the state can create a nation so you know there's this famous graph of like um search queries in the u.s for like uh for baseball teams right um this paper i think it came out yahoo research in like 2005 and like geocenters okay i mean i can bring it up let me see if i can bring this up okay so okay here we go this is an amazing amazing figure that i'm just gonna try to zoom in on okay so this is from like 17 years ago all right and uh so those are queries from um of different sports teams okay right and you can see that like this is a group of people who are brewers fans and this is the group of people that are cubs fans okay so bellagio i'm going to commentate for the listeners out there we are looking at what is almost a map of the united states however there is no actual drawings of the like the sea or ocean there's no drawings of the states there's only dots but you can see the outline of the united states just because it's like a population map right like people sort of outline in a pseudo way the actual state the actual physical landscape of the united states but there's no actually there's only dots and these dots are different colors based off of what team that they are on uh so my team of choice the seattle mariners uh happens to be this white in the upper left corner of the united states uh you have the uh you have the um chicago cubs which is where you'd expect around chicago you've got the houston astros around houston you've got the san diego padres around southern california but you don't actually see the state of california or like the city of san diego or or any of any particular line you just see these masks masses of dots that are around their respective probably sports stadiums these are these are the baseball tribes baseball tribes yes but here's what's interesting you can sort of see some state boundaries there like if you look at the tigers right versus the cubs you can kind of see like the pretty clear line yeah right there's a pretty clear line so this is an example of where like the social construct of these sports teams and these states is in the minds of these people it's installed softening the minds of these people and so the lines on a map have become reflected in the software installed in people's heads so this is one of those cases which comes first the nation of the state and the answer to that question is yes right and yeah it's like i i think the separation is super useful for me and i hadn't thought of it and immediately we're seeing crypto parallels so that you know the nation is the tribe it's the people and the state is the protocol set of rules it's the constitution and so the parallel between online communities which is kind of the root of the definition here is we've had online communities online for since the uh first early versions of the internet through chat rooms and message boards right so we've had the the nation we've had the tribe we haven't yet had the the state part of it the protocols and rules and maybe that's what bitcoin brought you know in uh year zero 2009 here and maybe that's the parallel here but i still have a question about these online communities right so questions my question is this balaji so like why does an online community need a nation need a nation-state type of apparatus to be recognized as a nation-state why not a guild why not a dow like why do we need this state recognition piece of it excellent question i actually talked about that in my chapter on um the one commandment okay and so just to kind of explain this the short version is um not all sharp societies need that right many of them can deliver value as purely digital okay many of them can deliver value as uh having a physical presence without any diplomatic recognition but some kinds of innovations or things you'll want to do require diplomatic recognition right so if you um you know scroll down a little bit here um go a little bit further so right so uh you know you can kind of read my definitions and stuff but um one concept is you start with a startup society that's just like a very early stage thing you know it it's very similar to a startup company where it's small but as aspirations upcoming big then you can set up a network union that is uh you know a online community that is capable of collective action like for example um you know crowdfunding something or upvoting something or helping people promote a product or giving user feedback or something like that right so network union is a digital thing that's capable of collective action online which is actually a very high bar because it's hard to get people to do things that are productive together it's easy to get people to yell or destroy or whatever um you know if you ask 100 people to burn down a building they can do it it's very easy they paralyze that it's embarrassingly parallel if you ask 100 people to build a building that's actually really hard it's like 100 or 1000 x harder right you're not sure those 100 people could even do it or have the skill so a network union just getting to that alone getting a digital community that's capable not of just canceling somebody online and everybody yelling at them in a disorganized way but building something online like a wikipedia or a google docs or a github you know uh repo that's actually something where there's talent there's skill there's organization that's required it's non-trivial to build a good network unit once you've done that the next step if you want to do that and not everything will need that right um some things as i give examples in the book um examples of purely digital network unions that do not need physical territory like the cancel proof community where you have a guild exactly as we were talking about let's say have designers and 99 of the time they're just designers trading back and forth designs giving figma tips they're paying their subscription fees whatever one percent of the time somebody's getting canceled and they come in and they say hey look this is happening and then the you know the leader of the guild looks up the rule book and is like okay um were you getting canceled for something legitimate they actually have some rules process they don't just blindly defend constitution yeah exactly and and they're like if x then y they have a written law so they aren't just reacting to it in the moment they aren't just reacting to it you know based on how much they like this guy they actually have a set of rule of law right and that's like the point like the reason you have like written laws for murderers it's like oh this guy's a good guy will let him off or this guy's you know a bad guy let's really throw the book you know sometimes you have discretion but really the constant rule of law is it's applied uniformly to people as opposed to the mob just deciding randomly that's not justice mob justice is never justice right so this is an example of something where you have a community of a thousand people and maybe you know uh you have to pay some fine um if somebody said a bad word like you know a decade ago and that's it and you're good in the community there's forgiveness there's a forgiveness process do you see what i'm saying it's cancelled proof cultures like restoration culture um that's something you could do digital only now but before we go too far i'd actually like to kind of uh just back up and just like emphasize this one point um before we start talking more concretely about like the future the future tribes of future network sites um that uh the just to really drive the point home as to like if you anyone is skeptical as like oh how is this discord channel or how is my telegram group going to turn into a physical country somewhere uh and there are some parts of the crypto world that we're already seeing accept some of these outcomes or trajectories there's this like meme in the crypto space that you know everything will have a token right is is it a is it a protocol it's gonna have a token is it a protocol it's gonna have a dow um there are some people who are also going as so far to say every single defy app every single d5 protocol will also have its own chain will also have its own like layer 2 or layer 3 or app chain on cosmos and all of a sudden not only do you have your own native currency but you actually have your own uh like economy and that economy if it's its own chain starts to actually collect you know transaction fees like taxes if you will uh and so like first first we have this shared valued shared community that's coalescing around this token because everything's gonna have a token then we can lean into that and be like well everything is actually going to be able to produce its own boundaries on its own like layer three on top of zk sync or app chain on top of cosmos and then create its own literal protocol based off of the community that's around this currency uh and so like these things seem to have like a set of believers who kind of think this outcome is a little bit inevitable for every single community that's out there uh and so like now we're getting into examples of of uh you know the the uncanceled community uncanceled like the the anti-cancer culture community and what you were about to show on the screen is like the sugar-free keto culture community like yes as soon as we figure out how to have tokens for each one of these things it's not that many steps removed from some of the infrastructure that we are already talking about here on the show so yeah so one thing though i do want to stress is i'm very big on this concept of the one commandment in the book which is a non-monetary thing right that's to say i am very much about like look i'm pro-capitalist obviously i'm pro-crypto and pro tokens all that stuff but i'm about them as a tool rather than a goal right and what i mean by that is a lot of discords because they start money first and what happens lots of people are there for the free money when airdrop right like uh you know that is um is is it good that folks you know have some way to live and so sure i'm not against people make money the problem is when that comes first everybody's there they're not really united by anything right um it what you what you want to do is start with the kind of moral foundations first now the moment i start talking about morality people will basically be like oh that's weird or you know where you preacher blah blah let me see if i can motivate that in western society um you have folks who when you say morality they are very reticent they will say who am i to judge i'm a fallible person i can't really tell others how to live et cetera that's one reflex the other reflex is when you get them on politics this is how everybody should live we gotta we ought to pass a law uh at gunpoint if necessary screw them tax them blah blah blah and so they go from zero to infinity like like this like it's totally bipolar right oh i'm so you know i can't judge at all to i judge everything and i will enforce it now right and in between that zero and infinity how about a one right so that's what i call like a one commandment i'm not saying to come up with your own religion and ten commandments and that's actually a really big deal to do it's like a whole software infrastructure in its own way it's a social order but you could come with one commandment okay one way that you feel society is at large failing that you are morally innovating on that you you think you have a better way of life that people should live like this that it's the single biggest problem whether it's you can think of it as obesity or as screen time or it's cancellation or or it's guns or it's alcohol banks bankers banks there you go right okay perfect okay bank less there you go so once you have that one commandment and it really should be reduced to like the smallest number of words and almost in a guttural way i remove is so rather than even saying banks are bad i'd be like banks bad right why why say it like that because you're going to say it a zillion times and it will need to sort of be laced into the community and the the ideal one commandment is one which has a real polarization against default society but that only changes that one thing and then the implications of it so when you say banks bad you're not changing um traffic lights you're not changing uh i don't know like the the laws on how electrical power is wired or something like that you're not trying to change that stuff right you're not trying to change how words are pronounced or change the language to turkish right all those other things are remaining constants you are changing this one dimension bank's bad that's actually a pretty big dimension by the way to change okay and easier you may require legal kinds of things for that and so on and so forth but it's it's totally you know it's it's it's it's in line with what you guys are doing so you've got energy and so on behind it you have a you have a historical critique right and by the way um how much do you guys know about like what happened under like uh sarbanes-oxley and dodd-frank and what have you are you familiar with that yeah i mean it increased the complexity so i want to dig into that but by the way while you were talking i tweeted out from the bankless account banks bad that tweet is doing quite well at this time and is on message are you are you is that bankless hq yeah thankless hq all right i'm gonna already do that so am i people are wondering what we're up to i mean this is the mean layer this is kind of the the moral philosophy of of what we're doing this very much fits the bankless twitter but continue yeah tell us so why is sarbanes-oxley applicable here banking regulation yeah i'm just gonna one commandment all right um i'm just gonna link this uh it's too good to not just link we gotta get 20 already in the first minute yep doing a little social engineering here with belaji this is super meta when people hear the pod i'll be like oh i remember that tweet yep i remember liking that tweet there you go i just i just replied so you can um i could also r q qt it but i thought that was fine all right anyway so um uh the where where are we trying to get back to sarbanes yeah yeah okay so here i wanted to show you this um your critique of everything will be just vastly more sophisticated and great remember i think we were talking about the beginning with like knowing the laws of physics like all of that accumulated thing like summarizing it here like it just makes your argument more powerful you have a stronger base like you do squats you know you go to like you you are you you lift right oh i do do you even lift bro like okay like um all right so lifted lift it at least hip hop point is you need like a strong base like good positioning to like lift a lot of weight right in banks big thing right so i think you get a lot of leverage out of essentially writing the history of banks from a critical perspective right from a cryptocritical perspective let me give you an example take a look at the thing i just pasted in into uh into chat okay the state solution to the financial crisis was to stop issue in 2008 was to stop issuing commercial bank charges for almost a decade it was a coronation disguised as regulation okay so click that first image look at that basically oh you know they said banks bad but how did they deal with it they've rewarded them by essentially eliminating their competition completely so what we are looking at is a graph of the number of new fdic insured commercial bank charters in the united states from 2000 to 2019 and right at 2008 2009 the number of new fdic shared commercial banks now it's like it was 188 in 2000 it was 167 in 2005. it was 175 in 2007 basically drops to zero because like there was like a social dis distaste for banks right but what belongs to the point you're making is that okay we have this distaste for banks therefore we're just eliminating all future banks making all current banks the new winners the new encompasses exactly that's right and then but fortunately we'd had the internet and so we routed around that in two ways so if you look at the next graph fintech was the front end during this period even though you couldn't get a new bank charter with fintech people could build all these very amazing layers on top of this antiquated banking system right that stripe that square that's merc this all these guys you know built you know things over the 2010 stripe and square especially right um and and coinbase and and so on right um but but i'd say stripe and square are like classic you know fintech unicorns right they're working on top of this antiquated you know bank back end and the reason so antiquated imagine if like when you sent an email okay behind the scenes it got printed out and delivered via pony express to the other side of the country and it took two to three days to get there and then it got scanned on the other side and that is a pretty good analogy for fintech on top of the wire transfer system like the legacy wire transfer system it's like this pony express thing under the hood and if you put unusual workloads on top of it like you know robinhood experience with uh you know the um the game stock trading if you put unusual loads on top of it it will not make it right okay so fintech begin the front end and go the next one and blockchain became the back end right so basically there's a they they stopped new bank charges from getting issued but like in a pincer attack fintech built the front end blockchain built the back end and like neo banks are now arising that have the ux of a fintech and the back end of a crypto protocol and that's like totally packet based and outside the system right um so anyway i'm a big fan of this trajectory so far i love this yes so the point is if you go back just two uh that's a history that just goes back 20 years if you write the history of banks i think you will you will find way more interesting nuggets there that deepen your critique of the system and also show why they were set up in that way in the first place such that your proposed reforms that's why you you know to really you really want to go after banks you have to become a counter historian you need to understand why the rules were set up the way they were you need to understand their legitimating history better than the bankers and the regulators do themselves in order to quote it back to them chapter and verse and to point out all the things they missed so that your v3 fixes not just the abuses of the american regulatory state but the abuses they claim to prevent as well and by the way i don't think that's that difficult because i feel like a lot of regulators and bankers have forgotten the first principles of why they were formed in the first place and what we're seeking to protect this is the first commandment right so like for the bankless nation the bankless community it it's not about all of the money you can earn in crypto it's not wealth first it's mission first yeah it's tribe first it's nation first that's what you you see is the one commandment and is essential for the formation of a network state that's exactly right and the thing is that you know you sort of know this as an investor by the way you know that you know you back missionaries over mercenaries right that missionaries who believe in the purpose they don't quit right mercenaries are just there for a paycheck you see that with armies you know like uh nationalism of the french variety was actually you know that was a left-wing ideology for a long time um before it's now associated with the right but nationalism gave essentially everybody like an equity stake in the country um at least mentally and so those nationalist armies felt they were fighting for something that they themselves belong to as a citizen and they often beat you know the hired guns of a monarch right so one has to understand why monarchies were defeated by nationalism missionaries beat mercenaries almost always right like nationalists be usually soldiers of monarchs because they're they're more motivated and so starting with that moral premise and attracting people on the base of that moral premise without any money that's actually kind of what a startup is by the way right a startup is there's a potential there's an equity stake right but fundamentally people are there early on because they believe in the mission you know if you're if you're doing a startup and you're recruiting people on the trying to be on the base of a of a paycheck of a higher paycheck or comparable paycheck to a google or whatever you're just not going to make it ngmi right um and so so it's a mistake to start money first as a motivator money should be removed as a constraint money can be you do have to make the dollars and send that up absolutely but it's a tool to to achieve that purpose so the one thing i would also do is i'd say yeah banks bad is really important but you also need to say x is good i mean ethereum is good i'm sure you'd say that right um then you'd have derivations and things of that like you know once you agree for example that banks are bad you might say self-sovereignty or self-custody is good and you have all these derivations from that and so that set of moral premises the more you can get of those and get those explicit i think it'll make it it'll just make you really strong as a community because you can now start doing tracking polls for example right you know how you have uptime up time graphs you're seeing those right right so you do a tracking poll for your community and you ask are banks bad yes no uh is self-sovereignty self-custody go whatever you ask these questions and you will actually see numerically what percentage of your community agrees with you over on these things over time now why would anybody ever disagree well i mean let's say there's some huge hack or whatever then maybe people's confidence and self-sovereignty declines and then you have to bolster it again or you have to flip on that perhaps but a flip is a really big thing it kind of means that you know your moral fiber is you know eroded you've lost the peg in an important sense right uh you know i'll show a provocative pair of graphs okay um obviously you know you go you know the like the terra usd thing when it lost the peg right yeah um good times good times um the you know i'm not involved in any of this stuff but here let me show you this curve and then i'm going to show something else so just take this image right you see it was flat and it just suddenly falls off a cliff the thing that people relying on a constant became a variable right that happened over a series of hours but there's something that's kind of similar and that is um like the decline of religion in america you know people you used to kind of be able to take for granted that people had this base of believing in christianity or what have you and you look at some of these graphs like church membership among u.s adults now below 50 and um this graph looks like this graph just like the wobble before the complete collapse yes and it's down like it was it was flat at like 77 percent for decades and then you know dropped and then now it's like down to like 47 it's dropped like you know more points in a few years than it had in like decades before then right bellagi america kind of feels like it's been wobbling more and more and more ever since 2008 yeah but it's been accelerating arguably but yes you can argue when no i'm saying i'm saying it's definitely accelerating like the 2008 was the first wobble and then we got we got back to stability for a while but now ever since i don't know 2016 it's been wobbly wobbly wobbly yeah though the the thing is that one thing that's useful is to take the long lens on certain things and some of these trends started probably before you were born like the fled you know the the the fed uh funds rate right i'm not sure if you've seen this so this is like the interest rate right and um the thing about this is uh you see so this is like the 1980s and you see how this has just been declining with spikes back up but decline decline right and then here's like like the zero lower bound interest rate and what is the long-term trend there it is absolutely like a trend towards lower and lower and lower interest rates right they just keep stimulating the economy and they try to let it recover you know and go back to normal but it needs to be stimulated again and stimulated again and like they juiced it to such an extent over here and they had to they hiked rates they're probably going to be forced to print again okay just looking at that long-term trend and they'll print longer and harder than what happened in the 2010s and that may result in like serious inflation the point is these wobbles began even before 2016. there's certain things that are in the system that like have gone back further right um other things like social security and stuff go back even further than that so uh you know i'm not saying all these things are inevitable but i'm saying that some of them you know go back further point is when you have something that was a constant that becomes variable right when it goes from usd you know if terra uh is 1.0 to something much much less of that very fast or it goes even over decades like everybody's a christian or you can basically assume 77 percent america's christians are like less than 50 the entire premise of society now changes you have um like structures that were set up on a certain set of assumptions that you know people just no longer agree a small example in a small an important example abolish the police okay like that's something where you might have had 99 support for that the police should exist or 99.9 whatever in the 90s in the 2000s that was not a political issue suddenly for a time that dropped to like maybe double digits said the police should not exist all right that's a huge shift in society those people can't they have a fundamentally different conception of what society should be you can argue whether that is a good or bad moral innovation i think probably you're going to need some kind of police force of some kind um but it is certainly just like those folks cannot really live in the same jurisdiction they have a different view on what like fundamental premises are so that's why it's actually important to measure these kinds of things in a tracking poll and make sure your community has that strong moral fiber which is the premises for all of your arguments as a content creator right if you enumerate all your moral premises those are like the notes that you're using to generate your songs yeah we uh i just did a tweet reply as you were talking um you know bank banks bad bankless good that is basically that like we bankless means you don't give up custody of your keys you don't need to trust it you are your bank you're going bankless and that is the guttural representation of our mission but like so getting to this idea of the definition of a network state we've got this aligned online community now that has a moral imperative and is creating some some moral innovation that mission piece is absolutely critical can we can we like look at this uh graphic that you put together because i just want to make sure people get out of this podcast what being inside of a network state actually is like day to day am i in a discord room i'm am i on a uh subreddit how am i existing in a network state so so have four tiers right startup society network union network archipelago network state startup society you're just starting okay it's like one person thing network union you have a digital society that's capable of collective action network archipelago that digital society is using a collective action to crowdfund territory and start assembling offline and they're networking those pieces together all around the world that what that is on screen is a vision of a network archipelago where it's got lots of nodes around the world there's little cul-de-sacs and apartments and offices and parks and ranches and whatever all networked together where your nft is your crypto passport gains you entry maybe you have ar glasses and you can see the sigil of that community there and uh it's got lots of pieces all around the world that when you sum them together are potentially of the same square footage as an existing sovereign right because many countries are small countries in population and or real estate and or income so that's never good it's the structure of a network state something like um global campuses or is it supposed to be in one specific region in the long term so the final version is a network state and i define a network state as a network archipelago that attains diplomatic recognition from a sovereign so you wouldn't start a network state you'd end with it same like you don't say i'm starting a public company that's actually something where you sort of need diplomatic recognition from the government to say you're a public company do you see what i'm saying you need like some interface you're getting on the public markets right diplomatic recognition is this incredibly important step between crypto countries and fiat countries it's as important as the interfacing cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies okay and that's actually a really productive analogy you know the the crypto country to fiat country exchange is an important thing crypto passports and fiat passwords will have some interplay i think over time but coming back to this basically the the network cn1 image the important thing about this is what i'm describing there already kind of like rough analogies things that already exist okay google offices around the world all have google's logo and your google key card or whatever opens the door to all of them and it's like a piece of google whether it's in boston or bangalore or budapest right like it's it's this archipelago of territory around the world and the total footprint is probably quite substantial especially if you add up all the data centers and so on but it's only commercial real estate it's only office space and data centers and stuff if you added in residential and um industrial and other kinds of stuff parks whatever you actually start to get something that looks like you know what what a group can afford i mean one way of putting it is the million estonians could afford estonia right what do you mean by that like the territory of estonia is mostly held by estonians okay so a million people is actually a very large number of people if you if they are all putting their morality and money behind something it's just a massive force right even 10 000 people is a lot of money and a lot of energy if they're all committed to something 10 000 people on a straight arrow right like by the way here is one proof of concept okay you know that you actually have a network union when um and this is like this is like the i shouldn't say you know you have it you know you don't have a network union if you have a community that has a thousand people and you can only get like 20 to like a tweet right a network union would get all 1000 of them basically the first order would like that tweet that's that what you're doing is you're the community is becoming like like like almost like a military level organization right it does things together it you think about a union at a company it's not something we're like oh yeah some people can strike and so they enforce basically like discipline in terms of people are there to do something it's you know if you're on a football team you don't like just show up for some games you show up at the games you show up every play and the coach is calling the place right at a company you're not just uh i'm there some of the time whatever like that's a full-time job right so that is actually the level of priority it needs to get to to be like a network union you see that's actually a pretty high bar that's not just a discord there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer 2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across its bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer 2s and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees you can be a part of across the story by joining their discord and using a cross for all of your layer 2 transferring needs so go to across.to to quickly and securely bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrary or boba networks rocketpool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eath in rocket pool and get our heath in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 168 to get started you're getting an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled eid that uses your node to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish e-staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocket pool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there so okay so can we walk this through for like you know again using maybe a bankless example because i'm familiar with that right so so we have this mission this guttural thing banks bad bankless good all right we have that we started like kind of this online community this the social movement where we have a newsletter with 200 000 subscribers we have a podcast you know 2 million 3 million downloads a month we have a discord community with tens of thousands of of individuals all trying to go on the bankless journey bank's bad bankless good okay so we have that so we're at level one of of kind of the the network state model maybe level two but like the nice thing about this is uh there are these i get we don't really have digital campuses right now but um bankless is a global movement there's a bankless brazil that's kind of fractured off and david and i don't even know what it does it has its own podcast has its own community so uh we have kind of i i don't know that we have yet these digital campuses but but let's say this community gets riled up enough about the mission and excited about about the mission that we want to get to that end stage of a network state and our end stage is basically some sort of jurisdiction that is incredibly crypto friendly that has like uh banking laws and property rights laws that mesh very well with what we're the the global digital rights platform that is ethereum and bitcoin kind of what we're building in crypto and we don't have that in our western countries and other societies we have sort of crypto antagonistic legislation at least not crypto friendly legislation so that is the end goal we want to get that jurisdiction we want to get that united nations um representation how do we do that so okay so so one thing i'll say is basically you i think you're starting to see my logic on this there's actually levels up of commitment that you haven't gotten to yet that once you set that as a goal you can start achieving that right um you know you go from think about like people go from just aimlessly surfing online spending lots of time on social networks to putting lots of money into cryptocurrencies to then thinking of these as their primary vehicles for you know community and citizenship right they're becoming their primary identities like the merger of social networks and cryptocurrencies of what we're talking about which which are entities that are very very important and that they have your community and your money and your citizenship and your history and your work history and that can acquire territory so now if they so desire so your specific example um one thing that's good about the one commandment model is that it's kind of like a startup because you you can kind of poke and you can say that's not specific enough right for example i want to improve file sharing online right the current state of file sharing is is not good you have to get like super specific on exactly how you're going to do that right so you can start with a high level the one command of banks bad bankless good and then you just raised a really interesting way to potentially operationalize that which is you have um a crypto bill like a like a set of legal provisions that maybe the community uh crowdfunds or someone who's a volunteer who does the legal work for um what's called model legislation right and it's like this is what the ideal law should look like okay it gives zero privileges to existing legacy banks it allows for new charters it allows for anybody to basically be their own bank at home legally like a you know a first amendment like thing you know right shall not be infringed kind of thing second right and um yeah i'm just i'm just like making this up right now but you know you'll have to think and deliberate on what that model legislation looks like and then you have folks in every different country who are like allocating time for this and they're like i speak portuguese i'm translating it here i'm introducing it in this town in brazil we'll get on base here oh you're in spain okay great let's work you know this is an activist group right it is checking in each day you're giving out nfts and stuff if you want for like checkpoints like job well done you're holding meetups and stuff but now you're not just um you know right now if i'm not mistaken you have folks who you know like your podcast they're there to be informed and so and so forth but after information comes alignment after alignment comes activism right and not every single thing it needs to be paid you know look i love tokens i love other kinds of things people are there because they believe in something bigger than themselves you know and look obviously you need to make the dollars and cents work but you're actually you have a concept of the collective good now it may turn out by the way and you have to think about this is bankless the right uh it could be a stream into this but not it itself right you might you want to put some thought into that one command you're right that you have something that's like that but it may not be super specific enough in the same way that for example vitalik wrote for bitcoin magazine and those people were aligned with his vision of ethereum but he had to actually go and do ethereum and have i don't know the 30 or 40 of bitcoin people crowdfunded ethereum with bitcoin if you remember that right and then like if you're almost like forked off from bitcoin this is where like a model for bank list is you stop at the the online community you stop at the dow or you stop at some yeah you go for a full network state yes and even actually there's a level in between which is a network archipelago you might find it cool to have bankless embassies around the world right or even something in between which are like bankless meetups you probably already have those right those are like temporary pieces of a network art palette the cloud is like materializing on the land temporarily and then dissipating back into the cloud right that's a great visual right yeah it's this is really cool so okay so what is the incentive though so i mean we talked about the collective good that's clearly an incentive but is there sort of a founder incentive as well or for like those who govern and work inside of the the network state um is there upside here or are are you like prioritizing the um so economic upside well so so i i think it's kind of like uh you know the left and right engines on a plane right you have to kind of balance you know if you're over money you probably need to increase morality and if you're over morality then people need to eat right and so they're kind of like control sticks where you you kind of need both right and i talk about this in the book like that's very roughly like left and right you know and it's like cause and community and you know like do it for this and then okay like you know let's be pragmatic and and whatnot but then you can get too self-interested over here and then this is the group again you know so you kind of need both of those control sticks it's like you imagine a car that you could only steer right or you could only steer left you the the the goal is the destination not the direction actually you know i talk about this do you hear my concept of the westest no no tell us about that oh so imagine that somebody who they they call themselves westists because that they like that they like the idea of going west to california i mean okay we're we're about these words what's that this is a big theme that we use on bankless is going west we're going into the frontier we're exploring the unknown um there it's dangerous but we're also like looking for upside yes and uh to be clear what i'm about to say is not a critique of that all i believe in that also you know going to the frontier and so on but in my hypothetical example of wesus which is not where you guys are but in the hypothetical example um a westest would define themselves by okay we're going west right and then they end up in california and then what happens is there's a schism in the movement why because some group subgroup says what are you guys wimps are you are you eastest cucks we need to keep going west right we got to go into the pacific that's west what you're in eastest now right and uh so they just go into the pacific ocean and that is when like ideology and direction uh is uh taken as being prime over destination right and you know that seems like a caricatured example but you can see how that applies to so many ideological i mean we definitely have that in bank list right you're not bankless enough do you still have a bank account david and ryan right or like i thought you were bankrupt yeah decentralized and i'm like i gotta pay bills i i want to yeah i have a family i have more like there's things in the real world i still have to do i want to be more bagless and like you know some would also say this in crypto more broadly about decentralization making that the end goal rather than a means to some other end well i think this is the critique of maximalism right like if you become too maximalist about one thing you end up uh as a snake biting its tail as in you become a maximalist for maximalist sake and then all of a sudden like are like oh you're more maxless than me no i'm more maximalist than you yeah yeah it creates this like extremist culture of just like who who's the most maxie of them all that's right and this happens basically this is really just fundamentalist movements in general right right maximalism is you know one thing i actually i've got a new chapter coming out on um did you read the bit on god's state and network uh okay so the concept is like you know uh there's this uh uh this is kind of a leviathan from hobbes okay as the most powerful force this is a big bank system and yeah yeah and so it it it generalizes the idea of god right so god for some people god is the most powerful force you know the prime mover and so on for some people it's not god it's the state it's the u.s military it is the police they don't believe in god they believe in the state okay the state exists the police can throw okay and then for yet another group of people that most powerful force is the network they believe in encryption and uh they believe in you know maybe the social network over the state or god right and so god state network are three contenders for the leviathan right that power that hovers over fallible men and makes them behave in pro-social ways that that aligns yeah exactly the leviathan that's right this is the actual image and i think it depicts those three that you were talking about well it's funny it's uh you know uh that's a really old image so it probably wouldn't have um you could argue that the network is those people there but he is um you know leviathan also comes originally from the bible and then hobbes you know you know turned it into something that was like the the figure that represents the state but the thing is one of my concepts in the book is the network is the next leviathan it is contending with the state and you can do some really fun stuff with this where you say god stated network are not just pure forms you can do mixes so for example god plus the state that is uh like the the 1950s u.s where people fought what forgotten country right that was like the marine corps forgotten country right so the god plus the state or you have uh like god plus the network that's like the jewish diaspora before israel or god plus steeples network that's the jewish aspect after israel where they have a religious state you know okay and um then we also have the networks that's also a hybrid so it's a different way of understanding the constant network state i get there in several it's like it's a really i think it's a very fun term because you can define it in several different ways as the fusion of these two leviathans right the network and the state are colliding with each other you know bitcoin versus the government trying to seize it and so building a state which leans into the network is that concert like recentralization rather than just decentralization the network and the centralization state the network states the recentralization go ahead bellagi i'm a little uh rusty on my hobs but it's like also baked into the leviathan concept is this uh concept that has been i guess core to the nation-state principle uh of a monopoly on violence and this is why the leviathan is holding a source this is why the leviathan and the picture was was holding his sword and of course you know crypto is very much a non-violent uh movement but there are these world coordination problems right you know like we can't have uh slaughter bots going out in the wild or like sure bio weapons right some network state comes up with this incredible bio weapon and it just doesn't just affect the network state it affects the entire world and so how do we bring that in ultimately the sword the monopoly on violence what is the role for violence in the network great question as a settlement layer if you will extremely good question and the thing about this is just to preface it like um i wanted to identify a certain catch 22. if you don't discuss violence and war and so on in in this then people will say oh you're hopelessly naive you know pie in the sky et cetera if you do discuss it in exact in detail they're like this guy's like a tech warlord oh my god right yeah you know he wants a drone yeah right so so so there's a bit of a catch screen too there so i just want to first identify that right and then propose a kind of somewhat different framing on the on the thing which is um the the way we think about the military and force and so on um it just come changes completely online okay it's as different as imagine firing a gun under water it just doesn't work right and like all the tanks and the planes and the nukes and stuff they don't work in the cloud in the same way they don't work on the internet right you cannot just hit a button and bomb bitcoin or ethereum um it's it just you know you you'd have to bomb if you go back to the network state image so think about something like this one of the things that i took from bitcoin and ethereum was the concept of physical decentralization as a core part because the internet makes it possible to network enclaves little pieces of territory before the internet that were all spread out around the world were not that valuable like if you had a little drip here and a little drip here but now they are valuable because you can network them together and it's almost like you know just somebody who's in hawaii thinking themselves as part of the us someone who's a town over here thinks this is part of the same you know network over here right okay so when you've got something like this that's physically decentralized think about just logistically what it would mean to bomb something like that first you'd have to find all the notes that itself is non-trivial because a network state or network archipelago or network you know society it doesn't need to make all of them public it doesn't in fact need to make any of them public it can still prove its population and annual income in square meters why through some combination of zero knowledge proofs and crypto oracles right so it can prove how big it is while proving only that you know and you can put that proof you'll stop to trust the crypto oracles or you'll have some more generally some trust model for the crypto oracles meaning you have some probability that this particular crypto oracle is misreporting and you've got some independent check they report is a thousand square meters we've resampled you know 50 of their properties they're 950 square meters most of the time they're somewhat overestimating but not by a huge amount right you have some model for the cryptoricals reliability you can frame it as an estimation problem of how reliable they are the point being that this society does not need to give away its entire position okay it can be something that is new a secret state an encrypted state because the network that underpins the state that that overpins the state is itself secret is that cool this is so cool i mean i get i guess it it um lends a hand to the incredible prospect that that maybe we can uh create the state in a way that doesn't require violence and i'm not aware in the trajectory of of humanity the time we've actually been able to do that we've always there's a couple maybe we arguably i'd like to hear that but like we've generally we've used violence as kind of the the settlement layer yeah and what's interesting about crypto is we have created this property rights system in bitcoin ethereum and others that can settle disputes can settle one asset goes to to the you know another place can enforce property rights without violence and so while it does seem a little pie in the sky and i'm skeptical that the network state will lead to less violence in the world at the same time we see the examples of of ethereum and bitcoin which are a property rights system that is enforced in non-violent ways and maybe that is is a hopeful prospect that we can actually achieve this but yeah well yeah just as we were talking about uh the banking layer having needing a foundation to stand on uh if we want to make network states that are non-violent at their core they need to have this non-violent uh foundation to stand on and bitcoin and ethereum they have their own armies if you will it's the proof of work miners for bitcoin and in the future very soon the stakers for ethereum offering and ryan if you want to share the uh the leviathan leviathan picture that i sent you this is an art and blog this is why like you and i have thought about a lot about this uh this is a leviathan picture that i put together forever ago to illustrate the bankless dow and i've edited it out i photoshopped out the sword and i've replaced it with the bank token as in the it's an incentive only structure as in there is no like physical enforcement by the dao there is only an incentive structure now this might change when we actually put instantiate the bankless dow somewhere physically in the world but when we have our are born on top of these like networks like bitcoin ethereum that are inherently don't have any armies or any physical capacities and then we also form dals which same same don't have any armies or physical capacities but they are still organizing people under a code of values of morals uh in like the same shared space and as you said like these uh meetups that are birthed in physical space and then they dissipate back into the cloud for a long time these things will be only be able to have incentive only carrot-only incentive structures as opposed to uh you know incentive structures with the stick uh which is what the why the leviathan has a sword it's meant to represent a punishment-only incentive structure is that are we tracking here yes yep and i think like the transition obviously from that guy has a fish let me bash his head and take that fish too that guy has a fish let me trade him for something was violence reducing right like you know trade is a very important technology animals don't have it right like animals if someone is eating something they just go and kill that thing to to eat the thing instead right it's very zero sum so uh gains from traits very look insanely abstract so that shows there's some proof of principle also the fact that ethereum and bitcoin have for the most part got into whatever hundreds of billions basically without much violence at all at least within the protocol you know obviously there's people folks have been mugged or whatever for it offline but relative to what they are give a proof point coming back to this thing um have you guys know why the internet was originally developed it's uh the darpa stuff sort of yeah why uh something to do with the military bellagi i can't yeah to to retain communications in the event of a nuclear strike that's right this is right yes right now unfortunately and i don't want to sound flip about this what's all may become new again right because like there's more probability i think of a nuclear exchange than i mean we're flirting with that right when when you're talking about like russia and china and hot wars and crazy things happening you know you just you're just rolling the dice on something that you don't want to roll the dice on and the people who set up this whole system of deterrence and whatnot are now long since gone and a lot of people have inherited and have fingers on a button that they could never have built in the first place right so um the thing is that if you look at that map you know can you nuke a network state or a network archipelago or a startup society it's actually pretty hard to do you'd cause you see that's the thing is imagine a gun that didn't have targeting right if you you know pulled it might shoot you know you're the guy next to you rather than the guy in front of you that's not a good weapon right it's not something where the use of force is targeted and proportionate and controllable and so on and so forth people don't usually think of it this way but like more is not always better for example the soviets had something called the tsar obama there's this gigantic nuclear weapon it could have like blown up all of you know western europe or something like that but it wasn't useful as a political tool because their goal was you know basically to convert people to communism not genocide them maybe after they convert them to communism then they genocide them okay they weren't but they weren't admitting it like that they thought they were going and doing a good thing comrade right and moreover on the other side if you if you just nuke something it's all glass then you know what's like there's nothing um there's nothing there to conquer uh you know you basically want to use the minimum amount of force to capture that territory and stop them from fighting you back and then return to trade in peace and so the concept that like guns and bombs and stuff are political weapons where you basically punch somebody and you're like yield and they don't yield punch punch yield right like you're hitting them to get them to get the fight to stop basically right unconditional surrender or conditional surrender or whatever it is you have conditions and punch punch punch negotiate punch punch negotiate right that's basically what conflict is that's why people say war is politics by other means punch punch okay the leverage has shifted and you know now you get punched back okay the leverage is shifted back the other way okay so all of those tools that people think of as tools for coercing the other side offline basically they all have to be completely reinvented online it's like firing a gun under water right this stuff just doesn't work online like you can't nuke online you can't send apache helicopters online you know if concrete example if you're um if your wallet is stolen physical wall in front of a police station a police person can in theory run after them grab them bring them back if your cryptocurrency is stolen that police person has zero kip where they're gonna do like launch some interpol thing to track down some person in turkey or you know like moldova or the uk that stole the money right the physical force doesn't work in the same way it does it it strikes me that the physical force doesn't work there could still be wars and conflicts but it also it's also striking that these might be digital these might be black cats and hackers and you know coercion to uh have a core dev flip and inject some malicious code into a major patch or something like this that's right so it looks actually like what we have now which is social war and financial war with it you know this is all happening in the cloud and occasionally gets printed out into the physical world with assassinations and drone strikes and riots and bombings and so-and-so i'm not saying that like large-scale wars like russia ukraine like never happen not at all in fact i actually think we haven't talked about china that much but one of my projections for the future is um a centralized east and a decentralized west china and india are at different stages in their civilizational life cycle uh this is something the sovereign individual i think is not like i think sovereignty is a good book but it's not a global book the counter decentralization i think is going to triumph in china probably at least over the medium term and the country's eastern studies isn't like the just like the reformation the counter reformation like protestants and then catholics didn't just accept that protestantism was going to sweep they had a counter-reformation against it similarly we have the decentralization and the counter decentralization and the counter decentralization i think wins in china but it loses in the us and you that's how you get chinese control american anarchy but the thing is that that means that like the large army is probably it's possible that for some period of time the largest army in the world is china's drone armada which you just don't want to see that black cloud crossing the horizon wow okay that like you know i don't know if you've seen their factories and stuff like cranking out this you know i followed this unfortunately unfortunately is the key word there it's i it's um it's terrifying yeah well the thing is also that stuff goes down it doesn't scale up it scales down it scales down into like assassination robots and other types of stuff right and so you know very few you know when you start thinking about that stuff then you're like okay digital defense the security starts in part with obscurity it's not all of it but stealth is important in war that's why you have a b2 stealth bomber and so on that's why don't disclose location that's why i use pseudonyms online that's why i have a secret state an encrypted state a distributed state that's why you know actually masks in public it's actually good that they exist right basically you know that's saying like the uh the internet is an untrusted environment yeah we heard that before the untrusted network so you know it's it's complicated but basically treating your startup society as the high trust zone and then zones outside that as potentially badlands i think will be common in some regions of the world it already is okay but um i think more common in some regions and in other regions there'll be surveillance and we want to build kind of that third region which is the sort of liberal free society you have today where people can walk around without a mask and without like their shotgun and whatever but also without the surveillance drone of hovering overhead so rather than american anarchy or chinese control can we preserve this sort of you know pretty decent life that we have now i think or not just preserve it but but build about that that is the hope and that's certainly the the hope of crypto i i want to get to one other criticism that's maybe of this idea that's maybe more on your term and that is the idea of like blogging but what about everyone who is not wealthy okay in the short run what you're talking what you're talking about maybe to someone's ears comes off as like oh cool the crypto bros they want to go create another you know nation state and it's going to be like another board ape yacht and only the cool kids can come and you know it's just for the wealthy sort of tech elites of the world it's not going to help the average individual citizen in an emerging country what do you say so so i reject this one completely and let me kind of go rude and branch on that right so the first observation is um america isn't just a nation of immigrants it's a nation of immigrants right meaning something like 90 or so of the us left they left poland they left india they left vietnam they left mexico they left wherever to come to the us and in their leaving they weren't necessarily rich in fact many of them were not rich right they were actually folks who were locked out of their existing political system and that's why they left in fact the whole concept of quote the rich and the poor is actually too simple because a good way of thinking about it peter churchill talks about this is there is you know there's the masses there's the elite and then there's a counter elite and the counter elite for example of san francisco the tech folks lost because they lost to the political elite they had to leave that is a very and the political lead are pretty darn rich if you go and look the political lead of san francisco they're quite wealthy but they're not just wealthy they're powerful they're politically powerful so the folks who are leaving are not the rich they're the politically poor okay they're the politically powerless because if they had political power why would they leave they would just transform the society as they saw fit right so once you add that other access where there's a significant power deficit and one way i kind of to take this to like extremist was stalin rich it kind of breaks the scale right stalin was powerful was he a bill i mean he could command anything in in the ussr he could he could basically like hit a button and get root on any tank or whatever that he wanted you know people waited on him hand and foot but he didn't carry cash to pay for things he just seized things he had power but not money that's the extremist example of showing that political power is not the same as money and in fact if you were some poor wealthy guy in the soviet union stalin would like he was definitely more powerful than you you'd leave you'd be a kulak you know you'd be denounced as wealthy and so the whole thing about all the wealthy blah blah is meant to i think usually obfuscate who has political power and the political elite versus the tech elite or mercantelli that is this eternal sort of dance right and that's the dance and i think that's coming up but it's already ongoing between the cloud and the land right so that's kind of one or a couple of major reframes the first is that if the us is a nation of immigrants it's also a nation of immigrants and that means the most american thing in the world is to leave your home and search for a better life so probably that person who's saying this you ask them whether they would denounce their ancestors and were they betrayed they were super rich to leave poland or germany or vietnam or south america or mexico or india were they super rich no they were not right they left because they lacked political power in some key way sometimes that was you know literally fleeing like genocide or war or revolution sometimes it was just searching for economic opportunity but they didn't have the political power to drive that at home okay so that's one number two is even if it's only a small group of people that leaves the frontier shows reform for everybody else only a small percentage came to the united states and that like had so many reforms so many new things that the world benefited from right only a small percentage of people left to go and join google that created all this good stuff for a time for the whole world even if it's become evil now um and so the percentages don't necessarily matter so much as the example to show on a new you know bit of terrain that you can do better than the old society if keto kosher worked if there were that is that example that one commandment if that society worked if you had before and after photos with all these people who are you know going from fat to fit or at least you know dropping weight that would be copied right you're actually doing something for the common good by shouldering the risk as the startup society figuring out all the bugs and setting an example for the rest of the world in a consensual way 100 consensual it's 100 democracy not 51 51 democracy is 49 dictatorship the 51 percent is basically dictating to the 49 percent whereas in a society everybody's chosen to be there everybody builds that example and then anybody else can adopt that example should they see fit that this example point is uh is really interesting because i was going to add another critique to the pile here of like you're talking about basically i i'm envisioning this kind of castle of you know classical liberalism you know freedom and and property rights and these sort of things for the individual and we're in a castle wall what's coming is kind of this this uh this army again against that idea of authoritarianism right and what you what you're also inviting in the network state idea is that people abandon the castle wall essentially opt out stop defending it and like the question here is or the criticism here is blaji we can't if all of the good people leave all the people with strong convictions strong values about these western ideas of democratic representation if they leave for the network state then the existing democratic nation state the west as it were will erode even faster and what is the argument there's a slate of hand there right the most important word there in that thing was all all you know hard it is to get people to move it's not even going to be close to all it's like a tiny tiny tiny fraction of people that will do this i would be extremely i think it'd be think about it'd be incredibly impressive to have a million person network state which is not even close to all that's like less than one one thousandth of the world population by like 20 30. that'd be insanely impressive right so the concept of biology your concept is so ridiculously persuasive that everybody is going to drop everything and do it right it's not just it's not going to happen right it's going to it's going to be something that i think i think there are some good concepts there but um we will see you know like gradual exit now with that said let me entertain let me after critiquing all let me try to get steel man it and give you know a different thing which is they're like well if everybody leaves who is there to maintain well who's there to maintain blackberry who's there to maintain barnes and noble who's there to maintain blockbuster some old institutions should pass such that others can be born right and you know who's there to maintain you know i don't know the place the the town where the you know puritans left in england right ain't there right just you know basically but the thing is and this is crucial what i'm trying to set up in the book is something where the new societies are better than the ones that were left they are attracting people because they are better everybody there's a there's a continuous vote of confidence in these societies because people are staying there and not leaving right it is a continuous plebiscite and it's not just on a two or four year election cycle it's not with politicians who have non-binding campaign promises this is the most binding campaign promise of all you know why when that president of a strap society advertises their society as what it is and you come there and if it doesn't match you leave right by contrast you have no recourse when a politician scams you out of a vote and we we are so used to them doing that where you vote on the base of i think they will do x y and z and they do a b and c or they don't do anything at all and then they can always say oh i was blocked by these other people point is if you invest in a ceo or you buy a product and they they give blah blah excuse that they that's why you know you ordered orange juice they gave you milk that's just breach of contract right you're just going to go and find a different ceo right and different product and so all that concept of recourse of optionality all these things that we know are just so crucial to making markets function to making lots of aspect society function um people are actually over morality when it comes to the existing system and the reason they are by the way and i argue the reason they are is because they see no alternative right once they see an alternative i mean you notice how actually in some ways uh the commentary on the fed was much more passionate in the early 2010s than it is now right i'm saying it won't wrap up again but over the 2010s everybody who just really disliked the fed and you know thought it was unjust just exited for crypto and built a better system and now that is there as a life raft to take over when the previous system collapses because it is not always true that just more effort will prop up that existing system sometimes it's the titanic and that's just throwing good money after bad good talent after bed having people being able to build that life raft and realizing that this person's estimation of their abilities as a reformer they may be wrong you know you sometimes you just cannot you know go clear and bring them back to life right it's very important that there's diversity of opinion that somebody can go and have have this minority report and start something new because you might rely on that look at like you know what happened with kovid when all the delivery apps and all the things that all these journals had made fun of they relied on them they needed them you know like to to do things and they were so you know there was a time there's a period where they showed some gratitude for the first time in their life but um it was something where they're like oh i'm so glad that these you know apps and so on exist that it's a lifeline now it turned out you know with lockdown and so on and so forth you can critique many aspects of uh of that and whether um any non-pharmaceutical intervention even work point being though that all these things that people thought of as toys are not a big deal became absolutely essential right right bellagio a lot of i i think there's a lot of listeners who are listening to this and you are articulating what was previously a vibe into an actual actionable path forward um i i would actually like to get into the actionable side of things so like say we actually get into this future network state i don't know what your trajectory is for this on the timeline 5 10 50 30 years but the idea is that we're talking about it now to manifest it into the reality in the future but like what is the short term path for this like what are we doing in the next six six 12 18 months to like manifest this vision okay so the first thing is um you know dm me if you're building a startup society okay and if you're starting a star society if you're doing something with aspirations of becoming a network state and you know the reason i don't say starting a network state is as i mentioned i try to reserve that for the thing that has diplomatic recognition right but if you're founding a startup society message me i may invest that's number one number two is we have a new dashboard at thenetworkstate.com dashboard which is tracking 23 startup societies number three is i'm going to be like shipping hopefully a bunch of things that serve as catalysts for the space right like this dashboard kind of shows that this thing is real it's essentially something where first of all just showing this people are like whoa i didn't realize there were that many of them right and pulling them together we just did like a twitter spaces the other day you can listen to that and they were all like oh cool my one commandment is this and my one commandment is that right and we're starting to bring some degree of organization legibility you know like it's like early crypto in my view except and this is important this is not a remember my god state network framework right this is not a list of networks it's a list of societies and potentially eventually future states okay but go ahead no i'm just commenting i i didn't even know this existed this is very cool isn't this cool right so click all of these take a look at them um they're early but they're not incredibly early the collectively raised like a few hundred million adventure so it's like this thing is happening right and so one way of thinking about my goal over the next five ten years is to turn 20 startup societies into a thousand why if you can do that it's way harder by the way to go from zero to 20 than from 20 to a thousand in a certain sense right if these business models work if some of these business models work and there's a variety of different things and these these societies scale and um you know we we are seeing a lot of different experiments in living then you have lots of different options for people suddenly you have you you're giving back agency to people they no longer feel like they're just on this titanic that's falling and they vote for people and nothing happens they can find people of like mind and move in with them right now if they'll be accepted right that's so important to kind of return agency to people that's actually really the essence of quote democracy is you know the consent of the government right like the choice that the citizen has a real choice it's not just you know um checking a a thing on on a form that's like a pro form a kind of vote for somebody they're not voting against something for the they're voting for something they're voting with their feet they're voting with their wallet and then they'll be voting as they join this new community just as their ancestors probably immigrated before them okay um so this is basically the concept is concretely there's a book i need to do the v2 of the book like the hardcover and the audible people here should
