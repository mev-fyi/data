if you write code once but it works seamlessly on a thousand compatible chains then the value of what you have just produced is far greater evm equivalence takes the evm network effects to a whole new level bankless nation today on the newsletter and now also on the youtube and podcast we are going to explore the concept of evm equivalence and in my opinion the paradigm of evm equivalence will unlock the next phase of ethereum's growth defy summer 2020 hit ethereum's limits to scale since then the network effects of the evm has fractured into different directions new layer ones and even many layer twos have broken from the evm standard in order to produce scale but the era of evm equivalence is upon us and it will allow ethereum to pick up where defy summer left off a new cambrian explosion of innovation is on the horizon we just need evm equivalents to unlock it this is an article that i wrote on the bankless newsletter and i'm reading it aloud for those that prefer audio or video content a big shout out to ben jones from the optimism team and also david mihal for their invaluable help in helping me go through this very challenging topic this concept of understanding evm equivalence and the network effects around the evm has been extremely challenging i'm not technical and so this is a very technical concept that i've worked really hard to get into what bank list is really good at which is abstraction and metaphor and meaning and significance without having to go in the nitty-gritty details so thank you to those guys for helping me get through this uh i hope that this is an extremely digestible albeit a little bit long piece that teaches us a very critical lesson about how this industry works all right let's go ahead and get right into it first i'm going to read out the table of contents but it's also a tldr so this should actually help map out the future the future of this article uh so inject a little bit into your brain now and then unpack the whole thing later part one is going to be understanding evm equivalence there is a difference between scaling on ethereum and scaling ethereum itself the evm is this emergent structure produced from thousands and thousands of developer contributions forking the evm limits the ability to access these contributions if you change the evm the developers that keep on contributing to it you aren't getting all of those contributions because you've changed the standard there's this line if you want to go fast to go alone but if you want to go far stay together uh and so i'll rephrase that and saying if you want to go fast fork the evm into something else but if you want to go far stay evm equivalent replication and emergence are necessary properties for a self-propagating system that blankets the globe evm equivalence allows us for replication at two the two layers of ethereum the app layer and the protocol layer evm equivalence with layer twos allows for the copying and pasting of d5 code across all evm equivalent rollups anything new of value discovered on one optimistic rollup that's evm equivalent is immediately reproducible on other rollups it also allows for individual roll-ups to implement an eip upgrade before the main ethereum layer 1 which allows for a live production testbed for ethereum improvement protocols before they are safely and securely implemented on the layer 1. next there's this term called horror vacuoid back that guy vacui basically means nature abhors a vacuum nature hates a vacuum it fills all voids nature if there's a void nature fills it if there's some dirt there a plant is going to figure out how to grow there and crypto is like nature it slowly comes to fill every void that it discovers there's also something called the last mild distribution problem and how evm equivalents can solve this under an evm equivalent paradigm eips turn into genes evm equivalent enables layer twos to merge eips asynchronously and independently from the choices of other layer twos and it allows each layer two to adopt the eip that its community desires the most this produces an ethereum that can adapt to the signals and desires of its layer 2 users each layer 2 represents an antenna for data for user preferences all layer 2 is adopting a single eip a shared eip signals to the ethereum main chain that is desired by the community and it's safe to adopt and lastly scaling public goods optimism's retroactive public goods funding is this novel incentive mechanism to inject silicon valley type financial incentives into projects that build public goods for the layer two layer two publications are funded by collecting block space fees collecting the economic energy of the layer twos and directing them into public goods public goods research and development which is what uh optimism is pioneering pioneering with retroactive public goods i was allowed to replicate and propagate throughout the evm throughout the ecosystem due to evm equivalents and so all of these all these pieces cheap fees on the layer 2 evm equivalents and retroactive public good funding are the ingredients to produce a network that has motivated outward growth into the frontier of of what cryptoeconomic networks can do all right that was the table of contents tldr but it's a it's a robust table of contents the rest of this is going to take about uh maybe 15 to 20 minutes to read but first before we get there actually helps in these fantastic sponsors future of this article the era of proof of stake is upon us and lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone lido is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using lido's distributed network of nodes don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in defy with lido you can have both using lido you can stick any amount of your eth to the lido validating network and receive st eth in return ses can be traded used as collateral for lending and borrowing or leverage on your favorite d5 protocols all this without giving up your eats to centralized staking services or exchanges lido now supports terra solana kusama and polygon staking whatever your preferred proof of steak asset is lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake if you want to stake your east terra soul or matic and get liquidity on your steak go to lido.fi to get started that's l-i-d-o-f-i to get started the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge with across you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution you can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of the cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitrum or boba networks if you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the next

understanding evm equivalents defined evm equivalence means complete alignment with the ethereum virtual machine specification the evm equivalent's design philosophy is to produce an optimistic roll-up with minimal diff that's minimal differentiation to ethereum evm equivalence extends the properties of ethereum into the layer twos it blurs the lines between when the ethereum layer one stops and when the layer two roll-up begins this is the difference between scaling on ethereum and scaling ethereum itself optimistic rollups that are perfect clones of the ethereum evm don't just share in ethereum security they share every aspect of its network effects other layer two design constructions do not have the same privilege of accessing all of ethereum's network effects and will always be more specialized than their evm equivalent counterparts so there's a barbell here to to think about where on one side of the of the spectrum you have evm equivalent uh optimistic roll-ups or evm equivalent roll-ups where it's a perfect one-to-one clone of the evm standard and then something completely different like a completely rebuilt the evm is baggage honestly if we rebuilt the evm from scratch today we'd do it totally differently but we can't because there's already network effects but anyways the other alternative to evm equivalents is just completely completely redo the whole thing just a very specialized execution environment that's built for your specific rollup that's optimized for you you don't get the network effects of the evm but you can recreate something that's just perfect for what you need to get done but it's not evm equivalent it's something completely special okay my claim is that evm compatibility is dead evm compatibility is the middle of those two things like you still have the baggage of the evm but you has also recreated a bunch of new things but you really get the whatever is the opposite of the best of both worlds either optimize for generalizability by adhering to the evm standard and therefore picking the same standard as everyone else or build something completely different that's highly optimized for your use case in order to fully extend the full might to the of ethereum to the layer twos we're going to need more than just mirror evm compatibility we need evm equivalents next section compatibility versus equivalence when the optimism team introduced evm equivalents last year they uncovered the technical difficult difficulties between equivalence and compatibility roll-ups were hailed as our scaling savior finally a layer two which we can run unit swap in the earliest rollups accomplish this by completely recreating uniswap with with custom code on top of a custom built optimistic rollup and that just wasn't enough the network effects of the evm extend far further than just solidity a massive supporting cast of tools give ethereum devs their superpowers because these tools are meant to run on the evm standard they broke for custom-built roll-ups not to mention the massive effort required by protocol devs to create something solidity compatible with evm equivalence the evm itself is copied and pasted into the layer 2. everything under the hood is the same the evm is a city david mihal who helped me understand all this gave me this metaphor open source code is like a city it's emergently created bottom up from the contributions of many developers who see problems and build solutions over time the city becomes optimized robust and efficient evm chains are evm ish chains are that like the vegas version of paris they're trying to artificially replicate something that came organically open source software is a public good maintained and upgraded by its respective communities developers that use open source software run into all sorts of problems while using it some trivial some critical and everything in between some developers spend time fixing these problems and then lobby the community to accept their inputs if the community sees value then the contribution is merged a new standard is created and the piece of software grows in utility and robustness like an emergent city builders come and produce things that the surrounding community needs and values shared resources and utilities are produced and since its code it never decays it's a one-way street of increasing value so long as everyone is working on the same foundation each developer builds in their own direction and discovers their specific contributions to add to the collective over time a highly robust public good is produced by the shared contributions of thousands of developers this is the story of geth or go ethereum death has slowly absorbed the meaningful contributions of eth devs over the years and produce a piece of software that has some of the strongest network effects both inside ethereum and beyond for the listeners out there there is a picture of kirby wearing the geth helmet absorbing eip1559 eip4488 eip2718 eip4844 and the other bajillion eips that have all slowly got integrated into geth by the community over time this is why geth has become a reference point for the foundation for such a large part of this industry change that have forked to get and produce a non-ethereum blockchain are still contributing to the foundation that ethereum stands on death forks that deviate from the reference version are deviating from the largest network effects in web3 the further that one-off copies move in a different direction the more labor and resources are required to keep up and progress and keep up and progress with the core network the evian peloton a peloton is a group of group or pack of road bicyclists riding in a group saves energy by drafting behind other riders the reduction in drag is dramatic riding in the middle of a well-developed peloton drag can be reduced to as little as five to ten percent of the total drag that otherwise would have been experienced by the rider the exploitation of this potential energy savings leads to very complex cooperative and competitive interactions between riders and teams in race tactics that last line hits real different when you think about the alt layer one wars and even the layer two wars for that matter if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together the peloton grows in efficiency and speed the larger it gets air resistance is distributed across a wider group of people and as the group scales the efficiency of the group increases being in the middle of the peloton is basically effortless because you're able to draft in the wake of the entire group the leaders of the peloton frequently cycle out as the leader takes the full force of the headwind resistance and must expend extra energy to set the pace of the peloton but when the leader is tired and the pace slows there are plenty of fresh contributors who have been drafting inside the peloton to take their place for the podcast listeners i'm pausing for the video or excuse me pausing for the uh for the image there's also an image of like caterpillars all crawling over each other but the caterpillars that are crawling on top of the other caterpillars are going twice as fast because like you know network effects breed network effects speed breed speed open source communities will always outpace the development of centralized teams the reason why this industry moves so fast is that it's a collaborative flywheel we build off of each other's successes and when one of us progresses forward into the frontier they bring us all with them kind of like the caterpillars evm equivalence is a bottom-up emergent city-like public good evm compatibility on the other hand is a one-off copy from that there are infinity different ways to deviate from the evm but there is only one way to adhere to it all right getting into replication replication at the application layer producing an evm equivalent layer 2 ecosystem is critical to retaining the network effects of composability and interoperability evm equivalent roll-ups allow for instant copying and pacing of code bases across chain development and innovation on a single evm roll-up is seamlessly transferable to any other evm equivalent optimistic roll-up and also ethereum itself since everything is being developed on the evm standard the network effects of the layer 1 are extended to the layer 2s and innovations on a layer 2 reverberate back throughout the holistic ecosystem a single line of code means more when it's deployed on an evm equivalent roll-up if you're an open source developer and you want your code to be used far and wide you would naturally want to use an evm equivalent roll-up as your code is instantly compatible with all the other evm equivalent roll-ups if you write code once but it works seamlessly on a thousand compatible chains then the value of what you have just produced is far greater evm equivalence takes the evm network effects to a whole new level non-evm equivalent roll-ups will not benefit from these shared net network effects the lack of a minimal diff design philosophy in non-evm equivalent rollups breaks the relationship between the network of ethereum and those that are not equivalent the gigantic wave of ethereum's network effects is compounded by every new addition of an evm equivalent roll-up and if you're not serving on surfing on this wave you're going to have to swim hard to catch up replication at the protocol layer these evm network effects don't just apply to the app layer of ethereum it also applies to the protocol layer itself where things get really interesting because evm equivalent roll-ups are minimally different differentiated from ethereum they offer ethereum a testbed for new ips to be tested in a live production environment right now eips are tested with ethereum test nets they are tested many times on many test nets to ensure nothing breaks and then it gets finely integrated into the ethereum l1 there's always risk with this because test nets are not minimally differentiated implementing an eip into gorly or kovin is not the same thing as implementing an eip into ethereum the difference between the size significance and nature of the economic activity on ethereum and the t that the test sense just cannot emulate there's always some unknown when implementing an eip into ethereum evm equivalence offers a solution when an evm when an eip gets successfully implemented into an evm equivalent roll-up it gives strong assurances to the base chain that the same eip could be successfully integrated without bugs roll-ups give a live production environment with real economic activity and real capital at stake for eips to be tested eips can be tested at the roll-up layer without the risk of something breaking and impacting the rest of the entire ecosystem when the l2s ubiquitously adopt the same eip as signals to the ethereum layer one that is desired by the community and is safe to integrate into the layer one evm equivalent rollups enable ethereum to sense the desires of the participants on its layer twos making each layer two and antenna attuned to the wants and desires of its users the command and control governance of tradfi in web 2 gets translated into the sense and respond paradigm of web 3. because each roll-up is its own sovereign economy it will implement various eips independently and asynchronously from the rest of the ecosystem according to the wants and the desires of its users over time the best eips will come to dominate the layer 2 roll-up landscape as more and more independent roll-ups see the value of the same ip and when an eip comes to dominate across the entire landscape of rollups it will signal to the ethereum layer one that it's a good ip and that eip and it's safe to implement it at the layer one level so here's a graphic i made with three phases one you have ethereum at the center and you have all these optimistic roll-ups on the periphery and two of them have adopted the same ip eip6789 in the second phase you see a theorem at the center but instead now five of them have adopted eip six seven eight nine and then lastly you see seven out of the eight uh roll ups having all adopted eip6789 and so because so many have adopted it it's been adopted at the layer one but also there's this eighth optimistic role that doesn't have to uh integrate eip1689 because that's the choice that that particular eip made it can do whatever it wants evm equivalents summarized all right here's the significance of evm equivalents it allows ethereum to break free from being bound by its layer one shackles what is ethereum becomes capable of extending outwards into the layer twos the dividing line between the l1 and the evm equivalent layer twos becomes extremely blurred there isn't any point in which the ethereum layer one stops and it's evm equivalent layer twos begin it's all just ethereum all right guys coming up in the second half of this piece we're going to talk about the way that evm equivalence creates biomimicry and the claim that i very much believe that the cryptoeconomic network that exhibits biomimicry the most will come to fill the voids because that is what nature is good at nature is good at filling voids and you know it's got a lot of voids the crypto industry the whole thing uh and so we are going to use ethereum is going to use biomimicry it's going to use evm equivalents to replicate and propagate all of its layer twos to fill every single void that can be filled and so that is what's coming up next in the show right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows for a higher loan to value ratios and of course portals allowing users to port their ave position across all of the networks that ave

a vacuum from aristotle nature is really good at filling voids the more evolutionarily fit an organism is the more space it fills animals consume food and reproduce to the maximum extent the environment allows all plants are expressions of fractals because fractals are algorithms that maximize surface area increased plant surface area adds to its ability to capture sunlight on its leaves and nutrients from its roots one of the most biodiverse areas in the world is the amazon rainforest where two percent of the light reaches the ground because the trees are so efficient at capturing sunlight here is the last mild problem defined the last mile problem is the last leg of a journey comprising the movement of people and goods from a transportation hub to a final destination the last mile describes the difficult last part in the transportation of people and packages from hubs to final destinations some challenges of last last mile delivery include minimizing costs ensuring transparency increasing efficiency efficiency and improving infrastructure nature is really good at solving the last mile problem this is a natural consequence of the survival of the fittest the organisms that rep can replicate and propagate the best come to fill the voids in which that it lives even inside an individual organism fractals are fundamental patterns for increasing scale and efficiency of the organism itself lungs are responsible for capturing oxygen and distributing it to the bloodstream and the circulatory system is responsible for distributing this oxygen and other nutrients to the first furthest reaches of the organism for the podcast listeners i have this these images of hearts and lungs and it they just look like trees uh and so does the entire circulatory system of the body and so do the neurons in your brain everything is everything that needs to have bio everything biological has this like fractal pattern because fractals are just efficient and the replication of uh d5 app layers and eips across layer twos is what i'm getting at here this easy replication along with the low fees of the layer two allow for this like organic biomimicry and if something has got biomimicry you know it's going to work fractals are structures in which each substrate has the same properties as the holistic structure fractals can be thought of never ending patterns and the replica replicatability and reproducibility is what makes a fractal a fractal only structures that are replicatable and reproducible can efficiently fill the voids found in nature and crypto is one massive void there is so much left to build but in order to fill all this empty space with new structures we need systems that we can replicate and reproduce evm equivalence produces the foundation needed to produce these properties with an evm equivalent roll-up ecosystem evm can replicate and reproduce at breakneck speeds zeroing in on the desires of its users and updating its code to reflect those desires every layer too can progress in its own unique direction specializing on whatever it wants to specialize in successful layer twos that on board many users and lots of value will signal to the other layer twos that it's discovered something of value when all we all know that the crypto industry is really good at copying and replicating something once it's been proven to be useful see the 2013 to 2015 proof of workfare launch era the yield farm copycatting of d5 summer in 2020 the l1 death forks of 2021 and if you are interested in the subject matter please read my article coordination and defection it's another good one as soon as in layer 2 finds a new source of value that source of value can be replicated and shared across the entire ecosystem and eventually brought back to the center of the ecosystem and you have here a little ant who's got a bit of an apple and i have a funny little caption titled david attenborough voice this app developer has found some food watch as the evm equivalents brings it back to the layer 1 to be shared this young developer is sure to receive infinite funding and a bunch of twitter followers eips are the new genes richard dawkins book the selfish gene discovers how each gene of an organism is the smallest unit of life and its inherent self-interest in his own preservation and replication offers the foundational pattern for which all life stands on good genes survive and bad genes die as organisms adapt and evolve genes that enable the well-being of the organism are propagated via replication reproduction across the entire species over time beneficial random mutations in an individual organism can help it survive and thrive better than the rest and as a result this gene goes from existing in not just one instance but existing in all possible instances because it was a good gene in the world of modular ethereum eips are the new genes good eips propagate bad eips die ethereum is a responsive adaptive system and the evm equivalent roll-ups allow for genes to be implemented into the organism first at the margins and then after the ip proves its viability it propagates outwards to the rest of the roll-ups and if the eip is good enough it will make it back all the way to the beating heart of ethereum the layer one ethereum becomes an organism that can respond and adapt to its environment even as the environment changes over time where biological organisms have their set of genes fixed from genesis ethereum has the ability to invent and integrate new genes as needed in order to stay up to speed with the changing demands of the world discovering the value in an evm equivalent paradigm turns that value into a public good that can be shared across the entire entire entirety of the ev of the ethereum ecosystem not just for that one specific layer too retroactive public goods building infrastructure for the entire ecosystem retroactive public goods funding will take ethereum from a system that responds to its users to a system that can take proactive action optimism is pioneering a new model for funding public goods one that injects silicon valley type financial incentives into projects building public goods they integrate the upside potential of a tech startup but with public goods as the product revenue generated from the layer 2 block space fees gets directed towards innovators and founders who build something useful for the optimism layer tube retroactive public goods funding commits money towards the future giving public goods builders the ability to build with assurances that there is money waiting for them if they build useful public goods there's a tweet from optimism that talks about the purpose of the optimism collective that was announced yesterday if you produce strong public goods infrastructure for optimism you increase the utility of the layer 2 and this creates a useful economy to build on as public demand for optimism block space goes up this increases the amount of funding available for public goods which creates further investment into more public goods which makes the optimism layer 2 a nice place to live because of how much how strong the public goods are and there's a feedback loop here this this cycle continues retroactive public goods funding takes web to incentives but has web3 profits and impact becomes profit the combination of retroactive public goods funding and evm equivalence means that when the optimism layer 2 builds something useful it becomes immediately available for the entire rest of the evm equivalent ecosystem to use lockspace sales on optimism turns into infrastructure not just for the optimism layer 2 but for all layer 2s and eventually ethereum itself blockchain ecosystems are famous for underinvestment into infrastructure and public goods this is a reference to one of italics articles the most scarce resource is legitimacy the graph that is shown here illustrates how much money that these blockchains are spending on security versus how much they are spending on research and development it's basically or many many many orders of magnitude you can barely see the research in development spending versus how much is spent on security these are block rewards and fees et cetera the one-two punch of retroactive public goods funding and evm equivalence gives us the first promising path towards solving the tragedy of the commons not just for optimism not just for the layer twos not just for ethereum but for the entire planet and here's how this works step one fund public goods on optimism step two expand these public goods for free to all the other layer twos step three integrate those public goods into ethereum and step four begin to expand the scope of the public goods that are built beyond ethereum and into the world step five solve global coordination failures and unlock a star trek future there's an article i wrote on this called how transaction ordering can save humanity i finished this up with a tweet the coming layer two tokens truly marks a new chapter for ethereum optimism's live stream viewer account on bank list was our second highest ever after mark cuban the release of layer 2 tokens will put attention back on the layer 2s the combination of that and retroactive public goods funding will lead ethereum into legitimacy as as the ethereum for the innovation of public goods funding is something that i think will be extremely appreciated by society and meanwhile layer two two two l two two two layer two twenty twenty two will lead us right into the ethereum merge and so it is time for ethereum to shine thank you for listening uh i really hope you enjoyed this piece i really think it's going to be a foundational component
