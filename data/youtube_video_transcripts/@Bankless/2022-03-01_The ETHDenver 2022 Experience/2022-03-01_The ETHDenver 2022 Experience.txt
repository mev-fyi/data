well we want to scale crypto to eight billion people so we can we can at least scale eat denver and eat them for five so maybe eight million yeah and we'll figure that out somehow [Applause] so people think that eat denver's a conference is actually a hackathon it's also like a community festival but the a lot of the culture here is set by all the hackers at all the tables like there's there's tables over there there's tables over there and people are hacking away building their projects because a lot of companies have bounties for example a lot of the sponsors put up uh tokens uh as like rewards for people that hack on their projects because they need the hackers to build the stuff and so while there's talks going on downstairs there's hackers building away up here at the table and it really sets the culture of like why are we here uh the term biddle was actually like propagated by east denver 2018 i believe uh and so this has been one of the epicenters of focusing on biddle culture rather than just huddle culture like we don't we can't just huddle our way into the future we have to build our way into the future uh and so having all these tables with all these hackers hacking away building stuff with the incentives of all the sponsors that have token rewards or bounties or grants like hey there's a competition so like if you build this like there's you could be entered to to win that uh and so there's obviously capital incentives to build all this stuff and so that's what all the hackers are doing and that's like the epicenter of eat denver and all the talks are just kind of layered around the hackers so if you're a builder thank you let's talk to some meta factory people all right [Music] yo what's up drew how are you how's it going my man good man how are you good good good so east denver has always had really good swag but this is the first time meta factory has been here and the swag game is big like really really upgraded what was your goal here at 8th denver wow two i mean two years ago we were pitching an idea uh we realized fashion played such an important role in celebrating culture and kind of defining culture we were figuring we can do something more my entire wardrobe consisted of shirts i got it swag conferences you know like passed out and i was like you know we can we can incorporate more so yeah what we're doing is digi physical so digital compliments to the physical merch we sell obviously it's a decentralized brand it's a dow we have some really cool mechanics for how we reward and get everyone involved in defining the course of this thing so trying to use these tangible experiences and physical goods to onboard people and teach them about the ethos of what we're doing and the culture and yeah trying to i guess push the needle a little bit in terms of just stamped logo on chest printful approach um we're doing some zero waste design you know kinetic design theory new patterns and prints we've actually started to integrate and in-house a lot of the production ourselves the fulfillment so we're vertically integrating and bringing on production and production partners so yeah it's been it's been exciting yeah uh so like you've just been giving the fantastic pitch for the meta factory merch what's flying off the shelves what are people buying the most the anti-meta meta factory is probably the top seller um the rest in peace mount gox and ether delta are also pretty popular is this how we're going to make crypto cool to the rest of the world because we have super dope swag i think it helps i think it's more about us celebrating our culture you know recognizing staying on top of the ethos of what's important to us it's for us right it's not necessarily too mainstream but again these tangible experiences and these kind of physical digital intersections provide a really i think exciting and a better way to onboard people who are new to the space and maybe aren't so technically sophisticated so any alpha coming out of meta factory what's what's coming up lots of alpha new cuts a lot of custom sew custom design stuff we're going to be doing a lot more with kong so the chip integrated but the biggest alpha is we've been working on our our digital wearable side again the complement to all the physical pieces for a long time and the big thing for us is pushing this vision forward of an open metaverse an interoperable metaverse versus a lot of these walled garden things so our approach is pretty novel in that we've yeah we've created something that will allow for a single nft that has basically multiple file formats on the backend and will allow you to kind of go in between worlds based on a single nft so hopefully that'll help push that standard and that conversation of interoperability and an open metaverse forward so that's going to be a big one if people want some metaver meta factory merch where should they go uh shop.metafactory.ai is going to be the go-to at the meta factory on twitter is going to be a good place to stay on top of drops and what's coming next and then of course if you want to get involved discord discord's one dude drew thank you so much my man cheers all right let's go find our next victim victim hunting victim hunting here we go here we go [Music] no one there no victims there [Music] yo let's go check out some of the sick art see the cool thing about eat denver is that there's that big hubbub over there but then you can come into this quiet space they have like zen rooms and art rooms and so it's both just a conference but also a vibe right like we've got some cool stick lasers this is actually like real art that somebody made for this event uh we can keep on going actually [Music] dave my man dave how's it going east denver og uh this is also dave part of dave dao been with maker dude i met dave uh in 2018 on the internet and i was writing for maker dell like doing all those just like my early writings and then dave on twitter posts like oh i just got a job as a community manager for maker dow and i was like that's an option dude how's it been dude this is your third denver yeah 30th denver that's right that's right yeah why do you like youth denver so much i like eat denver because uh it brings together the entire community and you kind of see year to year the evolution of the community and like the last day of denver i was at i think it was like four times less people and it's nice to see like a proof that the culture has remained strong despite the the inflow of like new people so i like that aspect i like the fact that you know we we i work remote right like most people work remote this is a chance for us all to kind of like meet and bond uh i think people underemphasize the value of just meeting somebody in real life and having like you know a genuine interaction and overall like it just boosts the morale in the space it gives you a lot more i don't know motivation for the work that i do you know personally speaking so yeah i like it it's not bad david [Music] excuse me do you know anything about this art do you know who made it i produced this this is your screen oh okay oh you're the producer can you tell us a little bit about that process to just make all of this happen um it's a big ass led wall and a lot of like really smart folks here to make it happen who asked you who found you to come do this at youth denver um so this is a production for trippy labs um i work specifically with house of attention to make this all come to life well it's absolutely beautiful and everyone's been enjoying it so thank you so much hopefully you enjoy it too oh i absolutely do thank you all right come to east denver hey kevin you busy i i guess not kevin you're an east east denver veteran uh how is how is this east denver different than the other ones uh that's a great question i actually have a question for you before we start which is uh hey cool beard are you moving to colorado when's the ponytail coming dude uh whenever you go to colorado you got to grow out your hair and grow the beard and care a lot about public goods so i'm trying to fit the mold there you go i'm happy to create the mold for you david what was the question you asked me again uh how is this denver different from the other ones uh the tweet i sent yesterday was that everyone's 10x richer and everyone's social skills have atrophied 10x during the covid so uh that's the take i think it's true uh so there there's a ton of people here and there's a ton of energy how would you say the energy from previous e denver's have changed or not changed um well you know anyone who's been through a cycle or two knows that crypto oscillates between fear and greed which means bear and bull and we're in definitely one of the cycles where there's been a lot of growth and i think that's created a lot of people who are using crypto for a lot of different things there's obviously the people who've been around for a couple years and are building defy projects and nft projects that have been around for a while and i think there's like a little bit more of a of an opportunist like the like people who have just entered this space kind of don't have the same grounding in terms of like the values and um and uh social social relationships of the people who've been around for a while so you're seeing a glorious clash of those two groups of people with each other here and uh i hope that people that that come here get green pilled and what i'm here to do is use crypto to build a better world to build a more regenerative world so i'm hoping to green pill as many of those new entrants to the ecosystem as possible i think the uh the underlying theme of ether has always been regenerative crypto economics but now it's actually instantiated in your book and in your podcast can you tell us a little bit about that yeah so plus one's east denver uh being a place where regen crypto starts uh get coins obviously from colorado and moloch dal v1 launched at east denver in 2019 i think which if i don't even remember 2019 but dowels were dead there was no one doing down there were zero dowels yeah and amin launched uh molok dowell v1 and everyone copied molokai and that was the renaissance of dallas that was the first proliferation of people actually doing dals and so i think that was really cool i remember his statement about uh after he made moloch dow he made like three other dowels he made yang dao he made like meme dao it was in an effort to make dao's cool again and it definitely worked yeah i think what amin really figured out was forkability anyone could take molok dao and fork it and make their own molecule we're actually trying to do the same thing with git coin uh take the same bitcoin grants experiment that we experience that we have right now and make it so that anyone can just launch a quadratic funding round if you want to fund boulder colorado quadratic funding colorado state colorado uh quadratic funding if you want to fund quadratic funding for your dow uh we really want to make bitcoin grants forkable and so that's really inspired by i mean and that's been fun but um you asked me about the the book and uh the new podcast so we've launched a podcast called green pilled on the bankless network and you can go to greenpill.party and subscribe to that podcast the first episode is with vitalik buterin who's talking about why he thinks public goods are good and that was a lot of fun uh there's also a book that you can pick up green pilled how crypto will regen can regenerate the world i want to do three editions of the book the first one is how crypto can regenerate the world the next one will be hopefully if the community decides to coordinate and create this world the next one will be called how crypto is regenerating the world and then the final edition will be called how crypto did regenerate the world but we have to choose those outcomes and so um i really hope to see that happen anyway so go to greenpillow.party pick up the book and subscribe to the podcast and the last thing that you can do is pledge uh pledge money to public goods we have a giving pledge on greenfield.party where you can pledge a portion of your net worth to public goods and create a more regenerative future so uh green pillar party is the site you want to go to for that for the east denver curious why should they come next year it's the vibe it's the building it's the culture that's been created around east denver and colorado is the place to be if you want to be building on web 3. so why shouldn't you come to that there you go kevin awake thank you so much cool beard david thanks man i appreciate that all right let's go next next victim hunting here we go [Music] hey what's up bartek how you doing my man hey how are you good yeah absolutely uh this is not your first eat denver right it actually is oh really how do you feel about that well uh it's a little bit different i guess than uh most of the european conferences um but i kind of like it you know it's a slightly different vibe uh new people you know completely new faces right like you go to paris you go to lisbon you go to all the european conferences and there's just so many people that you know you know you hang out and this is like a really really great opportunity for me to meet completely new faces and new projects so that's that's pretty cool bart you've been with uh maker dow for a very long time and something that was a talk of the town this east denver was maker dao through a really sick party for its first time ever and now people are talking about how maker dallas cool again you want to talk about that i mean it was always cool but but now but now we're throwing parties with it yeah now we're trying priorities you know we had to i guess we had to decentralize to do that right yeah the foundation wasn't cool but now dows are cool the foundation was centralized in a way you know and maybe the parties were not the priority with the spending you know we had to actually build a system and now that the system is up and running and uh the main problem is scaling you know we probably are in a different mindset and we can uh we i mean as a protocol we earn a lot of money you know the the stability buffer is growing and i think now we've got the proper budget to actually focus on growth uh having a very very secure foundation so it's just a different stage of the project right make a dao is an og you know we spend a lot of money on security probably we were the first project that was formally verified and you know we tend to think about ourselves as like this you know super secure foundational layer and foundational protocol for all the other d5 protocols to use and now that's done and it was launched right after osaka right it's been two years and the protocol proved to be very sturdy and now i think we can like refocus and uh think about growth more and if you want to grow i guess you know you have to throw the parties right bartek what are you working on are you working on anything here at denver or you're just here to vibe i'm here mostly to connect uh mainly uh but my main focus is scaling uh layer two multi-chain strategy and thinking about risk framework for a different uh domains right because uh maker is gonna go multi-chain very soon but we want to do it in a safe and very responsible way right and to do that we need to understand all the trade-offs all the security traders of every single roll-up out there and this is why we created delta beat as well uh to sort of help us with this effort it's an independent uh project however you know he's been partially funded by maker and we'll be watching all these uh you know layer two providers right because for maker it's all about the risk management it's all about making sure that when you use something else than ethereum you really have to understand the security trailers and my personal experience is that most people just don't it's too complicated right so you know we need to find a way to sort of explain uh very complex issues and very complex technical uh matters in a very simple terms for though for the bankless listeners out there we use l2b all the time to talk about them different metrics of layer twos and what bartek is talking about is they want dye to be on the layer twos but they need dye to be secure so they need the layer twos to be secure so we need to understand how secure the layer twos are and that's why we have layer two b so bartek thank you for making layer 2b it's super useful thank you very much it's not just me you know a handful of developers beyond chris uh thank you all right to make it uh available and of course all the sponsors and the other people that actually support l2p you know we've been uh shocked by the uh the positive uh support from the whole community i think you know this is a very very important resource that the community needs well and thank you for making it all right bartek i'll let you go have a good day cheers i need a i need a button that says don't pitch me your product i'm sorry let me do that again i need a button that says don't pitch me your product [Music] he's hacked so hard that you got to take a nap how sick is this art is dope in crypto [Music] if you want to you can go play ddr [Music] some live mario kart at youth denver we also play games in crypto oh is it japanese mario japanese mario kart hey what's up ben oh hey how you doing my man david good how are you having a good time i'm having a fantastic time this is uh ben of charged particles what's charged particles charge project's nft protocol allows you to take your nft and put things inside of it nesting dolls for nfts how how many layers can you go actually so we've gone like 13 layers deep but uh in theory a lot deeper but i don't know inception for nfcs why would one why would somebody want to do that well going beyond like just jpegs just with a jpeg it's kind of weird right but you can effectively turn that jpeg into a zero coupon bond mess tokens in them time lock them sell them but uh within in-game items within uh more financial primitives there's a lot of reasons of kind of taking a fungible non-fungible token putting non-fungibles or fungible tokens inside of it is this your first eat denver this is my first eighth denver are you having a good time i'm having a great time why are you having a good time so uh the energy here i mean it's a hackathon that has expanded into this whole thing but the energy here is super unique super special the amount of biddlers builders here uh it's just it's incredible so it still has like the hackathon central point that uh that is really special and uh what are you looking to get done here at youth denver are you just looking to vibe with friends are you hacking away at something like what's going on yeah um vibing with friends i'd say would be the big one so uh i've been mentoring uh so i have the unique position to like see a lot of these hackathons as they're moving along or these builders so supporting in that way and then um here with charged particles meeting my team in real life was always a pleasure and then meeting you know internet friends irl uh in real life as well have you been going to the parties i have we threw the official east denver opening party which was uh which was really great it was in an airplane hangar had tycho we had a literal blimp flying around air dropping goodies to the people it was a it was a it was a fun one so for somebody that hasn't been to any denver before why should they come uh well if you are in the space and you're interested in contributing or biddling or just kind of meeting other people and kind of realizing what the buzz is about would highly recommend coming uh i think we've probably outgrown this facility and many of the facilities that are offered here in east denver but uh yeah more of it like a psa anybody interested in getting in the space there's always human capital is the scarce resource right now like raise your hand dm's founders jump into discords there's always people looking for good passionate intelligent people to contribute and this is a great place to meet those people in real life ben thank you so much great to see you how's it going my man what's your name dave rodman oh i need to get you a part of dave dowell anyways you're into aaron dave down got scammed trying to get into dave doubt by somebody who has his name on telegram i sent him like a thousand dollars no you did not i've been in this space for a long time and like when i finally realized what i'd done i was like oh that's embarrassing and then i immediately told all my friends and then i joined the right dave dao oh if i had any part in that i'm so sorry absolutely not you had no part in it you had no part in it all right so all right you're you're a denver local so you've seen eat denver grow i actually is my first time attending in person um i've been really busy building my firm keeping my clients out of trouble uh and so this year i finally got to be here in real life how are your clients getting in trouble they're not because they're my clients how might they be getting in trouble uh inadvertently violating any number of securities laws bank secrecy act um sometimes weird stuff like employment things that you know they wouldn't necessarily think about i'm kind of their minder and i make sure that they follow everything they need to follow and when they can't uh we move them offshore which is actually unfortunately our most common move because this space is way too nebulous in the united states for young upstarting organizations and bright founders that have awesome ideas when should their time be to talk to somebody like you as soon as possible look i know lawyers aren't cheap i think we're pretty good because we're in the middle of the country we don't charge outside you know the coast race but the sooner you get somebody like me who knows they're doing involved the less money you will spend overall because it's easier to uh keep someone out of trouble than to mitigate especially when you're dealing with things like blockchains that have immutable ledgers forever and these uh statute limitations on some of these things are like 14 years long so honestly i tell people as soon as possible so i donate my time to colonel and give people like the chance once a week to come get legal education not legal advice um so literally as soon as possible do you have any opinions on the recent sec action with blockfly yeah i do i was actually really surprised uh that they were deemed a security it however if they had a banking license it would have made a lot more sense that they wouldn't have been um i'm a block fight user both personally and the firm we have a bunch of bitcoin and eth on the firm balance sheet so i guess i'm okay it's all sitting there it's it's you just can't add to it um it's it's a bummer it really is um i kind of yeah i i i kind of knew was going to happen we kind of didn't know what's going to happen all these things are going to get this sort of like uh regulatory touch further and further as we develop the space and the more money is involved dave thank you so much for your time pleasure meeting you man cheers all right hunty i want to find a dow punk this is sinjin out of the bankless dow and out of the dow punks something i noticed here at eat denver is there are so many dow punk shirts xinjin can you talk about your role with the dow punks and how it feels to see all these outbound shirts it's crazy yeah down punks was this project that grew out of bankless dao there was a i was doing merch with metafactory bankless and there was another artist in the dow cryptobushy who was making these one-of-one avatars uh four people in the dow called dow punks and um we basically found there was like a glitch in the matrix with this printer and they could like make these one-of-one shirts and we're like maybe we could use that for nfts and like make them together and like we actually built up a squad that all grew up out of bank list the devs and marketing and branding and like crazy it was like we're like is this even going to be possible right and it took like three months of uh trial and error there were multiple times like we're like we should probably just give up and we didn't we just kept going and the team came together the squad came together we made these like uh an nft drop with 11 11 dow punks and when you get a dow punk nft you also get a free shirt with it and um we made it very like web 3 where there was a wallet connection like as seamless as we could and um it has never been done in the space we haven't seen anyone else do it but every single dow puncture is completely different and there's a qr code that when you scan it it pulls up that dow punk on uh open c so uh also one of our community members said hey what if you guys took 25 of your mint fund and made a grant so now we have a grant coming along where it's going to give people money to pay their bills as they transition into web3 work so and there's so many dow punks wearing their dow punk shirts how does that feel it's a trip yeah i'm still like like getting used to it um and uh yeah every day there's different ones coming that i see and like um it's a good feeling you know it's a good feeling like i used to work in the you know the trad design space make stuff for like urban outfitters and here in this space like i feel like i'm like i'm making cool things for cool people making cool just like it means something you know it's not just a off-the-shelf design so it's a good feeling i feel blessed very very blessed to be in this space blessed for bankless dow punk's the success and excited for the future so and this has sweatshirt that you got on right now is something that you designed yourself right talk a little bit about that it is yes so the dow punks project started off from bankless and this is our first official merch drop and uh it's a organic cotton hoodie super high quality has a gm patch um and just out this is actually one of the hoodies that one of the dow punks was wearing uh so we made it real so irl digital meet space we're just we're just like mixing it all up something something life imitates art or imitates life yeah where does it begin where does it end is it the fractal who are we where are we going it's exciting syndrome thank you so much for uh outfitting us with really dope swag my my pleasure thank you so much cheers yo this uh you guys want to introduce yourselves sure my name is beau from bankless dao i'm ella dayne from dog punks and we were just talking with sinjin about the dow punctures and here they are can you guys like show us your dow punks of course i have creative number 20 um minted her back kind of over christmas um with the drop and this is my my personal favorite property which is the flowers and the plants uh but then you also have like the shadowy super coater tell us about your del punk so mine is 176. i actually traded with hashed may for this i got two women and i off too few miles and i wanted one that was a dude um and so i uh reached out to hash may we did a little swap and now i've got number 176 super shadowy coder have you guys gotten people to scan your qr codes sure have what's their reaction they love it it's awesome what shows up uh takes you straight to the open sea for the specific nft oh so it's marketing surface area for dow punks yes indeed yeah and how many other dow punks have you guys seen here at eat denver quite a few um grabbed lunch with a couple people last night i'd say around 15. um all in our swag yeah it's awesome it's great actually the dow punks community has been so strong um bankless community is strong of course but zap about dow punk showed up in force and we're all wearing our shirts i'm on day five i have watched it but i've worn it every day absolutely we love the dow punks we got scott from d5 pulse and got evan van ness from weekend ethereum guys how's it going scott first pretty good yeah yeah good time yeah that was going pretty great for scott actually i think it is going pretty gay for scott maybe we can talk about that maybe we will uh scott what are you up to here at ethember um meeting founders figuring out what people are building having fun meeting my internet friends in real life so evan what are you up to here at east denver yeah trying to talk to founders building new stuff the future of web3 and i have a presentation to give in 45 minutes that i have not prepared for at all it's going to be fun well part of the culture is we're just going to send it here at denver so we sometimes we wing our talks uh what are you going to talk about it's the year in ethereum it was supposed to be a panel but uh and i'm already losing my voice because i think my voice just cracked good times um it's supposed to be a panel but instead it's just me we'll see how it goes scott you have your hands in like a lot of different things all over the place so what are you focused on lately uh recruiting for what all the i'm working on what talent is missing leaders i would say that's mo like if you want to lead a project you have good communication skills you're accountable i want to talk to you all right if you can talk well and present well come talk to scott all right so this is uh my buddy reese lindmark reese lindbach was an inspiration for me because at my first eat denver he was the mc uh and he really embodied some of the culture around east denver greece can you talk about the culture of east denver what is it great question david and first thank you for saying that and i remember david's energy the first year was infectious and loving and great and you've kept that and that's been great so what is the culture of east denver i think part of it is like the humility and the curiousness folks who come in are just like i'm ready to learn and are ready to like i don't know much i might know a lot whatever and being curious about others and then the other piece is just like just like the having fun side like we really wanted to in both me and some of the initial early folks it wasn't just purely dev stuff it's like or 2018 it was like so much ethereum development things like what about the culture you know and so we did a lot of work on just like weird memes and and that was very helpful and how have you seen that culture change or progress over the east denver's over the years oh that's a great question i mean uh yeah this year it now feels like out of my hands of course like you know from 1500 people to now 15 000 i think the culture has actually stayed relatively strong part of that is the initial core community like not me has like continued to organize it and done amazing work there part of it is i think folks in the space you vitalik others really emphasizing some of these values um and part of it though i think for me is like i don't really interact with the um nft whales or the like um random dejin i'm dj good also teach like so i kind of just self-select and so i get the culture that i see but now it's just like so much more pluralistic than it was and uh what are you hoping enough to see out of future eat denver's what's still missing what do we still need to unlock as a community great question i was chatting with my friend dan about this earlier today and we were like whoa eat denver from 1500 to 15 000 10x and i think that's a really important question because this is still just the beginning we're at magic internet money is going to take over the world and that's kind of scary and so i think what's missing is i'm not sure i think i think that being aware of how much more we have to go that's still just the second inning and also trying to just re-emphasize the mission and the values and saying hey let's be you know humble and curious and do that forever i hope that that is what we continue to do yeah we well we want to scale crypto to eight billion people so we can we can at least scale east denver and eat them for vibes so maybe eight million yeah and we'll figure that out somehow reese thank you so much for being an inspiration to the space thank you david and thanks for all the good work you're doing cheers have a good day bye bye bye bye all right next victim hello simona simona you've been at every single youth member right i think except 2018. but you go to a lot of events why do you go to so many events i think they're a great great way to not only maintain but also grow and expand our culture and as we can agree the ethereum culture is one of the big big pillars of our movement and i think it's incredibly important for us to be together uh celebrate that culture and also welcome newcomers into into our space in like a nice guided and hopefully exciting manner i believe your title is head of community at status is that right as you know i wear many many many hats um so i yes i help status out with community strategy i also work with bitcoin on dow engagement strategy very important piece to work on you know dows are all the rage but they're not necessarily working perfectly right now i also again have my hands in a lot of these events and curating content shellingpoint on the 17th listcon last year so you gave the answer exactly what i wanted you to because i think your my unofficial title for you is generalized head of community of vibes correct yeah what does it take to do that um a lot of energy slight masochism at times um but i think it's it's one of the the things that keeps me in this space because i just love creating these experiences for people and i love creating these paths where people can choose their own adventure can follow whatever is in line with their values with their um you know wants needs whatever it is that they want to achieve i believe that we can enable that for them so you know that kind of energy and optimism for what's to come keeps me young and what skills does it take to go into that what makes you good at your job and how can people who aren't dev focused aren't technical focused but still want to help grow this community how can they follow in your footsteps i think it's so much about relationships and just because we are in the tech space it doesn't mean that those relationships and that human element goes away at all in fact as we were saying earlier it is the culture of ethereum that keeps people um engaged and keeps them once they come in they stay because of that they fall in love with the space and i think that's the big thing like away from the flirting element although that definitely happens but it you fall in love with the culture and the people and the way they make you feel and how welcoming people are so i think just start connecting with people find people that think the way you do find people that want to work on the things that you want to do and slowly you will create a network and hopefully create some new exciting things for our space simona thank you so much for the advice thank you guys cheers dude who are you i'm a jt from a grid plus also i'm a moderator on heath finance and i'm like talking to you at my first ethereum conference ever and it just so happened i was in here yesterday and kevin owaki was on stage with you it was just it's so surreal to see everybody in person i've had so many awesome people from heat finance come up and say hi our grit plus booth in the back is banging a lot of people are learning about what our hardware security wallet is all about and we couldn't be more excited dude the the moderator of efinance you've been with the er subreddits from the very beginning keeping the campfire warm while it was a cold winter at times and now it's really really hot what's it like to be a moderator of east finance during a bull market well during a bull market everybody's having fun right and it's kind of fun in the bear markets too because i feel like that's where your best friends are really made so when the bull returns we can calm down the moon boys and give a little bit of expectations and tamper you know and kind of keep the message on point so we pride ourselves on being a pretty high signal low noise environment but who cares when the price is skyrocketing right everybody's having a good time too so we're always open to like help out different conferences if any of the conferences out there ever need a little bit of help a little more visibility we're happy to put a sticky on the front page we've done that for things you've had for get coin we want to just provide a free resource with a good moderation team that really does a great job keeping out the click farms and the trolls so we can have a great down-to-earth conversation about ethereum and what it's doing for the world how much signal is in refinance right now we have like 800 to a thousand comments per day which is a nice number even on a on a good bull day because it's short enough you can kind of scroll through and get through everything what's great about that community is that we have a good core of probably 200 regular people and we've all like established a culture and it's so nice to read long-form stuff on reddit we kind of pride ourselves as being for a lot of people is like the only place they go on reddit it's the only thing they use it for and you know we've had we've had ernst young come along for the ride and we've helped them out on their conferences with paul brody and their team it's just it's a great place and they learn from us we can help teach enterprise people and we can help newcomers and we can we can allow a good conversation to take place on instructor it's a lot of fun jt what do you do at grid plus so at grid plus i do media i do youtube tutorial videos i help instruct people on set up the basic procedural things on the discord sometimes i live stream and in high definition i have a lattice device i have my desktop and i also have a camera on me and i'm able to walk people through how to get started and how to use the device and help answer questions push them to our support ticket system if we need to and just generally be a person that people can talk to and jt before you were doing that you were a school teacher right yeah i did 18 years of public school music education i mean little little kids k through 5. it was a really joyful time in my life i also do pro dj work and i would do odd jobs in the summer and now it was it was time to try new things right so we always teach people you need to try new things every now and then so after 18 years hung up my teaching hat and i joined the crypto space full-time it it was like i was living a double life while i was a teacher also managing reddit and like the you know it was just it was just a fun time in my life i think the little children they they they can teach us adults a thing or two about community and respect and wholesomeness and like being a positive force do something good today jt you said you hung up your teaching app but now you're teaching people how to use grid plus and how to use crypto so what is there really any difference between teaching little kids about stuff and teaching people about crypto how do those things overlap well i tell you what eat denver it looks like a kindergarten classroom right now these are my people right they're just a little bigger absolutely jt thank you for everything you do thank you so much man it's a pleasure talking to you keep going cheers so this is aj from tracerdal aj they you came all the way from australia how was that all the way from australia uh 13 hours on a plane but yeah worth every penny yeah and what are you trying to get done here at eat denver uh trying to spread the good word of tracer dow so launching our v2 over the next month and yeah connecting with builders and yeah contributors alike dude the tracer dao showed up in force there's like 10 people out here wearing the tracer down blue fantastic selection of the colors popping out yeah no we've managed to chill pretty well over the week got our merch out to a lot of powerful people so yeah hopefully we can continue to grow the brand from there and i believe if you're out of australia you can't necessarily get back immediately are you hanging out in the states for a while uh hanging out in the states for a while tracer dao is going global so if you're a contributor in the states or in europe feel free to hit me up and yeah we're open to contributors i believe uh tracer v2 is coming out uh what can people be excited for i think the biggest thing people can be excited for is permissionless deployment and we're going to be releasing a crypto punk index where you can take 4x 5x long or short on a crypto punk floor price feed so i think that'll be the big things and deploying any leverage market with any oracle price feed and uh tracer dow is a sponsor for east denver and so you guys have been trying to encourage hackers to hack on tracer dao can you talk about just like the relationship between tracer dow and the hackers that you that are hacking on tracer how are you like corralling people to hack on tracer i think the big thing was we got here early we got here the week before the conference started and we've just been talking and trying to connect with all these builders uh telling them about our bounties which is building a creative ui building a structured product um much like what joey just went into with uh 4626 um we'd love to see like those yield generating products being built on tracer as well um so i think it's just been about getting in the roots early of the conference and trying to connect with people in a meaningful way and how much in capital is available for tracer bounties for the hackers uh they're seven and a half k for the ux uh award and they're seven and a half k for the structured product and i think that's really cool this is a great model for eat denver because tracer dow doesn't have these employees they're just sending out the bounties and then the nebulous community of hackers build stuff so you just you know come out to eat denver if you need a product built and hopefully tracer dow gets something cool out of it yeah that's it 100 we're doubling down on the community first model and yeah i guess that's the dell way and if people want to learn more about tracer dow where should they go uh head to tracer.finance or tracer underscore finance on twitter or hit me up uh east underscore aj happy to connect cool thank you aj cheers thank you man all right ben you want to go on ben the gmi god griff you were recently on stage talking about public goods and market caps and stuff like that for the listeners that missed your talk can you kind of give them a preview yeah in short public goods are totally overlooked in this space there's a huge opportunity to disrupt governments and non-profit nonprofit industries which are just not working and everyone knows they're not working we could do so much better with web3 tools regen economies specifically and there's no competition in the space and the mark every year we're spending trillions in on public goods uh governments are and non-profits are literally last year literally spent 10.5 trillion dollars trying to solve problems in inefficient ways and that's that's it with a t trillion with a t five times more than the market cap of all of crypto all of crypto does not even compete to this it's a drop in the bucket and yet there's hardly any development in space i think it's the biggest overlooked opportunity and i don't think it'll be overlooked for long so people should ate in do you think that that is the meta goal of eat denver itself i i think it's the medical of crypto itself if we can actually solve this problem we can actually coordinate around public goods productions in efficient ways we don't we won't need governments anymore i thought that was the point when i got into crypto you know i thought it was to like change the way we coordinate as a society to the point where we don't need these inefficient like things that we invented when we're riding horses around you know uh so i i i fully expect that crypto will come back around and get out of this oh number go up we're only trying to make money uh idea and come back to the idea of like how can we create the most value for society and it's really not business models work great fundraising through taxes and donations really suck i think we can make major moves griff what does east denver mean for you oh man it's like christmas every year i love eat denver so much and by the way people call me santa so when i say christmas it means a lot like i love i love eat denver it's it's the best even better than dev con better than anything else it feels like it's i missed the first year and then i heard what was going on here and i i will never miss it again i would i i yeah it would be very difficult griffura one of the uh og inspirations for uh the dao which had its incident but then so many dows now exist how do you see the current state of ethereum the current state of dallas kind of fulfilling on the original vision that you had for the dao in the first place oh it's so beautiful i love it i think they're really doing it because it's starting to be lots of cause-focused styles when we when we started the dial the id we almost called it uh the dao was supposed to name itself later and there were lots of options one of them was genesis dow because it was supposed to splinter into thousands of now and now we finally have that splintering of course not with the bad dow code people are using other doubt there's so many dow opportunities to use and now there's pizza dow there's so many research styles there's cause focus dials developer dolls design focus dials and they're all kind of doing their niche and they're becoming like little guilds and i just love this idea of competing micro economies to provide value for society and i feel like it's really happening i feel like the the i mean to see pizza dow their goal is to spend a million dollars on pizza in a day right like and they're turning pizza into a public good you know so it's like they're i i feel i feel accomplished i've never i just can't believe how many dows i've never heard of that until i came to this conference well griff thank you so much for your energy and your commitment to values in this space uh and if people haven't been to eat denver why should they come in the future i mean this is where you meet everyone this is like i was saying on stage actually sporkdale's market cap is only 2.3 million dollars but there are going to be unicorns that come out of this if you can actually get down here and start hacking with people you can find out that you don't need to be a dev to actually provide value in this space and you can start connecting with people that your value as is like a positive sum game with them and join a team build something learn something network with all these people and then when you get on twitter you can start putting faces to names at the way they walk to the way they tweet you know it's super cool and you will it will pay off in the long run griff thank you so much thank you man cheers [Music] so the cool thing about eat denver is that when you sign up you get these tokens air dropped to you on an arbor trump side chain and then you get free food at all the food trucks and the number of food trucks is absolutely insane so it actually kind of turns into like a little bit of a social environment you know because people get tired they come out they get their their free food which they get air dropped you get air drop free food at each denver [Music] two days ago this was like all snow because it's denver and the sun's so hot it melts super fast now we're talking about the weather [Music] yeah what's up nice to meet you come to eat denver
