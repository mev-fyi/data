and here we are not just just over halfway through 2023. Quan is in jail in Montenegro waiting to be extradited to the United States Sam bankman freed is under house arrest can only assume he's going to jail machinsky's going to the jail suzu and Kyle Davies are still on the run but they are completely ostracized from the West they can't step anywhere outside of Dubai or otherwise they would be arrested so that box is not yet checked however with all the other boxes checked and the complete fall from grace that is through your capital and probably the very likely cases and efforts going into actually grabbing those guys is probably going on behind the scenes that we don't know about I say that we have permission to be bullish Banco station it it is the third Friday of July and it is time for what David uh it's the bank this Friday weekly roll up Ryan where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier no matter where we are in the world as you can tell I'm gonna you know you're kind of a cramped little this is the most cramped podcast recording setup I've ever had it looks good actually so uh David's in Paris and by the way bankless Nation this is the first time we were actually doing an episode in three weeks all right it says mine and Ryan's first podcast in three weeks which is the longest time that we've gone since starting this podcast yeah so we've had uh David's been off climbing mountains and you've got some more Mountains to climb by the way I've got one uh so we queued up some podcasts we we put those out for you for the last and I I've been doing some solo episodes David's got one more mountain how has it been so far uh it's been pretty good let me tell you the Whiplash between being on a mountain and then the next day flying to Paris to go to ECC so like from Mountain to crypto conference in under 24 hours was a lot I was sitting on the plane there was a few moments I had like halfway up the mountain I was like climbing Rainier and we were like 12 000 feet with two thousand four feet more to go I was pretty exhausted and I'm like this is my first vacation and then I'm like and that's what you choose to do that's what I choose to do yeah and then and then just a day and a half later I'm on a flight to go to uh Paris and I'm like 10 days behind on anything crypto related like crypto is a new industry 10 days later yeah I was like sitting around like man I need to catch up on crypto what do people do how do people consume crypto news what do they do when they need to catch up on the week oh I can listen to the roll up weekly rolled up with you and Anthony and I was like oh this is so useful yeah it you know it is really useful I mean bankless I think for for me and for you David has just been about kind of a journey of creating content and exploring subjects that we would have wanted to explore otherwise so it's just kind of a chronicling of that of that Journey I'm glad you found that roll up so useful David that's great that's great customer I am I was very satisfied okay remind people Anthony did a great job a huge shout out to Anthony cesano for yeah three times over the last like five weeks or so yeah I mean he really is the third uh podcast co-host is it yeah even if he doesn't know it yeah he's better than us okay so what are you doing in Paris you said a crypto conference what conference is that eat CC so I'm at the ethereum Community Conference so I actually ECC is interesting because it was the Super spreader event right before covid so it was the last ethereum conference before we shut down conferences and then it was also the first conference in 2021 that started things up again so this is the third HCC since the conference season really got started conference season started after like in 2021 where crypto like was dead between 2018 to 2020 from the perception of the outside world to very very much alive and so this July it's always in July it's always in the same place it's always the same org like running and programming this thing and so it always feels like uh you know one trip around the sun it's like an arbitrary birthday for all the conference Growers out there it's like oh it's a nice Landmark every single year so this is ECC number six this is my third uh it was great it's been great I was I always like to ask because as you know I don't go to these things I only go to like one uh conference a year and that is permissionless uh which is coming up by the way when is that coming that's the next one you're doing that's in September that is next permissionless is next yeah all right so bankless Nation make sure you grab a ticket if you already have it but ECC is different uh my impression it's very it's kind of a technical type type of traffic my favorite question to ask people and we'll get into some of the events some of the um announcements that were made at ethcc but the question right now is because we're still in a bear Market it's like what's the vibe among the builders so how's everyone feeling like what's your assessment because you've been to so many eccs how does it compare to previous ones yeah I'm since it's at the same venue every single year I walked up to the venue this year and there's always people like kind of just hanging out outside if you don't people come without tickets and so they come into hang out outside and then people take a break outside so there's always people hanging out outside the venue and I was walking up and I see like the massive people that's always there and I could just tell it's like oh thank God it's a calm one this year because last year's was insane and also it was 100 degrees last year this year was only 80 in Paris um so I would say it's calm and Relentless like the building the rate of building in ethereum has always been like redlining in a good way like at the highest RPMs possible whether you're in a bull market or in a bear Market that hasn't changed um and specifically the building now it really feels like people have always been building hard but rubber is really meeting the pavement here and I think we'll see that as we go through this weekly roll-up agenda and you can just kind of look around this space like layer twos are shipping like the infrastructure around layer twos are shipping hard uh entire ecosystems are transitioning everything is that all the hard problems if they are not being currently solved they are on the cusp of being solved and that's that's kind of how I would share the sentiment of Builders is like it's real inside of it's been real in the last like six months and like the next six months like a lot of very real stuff hard problems are getting solved I like those words calm but Relentless uh is a really interesting way to describe it and there was a bankless party event as well that we had for for bankless Citizens uh this is a photo from from one of these uh so what was the vibe there yeah this is the bankless team so this is at the end of the party we took a took a team photo party was great for all the bankless citizens shout out to all the bank citizens that were out there I talked to uh John Ice cool from the Dow quite a lot there and just a number of other people you know while talking to all the the bankless citizens there's like certain archetypes across crypto of course we know this the different different tribes I would call the bankless Citizens like the Athenians of crypto oh really they're like yeah they're like there's a lot of dads we have a lot of dads but like there there are a lot of people who really care and really care deeply about crypto and they're living like they're like it's a lawyer with the two kids or like and why I call this the Athenians is in the 300 movie you have the Spartans and the Athenians talking to each other and the Spartan the the Spartan guy who's I can't remember the name uh the guy it's just like a warrior Society right yeah and like he's asking the Athenians who want to join the fight and it's like what's your profession and one guy says like Oh I'm a blacksmith and he's like oh what's your profession it's like Oh I'm a cobbler and like oh what's your professional I'm a farmer we're the Athenians like it's just this very diverse group of very like humble focused people who live in a society live in a collective uh and so I I just it's like everyone's just really appreciative of course of like the podcast but like the diversity I think diversity is really the word I'm going for here is is pretty pretty cool to see I really love that description of bankless uh as the Athenians I feel like Athenian myself so uh that's that's really cool to hear David I see a lot of plants at this uh venue is that intentional David yeah so I wish I could say I picked this place but Rachel who is in the middle uh she picked she picked this place uh curator of Vibes the the drinks were fantastic uh I had a number of training Cocktails so I got I got a little loose uh and because we had this uh beautiful event sponsored by Sega all the drinks for the bank of the citizens were free these are the if you're a bankless citizen you come to the bankless Meetup you get free drinks uh the founder of Sega was there and we were talking a little bit Ryan do you know what an exotic option is no that sounds uh fun exotic is it fun yeah so it's an option that it's a it's so you have normal options you have vanilla options and you have exotic options I think the simplest way to explain an exotic option is if this then that statements for options so like conditional options so he was like walking me through what like what you can do with with exotic options and so if you are interested in exotic options or you are interested in free drinks Sega might be the place is the link yeah so thanks very clean for Sega for providing defy exotic options and providing the bankless nations with our liquidity and the next time the band gets back together of course is that permissionless and hope the Athenians the bankless citizens uh show up for that one anyone who's listening of course uh you can catch that in Austin Texas September 11th through 13th there's a link in the show notes to tap into this David you still have some conference energy in you for the back half of this year yeah I actually signed up for one more here at ECC but we'll talk about that later uh so you call the ECC a very technical conference and you're totally right like for people that like hear me and Ryan talking about conferences and hear the crypto industry it's talking about conferences ECC is like it's like you know 301 401 kind of hard mode like it's like professionals and teams and people coming to like get done and definitely that's also true for permissionless but I think if you're looking for a stepping stone into being a conference or and I can't recommend it being a conference or enough Ryan uh permissionless is a great place to get started it's like the The Vibes last year just like yeah the Athenians like so many different people hodgepodge group of people coming to all coalesce under under permissionless and block works just such as a killer job just like facilitating and organizing and operationalizing a conference and so we will have our next Bank meet up for Citizens at permissionless that is September 13th 11th through 13th in Austin Texas a ton of people if you only go to one if you only go to one go to one is permissionless yeah this is me I only go to one this one from your personal experience we got a lot to cover this week David man we're talking about conferences it's good to catch up with you but there's so much going on in crypto I'm glad you stayed up to date on the roll-up but topics of the week Alex machinski remember that guy and scammer from Celsius he was just charged by the SEC the cftc and the FTC finally they are busting the scammers uh we'll talk about that what else we got going on the Ripple case I know the Ripple case happened right after you saw uh stopped recording with Anthony last week and then you added that little bit but we're gonna get the reactions from the Ripple case I actually have a take I think Ripple actually lost but crypto still won so that's my that's my take about talk about that yeah and then also I interviewed Hayden Adams about this next announcement unit swap X I interviewed him right before I eat CC's we're going to go into what is uniswap X it's a brand new protocol to pair with the uniswap amms we also got an L1 that wants to become an L2 and we'll talk about all the ECC relevant things along the way as well before we get into it guys I want to give a shout out to our friends and sponsors over at uh stator protocol this is a new e-staking protocol it is uh decentralized one of my favorite things about this is that it is permissionless so similar to some of the decentralized protocols out there like a rocket pool and second this is if you're ever looking to run an ethereum node yourself okay this is the lowest cost way to do that lowest capital requirements I should say a way to do that only for eth to spin up a stator node which is really cool and they also have a pledge to keep staking decentralized on ethereum including a self-cap on the amount of eth that they'll accept in their protocol so David I gotta tell you I am now in the season where I'm thinking about staking my eth okay I've stayed some in the past but now I'm kind of ratcheting that up it feels like a lot of the risk has been boiled out of it and it is so fantastic to see all of these new staking options right now as far as launch incentives stator has a 1.5 x staking boost this month that you can be eligible for and they've got some LP rewards too so go check them out and and in general look for options to stake your eth that is the the bankless way that 1.5 x boost with that that means is you are getting a little bit extra from the SD token paid as incentive so token incentives is where that boosts come from if you want that boost there's a link in the show notes so you can go and get started with stator David let's talk markets man it's been too long uh where are we at this week on bitcoin I'm not gonna get out the words out of my head but at the bank let's meet up where everyone says that they just chuckle when we do the prices but we're doing them anyway we're doing them anyway Bitcoin last week seven days ago 30 900 it's currently down Fri uh Thursday afternoon four percent to 29 700. so down four percent Bitcoin down four percent on the week I think pricing in the crab market is is difficult because it just doesn't change from week to week it's kind of I mean this is basically it's been single digits a lot yeah how about ether may as well what what's ether on the week down three percent so 1930 to 1890 so down three percent and then of course that means the ratio is up it's up a little bit more than a percent week this feels like our crab market numbers right you know 30k yeah these are big crab markets yeah this is where we are crab by the way it just is a market that goes back and forth back and forth it continues and that that's sort of where we are to write before this influx of new money which where's it gonna come from I think that's a major theme for us uh this year in 2023 2024 but what's the ratio look like any change there uh up a percent a little percent and a half point zero six three uh market cap I think we're above a trillion I'm not even playing one point one point three trillion we're at 1.3 you saw you said 1.3 trillion last week with Zazzle that was the first time we we hit 1.3 I mean that feels big right to be above a trillion that's another big number for me um let's talk about Trad five David you remember stocks those things that you could um they're like tokens they're like erc20s but um honestly like I've not completely forgotten about stocks I only look at the charts that you've have pulled up the NASDAQ and the Spy it's a nice looking chart I'm I shouldn't have forgotten about stocks let me tell you that they're almost at all-time highs both in the NASDAQ and the Spy are almost at all-time highs which is around where crypto set its all-time highs crypto status all-time Highs at the end of 2021 and going into 2022. the Spy NASDAQ did the same and they are almost back there you know what gives yeah what gives where's our bull market where's our all-time highs you know and I it's funny because um people in crypto are bragging about like how you know Bitcoin and ether are decoupled from stocks now great that is I'm like but it's decoupled in the wrong direction that's not fun that way that's bad yeah uh from Anthony susano where he said Max Payne for crypto investors is watching stocks hit all-time highs while Ethan beats today BTC are range bound AKA crab market ultra pain is selling crypto for socks just before crypto starts a new bull market oh and like I I comment below this and I say the year is 2019. if you Ira this is exactly what 2019 was the equities markets were ripping and crypto was just lagging so hard and it gave us all so much fomo we were so bummed about that uh and then and then you know oh no it happens in 2020 but yeah this the 2019 to 20 2023 uh discrepancies not this you know what's different for me I'm feeling zero fomo like I just I I had rally stocks or something like I don't care like we are so well positioned right now in crypto I'm just like okay that's great go do your thing in fact it's like now that the discrepancy is there between spy and NASDAQ all-time highs and crypto's still flat like that it would be dumb to chase that because you but the discrepancy is bullish for us yes for crypto yes and it makes a permission to be bullish well do you permission to be bullish is that the theme for the episode do we have permission yes yes there's I put this in the agenda a number of times there's this is the first of many reasons in this roll-up and why bankless listeners I think you have have permission to be bullish now if you are a bullish person on crypto and your friends are saying haha you're dumb for being in crypto you're like no you should be buying crypto you have permission to be bullish about that yeah like there's enough evidence there I totally agree I think I am uh I've never should I say I've never been more confident about crypto but like I just feel like we are so well uh set up if like we are feeling good the spring is coiling right now and like it resonates with what I'm seeing here at ECC and all the hard problems about like sequencers and layer twos and ZK stuff all of that all the hard problems coming into into the fruition being solved man okay again theme of the episode it'll be it's a reoccurring theme we'll keep going okay well be patient you have permission to be bullish now it's David Hoffman my co-host says so good to have you back man I like that Bull Energy okay how about go the protocol that's gho this is Ave this is a stable coin that launched on top of Ave they've hit 4 million in market cap in two days um and are probably larger by the time we're recording this so a pretty good pretty good entry I would say into this so yeah it's 4.56 right now uh remind us what go is David yeah just a it's pretty similar to die from maker Dao except this is go from Ave pretty pretty similar if your mental model starts there you're off to a great start so Ave you know it's an has Assets in its vaults and it has um extra margin because you know people deposit more than they withdraw and so you can mint go from your deposits into Ave just like how you can borrow anything else and so now Ave is a hybrid compound maker protocol which is bullish I would say yeah I like it cool and then also similarly this is there's a I would say another theme of what I'm noticing is a lot of parallel development maker Dao this is aside from the news of this week but maker Dao is doing its spark protocol which is Ave for maker Dow so ave's got a stable coin and Banker dial it's got a lending facility so all these verticals well Baker Dow has always had a lending facility what do you mean by this uh it is it's different it's being compartmentalized now so the stable coin and the uh yeah so it's got an Ave so Ave is different than maker Dao and now maker Dao the system has a vertical has the credit facility which is die and then the money market facility which is Ave there's definitely this is a meta pattern there's definitely a lot of convergence here like one one thing so much convergences like there's a ton of convergence on layer twos that's another big theme that's going on this was completely unsettled two years ago anyway uh let's keep going on do you do any whale watching David I'm talking about crypto whales all right well I I don't either but this one I don't I don't I feel too jealous of people who I see moving their funds after icos after eight years I'm like man you gotta remember this is one address out there there's still some massive whales out there uh this this address awakened after eight years and just moved 116 million dollars to Kraken oh our friends and sponsors Kraken what other exchange would you use of course is it's got to be cracking Ico imagine investing in the ethereum Ico and not making a single transaction and the next thing you do is you send it to Kraken to sell it like I don't I wonder if they like lost their private keys and magically found it somehow which is the best day ever for them or they just have the biggest diamond hands of all time they don't even care about defy maybe it's just patience so you wrote that thing from uh I mean how much was this when they 25 cents 33 cents okay well that that was the price of ether right so it's 160 Ico price yeah oh no it's 61k worth of ether times you know 25 cents whatever that is uh I don't know fifteen thousand fifteen thousand dollars something like this yeah so yeah fifteen thousand dollars okay wait eight years and then you send it to cash out presumably at 116 million wow that is a patient investor right there I can't they must have had another address if they never because like they never got themselves like I don't know a house a car yeah like they never glowed up their life in eight years when they had access to hundreds of millions of dollars multiple times patience who knows wow what are the chances that way listening to this uh right now and us let's talk about this individual and they're like yup that was me they're bankless listener maybe uh David we got a lot more to talk about what else we got coming up next coming up next we got michinsky arrested on fraud but I have a conversation starter that actually starts with a Nick Carter take which leads into our second reason of the week as to why we're allowed to be bullish Ripple put the SEC on its heels and I also have to take as to why Ripple actually lost but at but crypto still won ECC has brought plenty of announcements and base is open soon to builders we're going to talk about that I interviewed Jesse Pollock here at ECC Ryan we're going to talk all about that and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show

details about what he's getting charged but first before we get into that conversation I want to pull out this take from Nick Carter I want to start this conversation here Nick Carter in November of 2022 right after FTX collapsed he tweeted out and I remember him talking about this on his podcast he says if we can't Purge the three hours Capital boys SBF and all of his cronies michinsky and Quan we don't deserve to move on as an industry good people will continue to leave because they can't morally justify participating I remember reading this take and I was like oh that's bearish that's going to take so long there's so many of them they're all over the world and today Alex machinski is arrested on fraud and all these other charges that we're about to go into and so the details here and we're going to come back to Nick Carter's take at the end uh the details CEO of Celsius of course charged by the Department of Justice lawsuits from the SEC cftc and FTC the Department of Justice accused machinsky and his cronies of orchestrating a years-long scheme to mislead customers on the market value of the company and interest in the sell token the SEC has accused of Securities fraud and misleading investors the cftc has accused Michigan engaging in a scheme to defraud customers by misrepresenting the safety and profitability of the platform and the FTC has accused machinski of violating the Federal Trade Commission acting connection with the marketing and sales cryptocurrency lending in custody Services the companies have agreed to a judgment of 4.7 billion dollars which will be suspended to permit Celsius to return information any assets to Consumers and bankruptcy proceedings basically like that is the comprehensive takedown of Alex machinski at all that book is closed and while we can go into the details of Alex Richards I think we can really just summarize it there and I kind of want to go back to the Nick Carter take three hours Capital Alex machinsky dokwan and SPF and he goes if you want to pick a bottom and it's when Olive Kwan bankman machinski Livingstone and suzu have reached their Reckoning only then can we recover and I remember being intimidated by this takes like I didn't want to admit that that's true but because I thought that it was such a crazy Hill to climb and here we are not just just over halfway through 2023. Quan is in jail in Montenegro waiting to be extradited to the United States Sam bankman freed is under house arrest I can only assume he's going to jail machinsky's going to jail suzu and Kyle Davies are still on the run but they are completely ostracized from the West they can't step anywhere outside of Dubai or else otherwise they would be arrested so that box is not yet checked however with all the other boxes checked and the complete fall from grace that is through your capital and probably the very likely cases and efforts going into actually grabbing those guys is probably going on behind the scenes that we don't know about I say that we have permission to be bullish I say those boxes are checked look it's um it really I think I think it showcases the value of the bear Market as well I mean if prices didn't go down and we didn't see the collapse that that we saw if we just continued to go kind of straight up then uh all these frauds would still be here in this industry and we'd have that toxic cancer inside of the body and not even know it I mean some of some people would know it but like it wouldn't be obvious this is the value yeah they'd be them minority we saw the same thing in in 2019 too um all of the all the ideas were tested we had a whole bunch of icos that were just like raising ungodly amounts of money for what like slides white papers remember it was the white paper season white paper raised 50 million dollars in a token and then just like exit scan basically all of that was lifted during the bear Market of 2019. uh 20 2018 2019 so we need these purges um I this is the reason for Bear markets and uh why I'm glad that I've been thankful that we have them uh David a ripple case we talked about this at the outset of last week's roll up so of course xrp a judge ruled in the U.S that xrp itself isn't a security according to the court we talked about this including uh we had Mike selig on the episode maybe we should just recap this for folks because you weren't here and then I'd uh I'd love to get your takes on this um in terms of like catching up and what you think about it so what happened last week that was so momentous yeah so last week that's course case came out finally we knew it was coming but we didn't know the specific dates and then it finally comes out and the tldr of the case is that it's both a win and a loss for both the SEC and ripple both sides won and loss depending on which part of the case that we're talking about so Mike Selleck who says it's a massive win by the Ripple team against the SEC where judge Torres clearly affirms that the view that these same crypto asset may be sold in an investment contract as a standalone good so what he's saying is there's a line being drawn here and is it it's a line that is so elegant to me and it actually really like it restores my faith in the court system to actually methodically and clearly and thoughtfully come to the correct conclusion so we have sold as an investment contract and then later sold as a standalone good and those are two different things and this is why I think this is so elegant the SEC is charging Ripple and Ripple's loss here is that they are being charged with selling an investment contract of SRP to certain large institutions under the premise that later there because of the efforts of Ripple they will be able to sell those tokens to retail for after price appreciation that was a security that was a legal Securities offering that was an investment contract the actual xrp that is sold later to retail is not a security so retail did not buy a security a security was not sold it was a standalone good so Ripple who I think you and I would say is like I do not agree with the strategy and ethics perhaps of Ripple as a product and they got charged for what I think you and I would agree on is what they ought to have gotten charged for which is quote unquote dumping on retail they just did it with these institutional security sales primarily the primary sales of xrp which was an investment contract but then it's a huge win for crypto because xrp is not a security when retail the interested retail parties permissionlessly bought that xrp token of their own volition of their own accord so the bad guys got got for the right reasons and crypto got protected also for the right reasons and the actor and ripple has to pay fines for all of their legal Securities offerings and Gary Gensler has to put his tail between his legs and we as an industry get to say that all of our crypto assets on secondary sales of programmatic D5 exchanges and also crypto exchanges are not Securities I think it's a three for three Ripple goes down and has to pay fees for the things that they did are bad and the sins that they've had and Gary Gensler has to you know put his tail between his legs and be like Oh I got beat by Ripple and crypto gets to go free saying like none of our things are securities anymore it's like three for three dude it's perfect yeah I I think that um I mean some would argue that well you know let's say let's assume that Ripple and xrp is actually selling a vapor of course right so they could continue selling those tokens to the public as long as it's not in an investment contract and in fact they did do that um you know and and that act in itself was not a security and some people would look at that and say well that's a net bad David right because they there's not much of a product here it's overvalued these assets aren't worth what people think that they're worth uh and so they're selling it I don't really have a strong comment on that what I'm most excited about is the um refutation that uh you know of Gary Gensler and the SEC regimes their claim that all crypto assets all tokens are securities that's what they said that quite plainly is not true and cannot hold right and so that's what was most strongly refuted in this particular case that that very strong posture of all tokens are securities and there therefore must be regulated by the SEC this was a massive pushback against that so yeah I'm it's it's super it's I'm very pleased with the outcome of this particular case um there's some takes back and forth about this but one of the takes was from Gary Gensler he responded to the Ripple decision uh his take was he's disappointed over the treatment of retail investors hey look guys I was just trying to protect retail this whole time um I don't see that I see most of retail being very excited like the actual crypto investors being very excited about this particular ruling so I'm not sure who Gary Gensler claims to represent on the retail crypto investing side but he's just sad for retail uh the true losers over this outcome lots of taking Gary gunzer knows a single retail investor I think he's saying like oh yeah the retail investor whispered in my ear that they're disappointed I'm like well Gary the retail investors whispered in my ear that they're super happy so actually I think retail investors are celebrating yeah yeah I am and by the way it's not my like it's not my opinion that we need no protection for retail investors in this whole like to the extent there are centralized you know parties then um of course we need protection I mean we're just celebrating outsmashinsky and SPF it was a centralized service that regulators and uh enforcers of the law are actually Prosecuting and we want that like go go after the scammers it's just that when the SEC is taking a posture to like completely kill innovation in the space and um basically take the posture that all tokens are securities that's just like unworkable of course they're not all Securities right and so that's what I'm I'm celebrating uh mostly here um here's a comment from Jake turbinsky that I thought was um pretty good some Financial journalists I don't know if you've caught up on this but Matt Levine for instance a Bloomberg wrote a post about this uh you know saying that there's still a lot of confusion this is what Jay is replying to some folks read Financial journalists are still confused about the Ripple decision the key holding is that investment contract analysis must focus on transactions not assets tokens are not Securities transactions in tokens Can Be depending on the facts and circumstances he goes on this is a critical distinction that the industry has made and the SEC has ignored for years the fact that a federal district court has explicitly acknowledged its validity its Monumental shift in U.S crypto regulation and a forceful rejection of the sec's theory of law it's particularly important for the sec's ongoing cases against exchanges that list tokens for trading like coinbase although the court didn't directly say trades on Exchange order books aren't security transactions it's extremely hard to read the decision any other way of course we saw many of the exchanges including coinbase re-enable trading for xrp on the back of this right how crazy is that xrp is once again trading on coinbase it's been so long it's been like two years so you think this is all permission to be bullish uh maybe this I think discounts as two actually this is there's two reasons to be bullish here permission okay reasons that you can have permission to be bullish one what are they is that all of the fud and negativity and fear out of how all of our assets our Securities is gone and that was that was a decent amount of cell pressure over the last like year or so the the regulatory oversight of Gary Gunter is going to label everything as a security so that's gone and then this this that's the first of two here's the second one so the this is the take from Collins Belton he's a lawyer that we've had on the show before he goes in the long term absent rulemaking or new laws there will be an explosion of token sales and distributions similar to what happened in 2019 he's referencing D5 summer after people's fear of the 2018 Crackdown resided D5 summer may look quaint in comparison we've did that episode right about the history of crypto bull markets and what was the common denominator of all crypto bull markets is there were appetites for tokens people were hungry for tokens tokens were on the menu and what Colin is saying is that because of this Clarity that we have we now have the room for an explosion of token or sales or distributions of such similar to what happened in 2019 the precursor to DFI summer after people's fear of the 2018 Ico Crackdown resided D5 summer may look quaint in comparison there's two reasons why you have permission to be bullish we're at three three total is that three so far no four with the yes four we got four we're at four okay well let me ask you so uh bullish prices that kind of thing I get that all right so when I hear where it's like a defy summary may look quaint in comparison um nice I'm worried that we're not ready for that I'll give you some more time personally okay but obviously the posture of all tokens are securities like that's bad I reject that but are we ready for an explosion of tokens right like are we smart enough as an industry and like will we put in kind of I I don't I'm just worried about stupid fomo season coming back and I remember how much I hated it in uh 2021 when everything was going off the rails in the same way I hated it in 2017 when it was just Animal Spirits like are we ready for this level of responsibility it does feel a little bit too soon but I don't think I it might just be happening either way they kind of felt like the bull market for me ended sooner than I expected it to I kind of expected it to have six more months in it than it actually did I think these I think it's fair to say that crypto Cycles are moving faster because information is per moving faster and we understand Cycles faster now so the bear Market ended before you thought it would but maybe all right the bull market ended before you thought it would but the bear Market is maybe anything then you thought it might do the same yeah I mean again the theme of this episode is we have permission to be bullish we're at four we have there's more there's more in here we got more definitely seeing signs I'm definitely seeing signs okay here's another one uniswap labs they launched an aggregator for Dex liquidity it's called uniswap X I know you did an entire episode on this what's the tldr for the Roll-Up the tldr unit swap X pairs with the unit swap amm so you have unit swap one vs one through four unit swap X pairs with those if you understand what Cal swap is basically start there unit swap X is pretty similar to Cal swap it is a order option swap right yes it's a Dutch auction that allows for Market competitiveness in order for filament so you can come to uniswap X and say hey I have this token I want that token and with this Dutch auction mechanism with off-chain order routing so instead of making a transaction on ethereum you just sign a message and broadcast that freely say hey whoever wants to fill this order can do that so you actually don't pay for gas because you are not making a transaction the cost of the transaction comes out of the trade so you don't pay for ether so you can swap you can just broadcast a transfer that says hey I have 500 usdc I would like to swap it for die and then the market will give you the best offer the free market will come and compete for the best offer to to give you as much die as possible and the gas will come out of that trade so actually you don't have to touch ether there's a bunch of other benefits as well in the long term this is not what's happening today but in the long term you will be able to say hey I have 500 uscc I would like as much die as possible on this particular layer too I'd like it on optimism or arbitrum or polygon or ZK sync and because it's you know off-chain order routing whoever service provider wants to just deliver you your desired crypto assets on your desired change so long as there is a bridge to provide a proof that the actual assets were delivered back to wherever the originating order came from so long as that's there it's it's it's Bridge minimalism because instead of sending assets over Bridges you are only sending a proof over Bridges and then off chain third-party service providers just fulfill your order for you I think it's really cool it seems to be to me the yin to the Yang of uniswap amms to unit swap X so this is a another layer in this stack of swap that I think really completes the vision and there's a fee switch swap X yes so that's an interesting tidbit of information there this this unit swap X is uh not generally available but it's uh open to an opt-in beta right now so I definitely plan on trying it um I it's really interesting David so like uh I love what you're saying about basically the ux is going to be much more seamless so you just signed a transaction we're not talking about gas fees really cheap uh trade I can I can see this being Incorporated in while it's everywhere I can see it being really good for for end users that said I'm a little bit worried about this function being pushed off chain this this third party does this introduce another kind of trusted intermediary into the system and I want to listen to the um episode that you did with Hayden Adams and explore this a little bit but um I haven't listened to that yet David so but I I did see this pushback on Twitter from D5 guy very deep in uniswap X docs behind the public messaging of a permissionless protocol is a completely centralized permission opaque off-chain RFQ system let's take a look RFQ is a request for quote right by the way so don't have time to get into this uh entire thread but basically the charges we're pushing some things off chain and this is a centralization vector and this is concerning and people should be concerned because it's a departure from a permissionless protocol I don't know what the response is to this kind of question or concern it's something I want to uh look look into in some more details do you have any hot takes on this yeah if I understand you still have X correctly again I would need Hayden to really be able to to drive this point home but the idea is that you broadcast hey I have this much of one token give me as many of the tokens that I want in the place that I want and then the free market competes to service provide for that so it's a third party service provider but that being a third-party service provider is permissionless so anyone could be that there's not one canonical third-party service provider it's the free market and when when the free market is competing that is decentralization in my mind I would also I need to go through this there's something I understand what this guy's talking about it feels like there's an analog to like Builders and Searchers in ethereum very much and it's just kind of like brain breaking like it took me a while to sort of understand Builders and Searchers and to understand what the points of centralization would be in that new function and whether that is sufficiently mitigated by the protocol to justify or not a conclusion for ethereum was like yes but if you for a while permissionless in the fullness of time the answer is yes if we stopped halfway short of the proposer Builder separation progress it would have become Central well I was concerned I was very concerned about proposer Builder separation going in because I like the idea of Builders and Searchers being sort of the decentralized groups it was like okay but how are we maintaining centralization and the key is like the validators are still kind of in control of the network right and you still have Fork choice anyway it might be a similar Dynamic working here but the first thing you should do bankless listeners go check out the episode that David has already published with Hayden Adams on uniswap X the first of my three eth CC interviews those three podcast ones here what else you got who else you might do a fourth tomorrow um one is with Jesse Pollock from bass and the other is oh my God it was so good Ryan you're gonna nerd the F out when you listen to it Justin Drake and Tim Baco the Sci-Fi roadmap for ethereum oh geez all right see I don't have to go to conferences and you bring the best content back thank you that's right that's what I do baby uh we got a lot more reasons to be bullish because you have permission to be bullish this week David what's coming up next polygon is about to upgrade the Matic token we're finally converging the discrepancy between the Matic token and the polygon networks those are two different words but that's actually the most insignificant part of the upgrade it's just the part that I thought was funny uh so we're going to talk about all the polygon Network upgrade token economic upgrades as well in addition to that a layer one is about to become a layer two is the bankless thesis finally coming true I told you what do you mean finally what do you mean finally come on they got a bankless layer two thesis is finally playing out let me be more specific uh ZK syncs got a brand new prover it's pretty it's pretty groundbreaking we're going to talk about why and what that means all of this and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible since this theme is you have permission to be bullish make sure that your portfolio is ready for the bull market metados portfolio can help there is a

assets and start building your first app on arbitrum a layer 1 wants to become an ethereum layer 2. this has been a long oh yeah I love those words can you say that again a layer one wants to become an ethereum Layer Two this has been a long-held I think bankless prediction many roll-up Bulls like plenya have predicted this for a while too and here's the first proposal of its kind that we've seen a proposal for Sello to transition to an ethereum Layer Two David what is cello and what is this proposal call for yeah cello is a it's always been a layer one blockchain uh fun fact it's actually the only layer non-etherium layer one that we've accepted as a sponsor of bankless uh why did we do that they are focused on public goods regenerative finance that whole movement blockchain for good uh and so they are working on adoption in third world countries uh just a lot of just making sure the long tail of of uh the globe gets at gets access to blockchain services so we've always enjoyed what cell has done and it's always seemed to me Ryan that they've used the blockchain as a means to an end to provide public good services to the world like and this so this is why this makes so much sense for cello to become an ethereum Layer Two is because they want to use crypto for the regenerative Finance movement and they've just been using a blockchain to get that done now they are saying like hey we actually can achieve our mission better if we become an ethereum layer too so they have submitted a proposal has permitted a proposal to its own governance Community to transition into an ethereum layer too so they are proposing to become an OP stack to help seller developers utilize all of the ethereum tools and libraries out there because in the op stack is basically ethereum they want to use off-chain data availability using eigenlayer data availability so eigenlayers got this supporting da services for them and then also end users of cello if you are a transactor of cello use the applications of cello we refer anywhere and the the vast apps that that sell does really actually truly have uh then you would not be affected it would be a seamless upgrade for you so I think this makes sense this is exactly what we've been predicting for a long while um I think this is the first of many I was talking to one of my friends here at ECC uh we were talking about cello actually don't remember this but apparently I told her that I think Stella will become a layer two eventually and I told her that about like six months ago and she goes she went up to me today you know six months later or yesterday and she goes did you know something when you said that sells become a layer too and I'm like I don't even remember saying that in the first place did you notice species play out the bankless Theses always work not always we you know but like greater than 50 percent haven't worked not none of the big things I don't think and you know the ones that haven't worked were just like oh just wait just wait a while you know the the timing's uh not not right on for that but we did get D5 right ethereum right yeah um okay so I guess one of my questions is are we going to see this with other layer ones right is Avalanche is Solana are they going to become a layer two and like my take on this is uh the reason a layer one becomes a layer two is kind of for three reasons right it's tribe it's Network and it's economics it's these three reasons and there's various waiting but let's roughly assign them a third or third to third one is there is some tribal affiliation right if you switch uh from One Tribe and now you're a team ethereum right you get some love and a support for or say the ethereum tribe that can be a motivating reason to do this or it's kind of marketing that sort of thing we're talking about it on the roll up it's that sort of thing right the second is network and that's the thing that has been lacking before but is now present in sort of the super chain they already have the network effect of the evm but when you become an optimism participant in kind of the optimism ecosystem as a part of all of the other layer twos that are developing on top of ethereum you get plugged into a network and you get some beneficial Network effects of interoperability right it's just connected to this ecosystem that I think is a driver for for solo and others and the third I would say is economics all right rather than issuing token which is a cost to the Sello business to pay for security a layer two doesn't have to do that all right it's much cheaper to maintain your security as a layer too the the analog here is this is why the state of Tennessee doesn't have its own own private military right it gets that from the federal government all right and it's much more efficient uh to get that cost that security cost from the feds than it is to create like a state military force of course it just makes sense and so a seller doesn't have to pay that security budget so it's those three things it's tribe it's network uh and then it's economics and I don't know what other layer twos these three forces will come into play with but I don't think cello will be the last layer one that makes the switch yeah my next prediction for my next for my next trick uh I think you're going to see cello and many cello apps participating in optimism's retroactive public goods funding so you're going to see op tokens being distributed to the cello ecosystem and so it's what do networks do they are basically the the local governments for their domain and they need to provide services and one of the big polls of optimism is being part of the retroactive public goods funding and so if a lot of the cell of ecosystem can get funding from optimism that is just a huge service that optimism can provide solo all of these Layer Two ecosystems will be competing for chains won't they um speaking of which here's another layer 2 base this is from coinbase mainnet now open for Builders David what's this announcement yeah so base mainnet is here this is mainnet it's open for Builders so the going back to the theme park ride which is really to the test of time the base Theme Park is open the real estate is open for ride builders for ride operators so if you would like to go build a ride on the base theme park for the inevitable flood of people going into the theme park which is cough happening in August uh then now is the time so mainnet open for Builders uh one of the interviews like I said Jesse Pollock of Base I talked to him for 40 minutes all about this and all the other like Layer Two manias that are coming Layer Two Season that we that we talked about um and also just his collaboration with optimism and all of this uh so base may not open for Builders uh mainnet actual mainnet coming early August I can't say the date I actually don't know the date I do another day actually uh but you can watch the interview that I do it might be out by the time you listen to this episode or it'll be out soon TM guys did we mention the base in base stands for coinbase this is coinbase's Layer Two attempt is in case you forgot oh yes this is uh one of the one another reason to you have permission to be bullish oh coinbase the layer two Mania the layer two summer like you would be excused if you made bets that this would be coming base coinbase flooding in users into the layer 2 ecosystem we have public goods I'm I'm just gonna at this point just listen to the episode with Jesse we talk about this but layer twos and provide in public goods and onboarding users onto chains and coinbase leading that charge is going to be a huge legitimizing factor for the industry uh base spearheading layer two summer Layer Two Mania I think is permission to be bullish it's a big one you've got a what 110 million or so users on coinbase that could be converted over yeah it's absolutely massive ZK sync announced its new prover it's called bojem what is thisum it's DK syncs era new high performance proof system so why do we love ZK Roll-Ups because of proofs because of the ZK uh you don't have to have that seven day wait period for fraud proofs from optimistic rollups you have just the proof that cryptography gets you the problem and the vector that all these ZK layer two teams are competing on is the efficiency and of their ZK circuit how manageable is actually producing that proof this is the thing that polygon scroll Z case Inc are all competing on is how solid can you get your proof your ZK proof system and so bujam is ZK thinks era's new high performance proof system it used to the average prover is they are saying needs about 500 gigabytes of Hardware on a GPU on a consumer grade piece of Hardware 500 gigabytes if if it is a GPU I think it is a GPU to make a proof 500 gigabytes is insane my gaming computer I've got a gaming computer it's got 16 gigabytes on its GPU uh the boojim requires eight which are not so low it's not so low like some GPS but they're kind of like the low end ones that need to be upgraded modern gpus 8 to 16 gigabytes I really hope that it's gpus I'm pretty sure that's true um but if if boot jump can be proved with just eight gigabytes of Hardware what does that mean that means if you have a GPU with eight gigabytes of memory in in it you can produce a bujum proof for zksync era you can run a ZK sync uh you can produce a proof why do we like this because it means you only need one prover to work whereas ethereum proof of sake needs two-thirds ZK Roll-Ups need one you need one prover to produce a proof that could be you if you have an eight gigabyte GPU and so that's why that that's and so this is it's it's taking the ZK stack that I'm so excited about and making it real small real manageable so that it can permeate into the internet which is again when I say the ZK stands back on here at the internet more Layer Two stuff going on polygon is upgrading its Matic token to something called pole so there are some big changes in the uh the the polematic ecosystem this is like a token Improvement I would say maybe an economic Improvement but the tldr is this one pull token is now going to power all of the chains so that's polygon supernets polygon ZK evm even the polygon ZK evm validium of course it already Powers the proof of stake change and they're chain and they're going through a Rebrand of it so no longer will it be called Matic it will be called Paul Pol is it Paul or pole I don't know one of those two things why isn't it Paulie is the better question I'm sure Paul what are they doing do you remember wasn't there like wasn't there a company or a project called polymath or something it was a security experience issuance platform yeah you remember this yeah I was in that security token as well back then they're totally relevant yeah it's permission to take I can't actually submit a governance proposal to change from Pole to poly because I'm a U.S citizen I think I think that's true actually wait really but Paul come on Paulie okay yeah no I I think I'm pretty sure that's true um but okay but uh more serious note not semantics one of the big critiques of polygon is like it's not a roll-up it's just a proof of stake side chain and there's no like it doesn't inherit the security of ethereum blah blah blah I think the the very important thing to emphasize is that you have the Matic token which is the proof of stake token for the current polygon proof of sake Network now you have the Paul token which is the actual validating token for every single Network actual fees all the networks the many networks of that is part of the whole polygon ecosystem they're calling this a third generation because first generation they were calling it Bitcoin second generation is eth for the ethereum network and third generation is Paul for the you know Paulie number of networks that's a that's a good pun I think the Paulie networks of polygon oh that's why they call it polygon oh I get it uh holders can become value so if you own hold Paul you can now become a valiator you can get the transaction fee so all of the many many networks that makes up polygon one token many networks yeah I think I I like what they're doing here so Matic holders this is a one-to-one upgrade so mad at the poll is a one-to-one upgrade right notice what they didn't do so what they didn't do was make it like a different ratio and ten to one token split yeah or even deeper inflate polygon is pretty cheap it's like 50 60 seconds or something they did so so but yes but they didn't kind of um I guess kill or Nerf existing Matic holders which is good they also didn't do a thing that they could have done I suppose would just create tokens for all of these chains right so I feel like this is a good move it's a um a long-term game type of thing so the initial Supply will be 10 billion dollars same asmatic now I will say that there is some issuance that has been added so there's a 2 percent yearly emission of poll tokens on top of this whereas Matic was fixed somatic was fixed at 10 billion with Paul there's going to be uh some issuance so there was some issuance added on the back of this one percent goes to validated rewards one percent to community treasury which of course pays for critical development uh all in all you know I think this is a pretty pretty good move for and most Matic holders that I've seen have been pretty excited and about this and of course you can not only use Paul for uh staking inside of proof of stake in the future but you'll also be able to use it in you know other other roles that Roll-Ups present say maybe sequencers that that kind of thing so um and just as a reminder before we move on Ryan is an advisor to polygon and Ryan and I are both advisors to both ZK sync and optimism turns out we like layer twos Dave you remember this guy from the uh a show called The OC back in the 2000s not at all okay well this guy was a pretty big deal back in the day some bankers teenage heartthrob type yeah that's totally what he was uh Ben McKenzie is his name former star of the OC so I woke up on Monday and suddenly here's Ben McKenzie and he's at war with crypto all right I did not expect this guy uh from the past he hasn't done a lot of acting since his uh this is who they're sending this is they're sending David uh the context is yes Ben McKinsey former OC Stars published a book this week on how all crypto is a scam and that really is the uh the conclusion of the book so his story is he discovered crypto in 2021 he invested in quotes uh 250k in it don't know what he bought but uh he indicates that he lost almost all of it if not all of it um proceeded to talk to the um the the crypto people of course which include machinsky SBF Justin Sun you know the best representatives of the crew he was talking he was hanging out with them that's who he was how did he find investigating talking to right those you didn't talk to the metallics of the world he didn't you know talk to anybody and talk to us he didn't look up our guest list and talk to you know Hester Personnel we didn't talk to any of those I bet you he doesn't even know what bankless is yeah and so he drew a whole first mistake well I don't know like I think he does I it almost feels at this point like he is purposely ignoring that in order to uh to send a contrary message which is all of crypto is a scam uh because they're scammers in the industry obviously all crypto is a scam so here he is he's doing the media circuit tour I'm gonna play this clip you ready oh God you dug in and yet you admit you still didn't get it it's it I don't do it either it's not rude it's not it's not a thing it's right like if you buy a stock it represents a company if you buy a bond you've got debt on tangibility yes right you invest in Grain Futures like there is a farm somewhere making grain like what is crypto actually rooted in or on nothing it's a story I mean these are bits of computer code that are uncorrelated with any real world asset to your point if they're an investment that's so bullish that's what I'm here for the reason that I use the word Ponzi scheme in front of the Senate is that an investment scheme without value is a Ponzi scheme I mean that's the definition and Ponzi schemes are regulated by this PS Exchange Commission so in my opinion the cryptocurrency industry does represent the largest Ponzi scheme in history there is I I could play more but that's about the summary so bankless Nation this is who you're up against when you're training it's so bad yeah well you know what to me why is this significant to me it just it kind of represents a bottom signal for me right it's just like now this person is coming out with a book on how all crypto is a scam and the conclusion and just this is on uh CBS Morning like this um the show host is like I don't understand this crypto thing it's not backed by anything real it's not backed it's not like wheat it's not like uh you know a security it's not like Equity or anything else I think that do we not live on the internet in this modern era like what do they think this is I'm very excited to take the counter trade here because this makes me bullish this is the good idea that I'm like this is all right against this is okay permission to be bullish this clip makeless Nation it's your permission to be bullish right now this is the bottom signal of bottom signals they're just handing to this uh handing this to us on a platter they have Ben McKinsey in the whole like Fiat font at the top of the banner oh my god dude yes I think we're doing this mistake and put him on on talk to the Senate Chief I can't believe you talk to the Senate yeah yeah anyway the OC uh actor is coming out hard against crypto and that is the ultimate box I'm shaking in my boots in politics I don't know if you've noticed this David but um Robert Kennedy Jr Robert F RFK um he's been taking some very Pro crypto stances last week just earlier this week David he he vowed to back the dollar with Bitcoin all right not a lot just under one percent very very small he said perhaps of one percent of issued T bills by Bitcoin and other hard currencies like gold silver and platinum he also not one percent is Bitcoin one percent is hard currencies like including Bitcoin or Bitcoin okay yes uh very Pro Bitcoin stance um he said is a mistake for the US government to hobble the industry and drive Innovation else where uh his uh Biden's 30 tax on cryptocurrency mining is a bad idea he also wants to remove capital gains from Bitcoin I'm assuming in smaller amounts right so probably not large Investments of you know millions of dollars but like if I send Bitcoin uh you know to pay for something pay for my Starbucks that's a capital gain on my Bitcoin potentially if it's gone up for paying for a cup of coffee other currencies aren't treated that way so he brings a lot of points um to bear and is definitely taking a crypto posture regardless what you think of uh any of his other politics which of course many people have complaints about or different opinions on Ron DeSantis as well um he is coming out hard against the Central Bank digital currency he says this of C bdc's he says this of cbdc's they want to get rid of cash they want no cryptocurrency they want this to be the sole form of legal tender it will allow them to prohibit undesirable purchases like Fuel and ammunition so the minute you give them power to do this they will impose a social credit system on the country cbdc is a massive threat to American Liberty what's interesting about this is politics aside it seems like all politicians are now in this presidential race having to weigh in on crypto and I haven't heard Biden weigh in in a big way I haven't heard Trump weigh in recently in a big way but this is elevated in 2023 2024 to kind of national level of conversation and that is quite a departure from the previous uh crypto cycle do you have any takes on this my take is that everyone's got to take about crypto and I think that's really just the summary it's it's it's now mainstream in politics and so it we have risen to that level like you can't everyone's good like you're gonna be running for some office somewhere and then one day you will be asked hey what's your take on crypto that's just it's that that's where we are 100 uh another maybe permission to be bullish that it's elevated to the the national conversation here uh this is not permission to be bullish is all the others well this this one is not strong at all binance cutting back employee benefits uh citing decline in profit apparently binance um cut a thousand workers this week um CZ had a response CC said that was fun he said that it was there were layoffs but it wasn't a thousand four is it one of the four fud things it's a four yeah I don't know what to think about all that but you know uh CZ as we continuously strive to increase Talent density there will be involuntary terminations this happens in every company the numbers reported by the media are way off it's just fun process all right there you go update from gnosis safe this is a gnosis pay see that little Visa card that knows this pay Visa card that you see on your screen I see you so I actually talked to some of the nurses team at zuzalo about how this works when you run your that credit card the magnet induces enough of an Impulse of electricity for that chip inside the card to make a private key transaction trans signature so there's a private key in that Visa card and just scanning it makes a transaction happen it makes it what yep yep there's a private key in that Visa card and it runs on top of gnosis chain and so we have gnosis pay and gnosis card running on top of gnosis chain bankless system uh and payment system along with your Vault NOS is safe so like gnosis chain noses pay notice card noses safe I think there's a few others as well it's a pretty impressive vertical but the news here is that nose if pay is out no says chain that's a like a side chain on ethereum I love gnosis safe I will say that best multisig I've used uh it's absolutely fantastic really cool to see this it says an announcement out of ECC espresso announcing an ecosystem partnership with eigenlayer collaborating to bring restaking to the espresso sequencer Network this is one of the things I was referencing earlier with the rubber hitting the pavement about very hard problems as everyone's getting really excited about espresso sequencing and shared sequencing and just overall the growing infrastructure around wait what is this one of the big problems about all these layer 2 networks and the fractal super chain fractal scaling hyper chains and all of and and then all the restaking eigenlayer chains is there's a lot of parallelization going on between all these chains like there's 10 there's going to be ten thousand op stack chains how are we going to parallelize and then combine all the transactions we do that with sequencing espresso systems is attacking tackling this problem headed on and they're doing it alongside of eigen layer it sounds like this is a rabbit hole that I think we actually really haven't explored yet I think I think we should we should probably do an episode on sequencing so uh call to action for who is the best sequencer guest might be torgel from scroll yeah I just have him on I I feel like I need to school up because most sequencers right now are run by kind of internal teams like arbitrum runs their secret sequencer optimism runs its sequencer but this can't be the state moving forward so yeah I would love an update on that um very cool to see David we got more coming up including questions from the nation some hot takes from crypto Twitter as well stay tuned we'll be right back at you but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible introducing polygon 2.0 the value layer for the internet for too long the limitations of blockchains have held back app development and stifled user adoption the internet allows anyone to create and exchange information what's missing is a value layer that lets anyone Exchange store and program value that's where polygon 2.0 comes in polygon Labs has unveiled a series of innovations that will radically alter the polygon ecosystem and web3 as a whole by leveraging in groundbreaking ZK Innovations such as polygon ZK evm the next iteration of the Best in Class plonky2 proving system and a first of its kind ZK powered interoperability layer polygon 2.0 will give users and devs unlimited scalability and unified liquidity right now there is a polygon Improvement proposal regarding a potential ZK powered upgrade of polygon proof of stake if approved polygon proof of stake would become a layer 2 zkevm validium so make your voice heard on this proposal by joining the polygon Discord today you have a chance to help the polygon Community give the internet the value layer it deserves are you planning

world of token compliance go to toku.com bank list or click the link in the description below question from bankless citizen Kyle Kaplan this week so if optimism switches from optimistic fraud proofs to ZK proofs and chooses the ZK sync prover we're just talking about that will it reduce the need to bridge between the networks and would that make it a hyper super chain I think this is a great question it's kind of a question that I've had in my mind as well alright so part of My worry is we create all of these Island ecosystems we have you know the ZK era ecosystem we have the optimism arbitrum ecosystem polygon they're all kind of separate ecosystems and be really nice if we had some standardization in a way to kind of easily bridge between them or we shared some security assumptions or shared some ux or something good could come of that I think that's what Kyle is asking about in this question will it reduce the need to bridge between networks what's your what's your answer to that David I think Kyle's tapping into my Fascination about Stacks lately so we've had the op stack for a while the ZK stack is brand new and I like when I was talking about the CK stack I used to talk about what is the ZK stack it is CK syncs ZK circuit emphasis like like concentrated put into a small little package and I think what Kyle is saying is oh a small little package you mean like a module and how the op stack is like a module for Layer Two Chains can you take the zkc circuit and put it inside the op stack and the answer is yes and no uh it is theoretically possible to do that and things are progressing and forward in that specifically the ZK sync circuit is not evm compatible so the puzzle piece does not fit but I then this is coming from Ben Jones I had to ask Ben Jones to make sure I was getting this right he said it doesn't fit yet important Point yet so it is possible to to it is eventually possible to do that you could put the ZK sync circuit inside of the op stack it just needs to be made more evm compatible however oh one Labs of one Labs we saw this announcement not too long ago they are also building a ZK circuit for the op stack so there is competition from the ZK world to build the ZK circuit for the op stack because then whichever one becomes standard is is the one and so there is a competition here I like competition and also I want very much standardization right so one thing that is nice about it but yeah it's like competition and standardization is like and like you want a monopoly for standards don't you like HTTP is Monopoly it went the protocol of the internet right and this idea of a hyper super chain that Kyle is tapping into the question that's what we all want we don't want like all sorts of different stack chains here we want one hyper poly ZK op d r b stack oh my God I don't know if we can get that I don't know right so um so and by the way I I do think that if ethereum doesn't figure this out with with layer twos as bullish I as I am about kind of the modular thesis right and I'm very bullish on this I think this is the in its armor armor right where a monolithic chain a Solana for instance has an approach and they're like ux is seamless you get from here to here and it's easy we don't make you change any wallets you have to change your security posture assumptions the ux is just seamless and it's easy so it's really the modular um you know modular way to scale this really important that we figure out ux and get some standardization here um great question David we got some takes of the week here's a take from Antonio from dydx what's he say Antonio from dydx dydx of course was once a starkware-based stark uh X based layer two and then pivoted into being a Cosmos app chain and he says DUI DX was early in right on defy very true e early and right on purpose also very true early and right on ethereum layer twos and d and then he finishes and saying dydx will be early and right on apps chains 2. I don't know about that tank why I think he's totally right but my my follow-up question was um do you still like Cosmos app chains over Layer Two app change he's he's in his tweet he's talking about Cosmos app chains okay however I'm not clear and they have an independent layer one becoming a roll-up on Layer Two and you can do app change as roll apps on ethereum and I'm pretty sure he's not talking about that but it's interesting right so um I'm also very bullish on app chains but I'm much less bullish on app chains and why it's because it it kills the kind of the economic remember or we're talking about tribe Network and economics it kills that last leg of the stool there the economic argument you still have to pay for security don't you well they cost you weaker tribes because all of the ethereum layer twos are anchored by eth Cosmos app chains are not anchored by Cosmos Federation of city-states that's what the cosmos Vision has always been rather than kind of the Empire type model of ethereum uh so yeah he's taking a bet big bet big Builder bet on the Cosmos app chain ecosystem so I think I think he paper handed layer twos I think I think the uidx paper-handed and Tony is pretty smart man and he's a builder I don't know maybe he he sees something that um that others don't we'll have to see that's mine that's my take is that Antonio paper-handed layer juice well he's always been early sometimes like he was he was doing ab chains before app chains existed on ethereum let's say that right and then he stopped he was so early and he stopped uh we're rooting for you though Antonio and dying Antonio you're great by James killer yeah it's just a lot of I've I've heard a lot of conversation about tokens being Securities this week and I just think that's the wrong framing like why are we even asking that question okay tokens aren't Securities tokens are tokens David yeah like it's not that hard tokens Can Be money they can be memes they can be loyalty points they can be nfts they can be shares they can be coupons they can be ious they could be Commodities they'd be cons they could be whatever you want because anything that represents ownership can be expressed as a token what are we doing what is ethereum a property rights system in which you can express ownership of a scarce unit on the internet ownership of anything that scarce ownership scarcity that's what we're doing with tokens right so when the SEC or anybody analyzes tokens under the Securities framework or that rubric it's like why are we even talking about this it's so like we're not thinking about first principles and that's why I feel like our regulators and our lawmakers are doing this stupid thing where they're they're Pidgey they're either pigeonholing crypto into Securities into something it's not that's limiting right or they're nannying us into you a list of thou shalts Thou shalt not with tokens and it's really stupid the one thing they could be doing that would actually be helpful for us is disclosures remember like that's what the SEC is set up to do it's a disclosures based institution not a merit-based they don't get to decide what investors buy right that's beyond like that they're not supposed to do that they have to help with disclosures right so you can see what a company's financials are so they're fired filed quarterly they maintain a bad a database called uh Edgar which lists all of this disclosure information about companies they require the file so what can Regulators do they can help the public know what it's buying we have a lot of public data on chain they can maximize I would love the SEC or the cftc to create Dune boards that would be a start wouldn't that be a prototype like wouldn't that be that's too productive of them we got the disclosure information and we can even as a crypto industry team up with them and help we got Builders like one thing that our Regulators can do and our lawmakers can do is they can help with the coordination problem they can help solve moloch and they can just be like hey here's a list of 15 things that we think um should be encompassed in a you know a protocol and here's where we're going to organize everything on this set of like Dune boards let's say for instance but so I don't understand why this is so difficult and the the constant um back and forth about you know tokens are they Securities or not it's just totally missing the point I just wish our Governors the people running things our regulators and our lawmakers would actually do their jobs and use their brains and govern because that's all that's what we need here anyway I think I got triggered because I was reading some other Financial analysts opinion on whether tokens are securities or not and I'm just like bubbling up to that's not even the right question to ask what of course there's a lack of imagination if you're trying to say yes it's because like you're trying to take this new thing and categorize it and pigeonhole it into this old thing it's the same conversation as like is ether a capital asset is it a commodity asset what is it no it's something net new it is a new thing it doesn't fit into the old things it's kind of like the old things but it's a new thing the answer to the question is almost like we'll see you know what I mean like like we just have to see where the use cases bring us uh David let's end with this what do you bullish on this week I am bullish on this is uh the last of my ammo of you have permission to be bullish okay does this graphic make sense okay let me get my bearings here I'm looking at uh eth over the dollar this is a chart we're looking at a log eth chart from 2020 halfway through 2020 to now okay and I'm seeing some uh bars and I'm seeing like kind of two two sets here some candles here two sets here so well yeah what am I what am I looking at flipped you just copied and pasted and you flipped the the bull market and swap that in for the bear Market yes yes so I cut the the part the bull market is in the blue box and I've copied and pasted that and I've flipped it so the bull market is now upside down and then I've shifted that over to the bear Market I've lined it up over the bear market and what what am I doing here the bull market of 2021 the bull market of old had two tops May of 2021 we had that blow off top uh I can oh I don't I can't point to it because I don't have the cursor you can uh you so the 2020 may have uh yeah that was a top and then we also had the November 2021 also that top is a double top oh here he is the bear Market had a double bottom it had the Thrills Capital liquidation right after the Terra Luna uh crash about a year that was the bottom number one and then we had the FTX insolvency which was number two and so I have Loosely lined up the double top of the bull market with a double bottom of the bear Mark kit and they kind of line up and what I'm saying is like okay if the and I flipped it around the reason why it's upside down is that now the double top of the bear the bull market falls into the into the bear Market but the double bottom of the bull market the point is it's about the same amount of time we are here and so you have permission to be bullish because the bull market and the bear Market are about right now the same length we could we could get a few more weeks or months why do they have to be the same length though just because it because of human psychology at some time we're done being bearish and I think that people have bare fatigue and the Bulls have room to take over they have there's enough evidence there's enough permission for them to take over and be like you know what bears get the F out of here we're done with you we're buying We're not gonna let the s p rally so hard without yeah right I'm gonna hit the buy button I'm gonna do it f you get out of here and so I'm saying you have permission to be bullish for the last time well that's a good bankless episode without some is this ta some ta at the end this is the craziest David Hoffman ta I have ever this is pretty crazy but you know what David I want to believe and all you're basically saying is hey human psychology plays out in the same way during a bull market it's just the inverse in a bear market right instead of hitting the sell button uh we we hit the buy button right that's all you're doing and you're just extrapolating that forward uh so we got two bottoms here uh just like we had two tops and uh now we can proceed into uh into a glorious bull market future permission to people what I'm very what I'm bullish on I'm just bullish that's great then all right where do you bullish on uh this week I'm bullish on staking that risk-free rate baby I was just looking at do you remember what I was taking last week I don't care I'm still bullish do you know um uh do you remember that episode we did a long time ago um and I've just been too busy today okay sorry the episode we did on how much eth it takes to retire crab market between like 100 and 300 or something that's what it is and it was a fun exercise to figure out how much like this is before the beacon chain launched and we're trying to calibrate the rewards and interests before we even knew about kind of Mev execution layer rewards and how big that would be we're trying to figure out how much eth how many validators you need to run to actually retire that whole exercise right anyway what's really fun is like staking we have a risk-free rate of return there is some amount of eth that you can acquire as a productive asset and stake it at a risk-free rate and then use the proceeds pay your taxes of course sell those proceeds and retire on that to me this is like the like fire for Millennials right um Financial Independence that whole kind of like strategy um so what am I bullish on staking stacking and staking eath has never second stake it's never it's never gotten boring to me that's still in my opinion ever since we started bankless that is still like the end game yeah you know what I mean like always has been you got D5 tokens you got Layer Two so you got all sorts of things out there but ultimately the uh denominator there the unit of account to me is still ether because it has this risk-free rate that um serves as a productive asset so yeah I'm staking on or I'm just taking I'm bullish on staking this week David and I'm bullish on people listening to bankless getting to some amount of eth where they can live off a portion of that semi-retire do have Bank list is about like Freedom too right and so it's a freedom technology you don't have to have an intermediary when you stake you stake on your own you can run your own node uh and then also having a cash flow to fund the things that you want to do um that to me is is pretty exciting and what we've been about since we we started this episode so I'm just returning that and being like hey you know a lot of the risk is boiled out of this and I'm personally ready to stake and uh yeah it's exciting we should go back to the episode and see what numbers we came up with back then with that calculator to see how on track we were with all this data that we had I think if I remember correctly it was something like 3.2 or 3.7 validators get you 3 60 000 a year of passive income uh under a 10K East Paradigm do you want to do that we should just do a redo of that episode and now that we have staking how much how much does it take to require I've got one more thing that I'm bullish on Ryan go for it if I'm allowed find a lot of two things yeah this is something that I know that you don't get to experience nearly as much as I do because I go to all the conferences um but I am always just like insanely humbled by all the people that come by and just say hey David also tell Ryan this thank you for what you do at bankless uh and maybe this is me patting myself on the back but I I'm I'll do it and I think you should too but it's something that is always the theme of every conference that I go to is people like I just find what you did so evaluate you do so valuable I've gotten to this I got a web free job because of you guys and because of the podcast I listen to it all the time uh and so thank for anyone who takes a moment out of their day could the conference to tell me that and I'll always pass it on to Ryan uh I'm bullish on the bank list Nation so just uh it's always pretty cool to talk to these people at conferences so I appreciate it that's really cool you don't get that kind of energy on the internet it gets a little toxic sometimes but in real life um real life is not like that Meme of the week David what are we looking at oh my god did you see this this is vitalik this is vitalik walking he looks like he has a uh skinny black T-shirt and blue shorts they look like they're playing Pokemon shorts you know the kid who's like I like shorts yeah it feels like those are the shorts yeah and then he's followed by what looks like a mob of people in suits and the Tweet is my entire net worth is in this man's hands uh the funny thing is when I was staying at this is this is at zuzalu the demand that you can see in the center behind metallic is Mickey he's the incoming prime minister of of Montenegro and the guy to his right our left is the president of Montenegro the security is for them it's like 200 feet ahead of them like that so it looks like they're close but the vitalik is it's not the Security's not vitalik also the apartments that I stayed in is like two rows of houses behind the apartments that you can see there that is funny so the security is for the president of Montenegro not kind of the you know that's amazing all right guys you're gonna really enjoy the Moment of Zen this week so make sure you don't skip it but uh David you got to give people I need some context for this what is the what is Pinky doll this is gonna be the hardest thing you've ever asked me okay so pinky doll is this tick tocker who there are animations on screen that people can pay money to make an animation pop-up and she's doing this thing where she's like a human bop it you know that you know the Bop It game like bop it yes uh slap it uh spin it like that thing again Millennials will know so like if you press one of these specific emojis and you have to pay money to do one emoji she reacts in a particular way uh this is not that this is people pay for this people pay yeah people pay for her to react in this particular way uh and she apparently she does it for like five hours straight and she's breaking in like hundreds of thousands of dollars anyways this is not that this is Gary Gensler superimposed upon her so this is what you were about to experience I'm so sorry banquilization thanks for explaining that uh guys I gotta end with risks and disclaimers of course it's pretty risky to stay till the end of a bankless a Moment of Zen of course but also gotta let you know crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot enjoy pinky doll as Gary Kinsler I'm so sorry good um polygon so good polygons so good balloon Ripple's so good give give balloon slurp polygons so good thank you Solana got me feeling like a queen thank you cardano avax avax avax ooh gang gang gang gang slurp Ripple's so good avax avac avac Evac avax avax thank you Udi slay meow meow hmm that was so good Solana pop amazing
