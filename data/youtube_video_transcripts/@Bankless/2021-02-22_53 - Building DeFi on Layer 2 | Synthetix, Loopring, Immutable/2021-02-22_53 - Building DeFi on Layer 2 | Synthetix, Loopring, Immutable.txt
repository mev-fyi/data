[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how you doing absolutely fantastic and much more knowledgeable after we just got done with this l2 implementers panel we brought on three different individuals who are all working on three different projects who are all implementing their application on a specific l2 so we brought on matt feinstone who works for business development at loopering justin moses the cto of synthetics and we also brought on robbie ferguson who is the co-founder behind immutable x which is a zk roll up based nft exchange and so the through line behind all three of these individuals is that they are working for a protocol that is building something on an l2 they are not an l2 they are building something on an l2 so there's an important important differentiator there and so we talked to them about what it's been like going through the research phase going through the building phase and where they are now and then also where the road map is ahead of them and i found it extremely informative and i'm sure the listeners will as well yeah absolutely so two things i want to say here the reason that this is top of mind and relevant is because uh ethereum gas fees are high and it needs to scale outside of what we call kind of mainnet manhattan into into uh into layer two which are these other chains that represent kind of like the suburbs as we've talked about before so this is a very topical issue right now that's that's really facing ethereum and what we think is d5 is going to have to completely re-architect itself into this layer two mode the other thing i wanted to say is if if you're kind of new to to layer two what we're talking about is layer two is basically a chain that is not on the ethereum main net but is secured by the ethereum main net this is different than a side chain which might integrate with ethereum but it's not secured by ethereum that is the distinction between a layer two solution and something that might be a side chain or a another non-ethereum chain that's not uh as well secured by ethereum and the thing about this panel is these are all application developers and that's why david and i wanted to get uh folks that were in the trenches actually building on top of these layer two solutions to talk because they can give the most credible perspectives on what's working and what's not because they're actually like users of the product they're consumers of the layer two they made a strategic choice and investment choice to build on top of layer two so if they're doing that if they're investing in it then we we wanted to know why and we figured that they would have the the best perspective on what's real what's not and when all of this stuff is coming and happening i think they gave us this so if you are looking to try to understand what ethereum ethereum scalability trajectory looks like what layer two looks like on ethereum this is the perfect podcast i think to to get up to speed there were two parts in this conversation that i really really enjoyed the first where is where we asked about the research process so you know each one of these guys has works for a team and there was a research process to go into which l2 was the best choice but before we asked that we asked well why did you even stick with ethereum like what you could have gone elsewhere why didn't you and i think that was one of my favorite parts in this conversation and then the other favorite part of this conversation came at the very end where we asked about their thesis or theories about does the value capture that's going on on l2 actually compete with ethereum and ether the asset or are they value generative to ethereum and ether of the asset i thought that was a really fantastic part of this conversation you guys are really going to enjoy this conversation but before we get into it we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible so as you guys know there is always a debrief at the end of every single episode that we reserve for the premium subscribers to the bankless program but we want to give the free listeners just a taste of what that kind of what those debriefs are like so if you are interested in hearing the debrief you can stay tuned to after the episode and you will be able to hear the 30-35-minute conversation that ryan and that ryan and i have after the episode where we talk about our takeaways our lessons our our thoughts that we had during the episode just me and ryan uh so if you are interested in that content again it's at the end of the episode uh it's it's free for everyone this time and if you are interested in the future and if you are interested in accessing the future debriefs you can subscribe to the bankless premium rss feed there's a link in the show notes to get that done i i thought this debrief was pretty cool and so check it out it's at the end ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave.com if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defy is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today all right bankless nation we are here with matt finestone of loopering business development at loopring we're also here with justin moses who's the cto of synthetics and then also last but not least robbie ferguson who is the co-founder of immutable uh which is the studio behind god's unchained so matt justin and robbie welcome to bankless and we're so excited to have you guys on the show today thanks for having me so l2 implementers assemble gentlemen you guys have all been invited here to because you share something in common you have all built and deployed functioning applications to the ethereum main chain and has seen success and adoption in the usage of your apps which is already a feat but there's something even more unique about their respective projects that all of you guys work on and that each of you guys have implemented or are in the process of implementing which is your guys's app being deployed on an ethereum l2 synthetics is offloading much of its infrastructure onto optimistic roll-ups loopring is building a complete payments and exchange platform on zk roll ups and immutable is building an nft asset exchange platform also on zk roll ups so again we brought jesse robin and matt here to tell us the story of their app their need to scale and their process thus far so let's start with uh with you matt and loopring tell us about the nature of your app what does it do and at what point did you realize that ethereum's main chain capacity just wasn't going to be enough thank you david yeah really excited to be here with fellow l2 implementers um yeah so blueprint is a bit different than i think my uh my compatriots here um in the fact that we had we were a protocol and then we built products and then we built a new protocol ourselves to the layer two protocol to augment the products so um the application did not force us to kind of uh look elsewhere for a layer two we built it ourselves so we're kind of a layer to protocol and layer two products um but yeah we realized long ago that like you know we had no business doing what we were trying to do on ethereum layer one we were building order book exchanges um the experience was really poor on ethereum layer one so we looked for scalability this was early on roll-ups were just kind of being whispered around and uh we built our zk roll up specifically to scale our order book exchange so we built an application specific zk roll up and then you know we start learning and we actually have users and iterating so the product changes a bit and then we we enhanced the protocol to support amms on layer two as well and then payments as well so what came from just like an order book deck protocol um really turned into an order book and amm exchange and payment zk roll up protocol um yeah it's a bit of a go all over the place there but as you see we kind of did like full loop uh no pun intended honestly and uh yeah that's that's where we're at right now maybe you can talk a little bit about how how and why building an order book exchange on the ethereum l1 was such a such a pain like why why did that not really work out so well right very briefly the the biggest thing is to get liquidity on order books you really need market makers or liquidity providers that are in control of their quotes uh what they're you know quoting to buy and sell and 15 second blocks and gas prices to submit to potentially cancel does not allow them to do their thing and kind of quote as and as the market's moving uh be quick and cheap like low latency low fee so it's really like a non-starter it's maybe one of the one of the worst things you could do if you're trying to replicate that legacy style order book on a blockchain but layer two allows us to really replicate that that performance you feel like you're on coinbase pro or in except you're on this layer completely coupled to ethereum base player security right so market makers even with ethereum before scale was really an issue in the in the way that gas prices were today those like 15 second block times and you know even penny's worth of a transaction it was already like without the congestion that we have today it was already a poor experience for and you know people who are managing order books need to be able to basically have instantaneous control not not 15 second delays or pennies at a transaction so even before ethereum was congested the l1 was never ever going to be able to do what you guys wanted to do that's a great point actually i didn't think of that kind of theme here that like you know justin and synthetics were forced after like large success on layer one already and uh potentially same with robbie we couldn't do what we wanted to do even a few years ago um that that's that's very true and i guess we'll jump to this but the layer one not being suitable for this type of behavior is actually kind of about spawned amms where these market makers don't need to jump in and be quick you're just kind of dumping your money and letting a function do the thing so it kind of uh amms came out of the the environment that optimized for it yeah matt they really came out of necessity right it was due to this constraint of basically uh you know low amounts of transactions per second that the automated market maker model became so successful and so popular uh maybe robbie for you kind of same question can you tell us a bit about the nature of your application and at what point you decided that you needed uh layer two yeah of course the point was actually really early when we were first launching the original sale of god's unchained it was at the same time f coin was doing their exchange listing uh and i don't know if everyone watching this remembers but the way they incentivized that was basically as poor as you get with they incentivize transactions in the ether network with high gas fees and so for the first time ever we were seeing gas fees of like 150 180. um we did some innovations then which were fine but fundamentally we did the maths we were like okay if we even get to 30 the size of hearthstone so a medium-sized game we are taking up some absurd amount of the ethereum blockchain via nft transactions uh particularly because nft transactions are a ton more expensive than just erc20 transfers like you can transfer a million dollars worth of erc20 value for a fixed cost you're transferring in a million dollars worth of uh nft value and god's unchanged um that looks like probably you know 500 000 cards uh so there's a fundamental difference between fundament fundable tokens and non-fundable tokens um and so in picking a solution really there were there were no available solutions i would say three years ago um there were ideas being thrown around state channels have yet to come to life uh plasma chains also really have not been implemented in a mainstream way and this i think was what drove people to things like new layer ones or side chains and then we had this magical thing called a zero knowledge proof come out which i remember being obsessed with when i first heard about it especially the different parables of ways of explaining it like the the parable of the cave or um you know the numbers and and how it's all kind of like probabilistically determined um which gave me some rough approximation of the mass which is probably like one percent of what it actually is uh but this is as vitalik says like the way it will scale um and so i think we we determined that solution pretty quickly um that this was the most obvious way to scale in particular nft transfers because they were so problematic on ethereum um and then it was just a matter of choosing okay who do we think the best kind of roll up provider is um zk roll ups a bit about nfts just because the lack of withdrawal time right now i think optimistic solutions work better if you want generalized programmability which i think why you know synthetics is is going with optimism which is also an excellent solution um so yeah i think that was the the genesis of when we knew and also when we knew there'd be a solution was when we first saw traction and deployment of roll-ups so to be clear robbie you are going with a ziki roll-up type solution in the same way that matt's team is with loopring is that correct yeah that's right um i think we use slightly different providers i think um looping do you guys use metalabs um we use ourselves um loopering uh pro protocol was the first zk roll up um as of 14 months ago so that's that's our kind of provider that's why i was kind of saying we're a bit of a beast we're a bit of a different beast like yeah yeah yeah operate across the stack but yeah no hard feelings no no no very cool very cool i'm sorry i didn't know that i think um i mean creating those proofs is bloody hard that's why that's how we partnered there and um ultimately i see there's a few layers of the stack here there's proof providers there's a protocol on top of that so i almost call that like uh an aws infrastructure right down the bottom which is clearly what you guys are providing and then you have okay well what networks or products that build on top of that and then you have applications then you have open c super ram marketplaces games um which sit on top of that protocol um so we went for this level we said we don't need to make the magic maths um i don't think we wanted to do that uh and and moon's real need exactly yeah actually um and the implementation of it for nfts is already tremendously difficult so we took on that challenge instead all right so let's turn to to justin at synthetics justin uh synthetics never really was destined to be an l2 in the same way loopering or or gauze and chained immutable was but you guys have turned into an l2 just simply out of necessity um because if your email one is congested so let's talk about a little bit of again the nature of your app the nature of the economic activity that goes on in synthetics and at what point did you guys realize that you know l2 was not just like an option for you guys but something that you guys must do so synthetics is a decentralized exchange a little bit like uh blueprint matt was saying i guess the big difference for us is we're a bit more like uni swap and that we're here to contract and we don't have an order book as such what's actually happening is people stake a token uh snx token um and from that they can issue a stable coin and then they can basically reprice that stablecoin into any other synthetic asset so basically what we have is this big shared deadpool that's comprised of all these different synthetic assets the more people that go into synthetic the more the deadpool is denominated in eth which is kind of cool because it means that you can get this idea of like infinite liquidity you can take any any synth and 100 convert its value to any other synth that is supported um but the problem with that is that that means that it's all shared like it's all shared state um and as for those of you who've ever written any absolutely know that that tends to mean things like you know you're looping over every cent from the system to figure out how much debt there are there is and this stuff is very gas intensive so i think for us the that they're sort of sort of somewhat super prompt um i actually think um you're a little a little off um david on that um assertion that we were never destined for l2 like if you talk to kane he's he's always been very much that that we he wants the experience like matt was saying he wants it fast and snappy like a traditional uh you know dex um and so you know we obviously couldn't do that on l1 but on top of that we have this very owner of gas fees that are just preventing you know regular people people who you know might only be staking you know a few hundred snx for actually doing anything because the code that we have is fairly complex um you know with some people looking at a hundred two hundred dollars worth at the time of trying to do simple things admitting now spending you know a few hundred dollars worth of eath in order to to earn maybe half fifty dollars worth of less than x so for us still really those two those two factors required us to go over and to answer your second question it was actually a devcon 5 um in a sucker when we saw the unipeak demo we saw um for those of you who were there or wanted to see the video basically uh you know the plasma team who became what it became the optimism team they worked closely with hayden and the uni swap team and they put together zuni pig and you know just seeing it you know just seeing the the tactile response you know my background's like you know full staff web engineering and i you know i was shocked and when we did our demo on l2 it was funny because our front-end engineers were now dealing with like regular kind of you know concurrency problems that we just never had with ethereum we're like we have multiple users using the app we need to basically use web sockets or something to to to tell in real time what's happening to this the shared state which we never had to worry about you know with l1 so yeah for us the uni peak demo which was uh about was it october 2019 was definitely the moment we were we started to take a lot of interest and optimistic and we started talking to them being honest so guys let's let's dive a little bit deeper into kind of the selection process of of layer two and i want to start here i know none of you are let's call it um you know chain maximalists of any sort i i'm pretty certain i think that you guys are looking out for your user's best interest that's what application developers do they want to provide the best user experience and the best application possible for users and of course when when you think about layer two you could also go in another direction which is a non-ethereum blockchain and there are a ton of what we'll call them eat killers uh in quotes out there that are promising you know low gas fees no gas fees infinite amounts of of block space kind of the all you can eat buffet please come to my blockchain justin from speaking on your app here uh and yet all three of you have chosen to stay within the ethereum ecosystem and not only that but have chosen the the security model of ethereum as well so it's not only kind of a side based on the ethereum virtual machine you're actually choosing to go down this even harder road where the security of your roll-up is actually based on ethereum so there's some some really new technology that you're cutting your teeth on i want to know why and i think listeners want to know why why did you stick with ethereum and what was the rationale behind the selection of the the layer two that you've chosen let's start with uh justin on this question yeah that's a good question i mean i think uh you know for us um i i don't know if any of you know this but um when we went haven which is what synthetics was before before it sort of rebranded um i was actually uh working on writing porting our contracts to eos i did it for maybe six weeks um i was brushing up on c plus plus and writing code and getting involved and really trying to get um like write open source code right um continuous integration that that pulled together docker containers and spun everything up and tested everything and whenever i tried to ping the community on eos it was just crickets like it was just nothing like and i was peeing different block producers and trying to get them to like help and and it really just just re-illustrated how strong the ethereum developer community is it's massive you know there's just so much infrastructure there's so much tooling um and there's so much momentum there and i you know obviously i'm an engineer right so i tend to maybe i over index on that but my experience very strongly is that ethereum's developer community is so rich that it would be you know very hard to move away from it and and i didn't i haven't seen any you know if killer that has showed me that there's any developer community anything quite like it so for for us it doesn't make any sort of sense um to move over to another one can we talk as well well i've got you on this justin about why the optimistic roll-up design specifically what were the advantages of that versus the other roll-ups or other eth uh layer two scaling solutions out there well i mean i think uh like some assuming we're on stage sticking on ethereum i mean for us like obviously you know the zk um they're not having to worry the one week for draw period is obviously there's obviously a better user experience there's no doubt about that but for us a big part of the the decision is how complex our smart contracts are um still to this day there's no easy way to port smart contract logic you know into anything into anything zk at all right uh on to l2 so the solution is to try to you know to try to take a little part of it right whatever you need to sort of take onto l2 and create some sort of zk compatible solution and create it and a big part of the the decision for us particularly for me is maintaining these two different code bases so i'd like to talk more about this at some point and this is a good uh piece but um there's a lot of complexity in our maintaining state on both and not just state but also contracts um code or both l1 and l2 like i'd like to think of as a new dimension now we have our contracts deployed on different networks right like you know covambelhaven but now we also have this dimension of layer two and the more you know the more cognitive load you put on your engineering team the harder it is to get things done so for me the big a really big part of the appeal of optimism was being out of port more or less exactly as is the contract code that we have on l1 and run it in l2 and then have two separate systems which is one elegance to the shards and and what i imagine is going to eventually happen is we are going to probably see different l2s and there'll be there'll be capital moving between these different layer twos and we need to handle how that's going to happen i don't actually think it's necessarily going to be when it takes all um you know so for us to be able to take our logic and move it over wholesale is a huge value out of optimism robbie let's talk about the process over at immutable when you guys were realizing that the ethereum l1 wasn't going to be enough for all the data that you guys would need to be able to put on chain did you guys ever look elsewhere other than ethereum and if you did what was the rationale behind why you decided to stick with ethereum yeah of course we looked elsewhere uh we even had offers massive grants from different chains you know how like these things go um this was actually a really simple question for me though uh and ultimately i am an 8th maximalist um i think a bit contrary to the original thing and the reason is not just inherently hey this is this is what i like it's i i think i'm a decentralized maximalist and ethereum is really one of the only public blockchains which fulfills that criterion for me um the alternative blockchains simply like either their consensus mechanisms are so centralized that if i hired a crackpot team of um hitmen with two million bucks i could go crack it um or if the government cracked down they could go crack it or if the ceo of the company um or their supplies blockchain don't know who i could be referencing here um was to leave that'd be a significant impact to the blockchain so i think um just speaking pretty candidly there's very few decentralized alternatives so my question is what is the point then why don't i run a marketplace on my database on my computer why don't i just do another steam like the whole point of this is to give users self-custody sensitive resistance uh and it's fundamentally decentralization and sovereignty over hard capped assets and hard cap money and so i don't think going halfway and just creating a nice experience for trading valuable things that can that is fundamentally vulnerable to the same things centralized markets are is doing anything at all um the next thing i would say is that that's that's why ethereum um but the next thing i would say is it's not sufficient for me to have some sort of relationship with the ethereum ecosystem and i think there's a lot of wool being pulled over people's eyes here as well at the same time uh which is i think i mean and this is where i actually take my my learnings from you guys because i think you so cleverly articulated what are the value propositions of ethereum which in in my mind are four each is a consumable eighth is a capital asset eighth is a store of value and ether is a form of economic bandwidth guaranteeing via security the operations that exist on that protocol to me you have to therefore rely on ethereum security uh currently the only scalability solutions which rely on ethereum security are roll-ups um so i think that that was partially why i chose that like at the end of the day you want to have the cost to attack the stuff you're trading to be the same as the cost to attack your roll-ups i think optimism has a slightly more um linear cost to it to attack the proofs but it's it's still correlated to it to ethereum security um so still really good and i think um you know justin was on the money with the fact that it's just way better for di define apps right now an optimistic solution um so that was why ethan that was why roll ups um and ultimately at the end of the day for customers it's way better too like it is where all the network effects are it's where all the developers are that's a really hard thing even with 250 million dollars to buy you know your own ecosystem of developers it's just you know that money will only go so far and that people will be motivated by cash rather than um the true kind of cultural genesis of a decentralized community which we've seen on ethereum today and so what about the research phase for immutable and an l2 uh how did you guys come to a decision as to what l2 was the right l2 for you yeah so it's it's really just two decisions it's one what kind of um so in my mind the only l2s are rollups right now i mean that's because the definition of an l2 is something which inherits the security of the l1 rollups the only solution which do that currently um other mechanisms like sidechains useful and they just they have their own consensus mechanism so you're not actually getting a security they they have bridges and it's it's great for the ecosystem and this is partially why polygon said hey we want to be this you know um relationship to future zk roll ups and and things like that um i'll i'll be excited when they release one and and they can they can use us if they like um for nfcs so i think that uh the first choice was out of rollups which one zero knowledge was very clearly the choice for us nfts have a reduced need for evm compatibility over complex smart logic and we're also getting there so immutable x's implementation of zero knowledge roll up with starkware uh already has the prover on chain which is able to basically take any evm logic we just don't have the language and tooling which is going to get there this year um so that's future-proofed um and the main reason for nfts is instant withdrawals so the benefit with erc 20s in a you know a protocol like synthetics is you can do things with liquidity bridges to kind of get around this problem with the withdrawal time they're not perfect but they're pretty good for fundable tokens you can't do that for nfts if you have a you know one-of-a-kind cryptokey axi godzilla chain card i can't you know loan you or construct some liquidity bridge which is going to give you early access to that capital it's just impossible so for us those with the you know a zero knowledge roll up was the only solution out of that it was like okay well what provided did we use and and starkware was the obvious choice for us 30 million dollars from sequoia um a really world-class team and and was future briefing that as well all right and last but not least of course matt from from loopering uh was uh building on something else other than ethereum ever even something that you guys could have considered right so first of all such a pleasure to hear these guys uh speak robbie and justin and like so like-minded or facing similar things and uh i don't have much else uh valuable to say except for our own situation but yeah i really echo everything they said um did we ever look somewhere here's another little fun tidbit actually even before scalability was like the big pressure on us or the big thing we're trying to tackle we actually did look elsewhere off ethereum back three years ago and i will up uh justin's eos we actually deployed smart contracts for loopering version one on neo um on neo wait neo the the uh the uh china's answer to ethereum that neo that that's right okay can you kick someone from a call no we'll just edit that out probably if we have to no it's okay matt you know we we we all have those things that uh have happened in our past that we're trying to get over now but tell us more no we i think it's a great learning moment um we you know loop ring is actually a primarily shanghai-based team most of our engineers and i'm not there i'm in canada but um a big part of our team is there and back then it wasn't so obvious to some even to me even though i'd also consider myself uh you know just a purely eth person now by a long shot back then it wasn't clear that you didn't want to deploy your things on other chains not for scalability reasons just for oh this is maybe the ethereum of china or interoperability different chains like the reasons are fuzzy now looking way back then but we we deployed it but it was really kind of like uh like a tangential um effort and as soon as we did it it kind of didn't work for certain technical quirky reasons like the way they're gas it's it's actually kind of funny to think about it they had like two types of gas and like if you did the transaction that is below some type of like consumed gas it's like free if i remember correctly but then it like spikes up it's like a step function if you do anything a bit more complex is really so actually the reason why we dropped it was because it was technically not feasible that was before ethereum just became the clear place where we wanted to focus our time as justin was saying like the cognitive uh overhead and just the simplicity so so we actually looked elsewhere so we have a bit of first-hand experience about dealing with crickets in a community or just facing all those things but it really was a different world back then in 2017. what's worse matt crickets or high gas fees is kind of the question right yeah right exactly that that's the first thing i thought of when when you posed the question was like user experience is not like we all think like okay speed and cost that's like actually way down the list on user experience what's way higher is people both users and devs assets um liquidity and like awareness right like that is um those are prerequisites before anything else in user experience which we think of like speediness and costlyness like so those so those are indeed the things about why ethereum um now to get to the next point when we try to tackle scalability it's funny um someone mentioned devcon 5 for us it was defcon 4 in prague and just zk roll ups i just remember it so clearly people were talking about zk roll ups for scalability and i remember just writing my team i was the only one there like hey what is this stuff it sounds like it's a magic bullet to uh all of our all of our problems and back then there were no live zk roll ups there was no like to my maybe there was the beginnings of thoughts about companies forming but there was no starkwear in this current forum or matter of labs or really any live zk roll up so we became overnight a zk roll up team and we're not a bunch of cryptographers um as as robbie was saying these proof systems are hard but like our team turned into practitioners of zero knowledge cryptography and um really we had a few great engineers leading us building the first ck roll up from scratch which was a huge a huge effort it took a year it stopped everything we were doing um but yeah we we built it our ourselves and um that's that i forget the next part of the question why zk over optimism uh i hadn't actually asked it yet but that's exactly right it seems like um zk rollups was the rollup of choice for you guys and it was seemed really really conducive to you guys from the get-go it seemed like you guys never really had any doubts that zk roll ups was the solution for you what strengths did dk roll ups have that really just made it crystal clear that it was the right path forward right so i may be mistaken here maybe somebody could create but i don't think optimistic roll-ups were a thing back then i think roll-ups like the idea of like a roll-up like generalized was i guess it was a thing because people thought okay validity proof were fraud proofs but like you didn't have debates like cool debates now like zk versus optimistic it was like okay roll ups and like yeah use these validity proofs as far as i know we only discuss that we never thought i could be wrong but then as we progressed and like we were mid build and maybe the idea came out a bit we were still very very strongly in the zk roll up camp because it does offer us what we need we're not we don't have those complex kind of arbitrary logic um that justin was describing we were building order book exchanges right which turned into order book exchanges plus payments plus a mm so still just like specific functions we were tackling so zk was able to handle that so that's kind of one one reason the other is indeed the fast withdrawal times we that's a big thing which is live on loop ring now it's really cool you could exit it used to be a big thing that people said oh you know an hour away two hour wait is way too long um now you could pay up to kind of eject from layer two in the next ethereum block 15 seconds it might cost you like 60 bucks or 70 bucks right now but that then you don't wait um something like that so so those that was it but really it's the the cold hard fact is like it was just the one that we were aware of but when we did kind of become aware of optimistic robs we just also we like the idea of validity proofs maybe we had like these naive debates which have since been answered but i remember talking to the team and okay what about optimistic rollups it's going to be more generalizable but we all said like we like the idea of just like validity proofs like not waiting for fraud proofs after i think we posed the question like what happens if there's never any fraud on an optimistic rollups like the watchers never like win a bond or something like that i don't know if that's even since been answered like that was like a thing like okay if everyone is too well behaved then does everybody like let up their guard because nobody's actually like slashing people or winning like a challenge fraud proof it's like we had those early probably now answered questions but we just like the idea of validity proofs so i i want to you know frame this question to the uh the implementers the the avengers of of uh implementing on layer two right now uh this way so a lot of people when they're seeing kind of um ethereum's congestion as as david sort of phrased it but basically it's high gas fees um they're getting flashbacks to 2017 where ethereum had its you know cryptokitties moment when uh basically um you know everyone realized that the cryptokitties application was consuming too much of the ethereum network and oh my god ethereum had to scale and then we also remember that the ethereum scaling solutions at that time were not quite ready for prime time there was like a lot of promise about state channels for instance you know projects like like raiden would come and solve things then there was a lot of promise about plasma that you know plasma was the next solution to to scale ethereum there was even promise about eth2 hey it's you know maybe it's right around the corner kind of like but we're not sure what the road map looks like um so this is a question i think only the implementers can answer and this is the reason we brought people who are building apps to this conversation is because you guys can drop the truth on us right like no one else can i mean we bring on uh some of the the layer two providers they're all going to sell us the vision essentially and try to sell us the platform but you guys are actually in the trenches building this  so what we want to know to the panel is uh is layer 2 really happening this time like how far along are we is it here i mean because mainstream's coming and they're coming right now they're coming during this bull run we got to be ready for him how ready are we let's start with matt on that question yeah um absolutely uh maybe you gave me this one because it's a it's a softball pitch for me because i could say it's not coming it's here uh you know exclamation point um it's it's here like that's all loop ring does without layer two we wouldn't exist we wouldn't have a product we'd have a protocol so to the extent that like we have stuff to do every day and our users do stuff and there's volumes that's all layered to live mainnet real value so let's get that off uh right out of the way it's here now it's time to learn and tweak and iterate and everybody else is coming you know we've kind of we've been alone for the past year now uh like you know mega popular apps are coming um synthetics apps and protocols um so now you know thereby they have a function of their platform live on mainnet so it's here it's not just us and it's really amazing as all these builders know when you actually have users and things are happening you start improving right like that's like compared to our zk rzk roll up last year um it was barely usable everything was like everything was gas intensive you couldn't do that much stuff now it's like you know it's more efficient it's more flexible so we're gonna see that kind of inflection kick in where people are learning from their l2 experiences and everything is just i mean it's here i'm so bullish if people don't know that layer 2 is here and it's only getting better then i hope this episode really um or maybe i don't want them because that's a nice flood thing against eth and i want it you know i don't want it to just be realized overnight and then priced in that oh yeah this could do everything that that we needed to so i don't mind actually some apprehension or or some other conspiracy theories that it's not covering because that gives me more time yeah alpha is of course always opportunity but but matt at looper you guys are still building stuff you guys are still working on progressing loopering so if you aren't actually working on building the actual l2 platform what are you guys working on like where are you guys in your guys's roadmap to actually capture and facilitate l2 scale right so i think we still are definitely working on all fronts that's not saying we're a bit of like a a different beast so we have that whole proving team and the relayer who's you know generating these ek snark proofs they still have improvement to do then we have the actual protocol what we could write in our zk circuits um you know now as of a few months ago amms are on our layer two so still improvements there maybe next will be a lending protocol or another type of functionality so those are kind of the two pieces of the zk rolla front like the relayer and then the protocol written on top of it and now we have this new layer of products which is kind of new to us that's super important is presenting this in a package the user on like the loop ring exchange on on web which is an amm and order book decks and um and payment uh application where you can do everything gas free and so just improving the products which which is a huge huge thing and quite um different hat for us and and besides our loopering exchange we have the livering wallet which is kind of another thing i know you guys are right on top of from vitalik's recent episode on social recovery wallets but looprin kind of uh you know expanded its focus again and we have um a smart a mobile smart contract wallet so the social recovery wallet with our zk roll up baked in which is kind of a dual like a really two-pronged approach at like mass uh you know mass market usability so you know fast and cheap but also a product that doesn't scare you with a seed phrase and is like socially scalable and like usable there so so we're still busy on all those fronts protocol product um all that definitely definitely it's only getting busier now that we actually have real users and real volume you know 250 million dollars worth of worth of value on our zk roll up which is unbelievable for me to think about i remember being discouraged you know mid last year saying man how hard is getting people on layer two gonna be and by no means are we you know hanging up our hat like we we've achieved at all we're just getting started but it's just so nice to see real users real volume we're all grateful and and really uh looking forward to continuing that guys i just want to capture that because matt you know 250 million in in locked value on a loop ring look guys like a year ago at this time we barely had that much locked in defy in our d5 protocols right i mean we just hit like the one billion mark in something like february of last year so now that we've got like loop ring 250 million that's huge and uh you know congrats to the team there and congrats for pushing this vision forward i just you know this space moves so fast it's unbelievable what you can accomplish in six months a year's time very cool thank you so much by the way let's turn to uh justin with synthetics justin where are you guys in the development of your l2 well like what what is that road map like where are you guys in that process and where do you have left to go so right now the uh optimism like has a pseudo main net so it's sudo in that that we're the only ones that can actually deploy right now um but uh you know plans are underway for the for a full real maintenance right and as um as matthew said before uh you know one of the great things about optimism is it's generalizable and i think to answer ryan's question before about like how real is this i think a generalizable uh way to start deploying contracts on l2 that's very very similar to deployment l1 you need you need your own compiler that's basically like a superset of a of the sole c compiler um and you just switch your provider to optimism and you know away you go you need a bit of wrap deep in there instead of ether and it's pretty much you know bambang you know you can you actually deploy on l2 and i think that knowing that that's coming um you know around the corner this year is going to be pretty huge it's going to pave the way for lots of developers who may not want to sort of get into the nitty-gritty of actually trying to get into zk sucks to be like i just want to be able to write contracts the way i always have and deploy it in something a lot faster and cheaper um in terms of our roadmap um so we're right now at a situation where not quite as much as matt i think i just had a quick check now there's about 160 million right now a usb value of snx it's on our layer two uh which is probably even more than perhaps we want considering it's a phase zero so right now what we have is um some stakers uh you can stake your smx on layer two but um the ssd that that is what happens is when you stake in synthetics you basically meet the stable coin the sust that's on layer two is basically you know useless the capital company you can't do anything with the capital right now there's no other protocols on there nothing else you can do and yet there's still 160 million dollars of value on there which is which is pretty wild um the synthetic say i was sending uh 25 000 smx a week to distribute among people who are staking but that's it and yet there's still a lot of values so clearly you know people are really excited to get off to get off paying gas on way one um our next phase is to basically enable basic exchanging so probably have like um uh having uh ether and bitcoin um and actually being out of slowly hopefully if we get some other protocols on there actually do something with these with these synths as opposed to just having them static sitting on layer two you know but for us you know be a big part of the excitement is as other teams and protocols do develop as matt was saying like as other teams do start developing different things and they're on layer two well then we can get those d5 legos you know plugged in and that's uh something that we're we're also pretty excited because you know as you can probably infer once you sort of take away you know uh 15 second block times and a bunch of other requirements all of a sudden new ideas and things you can do um start to pop up so justin i i just want to be clear oh sorry just one thing justin i just want to be clear on this because this this would have felt like a miracle in 2017. what you're saying is your team and what you've done with synthetics on optimistic roll-ups right now is living proof that generalized smart contracts work in a roll-up now like that works right now that's what you're telling that works so what we basically like just forget a little technical just because i find this useful instead of just sending um you know tokens right from layer 1 to layer 2 we're actually sending messages by 32 encoded messages we take users escrow entries because when you stake with snx every week you claim and you earn snx that's escrowed we're taking this payload and actually sending it off to layer two and recreating the state that existed on l1 and now we've recreated on l2 so we can actually create this you can these generalizable messages you can actually send data and you can do it both ways but as you obviously know that there's that one week withdrawal period um which is very onerous now for us as robbie mentioned we're talking fundable tokens so it's not a big deal um you can have a market maker come and basically solve the problem of liquidity by if it's snx or it's susd or something else they can basically they can they can basically sit there and on both sides and provide liquidity but yes we we do have a generalized solution it's just right now outside the noise it's right now um not anyone can can deploy to it yet but there is a there is a solution coming um soon where anyone can actually deploy to it and you know write their code in solidity um transpile it using the ovm compiler um and then deploy as i said using a regular provider because the thing that the optimism team is really big on and i really commend them for is is not reinventing the wheel and just leaning on as much as a much of of standards and developer tooling that everyone's used to um so there's no you know magical lists or magical data then it tries to be as much you know edm compatible as possible now of course there's more it's more complex because of fraud proofs and things like that um but they really try to make it as compatible as possible justin do you happen to have any sort of like napkin math as to how much gas you've been able to save your users or perhaps like what percentage of synthetics economic activity you've been able to offload any numbers like that you could give us uh i don't have it on my head off the top of my head but i think it's something on in the order of like two orders of magnitude difference like so a 500k gas transaction ends up being about 5k yes and you think of it like what the roll up is really what is persisted onto layer one is um is effectively the um the two things for every transaction there's the call data so the things that you know the inputs of the with the function call and then uh the merkle hash right of the state and they're the only two things that are actually persisted on layer one so every time that every time someone transacts they basically those two things have to be eventually get pushed onto layer one so it is about two waters a magnitude difference in terms of in terms of gas now it's a little hard to compare what's happening on layer two right now um to one just because uh right now uh the gas is being basically paid for um the users aren't paying for it right now just during this pseudo maintenance so it's hard to really say what's you know how many people are actually uh you know how much of this real activity is we all know people are a bit different when it comes to their own money versus when something's free just to go a little bit deeper into that you know synthetics is one has one of the most vibrant communities in all of ethereum it's kind of the thing that you guys are known for it's the the synthetics communities what i would say brought synthetics through the bear market and into the mainstream knowledge as we know today i would imagine that the demand for scale is must be absolutely massive inside of your community what can you what can you tell us about community interest in accessing this l2 like when you guys open up the door is there just going to be a flood of people that move on to this l2 or have you guys done any sort of like consumer research in this domain sorry you talking about our users we talk about other developers like another product your guys is users who want to move on to the synthetic cell too yeah i mean 100 i mean a lot of them really want to see you know a real trading app you know like matt was saying before they want to see you know ticking prices they want you know to get their orders filled immediately they want ethnicity they want all the things that we don't we can't provide right now i don't want so yeah i 100 i see people going over there now of course um the question of how useful is the capital that you mention all the things that you have at l2 is going to be a big it's going to be an issue so we will have to see um you know what else appears on on optimism and then if not like how like what other solutions to as i said before to get your smx or your synths back to layer one and play with them if you need to um i think that that's still a bit of an open question right now we need to see whether where that sort of comes to fruition but it seems like based on what i said before the amount of rewards that are being sent onto layer 2 are pretty miniscule and yet we still have you know something in the order of let's say that 160 million like 6.6 million snx right which is what is that uh i don't know 6.6 times roughly 25 yeah yeah no i meant the the total supply like i don't have the total spout of my head um what number that is but you know like three percent or something yeah which is pretty significant considering yeah that's fantastic fantastic work uh and really exciting because you just released um kind of the layer two optimism like what two weeks ago three weeks ago something like that i don't know time time i'm in a different way yeah it feels like about three months um i i think it might be a month ago actually now a month ago okay a month ago now thanks for the time adjustment day time is weird for me right now these days in crypto okay uh robbie same question to you right so you represent the the nft uh side of of these applications and nfts are having an absolutely massive moment so far in 2021 this is going to be an absolute breakout year like um it it seems so obvious but but same questions to you how real is layer two for nfts right now like hit us with the truth yeah uh building a layer two for nfts is really hard uh especially compared to erc 20s nfts are fundamentally antithetical to liquidity if you have eight and a half million gods unchained nfts you have eight and a half million order books each of those could have their own uni swap mark at its nuts like they literally have their own bids asks and spreads and rodney just so just so people can understand this this is almost like you know like uh obviously fungible tokens are things we see in the real world like like uh coins and dollars and these things are fungible yeah nfts they're more like collectibles they're they're individual items like things you might find in a in a pawn shop in the real world right so of course each nft is completely unique you can't trade one ft with another and that's why you're saying uh they each represent a separate order book almost and each nft needs to find the right buyer right like it's there's not a global buyer for nfts in the same way that there's a global buyer for dollars or gold or coins because they're fungible each of these you know goods is unique uh what i think and i i i steal this from jesse walden who's a great thinker on nft space uh is d5 is as to financial services as nfts are to literal assets and in the real world like um cards options contracts and physical goods term deposits heaps of stuff the real world are unique and that's what financial services exist to serve so i think fundamentally we're seeing the innovation of tokenization of everything the final stage and that's why this space has gone nuts we have mark cuban making nfts of him tweeting cameos uh we have um you know major ip pouring into um different partnerships the amount of people who have reached out to our company over the last you know three months is 20-fold over the previous year so the space has been insane it's really difficult to provide scalability which is why flo went off and said hey we can do a good competing business to ethereum by carving a niche out of nfts uh and this is why i'm quite excited to say that within six weeks from now the first zk l2 transfer then nfc will occur um on immutable x um and and people will be able to do that so it's definitely here uh i've i've done demos where we're doing test net integrations with uh basically partner applications because the goal of immutable x is like honestly it's it's two things one i want to make nfc is huge uh and i want the future home of those nfts to be on a blockchain which is good infrastructure which is open frankly that's ethereum right now you need to use it security fundamentally um and so the way i want to do that people should just try but they want to trade they want to trade on openc i want to make openc the most amazing place to trade ever and have those guys be hugely successful people want to trade in in fortnight and have an api and just trade in that marketplace they should be able to do that and have all the benefit of ethereum level security uh so yeah we've been we've been working on this for um nearly a year and a half now uh it's where where stoke field will release it at this time so robbie because we've heard a little bit uh of this from the other two panelists about sort of the before and after right they described like kind of the you know the current state on the mainnet if they had their app you know their app exists on the mainnet versus versus now and it's a world of faster ui better experience can you kind of describe the before and after for somebody who is you know using nfts today or trading nfts today on main net versus when immutable x goes live what's what's the difference how's the user going to feel this yeah it's a great question i mean the main difference is they pay zero gas ever if you're a game developer you pay zero gas to create an nft to mint one if you're a user you pay zero gas to trade an nft it's on a validity proof so you have the same level of security as ethereum always uh which is fundamentally the point it's the reason why we're good for ethereum down the track if if nft's become huge if l3's become huge we're not taking value away from the fundamental chain um that's really important to me otherwise you can't get ethereum supporters on site otherwise you're essentially just competing at the end of the day um so that's the user experience the other thing is we're working with starkwear to make it so if you have layer 1e you don't even have to deposit that um so really i want the worst the minimum experience to be identical to current thing you pay your ordinary gas fee you use your layer 1 8 the best experience to be hey i've literally just signed a transaction i see this nft in my account instantly it feels like magic like it legitimately feels like magic after three years of spending oh will this come in two minutes will it come in 10 minutes am i paying 45 to trade a one dollar god's unchained card uh which is just crazy so i think the demand is the you know it's gone from being a um a vitamin to a painkiller for nfts is the way i describe it um and right now it's it's gone to being general anesthetic the state of nfts so robby i want to i want to pin you down here because i have a gauze and chain deck that i enjoy playing with but i'm far from a professional and so i would like to use the marketplace to bolster my deck but i remember that it would cost like you said it would cost me five dollars or ten dollars to get this card that was worth two three dollars um so when do i get to use the nftx marketplace to purchase all the gauze and chain cards that i want yeah our goal would be for god's unchanged we'll roll out first in quarter one so within six weeks um you can create a prediction market on that i'll um for it awesome fantastic all right so i think that unless ryan you have any other questions you want to follow up here with this section i want to turn to the conversation of composability because this is a a frequent topic of concern that many people have when it comes to l2 which is well if if loopering gets all the liquidity on the loopering l2 and synthetics has the liquidity on the synthetics l2 well then a we're fragmenting liquidity and now that we're all on separate l2s we're all multiple hops further away from each other than we once were right so let's start with matt like how are how are you guys addressing this concern of fragmented liquidity and broken composability what are you guys doing to help mitigate this issue and or do you even consider this an issue right um for sure this is uh it's a it's a huge thing we haven't had to deal with it practically because we're the only ones so we've you know people kind of jab at this this potential weakness in layer two and oh you're all gonna be in silos and again especially loopering because loopering zk roll up is quite application specific we have the decks we have the amm we have the payments but like we're not trying to get like like we wouldn't have been a solution for um god's unchained like we couldn't have told robbie hey build on loopering because we're not trying to uh you know like starkware's power their other applications so there might we're not you know inviting other teams necessarily to come build and we're gonna hey like you know tweak our back end to optimize for you and stuff like this so we're kind of doing our thing um you know which is kind of a it's an interesting statement to say because you know everything as ethereans all of us we do is so open um but yeah the loop ring and this kind of goes back to your other question did you ever look at alternative l1 to some extent layer twos do become a bit of a silo uh you're there and you have to kind of make a transaction to go into there make a transaction out and it could be as instant or not instant depending on zk roll ups or optimistic roll ups but i mean at the the best case scenario then you're in a roll-up with other people so synthetics you're you're in a roll-up where there's other stuff going on and then it becomes kind of similar to layer one synthetics might have plenty of company probably will have plenty of company on optimism i'll let justin speak to that and then you kind of have those same composability um you know those great properties to go cross roll up there's a new now this is the next frontier cross roll ups right we all know roll-ups are here so how will we go across could we will it be easier for maybe validity proof to validity proof roll up so like will i be able to speak more easily to to robbie or to another starkware application because it's loopering zk roll up to another zk roll up can we also go equally as easy to optimistic roll-ups so this is the next frontier there's a there's a few projects working on that there's connects there's uh hop which which came out recently um so to to be honest we largely leave that to these new solutions to come we speak with them we we ask them questions they ask us questions but we um we're not trying to solve um composability ourselves uh we are trying to build the best kind of environment and products that that we can on loop brings ek roll up and we kind of take it for granted that really smart people our peers are going to figure out to build bridges um you know and everything again rooted the most crucial thing rooted in ethereum security so if like if liquidity providers have to bridge an exit from loopering and entrance onto synthetics or onto optimism then that liquidity provider at least has the assurance that like this is all ethereum level security guarantees they don't have to have a mental space for um this side chain that has seven validators um right so like all these rollups at least they're speaking the same language and they know like the fallback is ethereum layer security and then it's just like talking about what is the market rate on their liquidity to front you a thousand die exiting loop ring and then putting and crediting you that on optimism what do i need for that do i need 50 basis points for the hour like it becomes a financial consideration which clearly ethereum has excelled at figuring out these these these amazing new models and things like that so it's going to be solved i guess with a mix of technology and financial innovation and just like the market rate for for liquidity which sounds maybe like not such a huge thing but that's how composability is gonna work maybe like the equivalent of flash loans right from one to the other and i guess we still are thinking about it in the sense that like we have in our we have conditional transfers so i could make a message on that that is contingent on the layer two and the layer one action right so like again fronting this liquidity and being in two places at once so if i do something on layer two then i take that message and then it allows me to do something on layer one um we do support these conditional transfers those are a big thing that that's what fast with our fastest draws are based on um but yeah at the end of the day it's um i think a lot is to be seen like i really have a big chunk of this i just don't know how it's going to play out there's still technical pieces to fit in place there's behavioral pieces to fit in place like how often will people be leaving their roll-ups um right and then again it's the zk versus optimistic uh exit timing it's just there's a lot of unknowns here but it's clear that the work is is is being done and it's a mix of technical and financial and composability will remain but it's it's if i have to say kind of one thing like you know that's okay let's let's assess a risk here composability is not as beautiful as everything being on layer one that's for sure but we're gonna get over that at home justin i'd like to pull you into this into this conversation one of my long-term optimistic cases for for loopering is that uh loopering is a place that will be able to take fiat uh to take a fee on-ramp right and so let's say i transfer my hundred 000 whatever dollars into loopering and then i start trading snx right um buy cell snx to use the loop ring l2 and then say i've got my s and x bag filled and now i want to take that s next bag and or and maybe i also have s usd on on loop ring as well maybe there's both snx and susd on loop ring but now i want to go into the synthetics ecosystem i want to reprice my susd debt and if if in the current form of things without the theoretical financialization market makers that matt was just talking about i would have to uh exit out of loop ring which would be one transaction take it would take some time it would be a little bit more gas intensive than a basic l1 transaction then i would have to go into the synthetics optimism l2 in order to do some of the activity going on there and that would also take another transaction and it also takes some time how do you see some of these frictions being smoothed out and down the road look i think matt's right it's like the next frontier i mean to just to take a slight step back like sharding you know horizontal scaling is where we're going like this is the theory like it doesn't matter what we want to say and label this l2 like this is inevitable like we have to do something and i don't think there's been one solution as i said before when this is we're all coming to a lot of heads and trying to figure out how that how the hell are we going to do this stuff um you know i mean you're i mean you mentioned there um david the the cost of gas and stuff and you know of course that will be that's going to be unpleasant i'm not maybe it's not said there'll be a way to connect the dots between you know one roll up to another roll up and i don't i can see that being possible i just i don't see how that's going to come out generalizably but maybe um i don't i don't really have a great answer for you but i mean i guess the i guess for us like our attitude and our kind of ethos has always been let's just iterate um let's throw things out let's see what sticks let's get mvps out there let's see what people want and use and and go with it so i wish i had a better answer but we're we're looking towards as i said before market makers who could help get the the the assets back out quickly but to talk to another l2 it feels too early to really have a good answer to that right now just just anyone else has thoughts i want to ask you kind of two follow-up questions but but the first is this you know in putting kind of the tactical hat on that that you wear all the time i've i've heard some critics say well if you break composability you're not really solving ethereum's scalability problem right and and what they mean is that uh layer two is not uh actually solving scalability because the beautiful thing about ethereum layer one is that all of the applications are composable so now you're just like like fragmenting it so i've heard critics uh say that what's your response to that do you think that this is true scalability or do you think because it doesn't preserve some of the nice atomic transactions between all of the the d5 money legos on ethereum that we're we're losing something and we're not truly scaling ethereum what's your response to that i mean i think i think we are losing something and i mean matt said the same thing like we would it would be great to stay on l1 but i think we've just hit the limits of what we can really do um potentially there's some innovation in the future that can they can fix this but we've had a lot of smart minds on this problem um and it seems like we're back to this idea again as horizontal scaling so um i think the best thing we can do as protocols is to create a such a system where potentially if need be we might even need to be able to deploy ourselves on different uh different layer twos and find ways that we can bridge so maybe the solution to that problem before that that david mentioned is we find a way to deploy synthetic version synthetics on loopering um they can interact very nicely with the bring and then we have a way to to bridge that gap from there layer two to our layer two but at the end of the day like um if we can't find a nice way to do it like to go from from one layer to another two then yeah we do break to some degree we do a great composability and you know you know i i guess i don't really have much else to say on that one well so here's my my other follow-up uh to this justin's because you know synthetics interacts with a ton of the other d5 protocols in ethereum today so i remember when dave and i were talking to kane about this on a community asked me anything and he said uh hey you know what synthetics is doing we're moving out of manhattan and we're going to brooklyn and we asked the question okay kane um like you know how are you going to get the other d5 product protocols to come to brooklyn with you right and he was like well we're going to make brooklyn freaking awesome and everyone's going to want to be there so my question to you justin is like as part of solving this composability you've got with optimistic rollups you've got this this essentially almost like a a defy chain right it can it can host the other d5 money protocols my question is one of coordination how do you get everyone else to come to brooklyn with you what are you seeing along those lines i mean i think what we're what else is really offering optimism is really offering is is um the ability to tinker to play you know it's l1 has become prohibitive now yes of course you could tinker on kovan or girlie or any other tesla but l2 provides the ability to tinker and i think that's exceptionally powerful i think perhaps people who don't who aren't engineers don't underestimate the importance of that having a playground where you can actually start putting things out there and actually working um so you know i think that i expect to see lots of interesting innovation happen online too now the big protocols some of them are probably sitting there thinking you know what do i do do i wait for do i wait for a better generalizable zk do i join optimism you know and my response to them is like you should be thinking about this regardless and i don't see why it's why you shouldn't be considering ways to potentially fragment right potentially the fact that i don't i don't see why they you know i don't see why they wouldn't try and do this like now yes there's cognitive overhead but again i think that the writing's on the wall that we need to do something now kane's probably more well i wouldn't say fashionable i'm the one who used to live in brooklyn [Laughter] he lived in sydney hardly hardly the most fashionable city in the world sorry i'll be well the robber isn't the best part of sydney i think but uh but yeah i mean we definitely have been talking a lot some other protocols have been you know been have been asking us and talking to us and like we want to get on there i mean but they all have their own concerns like you know you know let's say a money market goes over there like you're in a you know compound or our bait and they're gonna be like okay well we're splitting up uh you know might be like well we're spitting up our you know liquidity we have equity over here and we're putting over there and how do we do it you know these are particular problems that these guys have to do but i we've seen lots of demand lots of people have been asking us and and reaching it through us and trying to get out and you know get on there and right now they said unfortunately only synthetics are able to deploy so i see it coming i mean i see i see it being a pretty cool place but i again don't think it's a bill and all you know um manhattan still exists and and you know what i'm not in new york anymore but um but you know i hear manhattan's starting to come back you know it's becoming the new place because everyone's moved out so the artists are coming back in so you know there you go robbie do you have anything to add to the composability discussion before we move the next topic for the panel yeah just quickly i think i have two things um the first one is that i think that uh you know justin is totally right it's about making brooklyn a playground and a really exciting playground uh you know we're gonna have cairo you can build recreations of this functionality in immutable x um the second thing to say is i think this is why nft is an interesting use case for l2 it's less about building that interoperability and more about how can you trade real assets on on a blockchain um with high security um and so i think that there's less of a critical need there the third one though is i guess like what does a scaling ethereum mean uh is it you are allowing the network effects of the community to be preserved interoperably that's one definition is it you are allowing people to use the layer one settlement based uh security um as the security under which their logic is is transacted i think that's a really compelling definition is i think that's fundamentally what differentiates ethereum from every other chain out there because either way they achieve either their security through a less secure main via consensus mechanism that's completely centralized all their chain is just less valuable and therefore easy to attack um so i think that's my kind of my real question is what does scaling ethereum mean and i think that it has to be on real layer twos i don't mind if there's a bunch of fragmented layer trees i think that's a great future um for ethereum because at the end of the day value is being consumed in the form of eat proofs being paid on chain and two economic bandwidth is being increased uh because these assets are being transferred with the same level of security as ethereum um so i would say it absolutely is more so than any other solution there's a reason that vitalik said ethers on rollups is the future uh you know centralized side chains are a betrayal of its values literally quote from him um so i mean if i'm if i'm taking an eq i'm i'm taking a cue from the the guy who made it yeah and you know you said the magic words at least for me economic bandwidth i i have been um dave and i have both been such a proponent of this term because i i do think that scalability is so narrowly defined if you just think about it in terms of transactions per second on the main chain right ignores so many aspects of it nor is the scalability of the the community ignores the scalability the user experience it ignores the scalability of economic security and it ignores the scalability of trustless economic bandwidth and when you have an asset like eth of course that acts as a store of value doesn't have any other centralized intermediary and you're able to preserve that on a layer too well aren't you scaling you are scaling trustless economic bandwidth are you not so i i totally agree with that last point robbie that we have to also broaden and expand the definition of scalability for these money systems i think david is going to take the next question for the panel yeah speaking of money systems the current form of getting value into ethereum is you you sign up with coinbase you sign up with gemiini you buy your ether and then you get it deposited to your own um your own ethereum address whether it's your metamask your ledger but that's like you getting injected with like your you know your first little amount of ether you're getting injected into the heart of manhattan where you don't really like things are scary um the the the l2 world is what really gets me bullish about the possibility of l2s is that each individual l2 offers a unique on-ramp possibility into ethereum where if people are playing um with like games on the immutable x platform what about the possibility of purchasing your nfts with your credit card on the immutable x and all of a sudden there's some value flow from you know the legacy world that you know the banked world into uh the immutable xl2 which is you know the next step into a bankless life so robbie let's start with you what what kind of things could could happen or do you have in the works with you know value flows directly onto the l2 that's not actually coming straight from ethereum yeah that's the whole point and i think that's why i we almost have a separate idea to to find more financial or d5l2s um is that what i specialize in is nfts that's obviously what we're trying to scale and i think nfts have the potential to capture an enormous amount of value in the real world uh that's video game assets for one there was 90 billion us dollars worth of in-game items not box copies literally the items uh sold last year to gamers um and they received zero dollars of real value they could sell none of that so i think that's a right market gamers are already digital natives and we're already seeing you know major companies starting to dip their toes to space whether it's the initiatives from ubisoft um who by the way the main thing they care about because the ubisoft uh you know blockchain team ultimately the thing that scares them is what if they put the ubisoft brand name on something that that ends up breaking that asset is taking um and so they fundamentally care about security that's why ethereum is going to be the winner because if you put world of warcraft on a blockchain you can't put it on a flow you can't put it on a you know a centralized sidechain which can't support that level of value the 200 billion plus worth of economic bandwidth of the ethereum can that's why i'm bullish and 100 the future is it's not people interacting with with apps and things maybe that's kind of a developer mindset and that's where a lot of this value originates it's hey this is the new asset for digital this is the new standard for digital assets if you want to interact with the game what you expect from your own ship quality is that you can sell it um and you don't even know you don't even need to know how the the security works under the hood you just know that hey these are the rights i get as a user i pay with a credit card i get these tradable properties and yes it's being minted into an l21 ethereum for free um via an api called by that games publisher and then i see it going way beyond gaming items as well i mean nfts have the potential to encapsulate the entire world's financial system outside of fundable tokens options contracts are unique uh financial contracts insurance contracts are based on the unique underlying circumstances at the home we've seen digital arts sell 100 million dollars worth this year we've seen um sports moments been tokenized it's this like fundamentally brand new world um and i think that that world belongs to the infrastructure of ethereum you'd love to hear it matt when can i get my bank account injected into the fiat or into with the loop ring l2 yeah i'm glad to know this is part of your bolt case for loopering now uh as you said before so i'll have to work harder on it but yeah i mean this is i guess like a pretty boring topic it's like how much effort and how hard could we work on like regulatory things right like we've been squarely in ethereum land for three and a half years it's it's nice that like we don't worry too much about regulation um it's you know it's i i kind of hate having to muddy up the waters with thinking about fiat and different jurisdictions and everything is just so much more simple on ethereum the uh global jurisdiction and stuff like that but so matt can i can i ask you a question that gets at the heart of this like so haven't the the crypto banks like coinbase and gemini and you know even finances some extent already figured that out like so why couldn't they just rather than withdraw to ethereum mainnet for my eth have a button that says withdraw to loop ring right and after i i make my purchases they're they're kind of the fiat bridge the fiat on ramp anyway i just want an on-ramp directly from these crypto banks directly to loopring and they could solve the regulatory stuff for you they already have that out of the box how close are we to something like that or is or is there some challenge with that that um we're not seeing right great point um and this is i guess a business so first of all that can be done right now they could have done that six months ago although now i guess gas fees sustainably high would be like a greater impetus on them because either they're swallowing the high gas costs to give their user assets in a reasonable time or they're passing it on to users for uh you know 10 15 withdrawal so this we have those conversations i guess a kind of maybe unexpected business answer for for loop ring specifically is so they could just use our api and forget looping the exchange the amm it's just this layer two where somebody could uh you know they could just throw some dye across and it goes to an ethereum address right there's no special you use your own ethereum address on loop ring there's no nothing funky that needs to happen just an api call and it ends up in this addresses kind of loop ring layer 2 shelf which all they need is their ethereum address to access but what i was going to say is it's a bit of a business case maybe they maybe some exchanges are reluctant to have some some some assets kind of pipe in to the loopering system because then we might eat their cake or eat their lunch a bit like right it's like why am i just zapping it into you where you are a finance that cannot act evil like why would binance like pipe a billion dollars of fiat through loopering in a day when those users kind of could like oh maybe i want to get off here and you know and continue using loop ring so i'm kind of if this wasn't already in people's head i kind of don't like saying it because maybe now i've given them a reason to uh to push back against us but um yeah the truth is like yeah sorry i i i see your point matt and like so so maybe a binance because they have their their eth killer you know the binance chain maybe they might be more reluctant to to do something with loop ring but it's like let me bring justin into this conversation here too and get his thoughts on this uh you know the the winklevoss twins are regular bankless listeners and they are very involved in uh in gemini the exchange of course like justin how do you get gemini to do a direct fiat on-ramp into the synthetics optimistic roll-up that you're building do you think that is the way forward to get fiat into the space or do you have an alternative idea on that what would you say to the to the winklevoss twins if they're listening now yeah i mean basically we just need a we just need a way for for these um like centralized exchanges for example to to get access to the tokens right like there's no reason why they couldn't um once they know the addresses the contracts and they've got you know they've got balances set up on layer two for their you know various you know wallets that's easy enough for them just to send off they could go okay those are just snx they can right now we have snx living on l2 um right now transfers are disabled because we're in the student mainnet thing but once the real mainnet comes along um there's no reason why they couldn't acquire snx have it set up on a certain wallet on l2 and then plug in a theater on-ramp and off they go bob's your uncle they could be like sp and then snx so there's no technical reason that they couldn't just do that and i'm just just curious uh justin your thoughts on on maybe all there has to be is kind of an economic reason to do this right so in the very early stages of ethereum no exchange supported ethereum but as it grew it became impossible to ignore and is that sort of what happens with layer two i mean matt's here on loop ring with 200 you know 50 million in total locked value you guys have 160 million if this is a billion or more does this just not become impossible for exchanges to ignore and they build those those ramps naturally because that's where the economic value is justin you see it playing out like that yeah i mean it's the same way like why they're listing all the why's binance listing every token under the sun i mean yeah exactly let's see if people are trading it like we just got to do it because it's like the market decides to dictate it you know yeah you know it's really we're just talking about developer cycles right so they've got to decide whether or not they want to invest the time and you know what it's like to to try to invest developer cycles that there's enough enough you know suits saying we need to do this for money then the developers usually have to get towed along and okay we'll do it so guys we have a lot of um folks that are into crypto investing obviously they're they're bullish on various defy tokens they're they're bullish on eth but there's a question i think of how layer two constructs might impact the underlying eth value capture thesis and i'm wondering robbie if you have any any thoughts on this are these layer two solutions value accretive to something like eth or they value competitive do they take away from eth's value proposition as a whole maybe we'll start with you robbie short answer l2's are the savior of ethereum's price they're the only thing holding back other scalability solutions who can offer ux that gives people the critical revenue they need right now but fundamentally don't use ethereum as a security or settlement layer from destroying us and i mean you know flo raised a quarter billion dollars the other day rome was on twitter saying you know ethereum is all great in that but flow is ready for mainstream nfts i don't think he's just trying to say that to mainstream nfts i think he's trying to say that he wants ethereum to be zero and he wants flow to be the dominant chain for all transactions and he thinks nfts are a good entry point to that now that's fine if you want to use flow um go ahead you can also use my old laptop with a database um and i'll run it for you for two million dollars a year um but fundamentally if you use the definition that you know you guys popularized which is capital asset um which is a form of economic bandwidth store of value um the only thing that means two things one you need to at some point consume it if you're not consuming eight you are not providing consumable demand for ethereum two you need to rely on ethereum as your layer one form of security that is the definition of a layer two by doing that you increase ethereum's value proposition via uh economic bandwidth so quite frankly i think any solution that is not a roll up on ethereum right now is is an eighth killer is an eighth competitor um you know even polka dot the way and the reason that everyone's positioning themselves is not east kilos is because it's a dumb thing to do like i don't want to swear it's it's like you're going to be hated by 200 billion dollars worth of capital it's not a smart move so their positioning is hey we're synergistic hey we're polka dot we're a para chain we're we're doing this this and this we're synergizing it's crap just look at the fundamentals either you use ethereum for your security and you consume it you're good for its value or you don't and you're not oh my god i really want to see the uh the podcast where it's a immutable x versus flow i would i want to see kind of that debate sound off now that i've heard robbie i'll have to be more polite guys uh matt justin any other thoughts on that value of creative we'll see matt any any comments robbie is a great uh spokesperson for that um no he's 100 right like we kind of lose sight about what the label layer two means like people say like anything scaling is layer two but yeah it has to be strict you have to inherit ethereum security guarantees which means you're paying gas um i like how he says that you know it still remains a consumable you're broadening the economic bandwidth because you're a little vertical or once uh david uh i was on here and he described ethereum as like a pier and then you go on to like your your loopering right at the end you know like so so these things like the end of that pier is like its own little economy where you know those are going to go in there's something it's it's a hundred percent creative and i i do think it it is just massively bullish roll ups uh yeah like people were talking maximalism before i'm a roll up maximalist and i'd even go so far you know maybe just to to chat to more friendly job here but like i'm a zk roll up person like i think those i think zq ellipse are kind of like here here now for the application specific stuff optimistic rollups are like right here and they're going to do a lot of generalizable stuff and then you know zk ropes kind of re-leap frog when you have like this the zk snark and the uh advances and then you do everything back in the validity proof way but yeah all it's just massively creative and i do you know it's funny robbie say about like the way they're positioning themselves i like to think that maybe i tried to coin something i'm not sure but like ethereum killers are rebranding themselves as enhancers well they don't use that word but i use that word everything must be enhancer now otherwise it's just really really stupid on you i mean we saw maybe a sound bite these past few days talking put like in putting that in jeopardy but um from different chains saying that there are no network effects that uh somebody may laugh when he hears about uh ethereum network effects but you have to respect the network effect you have to respect the network uh it's it's just um it's massively creative i don't know if there's a if there's even a bearish interpretation i haven't heard one of uh of layer two for ethereum besides the potential the composability breaking i don't see any kind of value um there's no leaky bucket where this kind of bypasses ethereum accruing the value in my opinion justin do you want to add anything to this conversation any thoughts here yeah i mean totally agree uh with both matt and robbie and robbie quite very eloquently uh i put forth his thesis that that you know the layer two needs to be something that relies underneath the security which i think is a really nice uh nice way to put a find on it um i guess my main thought and it's a bit more meta is that um one thing i really like about ethereum is i feel like it you know it's decentralized of course as robbie said but the way that it like it put this money where its mouth is in terms of the way the ef supports you know various implementations of the you know the protocol like you know the evm like here's here's a spec go on go at it right there's you know javascript hit rust yeah go and then the same thing with with uh right let's go with lighthouse prismatic you know and i feel like this is we're at the same thing with with roll-ups right like here are different implementations of rollups and and half out of it i think there is no one solution there are just the specifications based on um you know security um and usability and you know things people we are always sort of expected to to try different things out to iterate and things will bubble up the right things will bubble up and i love that about ethereum like i feel like there isn't this there isn't this this this you know dictator down on eyes saying this is the way it needs to be and you know credits are vitally because he does a pretty good job of trying to stand back and let things let things evolve around him rather than you know trying to try to maneuver and steal the you guys this has been such a fantastic conversation so thank you guys all for so much of your time and and your insights it's really valuable to me and of course also to the listeners and i want to finish up with this last final lightning question so in just two three four just a few sentences can you guys give us the maximally successful scenario of the long term version of your app so like when l2 is completely rolled out and also under the conditions of maximal global adoption what do you what does your app do when you have as much scale as you want and all of the things that you guys are trying to get done you do get done justin let's start with you the users can basically get a synthetic version of any kind of asset they want anyone around the world can take it and no one can stop them right they get access to whatever whatever they need whenever they need it and it's good quickly as they can and it doesn't cost them a nominal loan matt what's the maximally successful version of loop ring loopering out competing legacy fintech applications um you know we don't compete with each other on this call i mean some of us are not in the same verticals but just any user can trade any ethereum based asset so not synthetics not a synthetic asset but just if it's on ethereum or actually we can trade synthetics but um you know just trade anything instant finality um super cheap and payments as well just complete freedom you know we've started using the little slogan for our app freedom at your fingertips that is what ethereum allows us we can never misbehave nobody could take it from you nobody could stop you that's what we hope bloopering becomes matt you must be bearish because i was hoping in your answer you would have said the words venmo robin hood and central bank digital currencies but uh i guess i guess you're you're uh just focus on a little bit more more meta level right there true i wanted to keep it you know somebody actually brought it to my attention that on our site it says feeling you probably read it like venmo and robin hood and user experience but then they said do you still want to say robin hood on there should you remove that so uh but we haven't removed it yet give it all all this stuff but yeah uh um i'll leave it there robbie what's the maximally successful version of immutable and immutable x yeah i think it's the marketplace for all unique assets uh worldwide uh or the the exchange protocol that's it full stop all right you guys this has been such a fantastic episode again this we have robbie ferguson who is at the immutable project building out the marketplace for l2s for nfts we have matt feinstone business development at loopering the zk rollups exchange and payments protocol protocol and of course we have justin moses cto of synthetics leading the charge to deploy synthetics on optimistic roll-ups you guys this is it i think the listeners are really going to enjoy this one so thank you so much for giving us your time and being here thank you so much thank you thank you guys all right bankless listeners action items if you want a primer on rollups we just had vitalik on the show who gives a great overview of rollups in sort of layman's language we will include a link to that in the show notes we will also include links to loop ring immutable x and synthetics new optimism l2 because here's the great thing you can start using layer two now today it's here as our panel said so start using it uh you don't have to to keep uh with with on the main net in the gas feed transactions we could start using loopering immutable and synthetics now on layer two also david last and final request we want those bull market stars on itunes how we doing on our five-star ratings on itunes my friend uh we are always trying to do better than where we currently are at uh as you guys listened to during this podcast l2 is here but yet people somehow don't realize it yet and you know why it's because we don't have enough five star reviews on islands why that's exactly if you could please go to wherever you listen to your podcast and give us those five star reviews we're trying to get bank lists to the top of the itunes business and investing charts so that everyone can hear the great gospel of ethereum so if you could please go ahead and do that we would really appreciate it all right if you if you care about l2 give us those five star reviews that's what david said all right wrists and disclaimers everyone eath is risky so is crypto of course as is defy you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
