hey Dawson what certify earnify is the airdrop Checker artifies a web 3 notification tool that will let you know of all the things you have to go claim for your wallet claim for your wallet what does that mean so claiming for your wallet is things like airdrops whitelists nft mints and if I will check you for all these and let you know instantly what you have to go claim why do I need it you need it because without earnify you don't know when you have unclaimed assets this is tens of thousands of dollars sometimes that are just out there waiting for you for your wallet specifically how many people use earnify there are over 250 000 people who trust ernify for notifications okay so with earnify I plug in my ethereum address and it tells me what airdrops I can collect right exactly it allows you to do that for not just one address either you can do it up to 10 addresses up to 10 addresses and so how much money have you made people there are over 150 million dollars worth of airdrops that have been found through earnify since launching two years ago 150 million dollars so people have put in their ethereum addresses multiple of them into earnify and earnify has helped them claim 1.5 million dollars not just 1.5 million 150 million dollars oh excuse me 150 million dollars that's amazing what why did you make earnify what inspired you to make it you know I'm a crypto D gen just like all of you I found that I had unclaimed airdrops that I didn't know about and so I made this tool originally for myself to check my wallets and then it turned out that a lot of other people wanted the exact same set of features so is it just airdrops it is much more than just airdrops so earnify began originally from a hackathon two years ago as the airdrop Checker and now ernifies expanded to pull-up tokens nft mints whitelists and many other things like pull-up Raffles for just all the free things that you don't know about yet for your wallets so what do I get if I sign up for earnify if you sign up for earnify you're gonna be able to check your addresses right now but you will also be signed up for email notifications when you match a new claimable asset in the future so this means that when an airdrop goes live you can be the first to know that your wallets are in that airdrop but you can you can also pay for earnify right what what do you get if you pay for earnify if you're a serious defy user you should pay for earnify because you'll be able to watch more than just two addresses you'll be able to watch up to 10 and that means that you will get these email notifications for up to 10 of your addresses so you'll know more about all of the addresses that you have and all the assets that you can go claim how is certified different from any other airdrop notification service airdrops much more than just an airdrop notification service airdrop is the highest quality there are zero spam allowed everything is manually reviewed tested and checked to make sure that it's worth your time not just your time but also your money because I believe just like everyone else who is on the bankless journey that we should stay safe and avoid some of these spam issues some of these bankruptcy issues that we've been seeing over in the C5 world what are earnify's plans for the future is there a roadmap earnify has huge plans for the future Beyond just airdrops earnify is going to be checking you for all the things that your wallet can have so when new nfts job you can be notified of that when your ens names are about to expire you can be notified of that when anything happens on chain you need to be enabled to respond to that with something like vernify to notify you right away to go take action maybe your D5 loans are about to get liquidated maybe the ens name you've always wanted is about to go up for auction and you can bid on it and if I will notify you of all these things in the future
