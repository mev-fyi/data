the idea of privacy is we should have the right of financial privacy even though bad actors will also have that right the government cannot search your persons houses papers and effects without a warrant and that's true for bad guys too right the government can't just come barging into your house even if you might be doing something illicit right the right to privacy matters more than the right of the government to surveil everything that we do to catch every single you know person who might be violating some law and i think that crypto has presented a really stark challenge for us because we are now dealing with a disintermediated financial system this is very different from how anti-money laundering laws have worked in the past government has been pretty comfortable with crypto for the last 10 years because the blockchains are public and they can surveil transactions anyway they don't need an intermediary tornado cash changes all of that these privacy preserving technologies fundamentally challenge the ability of government to continue with this warrantless surveillance program that they've come to be very comfortable with and that they want to continue
