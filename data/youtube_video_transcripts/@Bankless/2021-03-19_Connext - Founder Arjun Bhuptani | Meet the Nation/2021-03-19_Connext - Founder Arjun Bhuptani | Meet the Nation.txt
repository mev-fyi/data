[Music] hey guys welcome to this meet the nation with connects i talked to arjun bhuttani who has been with connect since day one and people that have been following the ethereum space for since like 2017 will will know connects as the team behind payments channels but connects has really moved around and really tried to reorganize where they can fit their payment channel infrastructure their payment channel tech into the ecosystem but now with this emerging landscape of various separated roll-ups and separated l2s connects really has found what i think is going to be their true purpose and their true legacy which is making sure that hopping between l2s is fast and instant and up to the user experience that people not in crypto really want to experience which is just fast and easy settlements between l2s they're really doing a fantastic job of making sure that fractured composability in l2s doesn't actually stay fractured and connects operates as like this mesh layer between of liquidity between all these l2s it's really fascinating what i thought what i really enjoyed about this episode is it's so much it's so much uh there is a history lesson here about the history of ethereum there is conversations about like just the development and progress of payment channel tech which is one important component of ethereum there's the conversation of making watching connext develop with ethereum there's the conversation of public goods and how state channels can represent public goods and how connext is building out these public goods i really really enjoyed this conversation with arjun so let's go ahead and get right into that conversation but first we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave.com if you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with d5 tokens and products you need to download the dharma mobile app dharma is a non-custodial smart contract wallet and comes with a bridge that connects you right into your bank account drama is the fastest and most efficient wallet between your fiat and your bank account and any token on unit swap or even any vault in urine with dharma you can get over 25 000 dollars per week into the dfi universe and you

d-h-a-r-m-a-dot io download the darba app and get yourself unbanked today all right bankless nation i am here with arjun bhuptani who is a the project lead at connects and connects has been with ethereum almost every step of the way since uh the early days before even i got into ethereum and connects has been tinkering and working with different ways to help ethereum scale in a very specific way and so we are going to get into that introduction what connects is what it's doing now because there is a whole new frontier that connects fits into which is the worlds of l2 as well and so arjun welcome to uh welcome to the bankless nation thanks so much david so let's get into it let's where did connect start and what has it's been like original goal and original aspirations as a project yeah absolutely um so uh we started connects in 2017 so we have been around for quite a while um this is before like the first uh ico bubble and like boom that made everything crazy um we we originally started connects with just this like goal of uh trying to get ethereum into the hands of as many people as possible um so trying to make it as usable as user-friendly and as easy to like interact with as possible so that way people can can can use this new infrastructure because we have this like firm belief that ethereum and other kinds of decentralized infrastructure are like uh are going to be like one of the most equalizing forces in our society today um we started out by we actually started doing something completely completely different so we were originally a credit card processing uh api uh we started working with visa and mastercard trying to get uh basically allow people to buy tokens directly with cards um and uh and that was that's was going well until they until like the you know 2018 cryptokitties craziness happened um at which point we uh the the the interest in the space changed dramatically the uh the like um both from it from like a like a scalability standpoint and then also from like uh the way that regulated regulators perceived it and so like a lot of the conversations that we've been having with regulators movies and mastercard change from like oh this is really interesting to like oh most of things are going to be buying our scam which at the time was actually fair um so we ended up pivoting a bit because we we realized that uh our own customers were dealing with like uh or at least the the customers that we'd plan to integrate with we're dealing with other problems associated with scalability which were just much more pressing than even uh being able to get to the point where cards was an option um and we started working with spank chain uh at the time uh on on state channels um uh amine kind of helped open this whole world of state channels up for us and we we shipped the first ever non-custodial payment channel hub on ethereum uh in partnership with bank chain in like like end of summer 2018. um arjun i actually want to cut you off there because i this is actually starting to to be a history of ethereum that i i'm familiar with so i want to add my own commentaries and so before before the ico mania which really peaked in the late stages of 2017 people understood what ethereum could do at a very high level right and people understood like okay we have this new primitive erc20 tokens we don't really know what they can be but we know that they can be really cool stuff uh they can be currencies they could be they could be uh you know what we now know as defy tokens they can really be anything people didn't really know but people knew that people were going to be using tokens to transact and that people would need to be able to purchase these tokens so it sounded like connect started off with like all right well people are going to need to be able to buy these tokens to play in the apps right we don't know what the tokens that they are going to want to buy we don't know what the apps are that they're going to want to do but they're going to need to buy tokens so we know tokens are like an integral part of ethereum and so you guys were trying to bridge payment payment processors visa into purchasing tokens yet the evolution of tokens kind of did a rug pull on you we're like well some of these tokens are going to be either scams or securities or something else right and so there was a pivot to um payments directly on ethereum which is what you guys were doing with uh with spanx chain and spain chain uh it's it's for those that probably haven't been paying attention since 2017 or 2018 listeners are probably like what the hell is this bank chain thing spain chain is a mean solomonies project which is trying to democratize access uh for sex workers to sell their products on ethereum they are typically a very censored industry uh and using uh ethereum l1 for uh payments natively on ethereum is kind of cumbersome which is where connex comes back into play so i kind of just wanted to give that a little bit of history and context for the listeners would you say that was accurate would you add anything on to that history no i think that's perfectly accurate um and and you know i think the only thing i would add is that like um i think a big part of what drove us to to work with bangtan was just this like belief in um in the way that like like that that industry is really just quintessentially perfect for for crypto right like it's a it's an industry where there's just been widespread exploitation as a result of like not having good access to payment infrastructure and like that's the whole reason that this industry was created in the first place and i would also say quintessentially perfect for connects because you guys are specifically with payments right yep uh yeah we were um so that's actually that brings me to kind of our next the next leg of our journey and it has been a bit of a journey because uh the narrative for ethereum the narrative for connection overall just the way that this technology has evolved has really changed over the last few years um so you know at the time when we were building state channels there were really no other options for scalability like plas even at the time plasma didn't even exist so um and like rollups were had not had not been conceived of it it would be years before rollups were conceived of the word was not uttered yeah exactly um so we uh we we started working with with folks within the space uh basic basically early early pioneers that were interested in like integrating um scalability solutions metamask was actually really really helpful with this we integrated uh a feature to metamask called instapay which is basically like venmo like interactions on metamask mobile um but we we kind of kept running into these these issues with like uh you know with payments in general and i think this is something that a lot of people have tried to do payments on ethereum and payments in crypto in general have found that like actually the crypto payment space um is really really difficult to break into uh because as it turns out most of the a big part of the reason why people were using crypto at the time was actually this new space called defy that was right when d5 was starting to take off and right when people were starting to pay attention to it um and and arguably that's that's actually the main reason why we've ended up in the position where we are today where once again like 20 2017 2018 uh now ethereum gas costs are skyrocketing block space is really really scarce and we have these and unlike unlike in 2018 we actually have these like legitimate use cases that people are using every single day associated with decentralized finance um so uh one thing that we we ended up doing uh over the course of the last couple of years was like uh there were a lot of open questions for us um there's open questions around state channels so how what are the right ways to actually build these things and people you know despite the fact that these things have been talked about for a long time they're really important practical like engineering problems with them um and then two what is the what was the real narrative for state channels because it didn't seem like payments was the narrative right it seemed like um scale when people were thinking about scalability they weren't just thinking okay well let's make payments specifically faster they were thinking let's make take uniswap or like other kinds of ethereum based applications and run them in an environment which is exactly the same as what exists right now but just with lower cost let's make everything faster not just payments right exactly yeah so we um we went through a bit of like an identity crisis to be honest for for a little bit because we we needed to figure out where where um state channels and where we fit into this broader ecosystem um and then in and can i cut you off again um can we take a moment to actually define what state channels are yes uh yeah that's actually a good good good thing to do so a state channel is basically a way to batch up a bunch of transactions um that are happening on a blockchain so a really really really simple example is um uh you know the quint this is this is an overused beating the dead horse example let me guess bar tab bar tab um the bar type example is just great because it's like it is exactly what a state channel is right you you go to uh a bar you give them your card and so you're basically like locking up your funds with them uh they have the ability to take your funds if you if you don't uh pay them right and they've got the collateral right they've got the card exactly and uh and and then what you do is you basically just tell you buy drinks and you you add to your tab and at the end of the the night you just close out your tab and you pay like one transaction for all of your drinks um same core concept applies here like a really really stupidly simple payment channel would be like uh uh two out of two multisig um i put you know between you and me david and i put i put like ten dollars into it and then instead of sending you like a hundred ten cent transactions on chain i send you like a hundred signatures um any signature just updates my balance and gives you the ability to withdraw more and more money from this thing um and okay so so for context for for super new listeners what's really cool about public private key cryptography is you can using your private key you can make a transaction but not necessarily deploy it to ethereum you can make that transaction and then hand it off to someone else and be like all right here's my transaction and because you've signed it with your private key you and you it's a legitimate transaction so anyone can cash that transaction into ethereum and so you like sometimes maybe some some users of their ledger or metamask have uh have run into this where like instead of asking to make a transaction on ethereum with gas costs they just ask you to sign something and this is a very common like way to log into websites is that you just sign something which proves that you are the owner of said wallet right and so this is how a a bar tab on ethereum would work in a state channel where you sign a transaction but instead of deploying it to ethereum you hand it to your counterparty and that's the bar tab that you guys have um between you guys between the two parties exactly yeah that's exactly right honestly signatures are just cryptographic magic they're they underpin everything that happens in the space and then also pretty much everything that happens on the internet so it's just pretty pretty important um so yeah we we um uh fast forward to uh i think late last year um i think about like september of 20 2020. um we uh we there was this uh there's all of this like uh basically basically like i think it was like september of 2020 reddit announced um that they were going to do like a bake off a scalability bake off um to figure out whether or not like they could deploy their stuff on ethereum and to what scalability solution to use um and that was a really really interesting uh call to action for not just for the broader scalability community but also for us specifically because we started looking out at reddit's requirements and started looking out at the kinds of things that other people were building and realized okay like if we want to do this with state channels we're gonna have to build a really really custom thing and that was a big part of the problem that we'd been running into with other customers too was every single time we went to go integrate state channels it was ending up being like a really custom thing so it was taking months to get to get them onboarded um and and so we actually said okay well instead of trying to compete with all these solutions on something doing something that we're probably not gonna be as good at um you know like you could you could deploy an evm compatible rollup and you could run all the re like the reddit requirements scalability requirements on that roll up and you could do that in the same way that you run them on ethereum so uh why why would you ever use a really custom built piece of software for it um and and so we we decided instead of competing with these with these other options why not collaborate with them and we we had been playing around with this idea of what if you used state channels as a mechanism to communicate between different layer two scalability solutions um and the way that this works is that um with state channels you can do something called hop transactions so uh you know david you and i have a channel with each other uh you know you and i have a bar tab with each other and then uh you have a bar tab with somebody else let's say bob um if i want to interact with bob basically what i can do is instead of um it's sort of like the havala system we're like i can pay you in order to pay bob and because of again the magic of cryptography and the magic of signatures we can do that in a way where my transaction to you doesn't unlock until you complete your transaction to bob um now that actually comic it's an atomic transaction right exactly yeah now that core concept is actually super powerful for going across chains because there's no real requirement that my transaction to you has to happen on the same chain as your transaction develop and that's really kind of the secret sauce here is that um you can use connex channels and you can use the existing hopped transactions that we're already doing and that even even other channel systems like the lightning network do you can take that exact same construction deploy it on a bunch of different chains and use it to transfer value across chains effectively what you're doing is you're doing a swap with somebody who is an intermediary who's a liquidity provider so in this case david you would be the liquidity provider so we we took this concept and we turned it into it i'm going to cut you off again when you say across chains how what what kind of change are we talking about are we just talking about roll-ups and or things that all settle back to ethereum or are we talking about between ethereum cosmos and polka dot like what what kind of scope of these chains are we talking about yeah that's a good question um because you could so you can run lightning on bitcoin obviously um and uh and you can also run lightning style transfers on connects because we're sort of a more generalized system so we can support any kind of abstract conditional transfer a little bit more technology magic there but like the core idea is that like because ethereum is more expressive we can just do a lot more with it and because we can support lightning style transfers you could do you could build this with lightning too and you could build like a connection from lightning into connection there's actually people who are doing this um and so you could uh you can do these kinds of cross-chain transfers between evm compatible chains um and with a little bit of additional work you can also do them to things like bitcoin uh to zk roll ups to uh cosmos to really just anything you could even do it to a bank account uh which is so we could bridge like optimus optimistic roll up ck roll up so we could bridge the loop rings ek roll ups with binance smart chain via a connex payment network yes exactly very cool and uh in fact that's actually happening so we've been we have users that are currently doing transfers between like uh matic x die and binance um and we have uh you know we've done as part of our actually as part of our demo for the reddit scalability challenge um we we shipped a demo that had support out of the box for uh arbitrary optimism uh scale matic x die and one other one i don't remember so many so many that you've forgotten one yeah exactly um and it was it was really easy because basically like our core contracts can be deployed anywhere um you know of course for non-evm compatible stuff we need to like write a bit of a custom implementation but like the core ideas are the exact same everywhere and uh and so it didn't from our perspective it doesn't really matter what chain you're connected to uh which is which is really cool uh so that that makes connects relatively blockchain agnostic right like you just kind of care where where the liquidity is where the demand is where the people want to transact are exactly yeah and so this kind of makes connect something closer to like middleware or like inter blockchain where would you accept those that terminology yes exactly and i think that's that's our mental model as well is that there's this like new middleware stack of protocols that's that's appearing uh that that basically uh are a bunch of protocols that are used across all of these different chains and like form like a baseline set of utilities that that are like the backbone of defy and of a lot of these other uh like a lot of the things that a lot of the innovation that's happening like other protocols that fall into this example include link and the graph for instance um and they all have the same strategy they're all trying to deploy to as many chains as possible to be this like agnostic like network that allows you to have the same information everywhere um very cool i'd like to get your opinion on different middleware strategies because this is what connex has is one strategy but cosmos also comes to mind uh and maybe polka dot does as well but maybe less so than cosmos but like cosmos is a blockchain and it's like a network of blockchains like an internet of blockchains and that's also kind of what mattock tries to position itself as too so how how would you compare and contrast the pros and cons of a cosmos or and and ren wren's the ren protocol is also a great middleware system for inter blockchain communication how would you compare and contrast cosmos ren and connects and if you could talk about the pros and cons of each yeah absolutely so um there's a bunch of different approaches out there for interoperability and we know that we're going into this space that's like actually been worked on for quite a while and we have something that we think is very unique because it has very very good trust tradeoffs and because it's very flexible but we also exist know that there's an existing body of work here there's there's a few different approaches and i'll just like kind of cover them all independently so there's you mentioned ren that's one of the approaches where you have some sort of uh like mpc multiparty computation thing basically just a bunch of people like mutually agreeing to see that a certain asset was locked up on one chain and then you're minting it on another chain and so you get you get things like wrapped btc or tbtc things like that that are um that are basically just like a representation of btc on ethereum that can be used as part of ethereum's dfi ecosystem those things are really cool um however any kind of mpc system so first of all those things are really interesting for uh bringing those like that kind of value to a specific chain and we think that there's a really really important role that that plays um we when we think of interoperability we typically think of like okay i am a user and i want to interact with an application that's on a different chain and so things like tbtc and wbtc don't solve that problem um but instead the problem that they solve is being able to actually use these things in other environments because you can't run d5 on bitcoin um now there are trade-offs there uh the trade-off there is that right now there really isn't a trustless way to do that um at all like pretty much necessarily this is the the same problem with like thor chain and other kinds of things like necessarily your validator set is going to be smaller than the validator set of ethereum so like the security that you have using these protocols is necessarily going to be lower than the security of ethereum or of bitcoin it's going to be the security of the protocol itself and you have to consider what that means so like you know if if uh if there's a hundred million dollars worth of btc minted on rent protocol um then uh and like the the economic backing of rent protocol is only 10 million dollars then now there's a huge incentive for for rent to rug pull everybody um so that's that's like a risk there um you then have other approaches like cosmos like cosmos ibc and stuff like that and those are actually really cool because um that is actually truly native like inter chain communication use usable for like chain to chain contract calls and things like that and that's actually some of the same core concepts around like cross-linking with each two shards when the easter road map wasn't like more around focused around roll ups it was more focused around like actual shards um and uh and i think that's really interesting but then it that also makes a few assumptions so like cosmos works because cosmos and polka dot work because all cosmos and poco.chains are like the same they have they ship with the same like core functionality and the miners are mining this uh this chain which has built-in functionality to accept information from other chains ethereum chains don't have that they just they aren't built that way um and the other the other piece of that is that that is kind of we kind of think of interoperability as also having its own like stack we think of that as like layer one interoperability where like you have these like on-chain interactions that are happening and we're kind of a layer too where we sit on top of all of that so like you you could use something like cosmos or basically some mechanism of like really truly trustless on-chain communication you can use that as a way to like rebalance liquidity within connects but that doesn't negate the reason to have connects to begin with and in general connects will be faster and cheaper than those options it will be like uh you know if you if you today i think i was talking to um james prestwich about this and you we were talking about like the possibilities of building uh bridges to other evm compatible chains like zello and things like that and we were talking about what it what it looks like in a pos system and um while it's possible you would end up using like the vast majority of the gas in a block just to do a single transaction so like it's it's definitely not something that you would do for each user every single time they make a transfer okay so so to recap cosmos and wren these are really great for like you said l1 communications which means porting over assets from one blockchain to another which is specifically not what connects does kinex just manages value transfer which is independent agnostic to the assets right and so while with connects you know bitcoin on the lightning network will stay as bitcoin on the lightning network and then whatever the ending chain is that will all those things will stay separate but we can still pass value we can still make transactions between these things and so these are not these are not really competitive at all these are just different ways of having communication between blockchains um and that that communication between blockchains and also rollups is also i think really important and that's kind of what i what i want to turn to next because a huge amount of concern perhaps about both sharding and also a a many roll-up environment has brought in the concern of the lack of composability or the lack of interoperability or the lack of fractured liquidity right and so if uh if uniswap is on the optimistic rollups uh that is taking away from the liquidity that is on the loop ring roll up which is on a zk roll up so if things are on across separate roll-ups people are concerned that there will be less liquidity um can you talk about how connects can help with roll-up to roll-up communication and if it does could you also talk about roll-ups back to ethereum main chain communication yep absolutely um so oh it's a big topic um so i think i think one thing that people i i think one thing that's not super clear to people right now is that in general when when people think about roll ups and layer two scalability they think of it as like kind of a silver bullet solution where like either of two things happens either you have like one roll up that beat that is just like the singular rollup and that is the layer two um or you have many roll-ups and but they'll be able to like interact with each other um and i think both of those things are are kind of false um the one roll up ecosystem doesn't make a lot of sense because uh if you only have one roll up and everybody is validating that one roll up all you've done is really just like increase the cost of validating transactions on ethereum and at that point pretty much what you could do is just like increase the gas limit and it would be the same same yeah it's antithetical right exactly um and uh and then even in the multi roll up paradigm i think something that people don't understand is that like we are living in a very privileged world right now because um all of our transactions on ethereum are synchronous so like when you make a transaction you you are going to get back a response in that same block but that's not really how like any system on the internet and production works right like all systems on the internet are actually asynchronous because you can't really track the communication between these systems let's define that real quick asynchronous and synchronous so synchronous means that all clocks are tuned to the exact same time by law right and asynchronous means like well this one system will do its thing and this other system will do its thing and i think the the fact that we call them asynchronous means that they aren't synced right but even communicating that means that they are actually connected somehow so like you know asynchronous is like well each are independent but they are still independent uh dependent systems ultimately maybe you could elaborate on that as well yeah absolutely so like a good example would be like um when you make a google search right so like you connect to google.com and uh if you i mean otherwise you just type it into your search bar but um you connect to google.com and and it opens up the page and then you you actually submit the request for a search um when you do that google has like internal systems where um it's it's a it's a massive distributed system right they have they have like a bunch of computing servers and they have like databases and they have all these other things and so google has to go and like fetch all of that data for you and it takes time to do that so it's not like you query something from google and then uh like the second that you that that request hits google it now responds back to you now there's this like further step of google needing to go get data from its databases and then perhaps needing to go get further data from other people other parties and so on the internet in general this is kind of how communication works you have you have like requests and then those requests propagate further requests and so on and so forth and you don't if you're a server and you're making a request you don't know when you're going to get a response and so you don't want to like you don't want to just stop operating uh in that time you want to continue doing other things because you don't know if a response will even come back on a blockchain what this means is that um right now when you do it do something on chain it takes one block so like an like a uniswap swap takes like one block and at the end of that block you're gonna you're gonna get back a response um we're going to have to fundamentally change that paradigm for a lot of things where now you might have to send a transaction and then that transaction may kick off other transactions on other chains and then at some point in the future you'll have to know that you'll have to like collect data from those other chains and know okay things finished over there let me now send a uh completion transaction back on the main chain that i was interacting with to finish whatever i was doing right the final output and i do want to harp on this point one more time because like under a world where the internet is one massive synchronous system that means that the internet is completely centralized somehow right like there's the only way that that could be true is if the internet was actually just one single database which means it wouldn't be the internet it would be something else right and so like there is like this juxtaposition behind like ethereum is this decentralized protocol but there's just ethereum it's centralized on itself right and so there could be other chains that are not just ethereum that are what we are calling asynchronous that move independently and that independence is anti-fragility right like not having uh dependence on one canonical just clock allows other app other l2s other applications to optimize in what they want to do and do that thing best and not have to be dependent on other systems and it's that asynchronous that allows for flexibility and scale yet now we have this problem which connects us trying to solve which is interoperability and liquidity and just value transfer exactly so um that brings us to this like bigger liquidity question so like when we when we think about interoperability and communication stuff like a big thing that we're concerned with right now is just like transferring value um you can use connects to call contracts across chains too but that's something that like uh there's people working on it but we haven't really like prioritized it as much just because we think it's like the 80 20 case we're like transferring value and swapping value is gonna be like 80 of the usage um so that brings us to this really interesting question around like okay well how do you if i have money on arbitrary and i want to uh call a uniswap contract on optimism or i wanted to spot send money to somebody on optimism how do i do that um and with the existing mechanisms what you would have to do is like exit your money from arbitrary which takes a week and then and then onboard your money into optimism uh in both cases you're paying like l1 gas costs and you're waiting a week to do it um i think realistically no user is ever going to do that and it kind of breaks the whole point of scale like okay great like this actually i i have scale here but if i want to go over there then i have to go back through the congested part and i have to do it twice right exactly um so instead what you can do with connects is just swap value in place on arbitrary for value and place on optimism and the mechanism here is kind of like uniswap whereas like you have like basically kind of taking a step back to where we talked about earlier where you as a you david in this transfer from me to bob you were this intermediary who's a liquidity provider we call those liquidity providers routers um so you would have a router that has liquidity pools on optimism and a router that has liquidity pools on arbitrary and uh that router would be giving a swap price between those two liquidity pools and you as a user would be able to pretty much exactly the same way as you do with uniswap today swap you know uh uh usdc on arbitrum for usdc on on optimism um or on ethereum or really on any other other system that we can support um and and in theory usdc on optimism or ether on arbitrary or any other asset there's no reason why it can be a transfer of assets as well right exactly yeah um and that's that's definitely something that's pretty interesting as well it's like you you um you know we for the most part most people have been thinking of of like cross-chain transfers as like uh you know i have us i have usdc or i have eth here and i want that eth over here but in reality to us at least it doesn't really matter what the asset is we just defined some swap rate between these pools and um and uh you could do like east to usdc you could do you know whatever fun token to something else uh whatever you'd like okay so the calculus for a user would be like all right i'm on optimism unit swap optimism and i want to want to get to arbitrary and i want to get my assets are uh to to that l2 so got to make a transaction that gets me off of the uniswap optimistic rolex back onto ethereum that takes me up to two weeks or something crazy like that which and it also cost me gas and then i have to make an l1 transaction to get over to the arbitrarium l2 which is another transaction but i'm already on the l1 so that could be one block but that could also be a large gas fee uh and then i'm back into the arbitrum l2 which i think happens instantly but definitely costs more gas but then once i'm there i'm if i ever want to leave it's going to be another two weeks and so exactly let's see two two gas fees and two weeks versus a connect system where instead you find an intermediary which this can be protocolized and using me as the example i would be the intermediary i say look well you have your ether on the optimistic roll up on you as well and you would like it to be on on optimism i have ether on both sides and you can give me your one eth on this side and i'll give you 0.99 eth on that side and it will happen instantly and you'll probably save on gas and you'll definitely save on two weeks yes yeah exactly it's a it's a massive cost saving because like even i mean uh even if we charge like unit swap style fees where i think it's like point three percent or something like that um you still end up saving like ten twenty dollars on gas which is crazy and that should be really lucrative for market makers who would be like to as well you know i can charge even more than uniswap because i'm saving people on gas right depending on the fee size hey guys don't go anywhere we have so much left to talk about with arjun something that i think that is super fascinating is how connex manages to load balance value across different l2s is really really cool uh you definitely stay tuned for that but we got to take a quick moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eath bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemini.com go bankless if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defy is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today my my question is how do you manage orders and or like if if there are many different competing liquidity providers how does a market rate come come out and how do people find each other how do how do markets get matched yes that is a very very good question so um where we are right now is we allow people to spin up like their own individual routers uh routers can connect to like as many chains as they'd like um and you and they define their own swap rates and you can kind of like swap over this router um that's kind of the like v0 solves the bare bones problem implementation but the idea is that you can take this atomic component and um turn it into what is effectively like a marketplace um so the the way that you you kind of solve those problems that you mentioned where it's like how do you how do you as a user get information about the entire market of routers um all of the liquidity that's out there and turn that into a single price the single best price that you can swap over is we we have a like we've designed like an auction system effectively um so users would be when when they when they join this network they signal to the network saying okay i want i want to send eth on so and so a chain oh i'm like arbitrary and i want to receive usdc on optimism they would broadcast the entire network and then you would have routers basically submit bids to the user for the cheapest price that they're willing to facilitate that transfer for um and uh as in that's automated right that's not something like people don't have to be like hey user request this and then people are like well i'll give them this yield no this is an automated thing yeah it's fully automated it would happen like it's fully non-custodial fully automated happens for the user the broadcasting part happens like within their browser so we like from a technical perspective the way that we like uh there's we basically have like a browser node and a server node um and we have two implementations of connects which uh can live in two different environments and both of those implementations just run our protocols and one of the protocols would be this like broadcasting mechanism to like say hey i want to do an auction and i want to i'm willing to pay so like i'm willing to accept uh fees of up to so and so um and uh and then on the other side uh you have routers uh and all of these routers are just like servers people are running at home you could run them on a dap node eventually the idea is like they're simple enough that you just spin it up and you don't ever need to touch it you just throw some liquidity in it and it generates yield for you and and these routers automatically participate in this auction so like if a router says okay well i actually have this liquidity um i have you know in the example that we mentioned before like i have a lot of liquidity available in usdc on optimism i don't have a lot of liquidity available in ethan arbitram and i want more liquidity in eth i'm going to give so and so price and we automate this process uh we can actually attach it to an amm curve so it is quite literally like you and swap um and uh and in that case what that means is all of the the price that the user sees is the aggregated lowest price across all of the routers in the network that are willing to supply that liquidity that is that is mind-blowingly cool i want to you i think you just touched on it but i want to dive deeper into this say say there is a imbalance in l2s where like somehow too much usdc and too much eth is on one specific l2 and we need to rebalance the system because all of a sudden demand is shifting and supply shifting how how will the system rebalance and i'm assuming there's economic incentives involved how does this system uh self-correct yeah that's a that's a really good question because that's basically like what we've been thinking through in the last two weeks as well um so i've caught up all the way to where you guys are now look we started in 2017 and we're at today yeah it's awesome these are these are excellent questions because you've gotten us right to the the core of of the the problem in the core of everything that we're doing um so um right now the way that it works and this is a giant pain in the ass is that routers have to manually rebound so they need to come up with some mechanism to take funds on so and so chain and then like move them to zone so chain so like a good example is like uh we're running there's like a few people running routers on matic right now and they're using that as a way to get into an automatic really quickly from ethereum because right now to get entomatic takes like i think seven to eight minutes and then getting automatic takes like up to three hours which is absolutely brutal for user experience um now what we've seen is that because each gas prices are high most of the traffic is actually unidirectional most people are trying to get off of ethereum and automatic um and so very frequently what ends up happening is if you're running a router that has like you know 50k in on each side and then 50k on the magic side you end up with like a bunch of transfers in eth like coming to you in eath and you send out a bunch of transfers in matic and now all of your liquidity is on each side so you have 100k liquidity on each side and zero on thematic side uh and so then you have to do this really annoying thing where you now send funds to the existing matic pos bridge and the good thing is you only have to do this once and you don't care as much about the user experience because you're a router but to send funds to the existing mavic prs bridge to rebounds that doesn't work at scale because um not every pair of chains and every pair of assets has a a way to be rebound so a really good example of this is like we have we've been speaking to people about running a router on bsc and there's there's a couple of example routers up there already and bsc ethereum doesn't the bridge is sort of there not all the time because finance frequently frequently shuts down that bridge so if binance shuts down that bridge what do you do about rebalancing well one option that was suggested was okay well you could actually just go and sell your liquidity on binance and then like back into fiat and then buy it back on ethereum and now you've rebounded through fiat which is which is great the problem is if you're if you're a router doing that then now you need a high frequency like high volume trading account because you're moving hundreds of thousands of dollars potentially every day through finance um and that doesn't work and doesn't scale so what we realized was that like the core problem is that the process of rebalancing is centralized right now right now the router needs to be the one that does it ideally what would happen is that you can incentivize users to do it you can incentivize people to write their own arbitrage bots or to just like see market inefficiencies and and do this themselves and uh and so we started looking at good examples of how this works in the market and like unispot it and of course other mm's are the best example of this because the whole idea is like you know people for for unbalanced liquidity people will be willing to pay like have more slippage um in order to to like make this trade happen but on the other side you have people that will literally earn that will earn money by by rebalancing liquidity back to the the actual price so like a good example is like if i go to the ether usdc pool on unit swap and i buy you know a 100 million dollars worth of usdc um i've driven up the the ratio of those prices i've driven up the heath price they're according like in perspective of usdc however the eth's die price might still be different so now there's this arbitrage opportunity where a person can go and say okay well i have a bunch of money in eth i'm going to go and like buy a bunch of dye convert it to usdc somewhere else and then like sell all that usdc on unispot and i'm going to rebalance this thing and by doing that i'm gonna make you know a few hundred thousand bucks or something like that um so that's that's kind of our approach here is that in the long run the way that we think this network will work is that each router will be attached to their own uh amm curve they will they would all be tracking the balance between different liquidity pools that they are supporting uh very very similarly to a uniswap lp and as those pools become unbalanced the swap rate improves uh in it you know in one of the two directions and now because you have this auction mechanism where you're kind of aggregating the swap rates and fees of all of these routers uh any user that comes and tries to swap that asset will now automatically be paired with the most unbalanced router so the network kind of just continually self rebalances really really interesting and elegant yeah wow holy that is so cool i'm going to get back to this but i wanted to go on a little uh add a little tidbit it's like i was listening to this uh planet money podcast forever ago and it was the problem was it it was one of these like um bike rental services i don't know if whatever city you live in uh but we have the uber uber bikes lime bikes in seattle where you can just hop on a bike except they the the company had this massive problem where all the bikes would converge in the same spots over and over and over again right so they had to hire a truck to go drive the bikes and disperse them back into the city which was totally antithetical because if you're just driving trucks so that people can use electric bikes it doesn't work it's like well we're now we're just using gas and we're still wasting energy and so what they would do is they would just reduce the cost of of riders or make riding free if you were going to a specific area and so they load balance by well if you're taking your bike and going to the same spot everyone everyone else is we're going to increase that cost and if you're taking a bike and you're traveling to somewhere else that where there aren't any bikes we're going to make that free and the incentive mechanism worked so beautifully that all of the problems like they did they didn't have to drive any trucks anymore it was so crazy and this is i think the metaphor plays over pretty well here where if you just need liquidity elsewhere you just make it cheaper you just make it go downhill right you just make it make that the place where it uh converges upon that is so cool that's so awesome yeah it's a it's a really really interesting thing so i actually like related to the example you gave i um when i was in um when i was in high school i worked at this like research lab and there was this really interesting project that they were doing there where like uh they were trying to figure out if you could fix if you could like dynamically adjust tolls on roads to to basically fix traffic forever and the idea was very very similar it was like if you had a bunch of cars going down a certain road you would just start charging a toll on that road and you would increase the toll based on like the the amount of load and then if you had uh if it was the other way around so if you had areas of parts of the city which were not actually they were doing this on simulations they're not actually like as frequently used and not a lot of cars were going through they would actually do the opposite they would pay you to use those roads um which is really really fascinating because it actually worked out you could you could like using using very very simple modeling techniques you could basically beat these like pretty much random systems and like turn them into a instead of having them be like fully traffic jammed you could turn them into systems where like all of the traffic was load balanced really well right yeah that's that's that's so cool that's so sci-fi so like humans humans will like go on to like the freeway to i-5 you know i 509 whatever because of like a shelling point that's where all the lanes are but that means that people are abandoning other perfectly good streets and so with a with a with an incentive mechanism that rebalances across loads we can have equal traffic across everywhere which is just optimally efficient and and i think the city metaphor works out really really well because blockchains are economic systems they are economic cities they just are virtual and digital and so the the metaphor is so strong that is so cool yeah absolutely uh so so arjun where does canex go after this or is this kind of like the last stop on the connect story um yeah i mean i think uh so like our philosophy our vision is that we no matter what happens we're heading towards this multi-chain world and like we're all going to have to learn to adapt to it and i think as a result of doing that where like i think ethereum in general is going to become a much much stronger ecosystem because it's going to expand beyond just like the ethereum chain and more towards just like evm compatibility in general and this like broader ecosystem of standards and we think that that's really really powerful and it's worth leading into um our goal for connects and our vision for k'nex is that it ends up being used the same way that like unit swap is kind of like the primary mechanism for for uh swapping between value on the ethereum blockchain we our goal is that connects ends up being the primary mechanism for swapping value between these different chains and so uh and it's not it might not solve every single problem uh you know there's definitely some kinds of question communication which will require the lower level like l1 more complex more expensive like mechanism but um we think that the blocks are the best organisms exactly we think is at least for like the liquidity aspect of like beating fragmented liquidity on all of these different roll-ups um conext is the honestly is the only solution because pretty much everything else that's out there either sacrifices trust um or is very fragmented in itself yeah i would i would like to point out that um state channels there is a design of state channels which is logical where like if you are a builder of state channels you will all converge upon the same design and from what i've been able to gather that's what connects has done right it's like if you are a state channel researcher you will come to the same conclusions as other state channel researchers and that conclusion will be something like connect next or what you guys are building there um that that that's pretty cool um so i have to i have to ask does knex have a token cadex does not have a token uh does it does it need a token um we don't know possibly at the moment our focus is uh basically our focus right now is to white glove on board a few use cases um work with them to basically make the process of running a router as like as optimized as possible we want to make sure that people who are running routers and providing liquidity are going to be earning a lot from it we want to make sure that those yields are very very competitive against d5 because it's not just like passive liquidity provision like unit swap you're having to actually run a server or something so there's there's like a smaller market there that we have to really think about um so that's that's kind of the first step and then the next step is to finish building out the rest of this network um our goal is hopefully we can get there within like we found like minimum viable ways to build out pieces of this network so we can get all the functionality before it's all fully decentralized and our goal is to get to that point within the next six months um and to be honest we actually don't plan further out than that because we found that planning further out that more like further out than a couple of months of the space just doesn't make sense yeah as a team that has pivoted a number of times i think that's a lesson you guys have definitely learned um so out of all the members in the bankless nation and the broader ecosystem uh who would you need to reach out who do you want to reach out to you the most like what kind of ecosystem participants could really help out the connects world yeah that's a really good question so um at this stage you know running a router is hard and it's a pain in the ass and like i'm fully willing to admit that like you know we're still trying to figure out the economics i mean we shipped support for fees yesterday so it's like we we are currently figuring out the economics um but at the same time this is also something that's really really interesting um i think this is going to like our our vision is that this turns out to be like the backbone of value transfer across all of these trains and like um we we we are looking for people who want to be a part of that and uh we we think that like people who have liquidity access to liquidity um and who are able to run routers or maybe maybe even people who are able to run routers who can borrow liquidity are definitely people we want to talk to so if there's anyone out there that you know is interested in doing this is interested in being this kind of liquidity provider definitely hit us up very cool so everyone you you heard the man uh if you guys are interested in running routers if you're perhaps technically minded and you have the capital to do so uh hit up connext um arjun so since you guys don't have a token that means you guys haven't fundraised a bajillion dollars because you guys have a token which means that i'm and in front of what i can remember you guys have a git coin so maybe take this moment to opportunity uh to show your guys's git coin yes uh donate to our get coin cool awesome and then if other people just want to join the community and learn a little bit more where should they go um so uh if you go to our website connect.network by the way it's it's has not been updated it is still pointing to all of our old state channel stuff we just we've been moving so fast that we haven't had the chance to even like change our marketing materials yet um but uh if you go to that website you'll find that there's a chat option um join our discord chat like we are extremely responsive there it's been growing really really fast and there's like a lot of like basically we work really really closely with our discord community on pretty much everything and i think that like that's the best way to get involved if you're interested in the project um yeah very cool i i want to ha give get my hand to try at chilling your guys get coin um and and when i was saying that there are certain constructions of state channels that researchers will converge upon it's like oh they researcher a researcher b researcher c they all came up with the same construction the reason why they came up with that same construction is because state channels are a public good we need state channels and they are something that we can all use and the more that people use them the better that they get when more people use them the liquidity will be better the offers will be better it will just be a better ecosystem overall and making sure that we solve the fragmented liquidity issues behind across l2s and making making sure that l2s don't actually trap users by keeping them on the l2s and not allowing them to pay the gas fees that are like 200 to get back onto the l1 and instead they can go from l2 to l2 without having to pay exorbitant gas fees that is extremely democratizing and so what i'm hearing right now is that connex is building out a public good infrastructure for ethereum and the greater ecosystem so that's why you should donate to the bitcoin grants in my opinion thanks david that was really helpful well arjun thank you this is a fantastic interview i've already
