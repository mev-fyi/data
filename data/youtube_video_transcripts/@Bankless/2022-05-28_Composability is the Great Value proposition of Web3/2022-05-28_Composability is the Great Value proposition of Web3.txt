composability is one of the great value propositions of web3 is this ability to essentially have this shared execution environment where we can build on top of the things that other people have built we can kind of leverage the existing deployed systems built on top of them to create these kind of really emergent systems that are kind of well beyond what the original deployer could have intended them to be used for you get kind of much more emergent ecosystems of applications small modular composable type systems as opposed to large monolithic systems practically then for someone who's building something building in such a way where it's it's friendly with that like leveraging existing tools but also exposing interfaces that other people can interact with making your stuff open source like putting your interfaces off making the weapons source so other people can fork them and change them and modify them and host an alternate if yours goes down or you know run it locally or yeah anything like this
