we just hit a major milestone 10 million eth locked in the beacon chain that's eth staked 10 of the network in proof of stake that is what you call a secure network like 10 of the total supply of ethers protecting the network that's a lot especially when it's worth how many billions right yeah when the merge finally happens all of the gas fees end up going going to the stakers and it's going to juice that apr up to something like i think modestly 12 to 16 the point is is when the merge happens the the incentive to stake is gonna go from where it is at now at five percent 4.9 apr to something like 12 to 15 percent
