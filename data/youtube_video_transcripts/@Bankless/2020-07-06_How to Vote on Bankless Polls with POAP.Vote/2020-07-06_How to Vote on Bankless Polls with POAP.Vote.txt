[Music] hi everyone this is d5 dad uh this is a quick tutorial for bankless on how you can participate in a new poll that's been created with the poap vote app so this is proof of attendance protocol this is a you know really popular uh way to distribute nft badges at different ethereum based events so you've probably you know seen these show up at all sorts of different ethereum events like you know eth global or ethereal and so if you're a part of bankless you might have gotten the bankless badge there was a hundred folks i believe in total who received this not too long ago and so if you have that badge you can go to p o a p dot vote then scroll down and you'll see that these are active polls scroll over to the right and poll number nine is this one just click on it so the question is should bankless proceed with the bzrx governance proposal so uh bzx is going to be releasing a governance token bzrx and all of the details are actually linked here so if you copy and paste those you'll end up here and you can see uh just you know what the idea is behind the bzx dao airdropping some bzrx governance tokens to bankless token holders and so you can learn about that here if you want to vote in favor of it or against it here's the poll again it's p o a p dot vote slash nine slash results all you have to do is be sure that your meta mask or your ethereum wallet that holds that bankless badge is uh you know connected and so if i click here you notice it just requires that i have this bankless member badge and then i'm going to hit place vote and i'm going to go and connect my wallet so notice it needs to either be meta mask or a wallet connect compatible wallet and then yeah you just vote yes or no so let's hear should bankless proceed with bzrx sure i read over most of this earlier i think it's a good idea so at least i'm voting for it uh if you hit submit vote you should see metamask come up and all i have to do is hit sign that's it nothing else is required there's no gas i have to pay and that's it and i can see right now that there's 30 votes in favor of yes two votes in favor of no you can actually look at the results by address but that's all so let me know if you have any questions in the comments of this youtube video or feel free to ping us on twitter uh we'd love to help you if you have any troubles with this [Music] you
