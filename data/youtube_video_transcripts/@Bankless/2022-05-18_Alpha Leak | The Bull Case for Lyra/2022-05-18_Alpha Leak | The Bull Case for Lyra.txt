welcome bankless nation to this special edition of alpha leak the alpha leak episodes are where we explore projects dows communities teams all throughout the crypto space today we are talking with mike the co-founder of lyra lyra is an on-chain options market on optimism on the optimism layer 2 and on-chain options options of course are there a fundamental financial primitive why don't we have them in crypto the answer is fees uh layer one blockchain fees are untenable and they're just the l1 blockchain just isn't fast enough to allow for on-screen options so we know that as a product options will always have come from layer twos but layer twos themselves have not yet been ready to support the amount of computation amount of utility that options bring until now uh the fees on optimism the fees on arbitrage are approaching zero uh meaning that the optionality for options is going through the roof and with this lyra has finally gotten its avalon launch out the door it's coming out this week for the experienced options traders on lyra and then the rest of the community at the end of this month and so i brought on mike the co-founder of lyra to talk all about lyra and on chain options in the world that gets unlocked when we finally get on chain options out the door so bankruptcy and i hope you enjoy this alpha leak episode of the bankless podcast right after we get

to the show man hey david thanks for having me on yeah let's go ahead and dive right into the genesis of lyra can you kind of give the back story for the project and how it came to be and and how it got started and who joined the team yeah yeah of course so back in 2020 i was working at synthetics during deep by summer as a smart contract engineer and you know we were seeing a proliferation of activity on chain from uni swap to rv to compound all these new d5 primitives being built and really taking off people were looking at you know what's the next thing and derivatives were a really interesting kind of frontier that people were starting to explore so there was some traction back then in perpetuals like with dydx protocol and a few others but options were still quite an untapped market and i started to look into options back then and i noticed some really interesting things options are actually really composable primitives right like perhaps the most composable primitive you can you know possibly imagine right you get the right but not the obligation to trade an asset for a certain price on a certain date in the future that's called the expiry so with this template you can basically construct any payoff you want right you can bet on the price of an asset going up you can bet on the price of an asset going down you can even do funny interesting things like bet on volatility and all these more intricate pile structures that you know options traders like to use what this means for d5 though is it gives people the ability to manage their risk into the future right so the way an option actually works is you pay a premium to the option seller and then you have now the right to do something in the future on that expiry date and that's a really really interesting template to start with i think so we decided that this would be something to try and build you know a liquid market for and we we started to design what you know would be an automated market maker for trading options now we're big fans of the amm paradigm with the uni swap introduced and then was popularized by a number of other protocols but there were some problems when you know coming to the options context because options have a number of different pricing risk and liquidity issues that really hadn't been tackled before and we need to kind of start from scratch with a completely novel design mike the the amm world has been adopted just absolutely just through the roof uh it's kind of just a new status quo uh one thing i i'd like to pick your brain on is why options aren't skeuomorphic in the sense that like etherdelta once tried to place the order book on chain uh but then that just did that just fell when we when we discovered the amm through uniswap so why is on chain options the way to go or is there something in the future that we haven't discovered yet that will just make on chain options uh just like redundant like give us the pitch for on chain options yeah yeah sounds good i think it comes back to this template right so to give an example right take the 3000 call that expires at the end of this month that's gonna give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy a for three thousand dollars on the 31st of may now if was trading up at 4 000 that would obviously be a good trade to make you'd net a profit of one thousand dollars per option but on the flip side say you think the eighth price is going to continue to go down during the current market conditions well you could buy the 1500 put or the 1000 put and still net the difference if eight did drop below that amount right so you have this template from which you can actually construct any payoff you want in the future and i think what it kind of gets to is what options are actually doing at their core is allowing people to transfer risk from the buyer to the seller in exchange for paying the option premium and that's a really fundamental requirement of any market because it allows people that aren't speculators on the price to enter the market so you just have to look back at when and how derivatives actually got started they weren't started for like leverage or speculation or gambling it was actually to allow people like commodities farmers and producers to be able to offload risk right they were going to produce a certain amount of a crop you know in a month's time or three months time and they actually needed to have certainty right now because they had fixed costs they had to pay their employees all these types of things right so without derivatives and without options specifically you don't have the ability for markets to really onboard non-speculators right in a way that's sustainable so i think the ability for d5 to do that and flashing forward to what defy is doing right it's creating a market for everything of value right so tokenization via esc2721 and all these types of things is pushing more people into the markets than ever before and more people are becoming holders of tokens not all these people are speculators right a lot of them just want to say say earn yield from securing the beacon chain or hold the governor's token and participate in that network and do some activity whether it's staking or use the token in the network and these people need to be able to control their risk into the future so i tend to think that's a pretty essential requirement for for any market and something that's actually quite crypto native so is the argument that the options are such a foundational primitive to the financial world that there is no replacing them in the same way that we kind of replace order books with the amm as in they are just so critical and so like deep in the stack that there is no way that an options the options uh primitive could be skeuomorphic as in we it's just like a known science and we're going to have options for the rest of time that that's right because it's such a flexible template that you can literally construct anything from it so it's more than you know it is the sort of fundamental primitive from which you can build any financial payoff that you want with enough options so why isn't why haven't options taken off more than they already have uh what's the difficulty and limitations of on-chain options yeah so this flexibility which is so great for the user makes market making a very complex endeavor right so when you're making markets on options right you have a ton of risk and you're this is a known science in the real world options market making but it's something that's very difficult to do on chain in an automated fashion so early options protocols on chain really went for one of two approaches the first was the order book right and it's kind of similar to the ether delta example that you used you know early on-chain option dexes using an order book struggled with liquidity and really pricing depth issues on l1 as we know l1 is not a great place for building an order book due to latency and now due to gas problems as well so that didn't really work that well the other type was the amm type right which is the right approach but there's a whole lot of complexity you have to deal with to build an options amm that's able to run price options efficiently two aggregate liquidity and three manage risk for liquidity providers and early protocols weren't able to do this all again on l1 it's not something you can fit into the ethereum l1 gas constraints you need to basically design a protocol natively for l2 in our case we chose optimism to be able to solve the pricing liquidity and risk management issues okay so definitely one of the the big issues is that options as far as i know are very computationally intensive um yeah maybe not maybe not overly so but definitely more than you would ever want to put on the ethereum l1 so we need layer twos to really get this done um but yeah i think even layer twos in their in their genesis state still probably didn't have the low fees that were really required for something like like lyra to take off uh is all this tracking yeah that's exactly right so we needed you know recently optimism's been able to compress coal data down a lot and get gas fees down even lower we're still seeing in the kind of one to three dollar range on on our main at the moment but looking for that to come down with erp 484 and some of these other advancements to really into the you know sense per transaction so what's it really going to take for lyra to eat into like the centralized exchange options market because as far as i uh if i know the the numbers i think like something like darabit has like 80 plus percent of total market share for for options uh so what's it gonna take for lyra to eat into the centralized exchange option market yeah so i think it all starts with pricing and this is where we kind of you know our first innovation at lyra is building a volatility model that's able to accurately map the the options surface right so as i said like the lyra's amm is quite different to the way other options amms work and other amms in general right so you know if you look at something like uni swap you're trying to find the ratio of the assets to you know determine the spot price with options amms what you're trying to actually do and the key thing you're trying to work out is what's the implied volatility of the underlying asset and that's the key parameter that is used in options pricing so what lyra does is it kind of makes a market around implied volatility so that when traders come to the protocol and buy options they push up implied volatility and when they come and sell they push it back down so by creating a two-way market for implied volatility liars amm is able to work out exactly what the market is sort of implying the volatility to be and then use this parameter as an input to the options pricing formula which is known as black shoals which is very well used in the traditional world um once we have a fair price here we're able to trade options either side and at the market value but unfortunately this is still not enough and this is the second thing that we need to be able to do to really start to tackle the centralized exchange volume is to actually manage risk for liquidity providers so options are inherently very risky products and they incur a number of you know risks over different dimensions right so you've got exposure to the underlying asset price going up and down you've got exposure to the implied volatility going up and down all these types of things and lyra is basically the first protocol to actively manage and sort of mitigate these risks for liquidity providers so we hedge delta risk for our lps we do that actually in a composable way by going off to synthetics and iterating over our liquidity pool's exposure to work out exactly how short or how long do we need to be the base asset and this helps our lp stay what's called delta hedged which means that you know when the price of eighth goes up or down they're not making any money or losing any money it's independent for them the the other one as well is implied volatility risk which is really important because that goes up and down a lot and this is kind of similar to this notion of il you get in uni swap and we we have more difficulty hedging this because you need you actually need options to hedge uh iv risk it's called vega risk we don't have an options protocol to use that's why we started building lyra um so what we do is we kind of build it into the fee that we charge so that if you come to make a trade that increases the iv risk of the pool you'll get charged proportionately higher fees and on the other hand if you get come to make a trade that reduces that risk you'll get charged a proportionately lower fee so i think with the pricing and liquidity issues that we are currently solving once we have that in a position where the prices are actually as competitive as there a bit and the lps are as protected as they would be on darabit on an order book i think we're able to really start to offer you know the best of the traditional uh options experience with the best of d5 which is like the markets are fully permissionless they're always on you know aggregation of liquidity these types of things so when it comes to building an options market on chain what are the differences that you've had to build lyra versus what you would might typically expect out of a typical off-chain centralized options market like what what have you had to like re-engineer and build from scratch and overall what are the pros the benefits of like building option markets on chain like what does being on chain like get for you but then also what are the costs of that as well yeah so i think the biggest challenge for us was liquidity aggregation so each option is kind of an independent token right even when they have the same assets and early approaches kind of looked at this model and would kind of separate out and have one liquidity pool per option this causes big fragmentation problems and means that you never really have enough depth in the market to service you know trades of any substantial size so what we have done at lyra is build a single liquidity pool per asset so that all the liquidity is stored across like the eighth market for every option that gets traded on eighth and this allows us to have i guess a style that's much more similar to like a uni swap amm when all the liquidity can enter provide a lot of depth and really minimize slippage for traders but this has been a difficult thing because when you aggregate all the liquidity together poor liquidity is great but it also means pulled risk and this is where you actually need to start to iterate over the liquidity pool to work out what is the net exposure of all this liquidity to so delta the asset price or vega the implied volatility risk so this led to the second problem which is probably the main thing i guess design decision we've made at lyra which is that we could never really do this building it on l1 we needed the ability to do computationally difficult things and that kind of led us to going directly to optimism because we needed you know an order of magnitude more scalability than we can get so i think to solve the liquidity problem you need pool liquidity but that introduces the pulled risk problem and to solve that you have to go to layer two so it's been a i guess series of steps to get where we are and one of the things that i've noticed with flyer is that the options of that are available to users don't go out that far like i would today right now if i could take an option out for some ridiculously high eth priced uh in december right something like a six to seven thousand dollar ether december calls because i think the merge is coming but uh right now as far as i can tell uh lyra options only extend out about a month in advance so what's the limitation there and then what's the roadmap for that yeah that's a great question actually it's something we're dealing with at the moment um so the limitation in v1 of lyra is that liquidity is locked for the entire duration of a trading round and that's because uh when liquidity providers want to leave the pool we have to work out exactly what their share of the pool is and that includes exposure to options that are still outstanding today so it's quite difficult to on chain work out exactly how much they're entitled to when you don't know how many options are going to finish in the money versus out of the money in v1 we kind of chose to sidestep this complexity and just lock the money for the entire trading round but that meant we had to pick a maximum length we would put the money in there for so we picked a one month period and we would list options at the start of each month right so at the start of the month you'd get a fairly good selection at one two three four weeks but these would drop off as we move into the month and then by the last week of the month there's only one expiry left all the liquidity is still locked it's not a great experience for either traders or lps at that point so what we've done with avalon which is our new release of the protocol that's coming out next week actually for some of our more experienced traders and then a couple weeks later for the public is we're getting rid of those limitations so we're giving lps the abil the ability to enter and exit the protocol at any time so we've designed a mechanism that actually computes the aggregate share of the pool that the lp has and includes the value of those options so that they can enter and exit whenever there's still a short delay but it means that the follow-on effect from this anytime entry exit thing is that we can list expiries now out to three months so 12 weeks away so that whenever you turn up to the protocol as a trader you'll have an access to you know one two three four all the way out to 12 weeks and this will give a much more comprehensive experience right i think there'll be up to 100 strike and expiry combinations per asset for traders to use um we're not all the way to 12 months just yet because we still need we still do have money it's difficult to incentivize people to lock up for that long there has to be liquidity backing that option so the market hasn't really implied that there's enough demand there yet for that to happen but we're slowly increasing the yeah the limits with avalon and hoping to get to um yeah longer expiries as well in the future banquet nation don't go anywhere in the second half of the show we go into the details of the avalon release as well as layer 2 summer because lyra as a community as a dow as an organization is getting a bunch of op tokens to allow their community to yield farm with and so i asked mike what's he going to do with all those op tokens so if you want those op tokens and you also want to explore avalon stay tuned as we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge with across you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution you can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitram or boba networks ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows for a higher loan to value ratios and of course portals allowing users to port their ave position across all of the networks that ave operates on like polygon phantom avalanche arbitrary optimism and harmony the beautiful thing about ave is that it's completely open source decentralized and governed by its community enabling a truly bankless future for us all to get your first crypto collateralized loan get started at ave.com that's aabe.com and also check out the ave protocol governance forums to see what more than a hundred thousand dow members are all robbing about at governance.avey.com the era of proof of stake is upon us and lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone lydo is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using lido's distributed network of nodes don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in defy with lido you can have both using lido you can stick any amount of your eth to the lido validating network and receive st eth in return sces can be traded used as collateral for lending and borrowing or leverage on your favorite d5 protocols all this without giving up your eth to centralized staking services or exchanges lido now supports tara solana kusama and polygon staking whatever your preferred proof-of-stake asset is lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake if you want to stake your east terra soul or matic and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started that's l-i-d-o-f-i to get started okay so is is there a path forward for something like two-year long options or is that just going to be untenable for the amount of capital lock-up there may be it's going to require people willing to lock liquidity for that long so the rate that they demand on that might be quite high um there is i mean there is also as well another thing that's coming with avalon which can help with this which is like the ability to partially collateralize options positions right so we're giving traders the ability to rather than have to post a full collateral actually post a subset of that and then it does introduce liquidation risk but it means that they're able to get four to five times more capital efficiency right so if we introduce that on the back end as well to the amm then we can perhaps have a position where you can start to partially collateralize further data options and you know start to push the boundaries really there may be up to a year okay i want to dive into the avalon update just comprehensively but before we get there one last uh generalized question is the question of composability um and there's already a number of things that we've talked about you've talked about that i think would be useful for the rest of defy like implied volatility that can in theory turn into an oracle which the rest of d5 can tap into right so like what what are the what's the surface area that lyra has that can become composable in the rest of defy like the options markets themselves i'm sure is one the implied volatility oracle i'm sure is another one just overall can you talk about the potential for composability with lyra and the rest of d5 yeah for sure it really is like i think the true power of options on chain is composability um so i guess to begin their options are you know there's two size options markets right there's the buy side buying calls and puss and then there's the sell side you know selling options to the amm right so one of the i think the first area i'd like to talk about which is something that we've seen really take off in the last kind of 12 months in d5 is this idea of like option vaults right so people who are you can deposit each to a vault and it will sell options on that eighth for you and you'll generate that cash flow right this has become a really um i think fast growing segment of d5 because a lot of people are interested in yield although it's not exactly you know actual yield because you are selling volatility risk for for what you're generating but it's a real natural evolution to that process and i think lyra provides the first on-chain venue for those projects to actually come and build an option vault that settles fully on chain rather than having to go off chain and make a deal with a market maker or do something like that you can turn up to lyra build your project and trade directly with the amm and we're actually seeing a couple of projects that have started doing this already there's polynomial finance who have launched option vaults on top of lyra now there's brahma finance as well and they're doing something even more interesting which is basically they are taking interest from l1 uh yield farming say in convex or curve these types of things and they're bridging it over to optimism via an aggregator called socket and using that interest to actually buy options on a repetitive basis so it's another vault but it's on the buy side and what it's doing is it's kind of boosting the returns or the expected yield of that liquidity farming or yield farming um which i think is going to be i think something that grows a lot in the next couple of months so there's options on the buy side and the sell side there's also this whole risk mitigation piece right so if you're l paying in uni swap or on a lending protocol or really on any protocol at all you have some exposure to the asset that you're paying right if you're blending eighth or you know l paying uni swap you're gonna have to be able to deal with the ability or the chance that the price goes down and what lyra lets you do is basically turn up in a composable way and buy puts or buy calls or whatever you need to do to hedge your risk in an automated fashion so that i think by the time avalon comes out this will be perfectly ready for you know these types of integrations the other one you mentioned as well was implied volatility and i think having a true on-chain source for iv is something really interesting because that can be tokenized itself and used to allow people to trade the spikes that we see in the market you know at the moment and perhaps into the future wait so does this mean that uh lyra could like provide the on-chain vix potentially yeah we're not there yet but maybe one day our the on-chain markets at lyra will be the the source of implied volatility yeah amazing that's really really cool okay let's dive into avalon itself uh let's also start from the beginning we've talked about it a little bit uh and you see some of the features but overall what is avalon from a high level yeah so avalon is our biggest upgrade to the protocol since we launched on mainnet last august uh it's basically a full revamping of the trading and lp experience so that it's entirely seamless for users on both sides the three main takeaways i guess from avalon are the first one is anytime entry exit to the liquidity pool so as i said that's the ability to for lps to come and go as they please and best thing about that is it makes the liquidity pool tokens fungible erc20s so now these tokens can leave the ecosystem and be injected into the range of erc20 integrations that exist right so lending borrowing trading on uni swap secondary markets it really opens up the erc 20 tokens as like yield bearing instruments then the next one is rolling expiries as i said so the ability to go out to three months or 12 weeks basically and have options on a consistent rolling basis means that for a trader you're able to turn up to the protocol as i said before and have a hundred strike and expiry combinations available no matter when you turn up this is a really really good upgrade because not only does it benefit traders but it means the integrators that we discussed before they have this kind of always on programmable liquidity on a rolling basis right so no matter when they're turning up they don't have the problem of like at the end of the month there's no options to trade anymore they can always pick a new subset and build a new integration the final one which i think is you know worth calling out is this partial collateralization of uh short options positions so it's difficult in v1 in lyra for traders to arbitrage the vol surface back in line and that's because you need so much collateral to sell it back down it's hard to keep it you know lined up with something like there a bit what we've done is we've basically introduced a mechanism that you can partially collateralize these positions and you will be at risk of liquidation if you don't have enough value in your account basically to cover the option position but you get so much more capital efficiency that you can start to bring the whole service in line much more efficiently so it's great for traders but it's even better for the protocol because the protocol is a much healthier position than it was very cool very very cool and then uh so all of this is coming very very soon uh but what about what's left what's left to complete the vision of the lyra protocol and also what is the vision of the lyra protocol if lyra is maximally successful yeah for sure so there's still a lot left so we want fully permissionless automated markets on every asset that exists on chain um any strike and expiry combination that a user or a protocol wants to trade we want that to just be available out of the box right and that's quite hard because it's a complex thing options market making and you need to be able to design design it in a way that's still modular enough so that it can spin up new markets new options um to really fit user demand one of the best things about d5 is the markets can react to you know the new thing and whatever the new demand is on you know on a whim so we need to be able to support that the second thing is about really like battening down lp risk and making sure that lp risks are mitigated so that they can stay in the game they can earn the premiums for trading these options and they can be you know i guess a source of uncorrelated yield over the long term that you can't really generate anywhere else on chain because options market making can be very profitable it just requires the ability to manage these risks so permissionless markets uncorrelated returns for lps and finally is just making sure the protocol is maximally accessible to the universe of possible integrations right as i said at the start composability is the best thing about options the protocol itself needs to support this sort of composability right so you need to be able to turn up either as a someone looking to offload risk or someone looking to generate yield and be able to access the protocol and the asset that you want so that's what i think would you know they still have to do the new source of yield got me got me really really excited because with the coming of layer twos bridges also offer a very strong brand new source of yield but that's that's just you know in addition to and completely separate from options also providing another source of yield i i'll frequently make the the joke in the crypto space that's also not a joke that the crypto space has done produced three things that we know our product market fit one is store value money bitcoin ether uh one is yield and d5 just there's many many ways to make yield the third is content but this one fits into the category of the second one where uh yield is just uh it's one of the main sources of of uh just economic energy that we see throughout throughout all of defy and i haven't even considered options as being a long-term sustainable brand new source of yield so that gets me really really excited exactly i think d5 needs to move off this kind of unsustainable model of yield farming and towards more sustainable approaches as you mentioned and options just present a way to do that um there are risks obviously you are selling volatility and you're selling future risk but i think it's something that's sort of worthwhile if you know the risks and you're educated yeah and it's also a known science right it's not like we're inventing venting the wheel here like this is something that happens in traffic all the time exactly yeah the options markets often dictate the real markets in traditional finance right certainly certainly yeah we haven't really unlocked that too well too too much uh in the in the world of crypto not at least not yet um i would imagine as uh the world of layer twos comes online the world of options also gets really really unleashed uh and so that is something very very exciting to look forward to uh just the last bit of the conversation before before i wrap this up mike is uh the optimism token has recently been announced and optimism's on chain activity is hitting new records and if i'm interpreting the the the airdrop and the the commitment of the optimism team is that uh every single app on optimism will be getting a share of op tokens to distribute to their users uh so any details around that and any plans with the op token at a lyra yeah yeah i think it's a really interesting model that they're pursuing and lyra was so we were the first optimism native project we qualified for one of the first air drops and we worked with our community over the last couple of weeks to put forward the the first proposal to the the op token house as to how we would distribute um these tokens so we basically have an approach that is um i guess centered around the three pillars we think of our digital community that we're trying to build on top of optimism and the first part of that is the build is right without them there's no stuff there's no smart contracts no public goods we need to incentivize them to keep building a lasting foundation on optimism on chain the second is liquidity any d5 protocol needs liquidity to function it's kind of like electricity and we need to be able to make that sustainable um generate this sort of yield that we're talking about and then the third other trade is right and these are the actual users of lyra that are really paying the tax that we all pay to optimism um they're the ones generating the transaction fees giving optimism that revenue which then gets funneled back into the projects um so we're looking forward to hoping hopefully getting that proposal passed um when the optimism token gets released and really starting to i guess test the boundaries of like how we can start to do new distribution methods in an l2 native way amazing mike well there are any other details that you want to talk about or we haven't touched on yet that you would like
