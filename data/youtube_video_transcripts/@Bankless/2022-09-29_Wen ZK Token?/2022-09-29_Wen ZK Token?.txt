we've got ZK sync we've got the ZK evm win ZK token this was an area where like patience is is one of our greatest strategies we look at what everybody else has done in the market space And while I really can't comment on our token on when it will occur I can say that when we've studied the system and we really do think that when we saw layer twos coming out with token splits whereas 50 to the Insiders we just never felt like that was who we were we are committed to one-third insiders two-thirds public and I think that's essentially just as important of standardizing approver for everybody in the system we should standardize things like these things that say these are belief systems that should also be shared there's another big one which is gas fees I remember when I read that Stark where I was charging their own token for gas fees I was just like huh nobody's gonna like that like what we are here to scale ethereum so we will be charging our gas fees in eth and that's all I can really say about our tokenomics is that we will be committed to doing things the right way
