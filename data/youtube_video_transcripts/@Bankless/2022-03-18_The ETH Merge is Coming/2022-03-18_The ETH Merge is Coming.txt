emerge in three months david should we back up and just explain what the merge is yeah sure okay ethereum currently proof of work has also 100 always committed to eventually transition to proof of stake we have the proof of stake chain that's what the beacon chain is that's been running since early 2021 and one day we will swap out the proof of work and plug in the beacon chain which is the proof of stake chain to the current execution environment of ethereum what does it mean for issuance as well i think that's part of the story the new issuance of ether is dropping by 90 percent so currently uh 12 000 ether is minted per day to spend towards proof of work mining but post merge that goes from 12 000 down to 1280. so the big questions that i asked the bankless nation how much more ether will be staked as a result of the increase in yield and what is the price going to do as a result and all of these answers are likely coming in june because we all get to experience it for ourselves
