[Music] [Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we have a fantastic show with hasu tell us about it hazu is one of the few people that i consider a secular thinker in the crypto space he's very sober in his thoughts he thinks clearly and there have been just he's produced a ton of content that the most incredible thing that i think about the content that he produces is that we've seen companies make choices based off of the the content that hazu and the content that comes out of uncommon core so hazu we would call him a person that is the m zero of thought i would say uh there's just a lot of memes a lot of ideas a lot of concepts that comes out of what hazu produces so getting hazu onto the bankless podcast was an absolute necessity and he did a great job walking us through how he thinks about the space we talk a lot about the concept of a blockchain crypto system as kind of like an organism kind of a a cohesion of stakeholders that creates some sort of that has a body and then also a spirit right it has the the physical code and the in the physical people running their nodes but then it also has like the social contract right it has the implied values of that system and how these things interact and the the different ways that they cohere together you know it's cool i think hasu thinks of himself as a as a bitcoiner but also an ethereum so this is this is kind of a good follow-up to our nick carter conversation because i think both nick and he think in um they're both free thinkers as you said and many of their ideas intersect and complement one another but what i love about hassu is he is not afraid to sort of shake things up so um i think he originally maybe came more from the bitcoiner community or bitcoiner side of things but he's not afraid to break rank and write articles like why bitcoin might not survive the bitcoin standard that was the title of an article he wrote and it was about how crypto banks might sort of infiltrate bitcoin and break up the decentralized social contract and value system of the network so he's definitely not afraid to go push back on on norms and push back on ideas and part of the reason i think he can do that is uh he's actually a pseudo-anonymous account so on twitter and everywhere he posts um you know there's no profile shot we don't actually know who who hassu is he's got sort of this rick and morty with an eye patch uh avatar everywhere and that's that's you know what we know of of hasu to me he's like from rick and morty and he's dropping all of this wisdom but what's so cool is uh that you know the the crypto community is very much a merit-based um social economy so it doesn't matter who he is really it's it's we judge hasu based on the quality of ideas that he presents and not based on you know his reputation or or pedigree have no idea who he actually is but know he is a fantastic thinker just given what he's written and the way he presents himself every conversation that i have with hazu i always find immensely valuable and i'm sure you the listener will too we also talk about common topics such as eip1559 and the the issue of the growing world of crypto banks and how that influences this crypto industry and what it will look like into the future so evergreen topics and coming from a guy who thinks about them a lot so this is a fantastic interview before we get into that interview let's talk about some bankless things both part one and part two of a bank list nation i've written are up and on the bank list website so you guys should check them out it's a it's a two different two different articles one kind of goes into the past history of nations one goes into the future history of digital nations we talk about these concepts in this episode with hazu and so uh i definitely recommend reading those if you guys don't like to read but instead you prefer audio content as you are a listener of a podcast you can go to the bankless youtube where i read these articles to you and i also scroll through the articles you can read it with me but i read it aloud read it right into your ears so it makes it really easy and then while you're there you might as well just subscribe to the bank list youtube yeah the bankless youtube is really catching fire these days we actually just released a new show that we're publishing first on youtube it's called state of the nation where we talk about topical news items that are most relevant to the bankless nation and we're releasing that on youtube every tuesday we'll also publish it to this podcast stream as well on wednesdays so from here on out on mondays you're going to be getting a typical edition of the bankless podcast and then on wednesdays on this podcast stream you can you can listen to state of the nation and you can also catch that a day early if you go to youtube and subscribe to our channel so to do that just go to youtube type in bankless and it'll pop right up so we are about to dig into the interview but before we do we should take a minute and talk about our sponsors maltus gives you the ability to run your business without a bank that is the dream it is the first ever bankless bank account for entrepreneurs who want to run their business both on crypto and traditional currencies like stablecoins so it features a multi-sig wallet that means you can have team access not just individual access which is necessary for a business so you can implement access controls you can also earn interest on your crypto using money protocols inside of multis like compound and ave and others you can streamline pay payments as well multis has been featured on bank list we're huge fans of the product they're adding fiat on-ramp soon and as you are listening to this on june 22nd they are launching a completely revamped app you've got to check it out if you're starting a business want to run a business in crypto check out multis dot co in their revamped app we're going to be doing a video pretty soon and publishing it on the bankless youtube channel as well all right so you need to go to multis.co that's m u l t i s dot co and check it out when you mention bankless they'll put you ahead of the queue they'll give you better priority and let you sign up quicker in this episode with hazu we talk about the influence of exchanges crypto exchanges and how they turn into crypto banks and how that starts to dictate what these chains look like however getting value onto these systems doesn't always require a crypto bank and that's where monolith comes in coming soon on monolith is an on-ramp into your monolith smart contract wallet directly from your bank account so you don't need to pass through any sort of crypto exchange crypto bank to get your value on into ethereum monolith for those that don't know is a smart contract wallet that also connects to a crypto visa card so you can go to the store swipe your visa card as you normally do and instead of pulling out dollars from your bank account it pulls out die from your smart contract wallet so this is a way to live a bankless life without having it impact you and your daily livings with with your friends and family and you don't have to be that weird person that only has crypto money and no real money so it wraps your ethereum address in a visa card and visa is accepted basically all over the world and you still get to have access to your die earning that interest rate in d5 at the same time so check them out at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card today all right guys let's go ahead and get right into the interview with hazmat hey everyone we are excited to have hasu with us hasu is a crypto researcher he is also a writer he's read a ton of stuff you've probably already read if not his ideas are likely embedded in your subconscious as they are in mine hasso it is fantastic to have you today we're really excited about this yeah sam i'm really excited to be here guys okay so when i was looking at the volume of writing that you've done over the years since i don't know 2017 2018 when you started to really get active in crypto and publishing i was just overwhelmed like there are a lot of even your earlier ideas that i feel like are embedded in my own subconscious but i want to ask you this question you know maybe it's not your most popular article but what's your favorite article that you've written so far hmm well first of all first off that's what you said is probably the biggest compliment that you could give to to me i don't know i just i just love to write stuff where people say uh or that becomes basically part of this uh what everyone believes right it's i don't know how to put it yeah but um because i myself am influenced by by some writers very strongly and it's just we talked about this a little bit before the show started but i feel like it's worth repeating here but we all have these these kind of people who influenced our own thinking in a very strong way and for me for example like he's he's not the most popular guy or like he he doesn't tweet very much and so on but a lot of my thinking for example is strongly influenced by reading paul storz's blog truthcoin.org i believe so a lot of times when i write something and i actively wonder okay where does this particular thought of mine originate then and it's like there's like a 25 chance or something that i first set the thought while reading his blog or picking up something that he said um yeah and there are a bunch more people like that so james prestwich is someone who was probably almost at the same level as paul for me just in terms of when he says something then i listen so intently because just historically there's such a large chance that when they say something then it becomes like it it permanently alters my my thinking that's so funny because uh so i'll have to check out paul i've read some of james's stuff i'll have to check out paul a bit more too because um i feel like you're probably in that category for me at least personally and um nick nick carter who we had a couple episodes ago is probably another one who's in that camp for me too but like it's it's very cool how the crypto social um like contract or the the social layer i i guess i should say sort of works because it very much um it's it's sort of a just a free open thinking society um especially among among some of uh some crypto thinkers who haven't descended into weird you know maximalist kind of like narrow-minded paths and each of us kind of build on what another says and sort of take an idea you know further and it really develops this incredibly rich social layer that i haven't personally seen anywhere else i don't know if it exists anywhere else but i haven't personally seen it yeah and even um even when it comes to maximalism that's it's so fascinating to observe like in every aspect of this complex or these complex social dynamics that we have in the crypto community there's always something to analyze um and to draw an interesting takeaways from in my opinion so um the way that the just the the kind of tribalism works um in crypto i mean we've talked about this like so many times before but the they are very strong parallels to religious movements and when i realized that it really transcended the debate for me and it made me bullish on a whole other level about cryptocurrency when i realized how religious the movement is and i'm generally surprised by how how few people get this still or or still see the religious aspects of crypto as a negative because for me it it's so massive like even though i don't participate in these kind of religious rituals and the way that i guess others do but just as an observer i look at them and i find it in incredibly positive for the future if you have a movement that's that has ambitious goals and and changing how the world works um and you they're then having this this kind of religious structure is just and religious fervor is it's just fantastic all right so so that i'm glad you bring that up because so david and i were just talking about this uh yesterday on uh the first uh state of the nation episode uh that we released and we're talking talking about whether crypto is more similar to a religion or a nation state and uh david i think you made the comment that um well you know to you bitcoin feels a bit more on the religious side whereas maybe ethereum is a bit more nation state that both sort of blend together what what's your take on the legitimacy yeah i write actually i thought it was good the main criterion that you defined for the nation state was that it provides physical protection for its people is correct or not not even a nation state but just a nation at large right like so the whole idea was to expand the model of a nation into the groups of organizational schemes that have come throughout history and religion would be one of the original schemes of a nation that one of the core features of it is that it offers protection for its own constituents yeah yeah um i kind of buy into the i guess you would you could say like it's the sabo saboyen uh way of thinking about this or also harari it's they both kind of um have a very similar attitude about this but so those were both the the state or the the nation state and um religions are both uh social technologies or social institutions that are that humans invent to increase their ability to cooperate with one another beyond the the confines of their small trusted social group so it's it's always about scaling the ability to trust one another and as a result you can you can cooperate with one another um and the they both operate in like in slightly different ways so the the punishment or like the way that i would say this the state does it is um [Music] where you would combine it with some kind of uh legal system um so you impose some rules that are if the rules are paid it's beneficial for for everyone i just like social contract in that sense right but um like you can't kill me um well i can't kill you but in return i'm sure that you won't kill me and we enforce these rules by uh whereby by by physical punishment in the case of the state but in and in the case of religion via some yeah i guess some kind of more arcane threat right so um it's it's the punishment in the afterlife or it's the fall from grace i don't know what to call it um but in both in both in both it's also the the threat of being rejected from your community but that that aside so um so they are both social technologies um aiming to scale our ability to cooperate with one another by removing trust from the equation and i don't think that there's i don't think there's a diff difference between like bitcoin and ethereum there um [Music] to me they i think even in the future i think it's already happening but the just this distinction between religion and the nation state even in the in the physical world is just going to disappear so um [Music] this the state can be a religion and the religion can be a state um and then there are other movements that have sort of the attributes of both a little bit so um i just think that the whole the soul um distinction between them is is going to disappear and yeah bitcoin ethereum definitely have attributes of both i want to bring it back to the original question so the um bitcoin to me is more of a religious nation although it is also like a nation-state but ethereum to me is also more closer to a nation-state but it also it can has its religious components do you recognize that distinction i guess i guess not really um so i mean when you would say it it's more like a religion that that would imply to me that uh the properties are very strongly reliant on social norms because that's what religion mostly does it it creates or it the rules in a religious movement are upheld via the strong enforcement of social norms and values and that's how you get these scalability benefits um but bitcoin is just as much a a technical protocol where rules are enforced by a network of computers that reject each other's messages if they don't follow a certain well if they don't follow the correct protocol um so it's you have just as strict as an enforcement there and in some ways the enforcement in bitcoin is arguably even stricter right um because in bitcoin the the the bitcoin community is more more strongly believes in this this notion that everyone should be able to validate um the blockchain and we should reject the idea of weak subjectivity so there should be no subjectivity at all and what is the heaviest chain whereas in in ethereum the human community believes that hey it's okay we can use checkpointing for validation and it is okay if there's if an attacker takes over a proof of stake network then we can just fork them out on the social layer uh so i feel like the the enforcement is more strict and more physical is the bitcoin so in that sense uh in that sense it it might be like ethereum might even have some some of these more religious aspects or more social aspects if you equate religion with social enforcement that's that's really interesting that you say that you know one to one take on this and maybe part of the reason why david feels like um bitcoin has a bit more religious aspects to it and further about it is just it does feel like there is a um richness in bitcoin that oh in the social layer in sort of these uh enforced norms that isn't yet present in ethereum though ethereum is kind of is kind of getting there right there there are some very clear things in bitcoin that you have to sort of subscribe to to be you know part to be a bitcoiner right and there there's even you call the maximalists or you've written articles about an intolerant minority people who who go around and they they enforce these norms you know through sort of purity tests um so-and-so is not a real bitcoiner if uh if he was he he wouldn't say xyz right yeah um but but possibly that's just because uh bitcoin has been around for twice as long um you know so it's had you know 10 years-ish and and ethereum's had five and it's still kind of working itself out so i think that maybe a closer comparison would be to check out bitcoin in 2015 versus ethereum today where it's just starting to establish its norms but it on the topic of kind of uh these these social coordination systems as a religion right i find it very interesting that um when people talk about their religious affiliation they might say i'm a christian or i'm a muslim or i'm a hindu right and they put a name to it we do the same in crypto i'm a bitcoiner i'm an etherean and i guess my question to you is the same question i asked as nick are you a bitcoiner and are you an etherean hatsu do you identify with that yeah sure i i would say i'm both um for me i i would say mostly i i read nick's interview and i i was nodding along when he said so yeah i think he asked you for a definition of what it means to be a bitcoin or an etherean first um it's the most snick harder thing to do [Laughter] um and it's very it's it's i also agree with what is what he said that is uh it's easier to define what a bitcoiner is because they've like the the the the values of what that means are much more defined but i also agree with what you said earlier that the values of what it means to be an ethereal also becoming more strongly defined over time um and it's mostly this it's mostly a process of removal so you start with a community that has a lot of different beliefs but those beliefs are not held very strongly and then eventually it converges it converges on on the much smaller set of much stronger health beliefs um at least that's what it seems like to me and then people who were like held some of these fringe views um they find themselves pushed out eventually so yeah any kind of movement i think tends towards the the more extreme versions of uh what it previously believed over time do you think those extreme like people and those extreme versions that the maximalists are useful for these predator religions oh yeah i mean this goes back to what we talked about a few minutes ago with just uh the kind of religious fervor how how i think how valuable i think it is and one example would be one example would be um in terms of what i my my uh the article that i wrote before the one on eip159 about custodial banking so this is a in my opinion a great example of how it's not enough that you have a protocol a technical protocol that can enforce a particular set of uh of rules um automatically because the the number of rules that you can enforce with a blockchain is actually quite limited and it's not nearly enough to build a system that can become a global form of money that is very valuable and exists in a very adversarial environment you need to pair this with with social norms as well right look at gold gold is gold is a physical element and you can't alter the shape of the physical element but everything that is built on this base layer of gold as settlement asset is entirely shaped and molded by humans and it's extremely malleable in the sense so the same is true for bitcoin you can you can have um you can have a very robust base layer but if people are not using the base layer but using any kind of system that is built on top of it then um that's not something that that's a not something that the base layer can control and b it can it can push the entire system in a state where the roots of the base layer that they don't even matter anymore so if everyone's everyone's transacting only on on higher layers then whoever controls these higher layers they control the entire rules of the system so that that shows to me why this the social norms are so so important um as well if you want to build a system like that so hazu in my article the the nation article i made some sort of claim that the protocol of these systems are their dna right and as these systems grow if you take if you take the lens that these systems are organisms as these systems grow the dna of the protocol the the specific details of how their specific code works defines what they look like at maturity you know as dna does like as an organism grows up it determines the shape and structure of said organism and i think what you just said and something i think we want to get into in this episode is the the dna of a particular protocol if it doesn't retain its the sovereignty over its own soul right if it doesn't control what it looks like at maturity then there are layers on top of the protocol that can perhaps capture and control the soul of the system and redefine what it means to use use this system itself and to make this in more concrete terms so i'm not speaking in generalities uh this is the conversation of of crypto banks right where the cryptocurrencies have a soul a a structure of belief systems and values that are instantiated in the code in the dna but if everyone is using these cryptosystems via a proxy like a crypto bank that may or may not thwart or corrupt the soul the spirit of the the spirit of the system uh and so i kind of want to get your take on on a that perspective but then also lead into the conversation of what the future of crypto banks are and how they are going to impact the spirit of these systems so i think it's i agree with the take that um the co the code of these protocols is the dna but i would say it's part of the dna because your part of the dna also rests in the social contract and the social contract is not the same as the the protocol itself so they the the social contract is for to me is really the layer zero um of any of these systems and then on top of the the social contract sits the protocol and the protocol is expressed by code but the protocol can only enforce part of the social contract so it can for example enforce that i'm not allowed to print money from thin air i can only spend a coin that i have that someone that either i have mined or that that someone has sent to me with a valid signature um but then there are things that are not possible to enforce with the protocol and those are also important parts of the dna so for example the fact that we should use uh or we should validate our our own transactions or that we should um use when possible uh don't use intermediate forms of payment and custody for our keys so we should hold our own keys so those are not like how would you enforce those things by the protocol you can't um this this has to be all done through social norms that are also built on top of the social contract and that's where i think the whether more the i guess when the more strongly minded and vocal people and in both communities uh are very important because they do the same as the protocol does they and socially enforce um particular routes that are important for the long-term survival of the protocol does it make sense i mean i i think of these people as like they're like priests right almost in kind of a religious context they're like the the core devs of the the meme layer of the social layer and they are important and the weird thing about it is um sometimes i see the bitcoin maximalists uh on that side of things i think geez this is bizarre like you guys are not responding to like logic and reason and yet at the same time it kind of makes me bullish on bitcoin right it's this weird dichotomy because that level of religious uh fervor implies that there is a strong social contract around some of these things and ultimately it's that social contract that secures the bitcoin network and that's also why i see like i get bullish when things like um you know the parity multisig hack uh there was an eip to release funds there right but um that never went through that sort of shot down by the ethereum social contract that to me is is bullish for ethereum maintaining its minimum necessary issuance uh policy we're not going to you know do another dow and intervene in the protocol at all and that's also why i don't really get worried about the move from eth1 to eth2 because the same social contract like from ethereum's inception is going to be preserved you're moving the spirit but you know you're moving to a new body but the spirit is the same right so uh i'm not as concerned as as some people are like what if what if the eth2 technology doesn't work out of the gate well it's fine we saw this the social contract which hasn't been disrupted we'll we'll fire it up again and we'll keep moving on the social contract i don't know what your take is on that but that's where what i was thinking as you were saying that hatsu uh yeah i actually have an important thought on this i think so it's it's true that uh that the social contract i mean you can move you can you can retain your soul if you will and move to a different body and that's all good but i think it's like the ethereum community made one mistake with the transition from eth1 to e2 and that is increasing or like introducing double issuance there because it creates so the way it works is when ethereum two launches it has its own um it's its own issuance and there are two tokens um until the two systems eventually emerge but it's it's unclear how long that's going to take and could well be could we take five years or longer and what this does is it creates an incentive for ethereum one just to stay as its own network and split off from ethereum two because the moment that ethereum one and two merge there is this supply shock um where all the coins that have accumulated in ethereum two suddenly become merged with the coins that are in ethereum one and i i see this as a very big oversight and i was very surprised to hear this because you you create these disincentives in the community um against merging the two together and i think i think that would be i think this will kind of become a bigger issue when it's actually time to merge those and the issue gets larger the longer the the merging takes yeah so one question i've i've been thinking i've seen a debate in the ethereum community on this is so uh so you're right so eth when eth won uh when eth2 fires up there's going to be additional issuance right so there's eth1 issuance plus eth2 issuance and it's going to increase the total issuance of ether on an annual basis by you know maybe half a percent maybe a percent or so and some have advocated that well we should decrease the block reward on eth1 to compensate for the additional issuance in eth2 so there's not like additional net issuance but the other counter to that is any you know you only get a few rubs of the genie bottle right and any change that you make to the issuance policy it's human intervention quote unquote so it's hurting the credible neutrality of ethereum by changing issuance what side do you fall on with that do you think that in the transition to eth2 do you think that eth1 should reduce its issuance to compensate or do you think that the net impact on the the credible neutrality of the issuance of ethereum would be impacted from that and that would be a net negative i'm not even sure that you could prevent this bad outcome by lowering the issuance of eth1 because in either case you still have the supply shock when you eventually merge the two together so i think it's more result of having this launch in stages but at the same time i'm not really sure how you would do it better can you do it in a way where the two systems are i mean i mean i think i guess you could you could solve the problem by making it possible to trans uh to transact in both ways right so you have a b direction a transfer between eth1 and eth2 and the way that i see it then there is no zero to one supply shock there's only well any kind of coin that is created on e2 can it immediately affects the coin supply on each one so it's more like um it's more like like boiling a frog very slowly um compared to throwing it into hot water at which point it's just going to jump out again um i think that that is probably how i would have done it so i i don't see the question of should we lower issuance of ether or should we not lower it i don't see that as central so we want to pause the interview and tell you about two more of our sponsors the first is ramp what's holding crypto back getting fiat into the crypto system in order to get fiat into a defy application you have to create an account with an exchange you have to wire funds that's the same thing that's holding your defy app back users drop off off in the sign up process because they don't have crypto so what you're doing is you're limiting your market to the hardcore crypto people but with ramp that no longer has to be the case ramp is a delightfully easy fiat on-ramp it lets first-time crypto users get eth die usdc this takes five minutes or less this reduces the dropout rate so you can build products for the real world it's free for developers it takes 10 minutes to implement you can 100x your addressable market size if you have a defy app so this is the ultimate growth hack what you need to do is go to ramp.network to check it out that's ramp.network to check it out see how easy this is and when you mention bank lists they will on ramp the first 100k in us dollars for free so make sure you go to ramp mention bankless and get that set up today ave is a d5 protocol that you just have to check out it is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum but with a few more tricks and tools than what you may be used to so you can put assets inside of it and supply assets and then get your interest rate based off off those assets and then you can also borrow those assets but the cool thing is you can borrow assets at a fixed interest rate which is a really important money lego in order to expand what the ethereum nation can really offer the world around it having a fixed interest rate where you can borrow assets and not have that interest rate change under your fee is it going to be a crucial feature for enabling more tools coming out of the ethereum economy in addition to that there's also a tokens which are tokens that represent the underlying collateral but has that interest rate baked into it ave is climbing the leaderboards of the value locked in defy about to cross 100 million lock they're currently at 98.3 million so they are just absolutely crushing it developers you can check out their la flash loan protocol which can really help the ux of your application a flash loan is when you borrow assets from the protocol without any collateral so long as you pay back that those assets in the same transaction and this can help your users move their positions of their move their debt positions either a a compound debt position or a make or dial vault position it allows you to swap out collateral instantaneously in one transaction which really allows for a lot more which really is going to be a blessing for your users and their ux go to avey.com and you can deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing today any ethereum while it works so check them out i want to circle back around and finish a thought that we were talking about a second ago um hauser you said that the dna of a protocol isn't completely uh instantiated in the code itself but it is also part of the social contract the social contract of the system also has the dna of the protocol um but i think a case can be made where that's actually a weakness right because the whole point of the system is to relegate to code as much as possible and so if there is a social contract in bitcoin of you know run your own node hold your own keys you know do all these things it it the reason why those are rallying cries in bitcoin is because the bitcoin protocol uh is not comprehensive enough or strong enough to build that into the base layer right and so as a result uh the i see the social contract as compensation for the weaknesses of the code and so we have to actually rely on uh you know crypto banks to do our services for us and the social contract is like the force against this reminding people about why we are here reminding people about what our value should be but in i think it would be me more scalable and more um sustainable if we didn't actually have to rely on the social contract and the values of these systems were completely uh part of the dna of the protocol and so any i i see any and the the metaphor we use ryan ryan uses is a priest right like a priest of the system is somebody that people go to for insight and leadership but we saw in in the heyday of the church that the priests just claimed that they were the messengers of god when really they were just some dudes who were capturing like the audience of their local region and then extorting them for their whatever you know their sunday donations right and and priests would like lie and say like only i can speak to god that's why you guys have to listen to me and i and i can kind of see that similar role of of bitcoin banks right where they say you don't have to actually speak to the bitcoin blockchain you can just speak to me uh when instead it's a capturing and coercive system and i see that as a a weakness of the bitcoin blockchain and the and and so you know ethereum tries and fixes these problems with things like smart contract wallets or or um you know sharding and all these things that allow for maximal decentralization it's taking away the role of religion and and and trust and and just having to have these these these priest leaders remind ourselves what the values of the system are because the values of the system are more closely baked in on ethereum how do you feel about that take i think i think we're conflating two issues there so the first is in my opinion the social contract is always central um and it the the protocol can't take the role of the social contract because the social i mean there's so if there's no social contract for example against or that that says what the protocol should do then just it should it would be trivial to just change the protocol and thereby change the social contract but that's not how it works so there needs to be a there must be a community of people who strongly believe in the same values and the same things that the protocol should do and that's that's the whole way that we uphold uh basically the values of the protocol that's why we all converge on the same routes that because we all believe in the same things that the protocol should do so that's why i think the protocol is always an is always an implementation of the social contract that brings us to the second part so if you have a social contract and you have a protocol to implement it then the question is how well can the protocol implement the social contract and the better it can implement it the more the more robust it probably is um because let's say you have this you have you have a social contract and it has two rules and you can enforce only one of those with the protocol and the other you have to enforce via social norms social norms are much more malleable um than the protocol that's why we invented these protocols in the first place because otherwise we could just do it uh via traditional institutions and uh so the question really is how well can the how can the protocol implement um the social contract in a way that is not malleable and that's where that's where i see the big strength of ethereum because if the protocol is more expressive then the wish or the the optimistic goal would be that we can automate or enforce more of the rules of the social contract via these kind of automated means of the protocol and we don't have to enforce them as much um socially so yeah that's that's i think that mirrors exactly what you said about bitcoin bitcoin banks or bitcoin being on a path to scale via custodial banks to a much larger degree maybe than ethereum although that's totally up in the air still but i definitely see the advantage of having um non-custodial um smart contracts take the roles of custodial banks so yeah that that is definitely or that pretty much summarizes why or what i like so much about ethereum in relation to bitcoin can i just say so that is the entire thesis for the bankless podcast like that's that's why we are on this quest to go bankless because you know we believe and i think that the you know members of the community crypto community uh believe some of them anyway that the social contract of bitcoin is peer-to-peer right you know a uh peer-to-peer cash system was the title of the bitcoin white paper right um and like peer-to-peer means bankless right it's it's not trusting a uh central intermediary so david's point of like one of the problems with bitcoin is that it uh requires that the the members in bitcoin kind of observe this social norm so like at once a year we all like withdraw all of our private keys from the exchanges to make sure that they have them right um that's an example of that being preserved in a more flimsy way and the ethereum approach is basically like don't have crypto banks at all have transparent open money protocols d5 protocols essentially where you can always see the balance of your crypto so their balance sheets are completely uh transparent to you and you maintain custody of your funds so you can withdraw at any time as well so you don't have to get into these fractional reserve areas and i think you do believe that because you read this fantastic article you know why bitcoin might not survive a bitcoin standard um i i wonder if that raised some eyebrows in the the import part of the the bitcoiner community but can you talk about that a bit more we want to spend some time on that so why is it bad if uh bitcoin custodial banks essentially start to become the main way that users interact with bitcoin the asset and even with bitcoin the network yeah i feel like so i feel like kasi like uh you know there are some bitcoiners who think it's great right nick carter might be among them um that like custodial crypto banks doing the majority of transactions on bitcoin that's a future that is appealing uh what do you think about that is there a problem with that vision i mean so nick is a realist and a pragmatist and i would coin myself into that field as well so there's no not really a way around um [Music] the emergence of bitcoin banks um or just banks in general that hold bitcoin and offer financial services for bitcoin users but the big risk in my opinion is that that eventually everything just happens everything happens on on these custodial banking layers and then you lose this and then you you lose all the advantages that made bitcoin special in the first place so the bit bitcoin can enforce a different social contract than um a announce a non-bitcoin system could because the rules are enforced by the protocol but when the users don't use the protocol anymore then the system is vulnerable to the one in the exact same way that the traditional financial system is because then you you you still use a protocol but it's a different protocol it's a protocol that is subject to the laws and regulations of wherever it operates um so i some people argue against that that as long as you can withdraw to the base layer still and basically like let's say one country shuts down all their bitcoin banks and then everyone would panic and they would withdraw their money to to hold their own keys and and continue to operate on the base layer but there this is not possible um because once bitcoin has grown to a size where let's say i don't know 15 even even just 50 to 100 million people use bitcoin via banks if those people all wanted to withdraw their coins to the base layer then it's it's already not possible because it's it just the the capacity of the system doesn't allow for it so you lose this optionality you have this optionality decay of freedom um pretty much where the users become locked into the higher systems because there are now too many users um to withdraw to the lower level um i see that as a big big problem and it doesn't just exist when the fees are too high like let's say there are too many users and they can't always draw to the base layer but you also have the opposite way so the fees are maybe too low on the base layer and that's the system is just the base layer is very insecure then one way to one way to um one way to still transfer money and hold funds safely is just by holding the same amount of btc on the bank ledger so the bank ledger would then effectively replace um the bitcoin um the ledger of the bitcoin base layer so in my mind and maybe this is my ethereum religiousness coming out but the logical conclusion is what the ethereum blockchain is trying to achieve where an expressive base layer allows for individual banking services and for individuals to truly be their own bank uh am i right in concluding that that is the next logical step or or am i missing something no i mean that's that's why i like ethereum i think it's it's i like the the other approach of doing it uh or taking a bit more risks with the base layer but at the um for the potential benefit of having more trustless additional layers because it's already clear that the base layer itself is not going to cut it for any kind of larger scale adoption we have today um so we know that like we i think we have to take a holistic view let's just imagine so bitcoin and ethereum both have 100 million active users so how how does the system look at that at that size and if in bitcoin the base layer place only a very small role in serving these users then what does it really like what does having this very strict and very robust basically i even give you it does not automatically mean that the that the whole stack is robust um so i think it's it's it's a good approach to take oh it's possible to take some trade-offs with robustness of the base there and allow for more um expressiveness for example um just to buy you the ability to extend more of that trust to to higher layers so what do crypto banks look like when they're you know uh hundreds and hundreds of thousands of users of these systems right and and a lot of these users are using these systems through crypto banks like do what what what they're because there's a um there's a lot of political significance to large crypto banks right like if coinbase and gemini go from just being an exchange to being a financial services uh in you know institution they they are domiciled in physical nations uh they have a ton of data uh is it fair to to say that these crypto banks at maturity when they have you know millions of users that they start to kind of look like the web two gargantuans but in the in the crypto web three world uh and then what if that is true like what what's the relationship that these systems are gonna have with nation states like how is a nation state going to perceive these these uh you know new financial institutions i think they look exactly like the banks we have today so we would just rebuild the existing financial system so i don't think it it matters very much that uh what the what the base layers do at that point so you have the banks that work like banks do today and um and then they settle amongst each other uh maybe once a day or something so i mean that that seems to be what the end state of the bitcoin vision is even you know safidine in his book the bitcoin standard talks about the settlement layer bitcoin being used by you know maybe a thousand banks uh and maybe maybe that's maybe that's generous i guess my question is is that a better world like i is was that the point of the the white paper in 2009 to create a new banking system that's based on you know a asset with 21 million you know where we are going yet um and it's i don't like people read so much into bitcoin and the bitcoin white paper and satoshi never promised that bitcoin would be a system that could be used by billions of people and could do all the things that kind of that can fulfill all these promises that the bitcoin community invented on top of them eventually so um i'm not so sure that it is realistic within like the next 50 years that we can fulfill even 20 of these promises you know bitcoin and the theorem by extension they they might do a lot of good for the world but i mean they they might not there might not be uh everything that is that is promised right it's not it's not like they could support uh billions of users probably either uh neither of them could so the d5 version of a crypto bank is more or less maker dao right where it is a crypto bank but it is a protocol it's a crypto bank protocol and like the governance over these systems is defined by an asset that's uh tradable on the free market and it largely offers a lot of the same services that we would expect a crypto bank to to offer right so credit uh and then savings uh and then you know using many different types of collateral and i expect there just to be even more financial services based on top of maker dow into the future and you wrote this art this fantastic article which i hope everyone who is listening to this will read or has read called the future of money could be discretionary and so when we talk about how you know crypto banks real crypto banks you know physical crypto banks are kind of just you know the same boss or new boss same as the old boss do you see like uh maker dow and protocols like maker dow as the viable solution for these uh for actually bringing in a world that we are kind of hoping to imagine that is you know new and and sci-fi and perhaps more fair and equitable i wouldn't read too much yet into maker um i think it it serves one aspect right which is fully collateralized collateralized loans um but it does not yet serve uh or it does not serve custody and it does not does not serve payments um so these would be i would see i would see those as the three big main things that banks do so banks uh give credit or create credit or monetize debt and they do payments and they do custody and um only one of them is is currently a served by maker but maker is still a super interesting um project in my opinion so your article the future of money could be discretionary uh it illustrates that you know discretion discretionaryness is also subjectivity right and part of in my opinion part of the dna of all these systems bitcoin and ethereum they're they're supposed to do their best to remove subjectivity out of the protocol right um and and the the zabo idea is that you know any amount of subjectivity is a weakness when it comes to scaling these systems out to their to their maximal degree um at the same time maker dow is a protocol and uh when you you know submit collateral there is no um credit scoring there is no you know utility bills there is no government id so to some degree subjectivity has been removed but to what degree do you think that like the subjective governance over the parameters of maker dow is a hindrance on its ability to scale yeah that's a that's a very good question so i think for a system like maker it's it's a kind of it's a tight walk because of course the system is more valuable to to borrow us um the more types of collateral you can use for example so including real world type of collateral that is like let's say usdc where there's really an issue that that sits in a regulated environment um whereas for the holders um for the holidays it could be better that if if the type of collateral is more trustless right so you kind of these two streams going up against each other but of course they would also like liquidity so you kind of need to balance these different interests against each other um but i'd also like looking back at that article i [Music] i kind of mixed up two issues that could have been maybe two articles because it mixes up basically a discretionary or like a flexible money supply and a system that that is controlled by well basically by humans or not by algorithms and it i think it made a very strong point that you can have systems with a flexible money supply like maker so it is that it is possible to to target the price stable money for example um because i feel like that's not really something that the crypto community at large beliefs in so they think like price targeting is always a scam or something or it's always something that requires um i'm not really sure what they think but in general just the benefit of price stability is uh doesn't get a lot of credit whereas i think friends when you say they think it's like fragile well also the target of the price itself requires some sort of subjective opinion as to what that target actually is right like so the cpi for the for the federal reserve is a human generated metric that we have decided is valuable at targeting that's a great point yeah exactly so yeah i think they they don't they look at the entire stack of what it takes to make a flexible money or price targeting money and they think it can be abused in too many ways um and that might be true um but the more we learn about automating um the kind of steps that it takes to keep a money price stable i think the more interesting these ideas become and that's that's why i gave the um basically that's why i showed how you can keep the money price stable entirely by implementing positive and negative interest rates so that that part of the article was was actually picked up by jp koenig who is a finance blogger someone that i i love to read and he he turned this into a smaller article about how central banks should um or like how people should not be afraid of negative interest rates because they're not necessarily something like unnatural or anything because if you look at if you look at derivatives exchanges today like there a bit or bit max or fdx the only way that they're perpetual swap contracts track the spot price is via these continuous funding payments so you always have one side of the market paying the other that encourages more people to go long or to go short and that is the exact same thing that happens if you have a money that you want to make price stable so you also set a target and then you just continually rebalance the supply like the demand to go long those are the holders of the money right so the holders of die for example and the demand to go short those are the the borrowers the people who draw die against collateral so they are the short side and just by implementing this you can create a price stability without any discretion so that's so that's that was basically the the first part that could have been abstracted out of the article but it also looks at what maker can maybe learn from [Music] well i guess both what central banks can learn from from maker but also what maker can learn from existing monetary policy options of central banks and if you just look at yeah oh okay so if you just look at what um has already done in the past and we find that they use the exact same options that central banks are also using so they can use open market operations so they can they can print um [Music] they they can print maker for example and buy back die from the market to burn it so that's one thing that they can do or they can they can print die and then they can buy ether to back the die so they uh those would be one way to remove die from the market and one way to push die onto the market so those are those are two options and i think like i'm not 100 sure but i believe those are also two things that maker has done in the past when it was under less scrutiny than it is today and nowadays i think they they really don't want to be labeled a bank so i guess they stay away from that for now but the other is a very underrated option so what maker does is it uh it allows more types of collateral and it changes uh basically the the worthiness of this collateral as well so it can say how how much money can be borrowed against this form of collateral based on its implied volatility usually and that that is one option that that is super key to the central banking system or to the banking system that we have today but that most people never talk about is the collateral policy of central banks so the central banks also control the amount of credit in the economy very strongly by allowing and disallowing different forms of collateral that banks can accept to give credit so so what's interesting to me about some that article in particular is you talked about this convergence between you know stablecoin and d5 and central banking right you said within the next five years we'll see a major central bank hire a stablecoin designer and a stablecoin system hire a famous central bank economist right so there's this convergence and it does feel to me like even giving you what you said there's sort of a fork in the road for maker it can either go in the direction of removing some subjectivity right and going in the direction of something that's more algorithmic in terms of stabilizing price but there's some trade-offs there maybe uh usability is a trade-off because you have to get into you know negative negative uh interest rates for for the money and people aren't used to that they might not like that there's a usability trade-off and then on the other the other fork and like side of the fork is they could become a bit more central bank like and start and the inevitable conclusion of that is you know play that out and you're doing open market operations like the fed basically so i mean do you see it as a fork in the road for these d5 protocols they either become like a bit more protocol like through their governance process uh or they become a bit more like a like a traditional i'm not sure if i'd see it as a fork in the road i it's so the one reason why makers i think is super attractive to century bankers and to economists is is the reason that it crypto is such an amazing microcosm for monetary experiments and just monetary policy options so if you're if you work at a central bank today and like you have learned um you have you have learned all these different ways that you can potentially uh manipulate uh basically monetary policy to get one outcome or the other in terms of achieving achieving your mandate then these are all conjecture really like we we don't have a ton of um ways to test these but i like if if i was working there then it would be super fascinating to me to go into a space where i can actually implement and test these things uh in a free market environment where people like willingly adopt a coin and then you have competition of the best ways to manage that currency um i i just think that that's probably the most one of the most fun things that you can do [Music] but at the same time central bankers are very aware of the kind of negative influence you could say um that a lack of political independence from governments creates so there's a branch in um monetary economics um that is called algorithmic central banking so that is not something that crypto invented um because i mean central bankers would also like to make less like some of these rules they would like to invent rules um sort of like automatic trigger so when um when that happens to certain key parameters in the economy then we do this policy and then when the policy has such an effect it stops so on so these are just algorithms and the problem the problem for south central banks is that they can't credibly commit to these algorithms because they always they their hands are sort of tied to the police they are tired and depend on the political moods of you know whoever is in charge in the country and and also you know the what the actual people think about their policy so i see crypto is like a really interesting way to experiment with commitment devices so a commitment device is just you you commit to a something that allows you to commit to a certain algorithm or certain policy and then stick with it and then you can credibly say i can't change this my hands are tied so a smart contract without an admin key would be one way to do this that's why i don't necessarily see it as a [ __ ] road but i see it as more of a convergence so the two the two will become one where i think crypto will attract a lot of central bankers um because of the experiments that can be run here and just because of how well their knowledge applies but then what crypto does for central banking is like popularizing um commitment devices and removing the ability for governments and the tyranny of the masses to to influence uh central bank policy hazo getting your perspective on bankless has been super valuable and before we let you go we need to talk about of course eip1559 um and if i could challenge you in in a in a way can i get you to in a concise way in the most concise way as possible wrap up and summarize the significance and impact of eip1559 upon the ethereum nation like what if you had to boil it down in its most simplistic form how does it materially impact the ethereum nation well it's very hard to be concise about this because of how central this kind of this changes to ethereum it touches on so many different things and that's just that's just the nature of uh how central the block size the block space sorry market is for any blockchain um eip15f9 is is just a small uh handful of lines of code um but it's its implications would be pretty big so for me personally i mean everyone sees a different thing in it but i see four um i see four um benefits uh of the proposal so the first is it um it implements or it creates a better ux for users when interacting with the block space market so the way that it works right now is everyone um submits a transaction together with a bid for inclusion and that bid is the transaction fee but the problem is you don't know uh you don't know how much is actually needed to get into a block so because miners just include everyone's transactions um basically uh they they just perpetually fill blocks with transactions and then hash them to uh to search for the golden ones but um you don't know how much others are going to bid so you always like if you want to get in urgently you're probably going to bid more than the people already bit and then others see that and bit even higher and it's just like this these these kind of um models are called first price options and they are um they are quite inefficient in terms of translating like actual the actual preference of users to get into a blog um and to pay [Music] and paying like a reasonable amount of money and the way that erp-1559 changes this is it implements a a fixed price sale so a fixed price sale is when you go to amazon and you see an item uh and that has a certain price and you can just decide to buy it or not and that's what one of f9 would do also so you could you would just decide on the spot if like a transaction would have a certain price and you can just um decide on the spot if you want to get in or not and um the way that it the way that it does this is by implementing a a new type of fee so instead of one fee there would be two types of fees and the first is called the base fee and the second score the tip the base fee is set by the protocol and is burned so it does not go to minus and the second is the tip tip goes to minus [Music] and uh in the next step we have two um we don't have the single rigid block size cap anymore but we actually have two block size caps so we have the we have the target block size which is 10 million gas and then we have the new maximum block size which is twice that amount so it's it's 20 million gas and blocks are no long blocks no longer um have to be 10 million they can also exceed the um the the previous maximum so they can be higher than 10 million for a period of time so it can be if minus one they can mine up to 20 million um a guesswork of blocks no blocks blocks of gas sorry um but it's only possible for a short period of time because if you look back to what we talked about with maker and how you govern uh stability or how you can basically price target a money uh and how this is very similar to derivatives exchanges and the way that they get price stability of a perpetual swap against as a spot the spot price of an asset they do this with these kind of continuous funding payments and eip159 is actually not that different from that because you also have a target so you have a block size an average block size that you want to target which is 10 million gas and then you have this you have this payment for transaction actors which is the base fee which the protocol can control and um the higher like the larger the blocks are the higher the base fee goes and and that eventually creates a downward pressure on the size of the blocks so if you mine one block then that's that's that's let's say 20 million gas then the base he would increase if you mind another it would increase further and so on so it always increase relative to what it was before um and and and so the base fee would just continue to go up and um then eventually when there are no more transactions that are willing to pay the price then uh maybe we can mine smaller blocks again and when your mine blocks below 10 million gas that's when the block size block says that's when the base fee starts to go down starts to normalize and the fact that we always target 10 million guests but there's 20 million of capacity that is what ensures the the fixed price sale because there is always extra capacity available it's just that it is the the base fee that governs um how frequently uh is that how frequently the excess capacity is used if that makes sense so um because there's always extra capacity you can always be sure that you get in at the fixed price if you want to i mean that that's like a very thorough explanation of eip1559 and i i don't know that i've i've heard such a thorough explanation right so um it's clear that you have dug deeply into it one of the implications i think in in your article at least one of my takeaways was um the burning of the uh part of ether in these transactions actually makes the ethereum to monetary policy of minimum necessary issuance more palatable uh more viable you know that that was a huge takeaway for me i i guess now you dove into this uh so deeply what's your takeaway on the implications for investors like are did it make you more or less bullish on eth the asset oh i mean i see 1.559 as super positive for ethereum like if i am super in favor of it being implemented after i reviewed it so um i think it's very hard to disentangle the how how well the the different benefits we only touched on one of them right so we touched on the better ux for transactions but there's also we briefly touched on the other one so um we now target an average block size rather than a fixed block size and that allows more flexibility in the block size but without creating an additional burden for people who want to validate which is very important [Music] but then there's also the benefit of better security and preventing economic abstraction and it's it's very hard to say how much each of those will impact the the price of ether or just the market sentiment just looking at i guess looking at at um [Music] how the ethereum community talks about the proposal so very few people talk about the fixed price sale which is probably my favorite part um and very like a lot of people talk about the security well not even about the security aspect i guess there's also this so what for me is like it's a security benefit most people just see us okay um the monetary policy of ether is going to improve um because you now have this because the base field burned um and it's the base fee is 99 or something of all the fees that are uh going to be paid um because the base fees burn that created deflationary pressure on the ether coin supply and that's i guess that that is the the main benefit that um that i read when i read about uh like other articles on erp1559 but i think that it's really the synthesis of all these benefits that that is very very beneficial it was awesome to get you to take a look at eip1559 thank you for doing it thank you for all of your work in the space hasu you've written a fantastic body of knowledge i think both david and i consider you one of the the free thinkers that kind of bridges multiple communities and honestly talks common sense and rationality to each of them and is not afraid to push back on the the religious conjecture um you know another piece i'll just mention was a piece you wrote we'll include in the show notes about your future projections of of bitcoin's uh security that was uh i think you wrote with that with james prestwich and uh that was another you know instrumental article for me in understanding bitcoin into the future and transaction security went once issuance uh runs out so guys we will include many of hasu's articles in the show notes so you have access to that at the ready has you i've got to ask you one last question uh before we go so you have chosen an anonymous uh pseudo-anonymous identity online and it is this uh morty with an eye patch from rick and morty so i have assumed all of this time that you are a rick and morty fan are you indeed sir a rick and morty fan and why'd you pick the morty with the eye patch i guess he's like he's my favorite character from the show my i mean my favorite episode is the ricklanders mix-up which is i think it's season three uh it's a great storyline and that's great just the way that it it has these different layers and different storylines that all pay off in the end in a really nice way um yeah that's i think that's one of the best episodes in tv period right and of course it prominently features even more you've got me hungry for some rick and morty um i think i might do some bench tonight i actually have to get caught up on season four i've got like two more episodes left um and uh yeah it's a great show it does feels like it does keep getting better but i'm waiting for their like it's it's always you know sci-fi something right when are they gonna do the sci-fi crypto have they touched on anything with respect to like money in some of these sci-fi civilizations i don't think i've seen that yet they did once they had one episode where um the empire invaded earth and i i'm not sure what what happened exactly but someone i think rick hacked into their computer yeah with every one of them rick made the the money of the system worth one of something to worth zero of something and then everyone's everyone started blowing blowing like shooting themselves [Laughter] rick was fed that was definitely the attack at um fiat money at least i read it that way yeah i recall that now now that you guys are mentioning it i i worry that they'll do an episode on like crypto and you know rick will find some way to like beat the bitcoin blockchain and destroy immutability it will send the wrong message but on the one hand i and it's always nice when shows include references to bitcoin never really at yeah it's never really satisfying when it actually happens right yeah it always makes you sure like if you liked the show previously it just makes it look oh yeah absolutely well hassi this has been fantastic um we we appreciate you being here thanks thanks for everything you do oh thanks for having me guys all right guys this has been hasu i hope you enjoyed this episode uh some action items i think guys a real big action item is to check out some of hasu's body of work we will include some of our favorite articles in the action items so that's number one uh number two is go check out the episode that we did on ether scarcity that talks about 15 5 9 why we're also bullish on uh this change in ether's monetary policy and that's really what it is we'll include that as the second action item and uh third david i haven't checked in the last week or two how are we doing on the five-star review sir hey we're we're doing pretty good but we still want to do better we i think we have 60 or so five-star reviews so if you guys could push that up into the 70s and 80s we are still not showing up when you type in crypto or bitcoin or ethereum into the itunes podcast search uh and so those five star reviews are how we get there so thank you for those that have given us those five star reviews and if you are yet to do so please do that it really really helps us reach more ears reach a bigger bankless audience cool and last announcement is actually david you and i uh started a video podcast well a videocast that we're publishing on youtube we're also publishing on this stream as well can you can you tell folks about that yeah we are doing the state of the nation every tuesday so you guys can actually look at the charts look at the data look at the tweets that we are talking about so if you guys are into video content if you guys are on youtube you can find the state of the nation on the bankless youtube and then it will also be released as a podcast version on the stream as well because why not but really the substance is the video that is on youtube all right guys that's it from us risk and disclaimers crypto is risky folks d5 is risky we talked about eip1559 that could cause some risk too you could lose what you put in this is krypto we are headed west though this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
