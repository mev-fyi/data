hey banquets nation today we are going to meet tracer dow tracer dow is a brand new dow on the scene focusing on financial products um you taking a lot of the risk management tools that we know in tradify but putting them in defy and making them much more scalable much more permissionless and the genesis story of tracer dow is actually really really interesting rather than taking a gradual decentralization approach tracer dow took a day one decentralization approach uh patrick tells a pretty cool story about how tracer dao came to be slight disclaimer ryan and i have a governance proposal in trickster dow to become advisors that proposal has not passed um we don't know if it'll pass but that governance proposal does exist so there's that disclaimer um we're going to go ahead and get right into the show but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and returned back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eth terra or soul and get liquidity on your stake go to lydo.fi to get started all right bankclass nation i'm here with patrick mcnabb who is a core contributor contributor to the tracer dao tracer dao is one of the newer dows on the scene and they have a impressive resume of some products that we are going to go through to with uh patrick here today but first patrick zooming all the way back out what is tracer dow thanks very much for having me on david and i'm very glad you asked so tracer dao what we're building is a piece of derivative infrastructure that will enable people to manage risk so where we've started with tracer dow is is building an entirely new derivative primitive called a perpetual pool so for those that may be aware of derivatives and and perpetual swaps the perpetual pool itself is an upgrade in a sense in terms of the experience that people have when trading a derivative there's no margin accounts there's no liquidations associated there's effectively no barrier to entry when engaging in these derivative contracts users can come into the perpetual contracts and they can mint either a short or long leveraged token whether it be for a btc usd market or any market that has an oracle price fee so we've recently launched perpetual cools in the last couple of weeks and we've seen some great initial pick up on the arbitrary network um there's some slight teething issues as everyone's experiencing in migrating across it's something that's very new and very experimental but so far so good and we're really excited to keep building out the product okay so perpetual pools is the second product out of tracer dao the first being perpetual swaps is this meant to replace the original product or these two different products going in two different directions sure so uh it's actually our first product okay so it's the first one that we've launched we've written some literature about perpetual swaps before and and we were initially going to launch in first but we saw a massive opportunity with perpetual cools in abstracting out that liquidation piece that margin account piece and creating these leverage tokens or tokens now that can be used within the d5 economy so right now we will at least for the next few months be fully focused on continuing to build and iterate on perpetual pools our product that we launched two weeks ago was a great initial first step into the market but there's many efficiencies that we might be able to talk about a bit later that we're going to be building on with perpetual pools we certainly do plan on offering a perpetual swap offering and tracer as a dow and as a piece of derivative infrastructure we will be launching more and more risk management contracts that enable people to build on top of them as well as just meaningfully manage their risk in both a digital and a real world environment so perpetual swaps are to come but the first focus and something we're going to keep iterating on is perpetual pools okay so i see this conversation going down two different paths i definitely want to get into perpetual pools and why it's such a cool defy primitive unlock we like d5 primitives when something is like something that can only be created with defy that's definitely something worth paying attention to but first i want to definitely drill down the nature of tracer dow right because treasure dao is a dow for hosting many many many products and perpetual pools are the first product but um correct me if i'm wrong but the vision of tracer dao is to like like you said offer a suite of produ financial products risk management products um but can you kind of explain some of the core underlying components of what makes tracer dow tracer dow um whether that that be actual code or perhaps just a set of values and goals absolutely so there's sort of two pieces to that i suppose which is yeah the values piece um and then the second piece is how we're then achieving it um through through the product which is trace it out uh so with respect to sort of where where we've come from with tracer and where we're going to continue to be going is a few years ago a co-founder ash and i we we set out to try and build an agricultural micro financing solution which enables agricultural producers say they were farming a paddock of wheat to fractionalize that paddock of wheat and on sell that risk to a secondary market such that the farmer could continually grow and again manage that manage that risk piece in going through that process we learned all about smart contracts about oracle's got heavily involved within the chain link network building out on that that side of the the puzzle that piece of infrastructure and inevitably inevitably became more and more aware of decentralized finance so where we're going to continue to take tracer is to provide a broad suite of financial contracts that enable people to manage whatever risk they can find within the economy so there's sort of many risks that that can be found right now within the decentralized finance economy whether it be just simple token risk you don't want to experience the the volatility of a coin that you might be purchasing into therefore you're going to take a hedge position to try and manage some of that that volatility risk you might be yield farming you might be earning an interest rate and you want to you want to lock in that interest rate um so you want to manage that interest rate risk again there's there's many of these risks that have yet to have been fully um managed within the decentralized finance economy that tracer as a vehicle it's certainly not going to be focused or be insular to decentralize finance and the building blocks right now that we we're seeing um with the help of oracles we're hoping that we can take tracer to real world market economies as well in managing environmental risk for example markets we're really interested in our water markets where we can enable people to through oracle price feeds connect up to water derivative markets and manage their consumption to water like agricultural producers again these these are markets all around the world that there's no sophisticated infrastructure to enable people to to trade within them so wherever there exists risk within the economy um we are hoping that tracer can be a vehicle that can service people that experience that risk and so that's that's the values piece and sort of where we're heading um how we are achieving that is through tracer dow and and the tracer factory so you may have experienced the factory contract style set up within d504 it's it's a fairly standard standard implementation where it literally is what it sounds it's a factory that mass produces financial contracts so if you imagine contractual templates such as an options contract or a perpetual pool contract which we recently created you can install those contracts into the tracer factory and then anybody can then deploy a new market so if you've got an oracle price feed for that water market let's say you can plug that into the tracer factory press the factory button then there's a conveyor belt template which rolls out of the factory a new financial contract that anyone with an internet connection can connect to okay i want to drill down on this point because this point is really really cool and this might actually be a good learning lesson for people that don't actually know that unit swap is actually not one single exchange unit swap has like patrick is saying a factory contract where you can go and make a uniswap exchange and that is a uniswap exchange but it's only between those two assets and it's not actually necessarily connected to the rest of the uniswap contracts because it's one of many many contracts so somebody comes and they press the mint exchange button using the union swap factory and then boom a new uniform market is born patrick again correct me if i'm wrong but you're saying like you guys want to create similar infrastructure where you said you said you loaded up a template right like somebody initializes a contract template into the tracer dow and then that allows people to come and just bring the missing components of what is necessary to make a financial contract and once they do bring those things then you have a financial product right and so you have the financial contract factory you press mint you have a new financial contract then you bring in maybe like an oracle and like two assets and maybe some other missing pieces and then boom we have some sort of financial product that's based off of an oracle and the assets that are involved with this financial contract which you guys are talking about like managing risk and then you also told a story about coming trying to manage risk about in like the the legacy world about like um something maybe along the lines of commodities so i'm getting a lot of uh chicago mercantile exchange type uh products and services uh that was all that was all a lot at once but that was a decent in my mind a decent recap anything you want to add or a change to that patrick yeah sure just i think i think that's a good mental model you've sort of built up there with the factory um i in my mind think about it sort of you've got a lineage tree if you imagine a family tree in a sense and you've got the factory that can then it has it's its factory templates there and from that factory template you can mint different financial markets as you were saying from that template and they're all sort of connected to uh to tracer dao in a sense how a new market is added to the factory is purely through dow governance so tracer dao token holders governance right holders and they can vote on the specifications of the financial contract so previously in the legacy traditional financial system a lot of these financial contracts are um regulatory kept in a sense um that they're highly bureaucratic in how they're upgraded through through is the style of agreements um and in many senses a lot of the agreements are a sort of closed source and where obviously decentralized finance and endow governance can can really uproot this and and create an entirely new paradigm is through enabling governance right token holders to govern the way that they trade to vote on certain parameters that are held within those contracts to upgrade them so yeah that's that's sort of an incredible facet of tracer down decentralized finance generally that we're really excited about yeah i think the important property to parse out here is that when you load up these templates and you are what you're doing is you're reducing the cost of making a financial market really really really low and if there's one thing that defy does really really really well it is reducing the cost of executing financial logic and you tracer dow is trying to make the cost of bootstrapping new financial markets reduce that cost of like the absolute minimum because that's where how we see in d5 how innovation explodes is we've brought costs down to an absolute minimum that's right that's so so you're seeing that cambrian explosion of financial markets which is absolutely incredible and as more and more oracles come into the market as well um oracle price feeds through chain link you're going to see more connections to these real-world commodities real world equities real world real estate and you're starting to see these markets really seep into um just the day-to-day we're not we're not even though it's so exciting to be living in within this d5 environment and trading crypto pumps and all these digital pieces the true power of this technology is in the lower transaction costs as you've as you've highlighted the minimized counterparty risk you can compute risk within the system so simply and so easily and this infrastructure is going to be applied to every single market in the world okay so you guys have said that um because you're now in the world of defy you started trying to offer risk tools towards like trad fi legacy financial tools like commodities but then you discover decentralized finance said that hey this this platform makes a lot of sense but you guys have smartly in my mind started with actual d5 assets right like btc eth like usdc trading um and that makes sense because like that's where that's where the consumers are but the idea is to probably expand out from there maybe next step is to nfts but then ultimately return back to the real world like you said with water or real estate or other sorts of commodities uh and hopefully that's just like where this whole d5 thing eventually leads to right is that the idea yeah well that's that's certainly where it's going to be leading and that's certainly certainly the idea that's right we've started off with bitcoin and ethereum usdc markets initially on perpetual pools you can you can go on there now and mint and mint a long or short 1x or 3x perpetual pool token the leverage will be increased eventually so feel free to go on and and check that out but in the coming months or two um we are really excited about offering a nft indices as well getting more granular into crypto punks for example um rather than having to um require all the capital to purchase a punk which certainly not everyone has you can purchase a fraction of a pump through utilizing a derivative contract on tracer so um we're really excited to be bringing this to the market quite soon and i think the bridge between decentralized finance and nfts is is sort of happening at the moment we're seeing it in the market but i think perpetual pools and tracer particularly will be able to stamp ourselves as one of the pioneers here i think that a use case that i can already imagine is that there there is a punk that i want personally but it's not for sale and so i want in theory i could use a punk derivatives market to hedge my risk against never ever getting the punk that i can't buy today because it's not on for sale but i can at least get exposure to it and by using a punk derivatives market perhaps by tracer dow and then i can buy into that in order to get enough exposure and then when that when the day comes where the punk that i want actually does come on for sale i've been following the value of that punk ever since i bought into the punk derivatives market on tracer dow and so i will always have that the price exposure or or yeah exposure risk reduced by having some sort of uh price feed towards a punk right exactly especially with perpetual pools you just mint that whether it be long token of of of that punk indices that you want to gain exposure to and you can then perpetually hold that in your wallet for as long as you as long as you want um so that's that's certainly something that we're very excited about let's um go into the uh in more detail the perpetual pools can you maybe compare and contrast previous um perpetual products or current perpetual products there are on defy and how perpetual pools are actually different and unique in relation to them sure so uh perpetual swaps were obviously the the pioneer of this uh the similar form of derivatives you had bitmex and and arthur hayes find out this this incredible mechanism where you have a supply being matched with demand through what's called the funding rate mechanism so you've basically got an incentive to take um the the side of the position whether it be the long side or the short side that is less in demand so it's an incredible derivative type that enables leverage and for people to be matched in a supply and demand function where i think there's been incredible adoption with with these perpetual swap products and as obviously we've seen as in the traditional derivatives market um the derivatives for cryptocurrency the volume completely outweigh the spot volumes um but where i think that d5 has taken let's just let's just go to uni swap for example just simple erc20 transactions is it's slightly reimagining the way that we transact these traditional financial instruments in a in a decentralized finance environment so uni swap completely reimagined the way that we just transact assets from one another what i think perpetual swap spell perpetual pools does that iterates on perpetual swaps is it completely abstracts out a lot of the complicated pieces that are associated with derivatives trading one of them is having a margin account so you've got to deposit funds into this sub account that then you have to trade into different markets and you've got to maintain your margin obviously with maintaining your margin comes with a liquidation piece so there's a risk that if you if the price goes above a certain mark or below a certain mark depending on whether you've taken a long or a short position in trading derivatives you can get liquidated and you can no longer have exposure to that market so where perpetual pools has innovated on is we've abstracted out the margin account piece we've obstructed out the liquidation piece so anybody now they can come in and mint their beliefs whether it be short or long leverage exposure and they can then hold that perpetually in their wallet and utilize it within the d5 economy so we think that this is somewhat of a next step for um for perpetual products because it's such a simple user experience so the theme that i'm seeing here is that you've been able to and in d5 i recently wrote an article on the bankless newsletter that was about how defy and ether itself is on a march towards capital efficiency like unit swap v2 is a capitally efficient improvement on v1 v3 is the same on v2 all every new upgrade that defy gets it seems to be in the direction of more and more capital efficiency uh and so the theme that i'm seeing here is that you got there was these perpetual swaps there was clear product market fit for them uh they were generally only served in a centralized manner um or at least adopted in a centralized fashion um but now with perpetual pools we've been able to change some things and now we've been able to actually reduce the you can still have leverage exposure but without having the margin account right so you don't have to deposit money you don't have to hold a balance with a service provider who is providing you a perpetual swap now instead there is a perpetual pool which uh doesn't take margin you just actually buy the asset and the asset is this uh facilitates more or less the same product more certain same service that a perpetual swap does but now does it in a pool form and when you say to say perpetual pools and you also talk about uniswap i would get a feeling that there's like a place where you actually deposit your like like with lps on uniswap you actually deposit your money into a pool can you elaborate on that part and how that works and how that's new sure thing um so you've got one perpetual pool let's say it's a it's a btc usdc 3x pool so you've got a short side of the pool and you've got a long side of the pool somebody can come in and deposit usdc which is the collateral that will transition from one side of the pool to the other side of the pool you can come in and deposit usdc into the short side and then you've minted a 3x btc usdc short token so you then have an incentive for somebody to deposit into the long side now that there's collateral sitting in the short side so every period you then have a rebalancing event which is triggered by an oracle update so there's a btc usdc price update that then will trigger collateral to be traded from one side of the perpetual pool to the other side of the petrol pool so the person who's minted the short token after the oracle update their tokens will now be worth less if that makes sense and then let's let's go into the oracles how how does the oracle work with tracer dow where does that data come from so right now we're sourcing all all oracle data from chain link they've been a very strong partner for us over time and our roots are deeply within the chainlink network as well being one of the oracles in a previous life and and continuing to support that network as well so primarily all the data is coming from chainlink is there any like a roadmap to do any in-house oracle work or pulled oracle data from anywhere else i think that there's certainly a lot of a lot of interesting markets that are going to be emerging um within decentralized finance that um that may be able to be utilized uh that chain may not quickly move move into um so it's certainly certainly an area that we um we're looking at but i think right now in terms of the security um and and and the benefits and simple ease of use chain make a servicing great great purpose hey guys i hope you're enjoying the show thus far in the second half of this meet the nation i talk about the genesis story all right excuse me i asked about the genesis story of tracer dao how it came to be and then also i asked my most favorite question for all these meet the nations is when tracer if in a world where tracer dow is maximally successful what does that look like for tracer dow what does that look like for defy what does that look like for the world so those conversations are coming up next but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in eth so whenever i buy something i get a little

after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless all right patrick let's go into um let's go into the background of how tracer dow actually came to be can you tell us the story of how the dow actually formed and the humans behind it sure it's a pretty interesting genesis story actually so around the start of 20 2021 this year we had the dow code written so we'd written the dow kernel is what we'd called it um and then we'd posted that to github so that was the tracerdale kernel that had the tracer token and an initial framework for the tracer doubt contracts and and some of the voting pieces held within it but uh who's we though who's we so we are mycelium who are a core contributor to tracerdow quite purposefully where one of the contributors and and we'd wish for many more contributors to to join tracer dow and and build out tracer in in their own vision um but so we initially mycelium we we posted the tracer dow code to github upon which the code was was then deployed and it was sent out into the ether it was on ethereum mainnet there was then 100 international claimants that claimed from tracer initially so it was a dow kernel as i said so it needed some input for somebody to start up the life of the dow so we we told people that that we knew that we'd found this contract on ethereum and and there's an ability to claim from the from the initial dow contract so mycelium we weren't any of the the first 100 claimants and we told about 10 people who told about 10 other people and we don't actually know who that initial 100 group of people are um or all of them anyway mycelium we then put forward a proposal to be voted in by these 100 initial claimants who at that point had claimed one percent of the network to be vested over a three year period we then put forward a proposal to help software develop tracer dow over the next three year period as mycelium so um we were then thankfully accepted by this this initial group of 100 and uh in many senses the rest is history since then we've we've been working with many great partners and collaborators who all through a dow governed process have put forward proposals uh everything since the beginning you can you can go back and see it on our discourse forums and snapshot all the proposals are there it's pretty incredible story and journey to be a part of that is a pretty incredible bootstrapping story it's like um that's actually one of the few ways i've seen like decentralized genesis actually work out uh the to see you guys all you guys did was uh create some sort of initial set conditions cast it off into ethereum told everyone told a few people about it who told enough more people about it and then all of a sudden boom you have your genesis members who likely only accepted the invitation to be curious about tracer dow if they were somehow inclined to be interested in tracer dow in the first place right like trying to have some emergent selection process as well the only people who are going to claim this initial uh initial stake are people who are going to actually be interested in building this thing out and then boom 100 members started which uh the mycelium genesis team can't even actually track down or trace or know who they are and so it's it's a very clever way to get decentralization on on day one i think that's that's pretty cool have you where did you did you guys have the idea from this uh did you guys create this idea yourself or did you was this a model that you guys have saw where did this idea come from yeah there was certainly a lot of a lot of brainstorming and and ideation around it and yeah we'd definitely love to eventually meet those 100 people at some point along the way but yeah i think i think it was really important for us initially as you just mentioned to achieve that decentralization piece and if we're doing a dao let's really try and do it right there were a few months there where it took a while to actually get the the dow environment set up and enrolling and um with that sacrifice a couple of months of building out the product which is is certainly a cost but now we have an incredible foundation with respect to the dow the infrastructure and um moving forwards we've we've got a great community behind us at the moment and we're really eager to continue to build that out uh how many so you guys initially uh started off with a hundred people who claimed the initial claim uh has that number changed since then has any more people come into the dao yeah so there's right now tcr governance rights being distributed to any user that is utilizing the perpetual pool contracts and and staking long or short tokens in a yield earning uh yield earning contract so since then we've had hundreds of new governors join up and we're certainly looking for more and more people to engage right now it's a very just snapshot centric voting process but um eventually in the next few months to six months we're looking to transition into council-like setups such that different groups of people can have different jurisdiction in terms of their decision making um one thing that a lot of daoist struggled with that we've seen is just because of the slow bureaucratic process of lobbying many people around maybe what could be a very simple thing there's needing to be these council formations where decisions that could be made on the fly have to be made so for anyone that's looking to become a dow politician or dow governor and become actively engaged tracer we are seeking um seeking that involvement so i'd urge you to to get involved in the discord and discourse and start contributing what a specific talent sets are you actually looking for any are you guys looking for solidity devs or community managers or like financial gurus what's the ideal candidate look like certainly all of the above in terms of skills and talent sets but i think what really makes an incredible community is just somebody that cares and somebody that's in line with with the vision of the project and shares a similar passion of of creating more reliable financial infrastructure so if you're if you want to join the mission i suppose that's that's probably the the ideal candidate um to be coming and helping out the tracer dow um so long as you apply a bit of critical thought and um and thinking to to the equation and have your own say i think you're going to be an extremely valuable member of the community yeah and you guys are at the almost like the genesis moment if if we extrapolate this house into the long-term future this is kind of like the era in which tracer dow will be bootstrapped so patrick with that i want to put on a bullish cap or ask you to put on a bullish cap and say like when if tracer dow is maximally successful what does tracer dow look like in five six seven years sure five six seven years if tracer dao was maximally successful and i think this is true of the decentralized financial industry generally but we've consumed the majority of derivatives transaction volume in in the world i think again this infrastructure um ethereum infrastructure decentralized financial infrastructure it will replace every single transaction uh full stop so that's inevitably one of the goals for tracer dao is to be supporting the majority of that volume in terms of the benefits that you want to serve for people i think the risk management piece is something that has really yet to hit hit the retail markets in many senses or just markets generally there's as insurance brokers and the ability for people to manage their risk right now but i think with decentralized finance and plugging into different neo-banking applications for example and people will now be able to like budget in a much more reliable way and they'll be able to connect up to different pieces of programmable derivative infrastructure that enable you to gain insurance on your day-to-day consumption let's say fuel prices this is something we're really interested in at the moment is if you go to the fuel station or you've got your neo banking application you can purchase your next 3 000 liters or 3 000 gallons of fuel so these different types of programmable markets and new markets is really where we want to hit with tracer awesome well patrick as we come to a closer are there any last requests of the bankless community where should they go should i follow you guys on twitter go to the discord what should they do definitely uh jump in so tracer.finance is is where you'll find us go in and try and use the perpetual cools product where we're really eager on receiving some feedback at the moment as to how we can make that experience better mint a long or short position whatever your market beliefs are leveraged and maybe try and earn some tcr governance rights and and start becoming a governor and that that would be an incredible call to action i'd say well patrick thank you for coming on and introducing tracer dow to the bakeless nation thanks very much david appreciate it cheers hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to
