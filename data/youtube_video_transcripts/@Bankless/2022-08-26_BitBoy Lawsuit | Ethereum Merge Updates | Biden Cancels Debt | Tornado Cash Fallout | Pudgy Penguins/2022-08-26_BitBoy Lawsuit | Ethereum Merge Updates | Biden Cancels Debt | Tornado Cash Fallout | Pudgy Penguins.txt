some bad things happening but also some good things happening happy friday morning too it is the fourth friday of august and david the special time what time is it ryan it's the friday bankless weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we persevere into the frontier every single week nonetheless with a cup of coffee of course yeah i hope you are enjoying your cup of coffee by the way david did you get a cup of coffee when you went in the mountains last week you were in the mountains do you like what'd you take with you did you enjoy any coffee or any uh yeah so we we had coffee uh but then we ran out of water so we had to like walk we had to skip the coffee and walk out of there yeah yeah i guess you need water is that is is coffee higher on maslow's higher key needs or is it lower well it definitely makes you lose water so you definitely if you're short on water you gotta you gotta skip the coffee how was the trip though oh dude it's super good man uh we were five thousand five and a half thousand feet up but we're like the zero is we started we started like three thousand but like we're in washington so basically like really close to sea level you can see the ocean from the top of the mountain uh it was great man it was great you're also uh had cell service i heard because you're checking in yeah so i mean we were so high on the mountain that like we had sight lines with victoria british columbia uh and so we actually were able to get service and so when i wake up on sunday i just like look at my phone to check out the time and i have like a widget on my front screen that shows me the uh it shows me the ether price everything you're in checking prices i can't not check prices it's on my home screen like it's the first thing you can delete it from your home screen no no no i can't okay it's hard coded into the os and so i wake up on sunday morning like sweet we're down like 10 percent like big ass red candle excuse my language sorry yeah you knew it huh it was right right after the roll-up too when we prices were up so and then we had a crash but you you also saw some like uh strange activity while you were yeah dude okay so i don't know this sounds a little conspiracy theory to me so can convince me this is what this is what we were worried about okay so it's 9 46 it's it's dark out we're on the top of the mountain and you know we're watching a shooting star here or there there's a shooting star there's a shooting star it's nice super cute um and then uh we see this very slow line in the sky i'm like wow that is the slowest moving shooting star i've ever seen and then it just doesn't go away like shooting stars go away like a second or less this thing we saw it for 90 seconds maybe a little bit longer and it was just like this long line and it had this weird trajectory it was like first it was coming down across the horizon like a shooting star but then it changed direction and started moving toward us and then it went right over us and it was this line of light and as it got closer and closer it turned from a line to like a series of dots and then it looked like we were like right below like you know how those planes like trail um a signs like you know marry me susan yeah or something yeah it was like that but lights but who who has ever seen those with lights on them so like that's our case so what do you guys think in there like there has to be a group of five of you i know one of them i feel like a very sane grounded individual and i'm like i don't know i don't have an explanation for what this is this is it can't be a plane you think it's possible i don't i don't know like it is by definition an unidentified flying object because we didn't know how to identify it so we were all here dude like there's no explanation for what this thing possibly is like 30 to 40 dots in a row flying at a uniform there was no sound no propeller engine no jet sound like didn't make any goddamn sense uh and so we we had service so we started pulling up twitter and we typed in like ufo uh olympic peninsula washington and like 50 other people's videos and photos of the same exact thing all showed up and like people freaking out like what the hell is this what the hell is this and then we saw like people also saw in like albany new york and like minnesota and like what the hell is going on that's weird and so this is from the middle of the night middle at 9 46 p.m 9 00 p.m because i have the video like tagged uh and then because we're eventually figuring it out it's like apparently it's starlink launched like 58 new starlink satellites and when they launched them apparently they launched them like ducks in a row and they they start very close together but over time they spread out uh but like it took us forever to get there and also that's what they say allegedly like it's very very like like coincidental cover-up story and then the next thing that happens is that we see again exactly 24 hours and two minutes later when we go back to the cabin and we're just sitting out on the beach under by the campfire and we see it again we see it again it it it was one of the most like it's just elon musk messing around messing around with rich people playing rich people games i guess yeah i guess so but you know what this is um this is not gonna become a ufo truther podcast i hope david unless you are like what's the probability now you think this was a ufo versus elon uh i mean i would expect so when we we were up there we were like okay we're going to get back to like civilization tomorrow and like either aliens are going to be here or we're going to have like a rational explanation for this aliens are not here and no one has elsa said it's not starlink so like i'm going with starlink all right well bankless listener if you've if you've heard this story you have other information for david to to feed his uh alternative ideas then please uh send it over to us but we're gonna get to crypto right now first thing on the menu yeah you remember crypto the other big conspiracy theory out there uh the tornado chill tornado cash just got a little bit colder some bad things happening but also some good things happening maybe a page has turned some people are fighting back we're going to talk about that david what else are we covering tribe dao is shutting down there's a proposal from the tribe dao team to shut down and call it a day much to the consternation of the tribe community so we're going to cover that and like how the proposal actually looks like to wind the thing down uh and then bitboy the you know you know bitboy is crypto's biggest youtuber account filed a lawsuit on a against another youtuber who made a video of him talking about him being a scammy pump and dumper and then bitboy files a lawsuit like citing like defamation and like destroying bitboy's business um and then all of crypto twitter ryan shows up to defend this other uh youtuber who's not a crypto youtuber who made this video about bitboy uh so we're gonna cover all of that drama uh and this uh and kobe who just needed a hundred thousand dollars to help defend this uh innocent crypto youtuber um high drama hi drama and crypto twitter this week awesome i think we also have some merge updates of course some coming out from the ethereum foundation too so a uh a date is definitely being proposed uh speaking of dates that are proposed there's a date of a conference that's coming up our friends and sponsors smartcon this is a conference by chain link this is a crypto web 3 conference look at these speakers david this conference is absolutely stacked i've attended virtually uh the past couple of years this time it's in person it's physical so you know i won't be there because it's a physical conference but everyone else should go i'm the weird one because who do we got let's go into this conference david yeah we got eric schmidt former ceo of google we have sergey nazeroz of course founder of chain link uh recently had him on the podcast sbf ed felton from arbitrums dani from ave uh emin from avalanche anatoly from solana kane from synthetics uh and so this is the first time that smart con is actually in real life and so previously it's been in virtual uh every single year but this is in real life there is a link in the show notes to get a ticket if you so choose to go and also a code bank list to get a hefty discount if you also want a hefty discount which why wouldn't you hefty discount this is uh for you for the bankless community just type in bankless and get that discount uh a gift from the folks at smartcon uh thank you for that all right david let's get to the markets today bitcoin i'm seeing some red candles candles yeah right after we recorded the weekly roll up last week so like when bankless listeners opened up the weekly roll up friday morning like all of our numbers everything was happening it was all bad yeah it happened like friday yeah um uh and so uh let's see uh bitcoin started the week at twenty three thousand and a half twenty three and a half thousand dollars ending the week at twenty one point six thousand dollars down eight point two percent on the week oof oof that doesn't feel good down almost double digits and ether i think is down double digits double existence yeah start of the week at 1920 ending the week at 1700 where we are now uh down 11.4 percent on the week david what happened to my merge trade man did it last week no it's fine it's fine we're back 14 days we're back 14 days just back in time 14 days right not a big deal that's what happens when you're too uh zoomed uh too closely to this but how about the bitcoin ratio because that's a that's a tell for whether we're in merge season or not yeah where it started that last week at .0795 down to .0876 uh so down one percent but if you look at the chart like you zoom in it was basically point zero eight went all the way down to point zero seven three and then recovered to where it is now at point zero seven eight seven so like like went down a lot and then recovered a lot uh and so to me that like pressure that by pressure to keep the eath btc ratio at its like local highs i think is the merch trade that's kind of strange like what that's merge strength merge strength what happened here like why did this happen on friday last friday this big candle i don't know i don't know market's going to mark happens crypto does go down did you know sometimes on a daily hourly minute by minute basis goes up and down that's what they tell me sometimes it's going to work for an entire year i'm back to david why do we even do numbers huh every week uh how about the total crypto market cap while we're doing numbers what is that looking at down from where it was last week 1.16 billion excuse me trillion to where it is now at 1.086 trillion so down what what is that uh 0.8 trillion on the week do you know david i remember a time when total crypto market cap was 10 billion dollars some people remember way like way like sooner than that but like i remember the days like 2016 when ethereum was like 500 million to a billion and like bitcoin was just the big behem so zooming out this feels a whole lot better like one trillion dollars what a success yeah for grouping out 90 of these listeners weren't here ryan sorry but look at these things you know like uh i don't know we're back to crypto prices i came i came in in june of 2017 and the total crypto market cap was 80 billion dollars wow see how silly is that now you're at a trillion wow what a success wow it's been very successful yeah and and june of 2017 was like kind of like pretty frothy at that time we were well into the bull market yeah i was a 2017 top buyer certainly that top buyer badge with pride i think we all were we've all bought some tops around here uh that's how you learn in crypto but let's talk about some you want to talk gov stuff a little bit just a little bit because some stuff's happening uh biden just okayed a sweeping student loan relief plan as midterms near that's a key word as midterms near of course right before november but also what's happening here uh this looks like some debt forgiveness yeah ten thousand dollars of student debt is being forgiven for anyone who receives less than 125 000 a year so if you make 125 000 a year or less you have 10 000 less dollars of student debt if you had it just been eliminated it's got gone gone they they deleted the zero or the ten thousand dollars uh if you had a pell grant you uh got up to twenty thousand dollars of student debt for low and middle borrowers who had a pell grant um so cool some i and so like you know a lot of people have student debt so add like multiply ten thousand dollars by the number of people who make less than 120 000 uh 25 000 a year um that who have student debt like that's a large number i don't really i think there's that calculation in this article but it's a pretty good number it's funny i mean you just said cool some people think cool and a lot of people who have student debt are like this is cool and you know some people who who don't but they're just supportive of debt relief uh i also think this is cool some other people don't think it's very cool as well right right um this does remind me a lot of the ppp loans though which were loans for um businesses some small businesses got the funds a lot of large businesses got the funds that were eventually forgiven during covid it kind of reminds me of that uh and it strikes me that um you know some of the people who got the money are generally in favor of this and people who didn't get the money aren't right uh and so like how that works it just feels very much like different uh constituencies are um hooking finding their way to hook into the money printer right and whether it's a good or bad thing that's kind of beyond the scope of this podcast to consider but what we are looking at is the money printer continues to go burr right and one uh you know whether it's red or blue one uh politician gets in control and rewards their constituency then another gets in control rewards there through tax cuts or debt relief or stimulus checks or that sort of thing i feel very much like david we're kind of losing the credible neutrality of the of the money printer through this process though and that is certainly a contrast with crypto david you've got a meme here uh i think this is the classic trolley problem what are we looking at here yeah so there's two like fights on this debate there's like the people some people are sad that like they paid back their student loans and then then the student loan gets cancelled and they're like well f like i shouldn't have paid it back i should have waited just get it canceled so there's like a i think i thought i thought a funny trolley meme here uh trolley problem and so the trolley problem of course traditionally it's there's one person on one track five people on the other track if you do nothing if you don't divert the trolley the trolley's gonna kill five people and so if you do something if you divert the trolley by like switching the lever then it only kills one person it's a moral question as to like do you take the action you as a person with agency do you take the action to divert the trolley to kill one person rather than five people in my mind you absolutely do that even though you then become like a murderer technically you also save five people it's like beneficial anyway utilitarian utilitarian yeah uh this trolley but there's also there's like an infinity number of like renditions of the trolley problem so this one the trolley has already killed 10 people and if you divert the trolley it won't kill five people it will instead kill zero people and then the person who's like in control of the lever says but if i divert the trolley now that would be unfair to the people that is already killed i thought it was funny i thought it was funny meme yeah no i get it this this is kind of the argument that's like but you bring up an interesting question david about your ethics i'm curious here so have you ever played that uh like trolley problem game or it's like 30 different renditions of the trolley problem yeah yeah yeah and then they start off relatively like easy but then they get more and more like hard yeah okay so there's like some that are very very difficult right so like you got a baby on one side and then five people over 85 right on the other side and do you flip the switch is it baby or do you let the trolley go kill five 85 year old people what do what what do you decide in that case oh am i am i on the stands here yes i'm curious as my as my business partner and co-host i need to know your your moral ethics david we haven't big utilitarian over here so like the way that i would do this if i was to do this uh like how old are these people 80 80 years old like 85. okay so like i don't know what the stats are but the way i would come to determine this is that if you are 85 years old what is your expected remaining years to live and so like if your expected remaining years to live is like eight multiply that by five and you get forty and then you take the expected remaining years to live of the baby and if it's greater than 40 then you kill the old people and save the baby okay let me modify that what if one of these 85 year old people are noble prize-winning scientists uh on the cusp of curing cancer what then oh if you know they're on the cusp of curing cancer then you absolutely kill the goddamn baby because that baby hasn't done anything he's sick i can't well no because like if you kill if you cure cancer you ins like re re recreate like david there's billions of years of life these problems all right kill kill the baby ryan kill the baby oh my god do it we're about to get sued by bit boy all sorts of um different agencies here okay my favorite one which i think is the one that okay most answers i i answered with consensus but the one that i didn't answer with consensus was um do you kill one human or five sentient robots what do you do well i've got to represent the ai side so well okay that's good because i also represented the rope the the ai side oh my god can we get back to krypto sentient sentience who am i to judge you know at some point in time i guess maybe uh ais will be making these decisions for us that reminds me of our uh of our episode with dimitri that's coming up it's related well the future ais of the world please let it be known that if the trolley problem kills ai yeah like choose to save you uh is that rocko's ballisk right yeah you gotta use basilisk yeah yeah uh roku's basilisk um anyway let's move on deep cut so far in this room deep cuts on this roll-up uh maybe this will make the cut maybe you'll never hear this we'll see did you know though okay so we're just talking about biden more money printing of course more debt forgiveness it that is what it is uh here is a tweet from jacob franek who says a fed study finds that 60 of all u.s inflation over 2019 to 2021 was due to what a demand for goods thanks to fiscal stimulus and other aggregate demand factors ryan what is student loan forgiveness this is a stimulus is that fiscal stimulus is that yes increasing everyone's net worth by ten thousand dollars it puts more money in people's pockets more perceived money they're more willing to spend on other things including meme stocks because they're probably millennials and also crypto right which is kind of an interesting byproduct but there's a direct link between the money printing and fiscal stimulus of course and uh inflation which is a problem david because the u.s is in the process the fed is in the process of trying to get inflation under control this is a chart from pantera capital and this is showing the real 10-year treasury yield okay so this if you buy a um a treasury bond for 10 years your real rate of return right now that's the return of the bond minus inflation is negative six percent sorry right negative six percent which david would you buy this bond earning negative six percent per year right now okay so yeah i feel like there's two rational ways to say yes to that question if i embarrass on the stock market and i think the stock market is going to go down more than six percent uh then yes i would buy bonds rather than have it in stocks rather than have it in stocks yes um what was the other one i can't remember the other one is maybe you're the fed and you have to buy bonds to keep the entire because that's what's happening that's the other rational help coming up what's actually happening is they're kind of running out of buyers right because a lot of people are like this is not a great deal with inflation running so hot and they're buying alternative assets so the fed has been buying a lot of bonds historically of course anyway it's a real quandary and i think there's a juxtaposition between debt forgiveness uh inflation and also the real return on sovereign bonds and you contrast that with with crypto and this is the market we find ourselves in uh right now um david there's also some energy price things going on what's this yeah this is a graph of the cost of a megawatt hour in euro terms in germany um i haven't been paying too much to the macro markets except for like a tweet here and there talking about the commodities markets which are looking bad and energy markets which are looking worse so just let it be known we don't have time to go into it and i'm also just not an expert but energy in europe is really expensive right now um going to the start of the year say let's just pick an arbitrary point is like january 2022 the cost of a euro megawatt hour was about like 80 to 100 euros for a megawatt hour we are currently up to 313. so it's 3xed and since the start of the year uh so energy cost europe going up that's bad that's right it's going up relative to euros in particular which is kind of bad um because euros are europe is a next exporter net exporter of energy so they don't have energy kind of backing their their currency the way rubles do more on that in the luke ramen episode which i think is a fantastic episode on that that we did but david uh we're talking about money printing spf and ftx is definitely printing some money it's not printing money if it's revenue i guess so uh all right so uh some leaked financial data how much was ftx making last year uh in 2020 first off before we get to last year in 2020 ftx was making just a measly below 90 million dollars you know just below 90 million dollars in 2020. in 2021 they were making over a billion dollars of revenue so from under 90 million to over a billion in revenue some insane profit margins profitable with 27 operating margins and then not only did they make just a ton of money in 2021 but they also made a ton of strategic acquisitions uh and so they have just like like sam bankman freed and ftx just won the bull market made a bunch of money bought a bunch of businesses at a very cheap discounts because all of those businesses were distressed uh so ftx really just won the bull market for sure yeah they definitely did and that's what they're doing buying these uh distressed assets right now um david this is interesting i think we wanted to include this year because uh it seems like a layer two season might be a foot some more competition for alternative l ones at least on the nft side this is a stat from immutable x what's immutable x doing mutable has passed a lana in daily nft sales volume in dollar terms now it is the only chain uh it's the second chain with the most volume behind the ethereum layer one and this kind of just makes sense like immutable is a nft optimized platform it's built for nfts and for trading nfts um and also with super cheap fees kind of like solana so perhaps eating into solana's market share but also solana overall is down in nft trading volume it was between like three and five million dollars uh in daily nft trading volume back in june uh now it's down to one million dollars of daily nft trading volume where um imx has now gone to like one and a quarter million dollars in trading volume this is one thing we predicted not sure if we're right on this thesis but uh alternative layer ones will find themselves uh competing more with layer two's ethereum layer twos than ethereum directly maybe that's starting to play out now it's also just a big plus one to the modular ethereum thesis where specific chains that are custom built to do and perform specific activities are going to be better at those activities than monolithic chains who have to like have trade-offs because they want to do everything at once right and here's a plus one to the bankless thesis so maybe we've learned something this cycle as we always learn things uh did you know that even in the midst of a bear market crypto hardware wallets are up up bigly okay so ledger says their sales recently blew up since the house celsius hacked by 4.5 x 4.5 x trezor and safe pal also up hefty sales figures people are withdrawing their funds from centralized exchanges they're taking sovereignty of their own crypto taking uh their own keys they're going bankless and they're buying hardware wallets and that's on the on the back of centralized exchange failure this is a good thing i think we are learning our lesson uh and we are getting more people to go bank-less i'm kind of bullish on this actually of course this is i mean this is how the crypto industry learns we learn through pain so when something bad happens when everyone gets like a punch to the stomach they're like i didn't like that okay what can i do to not have that happen to me again and hardware wallets are definitely a solution absolutely get more resilient as time goes on david got a lot more to cover uh in the next section what are we gonna talk about oh my god so much uh first coming up next is the freezing the chilling effect of the tornado cache but we also got some thawers on the horizon people trying to stop the freezing and thaw things am i drawing out this metaphor too much i don't know probably but in addition to that the tribe dow trying to unwind trying to shut down proposal from the tribe down team to just call it a day with tribe uh and the community backlash as a result of that and also bit boy sue's a youtuber but the entire crypto community the entire entire crypto twitter community shows up to defend that youtuber so we'll get into that drama which is some juicy drama and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that help you go bankless rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there lens protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era through social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media all right guys we are back more on tornado cash some more on the ofac sanctions of course as you know ofac sanctioned for the very first time smart contracts on ethereum the tornado cash smart contracts last couple of weeks we've been dealing with and talking about the fallout from that here one of the follow-up items this is in the in the negative uh section there's also some positive things we're going to talk about but um what is this first headline we're looking at david yeah so post merge a lot all of the ethereum clients are going to have this thing called mev boost kind of plugged into it like a little bit of a side car um that's produced by flash bots and this is something that is first an accessory to the ethereum protocol but then later becomes integrated into the ethereum protocol basically it's a precursor to proposer builder separation and it allows ethereum stakers to just receive pre-created blocks from mev boost from these people called block builders who are building blocks which are it's kind of a computationally intensive thing to do and then these block builders just propose these blocks of proposers east stakers proposers or east acres and then east takers take these blocks and then they just like oh i'll take that bid associated with that block and i'll propose that this service is going to be created by this thing called mev boost but sadly uh flashbots is a u.s centralized entity and they stated that they plan on complying with ofac regulations because they don't want to go to jail like relatively rational and so as a result of that that's one of the big conversations that trigger this ethereum censorship conversation saying oh well if flashboss is going to maintain ofac compliance we're almost doing censorship at the protocol level and as a result of that flashbots has accelerated the um open sourcing of meb boost and their relayers so that more people can participate to remove some of that censorship but the point here is that flashbots as a as a centralized regulated entity is not going to go toe-to-toe with ofac and they will be complying with ofac um i actually wouldn't necessarily classify this as a tornado cash chilling effect i would actually straight up saying like this is they would otherwise be in violations uh and so you can't really blame them like i wouldn't say like no tornado excuse me no uh flashbacks people you gotta go to jail for us um but it's also stuff we don't like yeah definitely and uh there's two things for this one if you still have more questions on me vboost or flashbots go to the episode that we released earlier this week on flashbots you'll understand all of that we actually recorded that episode before all the tornado cache stuff happened so we weren't able to ask the censorship resistance questions but if you're wondering how this affects ethereum's long-term protocol censorship resistance listen to our episode coming out with justin drake this monday new drake dropping it's so good okay this is uh our episode i think we called it ethereum uncensored yeah and uh he classifies this problem the problem of flashbots and block builder censorship as a form of weak uh censorship attack weak sensor attack and so he goes to the difference between weak and strong and shows what the mitigators are anyway fantastic episode if you're worried like i am when you read a headline and you're like flashbots is blacklisting wallets what does this mean gotta do your research listen to both those episodes coming out on bankless uh we could talk a lot more about that but there's more uh ftx hey this is actually tornado cast chilling effect as in this did not need to happen this is not no one is forcing ftx to do this so there's a layer two similar to tornado cache in terms of the tech stack it uses but also different more advanced in some ways we've talked about a lot it's called aztec uh and ftx actually froze a user account who sent coins to aztecs zk money aztec of course was not on any of tax sanctions list does use similar technology it preserves your privacy on chain only and then now here's a um crypto exchange saying wallets can no longer uh with like uh our users can no longer withdraw to aztec big problem flashing red light what do you think about this david yeah yeah this is like this is like an unforced error i would say like what if we're going to be in crypto can we live by crypto values which is to not censor like a minimum viable censorship that doesn't make operators of ftx and others go to jail and so aztec you can go and use aztec right now you're not violating any laws you are free to do so um i'm not a lawyer but i'm pretty sure that's true um yeah and so the fact that we are banning people that are using aztec before just because it is privacy services is like against the ethos of crypto we didn't need to do this this is bad yeah this is part of the chilling effect um aztec also responding by implementing some practical deterrents and measuring uh their effectiveness um this is a tweet from aztec and i understand why they're where they're putting this out there they want to say that they're doing something but i don't like it david look at this i don't like that they have to do it yeah i don't like that they have to do it or they feel like they have to do it this is all part of the chilling effect they're doing some ip specific deposit rate limiting they're looking at people's ip addresses and trying to rate limit how much you can deposit nothing else this um has a throttling effect to how many people use aztec in the scale of what aztec could be so this is a throttling effect for privacy right for everyone in the world a massive problem and let it be known that like if you are north korea or a highly motivated actor you can get around all of these things except for except for the system-wide daily asset deposit caps which they mean like you know like no more than 1 000 ether can go into aztec on a daily basis other than that it actually just makes it have more friction for individual people like you and me and it's annoying for somebody like north korea but it's not going to stop them in the slightest david have you seen that meme of like uh there's a guy there's like a sidewalk yes yeah okay that's like it's a six inch wide or the six feet long barrier that has no barriers on either side and it's like banning north korea yeah and so it's like north korea is obviously just going to route around all of this as they usually would so the only group that you're punishing are law abiding privacy seeking individuals which is a big problem uh but let's keep it it's not asic's fault that is offec's fault that's offec's fault yeah yeah i get that i get that it depends like i think there's a spectrum of how much you react to the chilling effect right i i don't want um look people can't code from jail we can't do a bankless podcast in an orange suit right so like we gotta we gotta stay out of jail in order to continue this stuff and yet we don't have to be over compliers either and so i'm not sure what the line is here but um there is a line here anyway the fight continues but what is uh happening with uniswap labs yeah more wallets are being banned from trm labs which the uniswap frontend and other frontlands used to ban um to block banned addresses so 253 crypto wallet addresses over the last month have been banned uh they have been claimed to belong to criminals and hackers or interfere with u.s government sanctions so d5 front end is getting harder to use for well 253 addresses sad and you know jake travinsky says he doesn't blame uh organizations for doing this at this point in time again because of the chilling effect if you want more of the mitigators for front end uh kind of bands then listen that justin drake episode he he walks through all the ways we can we can solve this as a community um but also david the developer uh alex perceph who was arrested by uh authorities in the netherlands is still in jail right okay so yeah he's been in jail now i think for for 12 13 days right uh and a judge just ruled that he will spend the next 90 days in jail as well until until it's great yeah no charges have been laid no charges we don't know why are you supposed to hire a legal defense if you don't have charges uh it's unbelievable how do you go to court without charges they tried to hit his lawyers apparently tried to um make bail and bail was denied uh again no charges right it's just like there's the due process i don't know i don't know what's going on anyway some people are um protesting this uh as they should be there there are some ways to get involved too so some people are literally protesting in person um you know this is this is my tweet a judge just ruled that alex must stay in jail alexi must stay in jail alex wrote some open source privacy code of public good a few bad guys used his code so they put him in in a cage who's next vitalik tim berners-lee we're gonna arrest the the creator of tcp in the internet uh so i think we need to get loud as a community and there are ways to do that there's a website called set alexfree.nl where you can join a sign a petition join a telegram group donate in various places and start to speak out because we at least need to know what he's being charged for if they don't have a charge they need to let the guy free because it looks like they're just putting him in jail for writing code right how is that permissible in any free open democratic society yeah there better be a real good reason why that guy's in jail uh otherwise it's it's completely ridiculous uh and also scary so protests happening as well um but david there's also some good news coming to the rescue okay what's up imagine people with flamethrowers just like flamethrowing the tornado catch chilling effect that's like that's what's going on here so uh representative tom emmer who we've had on the podcast tweets out i sent a letter to secretary yellen regarding the unprecedented sanctioning of tornado cash the growing of the adoption of decentralized technology we've certainly raised new challenges for ofac nonetheless technology is neutral and the expectation of privacy is normal oh wow i like that expectation of privacy is normal thank you thank you and then this is what this guy ryan sean adams says thank you for standing up to privacy representative tom emmer but he is not the only tornado cash flamethrower of the chilean effect um matthew green who we've also had on the podcast says on twitter i made a github organization to republish a fork of tornado cash repositories that were banned following the treasure treasury sanction order of the other week so there's tornado cache code back up on github a new github repository with tornado cache because all that is is open source code uh matthew green nice job third tornado cash uh flamethrower anti-chilling effect thar person tether tether that's unexpected yeah tether tether holds firm on a decision to not freeze tornado cash addresses awaits law enforcement instruction so basically saying hey guys we're not going to freeze those but you know come talk we'll come talk and talk send us a reason like yes give give us a court order they're they're not falling victim to the over compliance uh trap i will say though uh tether has like blacklisted i think like 10 to 50 times more addresses than usdc has but granted it's been around longer and it's had a higher market cap longer than usc so asterisks there definitely um ultimately david as we get into the justin drake episode our greatest defense is the layer zero right and if there is some sort of censored version of uh sanctioned version uh of ethereum versus an unsensible original ethereum which one of the core devs going to support which one is the ethereum community going to uh actually develop software for and actually want to use this is a quote directly from the last core devs call from one of the core devs of ethereum he says this if we allow censorship of user transactions on the network then we basically failed this is the hill that i'm willing to die on if we start allowing users to be censored on ethereum then this whole thing doesn't make sense and i will be leaving the ecosystem who's going to work on your ofac sanctions ethereum version chills it's not going to be the core devs of ethereum that's for sure right uh yeah see yeah that's a really good point if if ofac wants an ofac compliant version of ethereum they build it and they need to build all of that infrastructure from themselves because no ethereum core devs are going to be like okay yeah we'll just build ofac compliance into our censorship resistant blockchain ethereum.gov baby let's go let's do it build your own blockchain if you want a sanctioned one china's doing it why can't the u.s do it yeah go do it uh nice job this is uh marius on the uh geth team geth uh i mean probably the most important piece of ethereum infrastructure that exists bullish bullish i think bullish layer zero david yep let's move on to the next story what are we talking about here yeah so this is uh the fae fallout of the fade out uh so the the title of this article here is that the fey community is up in arms over the dissolution plan uh and so exciting technical financial and future regulatory risks the team behind fey says it's ready to call it quits uh they're they make a proposal to the dow but that proposal would only partially repay 80 million dollars of the uh of the rari hack which is now the rari faye ferrari remember that whole thing um so rory dow rory got hacked 80 million dollars and there's plenty of funds to pay back these hack victims in full but according to this proposal this proposal pays back the uh tribe token holders hence the you know this is the tribe team but uh and only pay back the hack victims partially at the peak of the bull market the fey market cap the face stable coin was over 800 million dollars now it's just 140 million dollars a comment from sam cosmani founder frack says it's a new low for dpi so an important part of this story is that back in may holders of the tribe token the the entity's governance token all voted to make the community whole after the rari hack by repaying the bad debt on behalf of the hacker but the specifics would be hammered out later but then when the specifics were actually hammered out the team with the majority owners of the tribe token the actual like centralized team voted no and the team said that well the original vote was non-binding since it didn't take place on chain oof big lame big lame okay so going into the actual details of the proposal for the wind down of the fae dao which is coming out of the fey team there's three phases a consolidation phase a fuse hack repayment phase and then a final redemption phase uh basically consolidation is just like a liquidity phase it's like let's just sell all the assets and get as much as liquidity as possible the current account ownership asset ownerships of the fey dow the tribe dow fifty thousand staked eats twenty two thousand eath uh that twenty two thousand eight is going to be converted into die using balancer that fifty thousand staked east because it's illiquid is going to be distributed to tribe token holders pro rata because they can't sell that so they're just going to distribute the staked ether there's 18.7 million l usd from the liquidy protocol is going to be converted to die using periodic trades on balancer or curve and then so that will be retained by the dao temporarily and then they have some other assets 1.5 million and ve bell which is going to be traded otc for faye tribe or bell 1.5 ohm traded otc with forfeit tribe or die and then there's some liquidy fox tokens and index tokens which i mean very small amounts uh and then so after a lot of that staked ether gets distributed to the tribe token holders you have phase two which is the fuse hack repayments which of the remaining assets in the org of any of the assets that could be converted to die that 22 000 ether and also that 18.7 million lusd that will be used to whatever is left will be paid back to the fuse hackers and then there's the final repayment which all faye becomes wrapped die so if you're a fae holder you basically become a die holder try becomes redeemable for a pro rata claim on all the remaining assets after setting aside die for backing fae and then uh that's basically it well what kind of sucks about this is it feels like it's like like um at least with blockfy depositors didn't get a haircut right equity holders got a haircut right and it seems like in this case the people who are depositing into rory in this case which was later merged into faye which is like what you were talking about like fae and tribe is where this is all coming from um they are not getting protected they're getting protected after all of the tribe equity holders yeah the tribe equity holders are like i choose to pay myself yes and not the hack victims oh and there was a governance proposal that said that we should pay the hack victims but oh that one doesn't count no that was a that was a fake one so it's just i i'm i'm with sam this is just kind of look i don't know all of the details of this so i i hazard to to talk too much about it but in general this doesn't strike me as a good a good thing or a good precedent to hit or or the right thing this goes back to our episode with hasu is um right investor protection rights kind of suck and so do depositor rights and so it's very much like um uh caveat emptors like you know buyer beware when you're doing this kind of stuff this is something that like when we take this to like tradfy tradfi is better than defy on this particular scenario traditional equity equity holders rights like that if i failed here because because we don't have positives like exactly yeah like this is something that like when we show to gary gensler gary gensler is like oh this is great this is good for me i he's wrong because he wants to fix it the gary gensler way which is like these things gives him more demo yeah yeah there's also it gives him more ammo for sure but so i'm disappointed with that i like not with the wind down and them choosing to quit but i'm disappointed with them not helping the fuse uh hack repayments but i'm more disappointed macroli in like the class of 2021 david d5 builders i'm not throwing everyone under this bus but there's been a lot of them and there have been a lot of d5 builders that i feel like have abandoned their projects just like orphaned them things got a little tough right they go and got tough and they folded yeah i feel a little bit like um defy grandpa over here saying back in my day ruined christmas didn't quit when the going got tough but that's a bit how i feel and i just want to say rather than calling out some of the d5 projects that did abandon the founders that did abandon their projects um i just want to give a shout out to all the d5 founders that didn't even when the going got tough and there are a lot of them i created a thread where um the community kind of tagged a lot of people here and it gave me some hope that you know what a lot of d5 founders stayed with their projects did not choose to abandon i mean ultimately i don't understand why d5 founders are taking the shortcut reputational shortcut when we're at the very first stages of a multi-decade industry of like you're going to abandon your project like people are going to remember that i know i'm going to remember bankless community will remember and uh it might make it a little bit hard to to re-enter after you've done something like this that's all i'll say defy grant's over the the sad part is is that ether is such a like a lucratively bullish asset that if you exit into ether you still get so much upside so i think that's where a large amount of the incentive comes from it's like oh if i like abandon my project i'll have enough ether to stake for life it's the same story david we saw this in the icos right yeah a whole bunch of them just kind of did an ico and they half asked their project right but then they kept all the eth right yeah but also i would say yeah it's people that like take money too early right that's another problem of defy is like we fund people with way too much money way too soon and they're like wait but i just made all the money like what that was the point i'm done here i know uh we're got to work on that for sure uh david next thing though is the big boy story okay so i don't watch bit boy at all like i've never seen i've never seen a bit boy i've heard of him by reputation so let me just say that could you give some people some context for who who bit boy is i get the sense that there's a whole nother world of uh crypto youtube out there we are barely youtubers by the way if you're listening if you're watching this on youtube we are podcasters who put our stuff on youtube we try our best all right we're like we're not youtube optimized yet although we're getting better right david yeah but anyway bitboy was purely crypto youtube and what what was he all about what was his platform yeah he's i mean he's got an insane following i think he's got something like uh over a million followers uh i called him and well i participated in some of this drama i commented on a degen spartan suite thread calling him like the alex jones of crypto and maybe we could get the editor to actually play that clip just a small like showcase of who he is he's got this insane setup uh like just like a stupid media studio office thing kind of like how alex jones does and then makes some just like very ridiculous like statements about crypto like the one we're about to play right here i won't be very clear on this the us government is 100 percent behind the crash of usd anyways very bombastic dude uh and also it's totally again completely known for just like dumping on his followers that's the i don't think he's dumping on his followers uh signing deals receiving tokens pumping the tokens and then selling the tokens like that's just the general pattern right okay and like i don't know this because i watch him personally i know this because that's what everyone in my sphere like comments on and so it's to the point of like why would i ever go watch bitboy like uh uh yeah um anyways so that's the start of the story so here is a thread from a twitter handle tagged a toesy a-t-o-z-y and he puts out this uh thread that says i wish i didn't have to make this red but i'm being sued by youtuber bitboy crypto for a video i made roughly nine months ago covering how he promoted a project named pamp p-a-m-p it's called yeah last night a third server like somebody who like i i listened to this guy's youtube video three he got served three different times um and the third person finally actually showed up with a real lawsuit and according to the and this house yeah uh-huh the the first two were just like drafts of lawsuits the third one was the actual lawsuit and so this crypto youtuber he made this youtube video about bitboy it was like a journalist like yo this guy dumps on his followers he like promotes makes promotions uh and then these tokens rug and so like this whole pam token like pumped and then it went to zero uh after like bit boy covered it and i think this is just like one of many many many things that big boy has covered uh and so ben armstrong aka bitboy says erling mensheng jr which is a toesie posted a video on youtube entitled this youtuber scams his fans bitboy crypto in november 2021. i'm reading out the details of the bitboy filed lawsuit right now the lawsuit claims a laundry list of offenses in that video including defamation infliction of emotional distress torturous interference with business relations or potential business uh or potential business relations violation of the uniform deceptive practices act and violence violation of the fair business practices act uh and so this is bit boy suing a toesie for these things and all satoshi did was like talk about how bitboy pumped this token and then and then dumped the token and dogen went to zero and so which you can see on chain you can see it all it's back totally audited it's not speculation and so this a tosi person he's not like he's just such a normal youtuber so he doesn't have the money to fight this lawsuit so this is bitboy who makes bajillions of dollars pumping and dumping tokens again allegedly i'm pretty sure it's true though um oh david's showing up at our house yeah and we're getting yeah you're gonna see you're gonna see a gofundme for another bit boy uh lawsuit anyways bitboy coming in hard with like paying a ton of lawyers to like slam this guy with a bunch of lawsuits that he can't afford so this crypto youtuber atosi spins up this gofundme with a 50 000 goal to defend him from bitboy's lawsuit and this is when it gets into crypto twitter and crypto twitter doesn't like bitboy no one likes bitboy except for youtubers or youtube consumers who probably don't know better and so cryptocondom uh excuse the name this is actually like a crypto community member who's pretty good says i will be donating to atosi's legal fees related to bitboys lawsuit if you have the means i encourage everyone else to donate to scammers like bitboy are a net negative to the space and should not be supported if we don't believe our police ourselves no one else will and so this is when this gofundme starts to actually gain some traction and then coming up next kobe uh tweets out uh i'll send a hundred thousand dollars later or something win at pc and then that gets eight thousand likes uh and then toby follows up a little bit later says sent uh and yes kobe actually did send a hundred thousand dollars to this uh this uh crypto non-crypto youtuber normal crypto youtubers just like ethereum address i'm assuming ethereum address uh and so what happens next what happens next ryan is that bitboy drops a lawsuit so this is autism capital saying hearing bitboy succumb to social pressure and announce he's dropping the lawsuit can anyone verify and then the next tweet says yes indeed and so here's the clip that bitboy said where he's on his own like youtube channel saying i'm dropping the lawsuit okay we're at is at this point it has become public it's become uh an absolute [ __ ] we know kobe game 100 000 so uh you know hopefully that money will go to good use uh but yeah so we are going to drop a lawsuit 100 and uh i'm sorry this became public i'm ryan you want to know my favorite quote from this little clip here yeah give it to me where bitboy says i'm sorry this became public is what he says i'm sorry i was found out i'm sorry i was found out to do frivolous lawsuits to allow myself to continue to dump on my followers okay but uh yeah david here's one thing that doesn't connect to me this feels like um you know victims keep going back to their abuser why does this why does this person have youtube uh views why does he have followers why do why do people like why do people do subject themselves to this so like look at the production value of this like of bipwit right like fantastic production value no wonder he has a million views he's optimized the youtube algorithm he's played the game he's got his ads everywhere he's got his like topics that he's run down and like this kind of goes back to the heart of like crypto i think where like there are some projects that like you have these open source developers that just care about code they don't know how to market and then you have other projects which market themselves to the very end and that's the product and they forget about the actual code development this is the same thing this bit boy hyper marketing optimized knows crypto to enough extent to when people like oh like i would like to know about crypto i'll go to the most number one follow crypto youtube channel because clearly that's the best channel uh and then they listen to bit boy crypto who's like pamp token is gonna pamp it's in the name and then and then he's paid a promotion for that and then token goes to zero uh and he makes a bunch of money and then wash and repeat because people like people these days have amnesia they forget everything i would say why do people go back to like their abusive relationship is because people have amnesia ryan they forget yeah i've you know one once uh commented that that crypto twitter crypto in general has the memory of the goldfish you know like we just like constantly forget things but is this also a lesson that if bankless ever gets if we ever get our stuff together and we increase our production value people better like be scared okay well we do plan on increasing our youtube production value he's looking back at his studio that he's just built and he's like uh oh what did i just say oh i think we can do both it just takes longer you just gotta take something right not take shortcuts don't take shortcuts plus like the bankless community's intelligent if we ever started like pumping and dumping tokens it would they would be over so fast it wouldn't even take a half a second to like oh like bankless went evil they wouldn't they wouldn't allow us to do that they wouldn't let us do that no we would go to zero so fast man what a story though that's crazy uh my favorite favorite part about this yeah so so since they dropped a lawsuit like well uh they made atosi made two hundred thousand dollars and he says once i have it confirmed it's officially pulled i will be refunding everyone who donated uh and then kobe says uh use my money my hundred thousand dollars to pay for the gas fees for a lot of people the individual donators but then also kobe follows up and says keep some for a vacation to smiley face good job well done hey look well done both of these lessons right it's like the last lesson is like not take don't take shortcuts this lessons don't take shortcuts also i love this this concept of we can also police ourselves at the social layer too we need to do much more of that in crypto and call these things out so good job uh a toesie youtuber man i am so not connected with uh crypto youtube though this just shows me that i'm just living in a different world david what do we got coming up next oh my god so much okay uh merge updates we got some merge updates for y'all of course uniswap is getting a brain uh cue that part uh of the wizard of oz where the scarecrow says if i only had a brain uh there's a meme on that later between nike and adidas made 200 million dollars in total nft revenue but one of them made a lot more than the other so we'll get into which one may which one won the nft game in 2021 all of that and more right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrary is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts

that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zk sync has combined the power of zero knowledge roll-ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but cryptokiller apps need zk sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge roll ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zk sync is leading the charge into the final frontier of cryptoeconomics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zk sync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on twitter too at zksync alright guys we are back another merge update this is a date now it's an official date not just a tweet on twitter it's a tweet from timbeko in the theorem uh foundation so timbako says ethereum's transition to proof of stake is happening client releases are out upgrade your update your node that's the thing you have to do if you're running a node by the way um first part of the merge bellatrix happens on september 6 and then the full transition eta september 15th not even a date range not even the 15th to the 16th september 15th mark your calendar david is that the official date september 15th that is well uh no because it's still the it's still an official ttd number total terminal difficulty uh so there is no official date that ttd number can hop around but it's an official ttd number which says the same thing there's no there's no new ttd number the only thing that's new this week is that we have new client software that instantiates that tdd number into the clients and so as soon as you update your clients that ttd number goes into your client and then it's hands off from there that the bellatrix activates and then later is the merge the current estimated merge time right now is 6 20 am eastern time thursday september 15th this number's been hopping around uh it used to be like 8 a.m uh then it hopped around to like 4 a.m and now it's now it's at 6 20 a.m but it's looking like thursday early morning eastern time uh pacific specific people and also eastern people you're probably gonna be in bed uh but this number will continue to hop around but you know zeroing in on thursday morning september 15th this link in the show notes is a script that actually calculates it based on the current hash rate so you can always get the update on that even though you know bank was gonna update you on a weekly basis yeah we're gonna talk about everything this is gonna happen until it actually happens because as do analytics says the merge is coming here are the top dashboards to follow the action uh anything here we should pick out i guess maybe a link for people and a resource for people if they want to follow the merge there are a ton of dashboards from dune analytics where they can see the intricate details of all of the numbers that make up the merge so uh anything here to point out david yeah all six of these dashboards are fantastic it's just a nice little command station to sing the merge i don't really have anyone particularly this favorite but just as a resource these are available to you you know the bigger question i think is there was this uh rag of a publication a you know a terrible uh newsletter terrible terrible newsletter um that published an article said why would you ever publish this title of it is the merger over hyped who published this people who are not seeing on on youtube this is bankless okay this is a bankless article we had our friend uh jordy alexander do you remember jordy alexander so he came at a time when everyone was uh just so frothy bullish about tara luna and he took the bear case very difficult at the time difficult position to take the bear case for tara luna at its peak when was this april did we do this march april something like this like about uh a month before the terror collapse essentially and jordy took the position that like i know everyone's bullish on this thing but there are a few tail risk events you really should look at and i think they're fairly high probability a month later it's it's completely beat up and by the way a whole bun most people a lot of people coming out of that debate thought jordy lost the debate yes yeah jose the other guy just absolutely sweep the floor with him but then if you go back to the youtube comments they're all like oh like now oh really yeah if you if you see the uh uh the chart of viewers on that video you know it's the normal curve and then tara collapses and it gets another huge bump because people went back and watched it and so like the four month old youtube comments are like jordy got railed by jose and then the three month old youtube comments are like oh jordy was right oh jordy got it right wow jordy was right but here's this case we asked jordy to write an uh eth um bear article for us even merged bear article because david and i couldn't bring ourselves to write that all right because we don't actually have to leave it but uh fantastic article and i think like any time we have a thesis on something or bullish on something we'd love to get kind of the the counter to that or the um the steel man case for why not and i think jordy puts in a fantastic steel man case so a few things by the way this is full of uh fantastic memes throughout the article but let me try to summarize some of his uh high-level takes and get your reaction to this david as an eth bull right so one thing he says is that yeah there's these three dragons to the triple havening to the east merge bullishness one is reduced issuance he says yep i understand that that's pretty bullish i get it the second is eip1559 burn and the third is locked staked eth okay so he's good with the reduced issuance but he says burn has been down pretty bad okay like look at burn over time so it's because blocks base is in much lower demand than it was during d5 summer and then later nft like the whole nft boom and then if you look at like this past summer david uh we're not even deflationary no that's not deflationary and so what's what's with your ultrasound money merge money if it's not even deflationary that's what jordy's saying and there's not an indication he says that a positive catalyst ahead that will actually bring this block space demand back maybe it goes all alternative layer ones maybe it goes to layer twos that don't consume as much block space revenue so there's that and then he also chips into the east staking rate and he says it's actually a lot lower than a lot of people are saying so he calculates the eat staking rate at steady state in like 2023 to be closer to like one to two percent uh yields so in real terms in real terms is what he's saying yeah in real terms yes you stake your eath and maybe you're getting like three or four percent but then you have to subtract the issuance of each which is maybe you know one and a half percent so you're left with like you know one uh to two percent right really yield and he's like no one's going to be super excited about that and he's calculating this based on a whole bunch of more people will stake right and so that the yield goes down and so maybe you'll get like you know 20 to 30 million each staked in the network and i can't remember what it is right now david but it's like it's like 15 million i can't even remember i shouldn't even say that but uh it's a lot less now and so these are some of his um his his bare thesis cases for why the word merge won't really matter what was your take when you read the the high level of this article my high level article was that jordy is making an argument against an outdated bowl case both like outdated stats and so he's taking like may 2021 or november 2021 gas price of gas markets and he's making the his argument that it's not bullish against that and i mean we we have since then like who don't see this i'm not going to explain this one um and so he's making like yes there was previously more bullish parts of the ethereum economy gas prices used to be a lot higher therefore the ethereum burn used to be a lot more and it's no longer the case and i mean since then we've adjusted the numbers the yield numbers like if we had may 2021 gas prices like we were looking at like a 15 yield on staking ether uh and like we used to say that on the weekly rollout because that used to be the data but that is no longer the data and now we've adjusted down to where it is now at like 5.2 without mev and maybe perhaps maybe six plus percent with mev uh but jordi is taking the a frame a slice of data that was in the bull market um and now but also and so that that's the gas market thing now i will say that the eth supply reduction is was always going to be more significant than the ether burn simply just like when you compare those things there's less ether burn less ether issued that's the name bulls are bullish on supply reduction right and so even at these like even if you take the barrett most bearish gas fees which is at like seven or eight percent that goes from point four three percent ether issuance down to point two percent so the burn just lowers it by a measly point two percent but it's cutting the issuance down by fifty 50 because it already is so low and so like that's still this bold case is still strong and if you go and compare it to bitcoin issue and so like 1.5 or solana issuance and avalanche issuance at like six and seven percent like it's still fundamentally bullish it's just not ultra uber mega bullish that it would have been if we had merged during like defy summer for example so that's the gas market thing did you see this argument too yeah it's like you know one side steak diet will be locked off the market yeah you're super happy about this but then you realize the unlock will hang over us for over a year so this is because everyone is essentially depositing if they're staking and it's it's one way but then there will be this big unlocking event maybe a year from now and all of that you know 15 20 30 million worth of eth is suddenly unlocked and his argument is the market's going to price that in ahead of time too and that makes the case less uh bullish and maybe bearish sure the market will price it in but we need to make sure like are all the unlockers going to be sellers because i don't think necessarily so like typically we use this word unlock or like invest like investing unlocks for like angel investors or seed investors that got in at valuations 1 10th or 1 100th and so of the supply of the asset so like of course they're going to sell it doesn't matter what price it's at they're going to sell because they're up so much that's not the case with ether like the average ether deposit price i think is like 700 or 800 so like the average person is up a 2x and so like yeah maybe obviously some people have had their stuff like illiquid for so long that they're going to sell but i don't really think it's going to turn this into the systemic cell event when the apys go up too by the way up from four percent up to like five six maybe seven percent if mvp is really strong uh i don't really think they're like we use this term unlocked be like oh investors unlocks are totally going to dump that's not true with ether stakers ether stakers are fundamentally bullish that's the whole point of proof of stake is that you reward ether holders who want to be long-term holders and so the people that stake their ether back when ether price was like 300 to 700 they're the people who are like yeah i'm fine with having my ether be a liquid for two years three years an unknown amount of time they're fundamentally the most bullish ether owners there are because they take the illiquidity of it and they don't care about that so they're not likely to be sellers so i don't really think it's fair to say that like all of these finally we get this big unlocking and everyone runs for the exit so they can dump their tokens i don't see that happening well anyway i think we could have an entire episode oh wait no i'm not done we got one more you're not done we got one more point and so his last his last argument is that the yields go down to a super low amount uh can you go to that part in the in the articles that like uh the the if we if we have something like uh 30 000 ether staked and ryan ryan i pulled this up right now there's 14 000 ether staked if we get something like 30 000 ether staked the issuance of ethereum goes up because as more people stake the more ether is issued to reward those people the yield the per validated yield goes down but total ether issuance goes up and so that's his argument that like well we have increasing actual ether inflation and decreasing yields for stakers and so the yields are actually going to be way lower than people expect but he's missing the part that the way to get to like 30 000 plus ether staked is 16 000 million ether comes off the market and begins staking 16 million 16 million ether comes off the market and begins staking and so he skipped over the bullish part of that right which is that a bunch of ether gets locked up so you can't forget that bull side and that is my complete rebuttal of the uh bear case for the merge it's not complete come on you know it sounding like david wants to get on a podcast with uh jordy and really hash this out and have a debate but i also remember what happened to the last guy who did that i was defending tara and i'm defending ethereum i do think if there's demand in bankless nation if you guys are excited about this uh let us know maybe we'll have a hal press plus david plus jordy plus another uh bear debate on this uh maybe we'll get checkmatey in the scene or something uh anyway a lot of discussion about this and i think it's uh it's really fun to look at both sides of the argument david let's get to this uh uniswap has a brain that's what you've been saying and then teased to this what do you mean by this how's uniswap getting a brain uniswap uni governance voted overwhelmingly at 86 million to 770 so i call it 99.9 yes to create the uniswap foundation we've talked about this at precursors for this there was a governance proposal and also a sentiment check but now formal vote token snapshot vote has gone through overwhelmingly in support of creating the uni-swap foundation so what what does this mean what are the details of this um the the blog post says there is work to do to help union swap reach its full potential the governance process has too much friction the ecosystem is too difficult to navigate and the ugp unit swap governance process in its current form is not able to fund the most ambitious and impactful projects we want to change that today we are excited to propose the creation of the uniswap foundation which has the submission to support the decentralized growth and sustainability of the uniswap protocol and its supporting ecosystem and community today we are thrilled to propose the creation of the uniswap foundation and then some details scope team budget and governance participation scope the uf the first foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process will support the protocols decentralized growth reinvigorate governance and serve as a protocol advocate the team behind this is going to be devin walsh who will serve as executive director and ken eng who will serve as head of operations they also have a team of 12 behind them they've got some budget requests as well 14 million dollars of operating budget to cover a team for three years and 60 million dollars expanded unit swap grants program budget to cover three plus years so they are requesting a total of 74 million dollars from the unit swapped out which we broken up into two disbursements a first disbursement of 28 million dollars and lastly in governance participation also requesting 2.5 million uni to participate in governance primarily through delegation through usage of a new smart contract primitives called the franchisor and this uni will be revocable by the dow at any time and cannot be used for any purposes outside of governance and so uniswap getting the foundation nice okay so uh one question i have on that david is there's 74 million dollars that's that's going to to fund um the the uniswap uh foundation where is that coming from i would imagine it's got to be like uni uni token uh sales at some level from the dow maybe yeah if not already then future sales i don't know i don't know that's uh one interesting thing to check into but like am i also on the understanding that so we have we have three pieces here we have the protocol right uniswap itself which is not a legal entity or anything else it's smart contract code and then we have uniswap labs which is the thing hayden and team are doing that is venture backed that is continuing to to buy companies and create tools for the uniswap ecosystem and then now we also have this uniswap foundation and their job will be to kind of steward the protocol itself a bit more uh and uh i guess grow it is that is that the model here yeah it's exactly right and i've looked into the governor's proposal it's all coming out of the uni token yes uh so this is all funded by the uni token so this will uh create some cell pressure i think in uni in the short run uh now they're doing this in chunks like first district uh distribution of 20 million and then kind of the remaining but also um you could say bullish on uni-swap getting a brain yeah this foundation yeah don't who cares about 20 million dollars of cell pressure that's a blip uni token is actually pretty liquid the point is is that uniswap can be just more organized if you listen to our podcast episode with hazu these daos need direction and centralization centralization's not a bad word uh and the foundation can do this um in addition to the two uh to uh ken eng and devon walsh we also have some advisors jesse walden from variant julia rosenberg from oakland uh from orca protocol alexis gauba gaoba from open and heart lamber from uma um and then they also have already talked about some proposals that they're trying to get done which is building uniswap in the cairo language for starknet and other things that like i think the unit swap without a brain just might not have been able to get done so i think that is the reason why we should be bullish here is that you know execution execution matters and if you're curious to why it doesn't have a brain why uniswap labs is not necessarily that full brain i think the asu podcast is the answer to your question but uh here's a nice meme the scarecrow yeah from scarecrow from uh wizard of the audience there's that one song where the scarecrows cuts i only had a brain but this one's if i only had a foundation this is every doll by the way dancing around like a scarecrow uh block okay this is cool this is a tweet from blackworks but um did you know david this is a another chart from dude analytics uh nike and adidas had nfts last year nike revenue was a hundred and eighty-five million dollars damn adidas was 11 million but in total like so nike absolutely swamped the floor with adidas but think about how much money that is for nike nft what do you think the costs of these nfts were very little three million yeah and right i bet you the biggest cost was legal 10 million yeah like but think about these profit margins so if you think that large corporations are just going to pass this by pass up this frame uh you don't understand look at that secondary trading volume of nike nfts 1.3 billion dollars of secondary trading volume crazy you know they have royalties on that look at these other look at these other brands too dolce gabbana here tiffany's here gucci here adidas here budweiser here time magazine here nft nice nfts are just a fad never coming back okay so look at that data there's two columns they're private primary sales revenue 93 million dollars for nike 92 million dollars in royalties off of that secondary volume crazy crazy crazy yeah more companies are going to join this and um nft market will be back i'm sure uh but in the short run we are uh seeing some resurgence in some of the other classic non-corporate nft's pudgy penguins penguins pump 83 as meta and nansen executives join advisory board ryan facebook huh yeah right uh you want to hear a funny story ryan yes you know when we were talking about how uh how i was moving wallets uh from a while ago yes well i'm also slowly doing that for my nft wallet and just like getting rid of all these like nfts that i thought were dead yeah and so i sold my pudgies literally two days no you didn't before this happened david oh it was it was like perfectly ironic it's like i sell these things just because like i don't really really know what's happening with these things these are just something i would assume they they're dead too yeah and then like literally like out of nowhere like that has the biggest resurgence of all time it was like literally the pico bottom it was fantastic it was great why you listen to bankless for your nft alpha every single week because uh dave and i know what we're doing we know we know what we're doing the jpegs do you know we do know a little bit about d5 and this is kind of a blend of d5 plus nfts this thing called ben dao which basically like uh i think of it as maker it's like um it's like collateralized loans backed by nfts so but there was kind of a crisis last week with ben dao what happened yeah so ben bend out nft liquidity protocol of course uh you can put your nfts into bend out and borrow eth against them uh some of the top nft profile uh collections in there azuki's board api clubs clone x crypto punks doodles mutant apes and space doodles um and the thing is is that once upon a time bendall had about 18 000 eath earlier last weekend and that went down to 15. not 15 000 15. yikes 15 eth it's currently back up to 4500 as of a couple days ago but basically what happened was that all of the ether you lend your eath to ben dao and that eat and then you get a yield on that each very strong yield and then that bendall lends out that each to people that collateralize their nfts you could get an 80 percent yield on your and your ether because they were in such a short supply of ether because all these nft collateralization people were borrowing were borrowed up all they eat they use all the bandwidth it's like if compound utilization if you put like a if compound has like a hundred thousand dollars of usdc in it and then like there's 98 thousand dollars 98 percent of that uscc is utilized they're going to jack up the interest for interest rates to incentivize people to pay back their ether so what's going on here is they jacked up the interest rates or yields paid to ether lenders and they also what they did in order to fix this just like credit crunch they had is that they pass emergency parameters to progressively lower the liquidation threshold from 95 percent to a new baseline of 70 incoming on september 20th so it's going to go from where it is now at 95 percent to where it will be in the future at 75 percent or 70 basically like making liquidations more likely to happen increasing it's like increasing the interest rates the bendao if it's a if it's like a maker dow they're increasing the interest rates and making more strict capital requirements for nft lenders so that they can pay back their loans and get ether back into the coffers i will say this is not a failure this is actually quite the opposite i would say this is a big success it's so it was so successful that they uh all the borrowers used up all the ether and they just had to jack up the interest rates the the first time the first time maker dell had to go through a cycle dye was trading below a peg and they had to jack up interest rates from like point zero five percent to almost twenty percent i remember i feel like this is this is the same thing with ben dao it's like yo everyone's using the protocol we ran out of like credit we need to jack up interest rates so we can like get more yeah but they almost they almost went insolvent in the process right so they they they bent they didn't break but like they almost i wouldn't call it insolvency they just had more loans outstanding than they can issue they couldn't issue any more loans they didn't have more enough money in the in the system there is a great explanation if you want all the details from william pister who does know a thing or two about nfts in mediversal and you can read through that um ryan was joking earlier we don't know [ __ ] about nfts i think one of the things though david is uh that ben dao has definitely learned through this episode is that nfts are not quite as liquid as maybe they thought they were so it's one thing if you're selling eth as collateral in a maker type auction because you have to liquidate it's another thing when you've got like 50 board apes and you're trying to find buyers for those things of course that's what makes them non-fungible and lower liquidity profile in them right now david gensler's back what's he saying now he wrote a op-ed in the wall street journal uh i read part of this uh it was also paywalled um maybe there are a few choice tweets or choice quotes we could take out of it but basically his take is there's no reason to treat the crypto market differently from the rest of the capital markets just because it uses a different technology the fax machine and the internet are the same thing that was my paraphrase that's not his paraphrase that end part but like i feel like that's kind of what he's saying right uh what are your thoughts on this david he also made a video on this and basically he's saying like oh yeah like uh crypto markets traditional equities markets they're the same thing therefore we should regulate both of them uh which is a hot take uh but also just like you're having you're trying to like have your cake and eat it too it's like you're you're saying you want to regulate the crypto markets and therefore we should treat crypto markets like the traditional equities markets but then you're also not treating us fairly and this is what kobe said when he uh when he followed up and says sounds good spot etf then because if kobe said or if gensler says okay we're going to treat the crypto markets like we treat the traditional equities markets that means we get spot etfs that's what that means and so he says like we the sec according to gary gensler should regulate the crypto markets just like they regulate the the traditional equities markets and if they but then he also doesn't want to treat us regularly like normally so there's a double standard at play yeah huge double standard there's a double standard but he also doesn't understand that this is a much different technology it's not like that it's kind of like covering your eyes and plugging your ears and just kind of ignoring the differences between crypto and the traditional equities markets of which the differences are also vast these are two different technologies it's fax machine versus internet and i would definitely say that gary gensler is playing this narrative game he knows they're not the same he used to teach classes at mit about blockchain and so he's trying he's doing a pr stunt saying hey the sec is going to regulate the crypto markets because they're the same as equities markets there's no new magic here the sec is going to regulate these things it's just not hard we can have a nuanced conversation about what pieces are the same because there are parts that are the same as the equities markets some of these things are securities are different let's have a nuanced conversation about that and let's get some clarity mark cuban had a tweet uh take two he says uh to gary gensler who says there's no reason to treat the crypto market differently uh just come in and talk to me mark cuban says come in and talk to who set up an appointment how you using calendly these days since you understand crypto lending and finances why don't you just publish brightline guidelines you would like to see and open it up for comments we don't want regulation legislation by wall street journal op-ed all we're asking for at some like just some clear experiences the same sidelines or even treat us the same and don't have a double standard uh very confusing here but seriously gary come on the podcast i think the best way of clearing all this up is to engage with the crypto community that's what you should be doing we'd love to have you on bank list sincerely we've had hester person we've had other cftc regulators on we would love to have gary gensler on pretty friendly we could talk about this uh give us your perspective david do you have a take care the the thing is people outside of the crypto industry have noticed gary's lack of popularity and so this are also an article that came out in in forbes i believe yeah forbes uh was titled gary gensler colin resign uh from a writer called uh roslyn layton from the international tech policy not a crypto person but like gary gensler is like losing the public support like left and right uh and so gary gensler like gotta win hearts and minds and you can do that by coming on bankless yeah we don't want you to resign until you tell us what you really think about crypto and we can have a good conversation first come on bankless uh all right david do you know coinbase's ens integration is finally out in the wild what does this mean yeah so this is in the coinbase wallet i'm pretty sure not the coin normal coinbase consumer app but uh if you are a coinbase wallet user you get an ens name built into that wallet so this is a user who's got debanked dot cb dot id interestingly ryan not dot eth did that catch your attention there's no dot eve it is actually an ens integration and so from from the article it says on a technical level both cb dot id and dot eth can be used on multiple networks uh we determined that most users associate each ids solely with ethereum and so coinbase chose cb.id because they want to make it easier for people to understand that a username is not tied to ethereum and can be used on multiple networks however did you know ryan that your your dot eth name can work in in bitcoin wallets and litecoin wallets and dough coin wallets that is by run by the the ens standard yeah and so coinbase wallet is just like kind of making that a little bit more formal cb id saying hey this can work for your ethereum address but it can also work for your bitcoin address it can also work for you what's happening here coinbase is just giving these to all of its users yeah basically yeah and all of its users who are using the coinbase wallet users are becoming decentralized either claim your current username or decline and get a random 20 character username so you get your own ens name you get one by default yeah that's cool what is this extension though cb dot id what is this i think it just means identification identifier yeah but i know but like what how are they getting a dot id is this like i guess this has something to do with dns and this is a dns dot id like a dot com like a dot org so another fun fact of ens is that it's actually dns compliant it also operates with the traditional dns system uh and i think i don't know the details beyond this but like the dot id is a dns thing so you can uh oh actually ryan go and type in type in this into uh into your url it worked it took you back here you already had the web page you just sent me back to the same site yeah but but it worked it's like yeah so like if you have like uh this is this also works does i think this also works no this doesn't work with david hoffman.if does it depend out no it doesn't work with david hoffman.if but that and that's why and so the id name is a dns name and so that's what you have in every browser exactly works in it it works in your browser yeah but that's not completely decentralized because there's still some dns linkage there i suppose but whatever okay cool that's cool getting better swell uh what is swell are they another staking provider yeah staking as a service provider basically swell is a hybrid between rocket pool and lido so they have a permissioned validator set which allows for capital efficiency but they also have a permission list validator set which allows for permissionlessness and so they uh they had a test net launch not too long ago now they have a guarded launch coming soon uh and so swell network uh is coming out uh news taking as a service protocol we gotta love that competition that's awesome um also more competition of course in layer two world so just a reminder now i think there are five days is it five or four days five five days okay five days till arbitrary releases nitro which is the next release of arbitram and of course the tl dr is this is faster cheaper transactions for you if you are an arbitrary user awesome to see layer 2's upgrading as well david speak of upgrades you have an opportunity to upgrade your job right now upgrade your job okay this is our reminder to you to what david get a job in crypto because it's the most fun place to have a job absolutely that's that's the rule what could be more fun uh number one jobs i'm going to read some out for you uh missouri it's looking for a software engineer two software engineers one

scrolling through them for all the people boards for all the people that watch the youtube i'm aware my dancing is extremely crazy no one's ever said anything that i've seen david it must be great i can i can feel it all right what's going on next coming up next we got questions from the nation which layer two are you most bullish on and why and also how can you explain the merge to normies and also of course some hot takes from crypto twitter the meme of the week and also a fantastic moment of zen coming out from gabriel haynes uh it's about bit boy ryan uh so all that coming up and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your trucking account with juno you can send money from your

back starting the questions for the nation of course a reminder if you have a question for dave and myself follow bankless on twitter that's banklesshq on twitter we tweet tweeted out you can reply to the thread get your question answered the first one is from two commas dot eth how do i summarize and explain the importance of the merge and its implications to my normie friends who ask me about it it's a good question from commas dot eth explain it like i'm five david how do you explain the merge to someone who doesn't know anything about crypto doesn't really care about crypto god these are all be so hard all right i'm gonna go for it uh okay ethereum it's the number two blockchain behind bitcoin it's the thing that created defy and like smart contracts and allows us to do things like decentralized finance stuff borrowing and lending trading et cetera so that's the big blockchain it's got the majority of all economic activity inside of crypto created nfts it's that blockchain it's the big blockchain it's proof of work which is that thing that consumes a lot of electricity which a lot of people in the outside world don't like and it's always been proof of work but it's always wanted to go to this thing called proof of stake proof of work works by if you lie to the blockchain you basically burn electricity for no reason and proof of stake works that if you lie to the blockchain you lose your ether ether the native currency of ethereum how proof of stake works is that you stake your ether to the promise that you're not going to lie to the blockchain and if you do lie to the blockchain by trying to add in a false transaction an invalid transaction you get your ether slashed so it's kind of like proof of work in that you just lose money but you lose money a lot faster and a lot more quickly and a lot more money in proof of stake so generally the crypto world is like this is just a better more efficient way to secure a blockchain we don't have to consume electricity we also don't have to have uh bitcoin be sold because of proof of work because of all this electricity consumption because there's no electricity consumption you don't have to issue as much ether to pay for that electricity consumption and these stakers don't have to sell their ether so it makes ether really bullish and how was that pretty good pretty good i think it's i think it's hard to explain honestly you know it kind of what i go back to is just like buy a hundred dollars on coinbase worth of eath and then ask me questions as you're curious about it ah so it's just like i feel like but what if not what if this is the question they're asking you about then then i i get them to listen to bank lists and you explain your thing i think it's like that it's sometimes people aren't interested until they have some skin in the game they actually have financial i wasn't really interested as interested in crypto until i owned some bitcoin and then i was like oh this is cool why are the numbers going up and why are they going down what does this all mean right that's why i actually advocate like don't dump your entire net worth in here but like if you want to get into crypto buy some first do it step one buy something just do it not financial advice um all right that was the first question let's get to the second when the merge occurs this is from eddie coates when the merge occurs what if anything will eath holders have to do will it automatically convert or will holders need to sell out of the old and buy buy into the v2 thanks guys bankless podcast is lit you have to do anything as an ether holder no i'm so glad i'm so glad the answer is no the answer is no you don't have to do anything you're going to have ether in your wallet and then you're still gonna have ether in your wallet you will actually not notice a thing the merge is a kind of like a software update you know when you plug your phone in and then it just like updates while you're sleeping it's gonna be like that you're not gonna notice it not gonna notice and updates like this have happened many times in ethereum's history and you probably haven't noticed if you've been here for one of them it'll just be like one of those that's if everything goes well [Music] it should go well but nothing you should have to do last question from sat kc.eth ask the question which layer 2 scaling solution are you most bullish about and why and he lists a few starkness zk sync polygon scroll can't help but notice david all of these have a similar theme and they are zk evms yeah which layer two scaling solution are you most bullish about is the question and why i am most bullish on yes they're all great they're all great uh like okay i'll give you different reasons why you should be bullish on every single one uh starknet apparently after listening to a podcast which i'm about to talk in a sec this cairo coding language and this overall the developer support and like building out cairo and accepting like updates from developers has been great so the developer user experience for stark net has been just a lot of adoption developers love it they've built along in a lot of ways yeah yeah and like definitely their bd skills are really strong they i think they were the first to market so like uh stark net like can't not be bullish uh zk sync alex and team have been around ethereum from the beginning they're also doing uh a separate um an evm compatible strategy uh with with their zk roll up they just like exude the values of ethereum and like we just see adoption of things that like exude the values of ethereum unit swap i would put in this category and so like they just have like fundamental ethereum alignment at their tailwinds uh they've been around for a while they're like friends with all the other developers in this space uh they're they're just very well connected uh and then okay let's go to polygon polygon also has their proof of stake chain which is a like not a zk roll up but like the most bullish thing possible i don't know if this is possible but if it is possible it's really bullish is that their current proof of stake chain just rolls into their zk roll up if that's possible really really cool scroll the most bullish thing about scroll is that it's got evm equivalents they're going for the very hard task of evm equivalents which is if you can deploy your thing on the ethereum layer one you can also deploy your thing onto the optimism layer too without changing a goddamn thing and you can also deploy it to scroll which is a zk evm without changing a goddamn thing also really [ __ ] super strong engineering team though it's a harder problem right yes it's like all of these have different strengths they all have they're all different flavors so like i like i like many different flavors and they're all both they're all bullish they're wrong this question is like asking you know which of your kids is your favorite like i can't answer that question they're all special i feel like you can't answer that question out loud no it's true okay i have three kids and i love them all equally kids if you're listening you guys are fantastic all of you equally so are stark net zk sync polygon and scroll david takes the week let's get into the week uh first take here from you yeah you want to read your own tweet no i'll read your tweet okay it's better that way from david hoffman my favorite version of the future is the one where global forex markets are traded on a unicorn themed venue this is uniswap i imagine yeah you think that's real i mean i feel like that is actually the most likely version of the future is when like global forex markets are held on uniswap and just like hayden and like his friend carl and vitalik they just like unicorns and so they made it a unicorn theme and then like you know butterfly flaps its wings and all of a sudden global forex markets are like on this unit swap trade unicorn traded venue i still contend that uh uniswap will be the largest exchange in the world um you know sometime in the next 10 years yeah that's right i think that is undoubtedly true but we'll see uh and that'll be funny when it is also you have a podcast that you want us to tune into yeah i don't really know where to fit this into the roll-up but here's my hot take this podcast that i listened to was really really good uh this is into the bike code uh from cena great podcast very technical um but also does a great job of breaking it down for the listener uh and so this is a julian from argent argent smart contract wallet and they talked about just a number of things like built why smart contract wallets need to be the future why smart contract wallets and zk roll-ups go really well together uh account abstraction and overall the developer experience of starkware and zk sync and so this is where i got that take that the starkware team is just doing a great job uh just like making their developers feel good uh so my hot take is that this was a good podcast and you should listen to it i've been waiting for arjun to get legs under uh under itself again because i feel like we haven't yet seen the promise of smart contract wallets oh god no and i'm hoping that later to use bring that but we like we still haven't seen it yet and uh there's just such a promise such a potential there it's a little bit like um layer twos where there's promising potential but we just haven't fully seen it realized uh last take here this is a poll take actually i'm showing the poll results here but let me give you the a b and c uh this is from eric wall a option a the merge will happen as planned in september you vote on that if you think it will happen as planned b it will happen but something big will go wrong like private work miners will refuse to mine the last block a major client consensus split something chaotic that's option b or c it won't happen it'll get postponed all right before i clicked uh my answer which is a i thought that basically a would be the vast majority i thought we'd get like 80 or 90 percent but it turns out what what are the results here david uh it is a that got the most votes um 52 of respondents said um said a it's going to happen as planned in september without any uh problems four to fifteen percent of people said show me the results so 15 of people are automatically off the table 15 of people said b it will happen but something will go wrong and then 18 of people said it's not going to happen it's going to get postponed so if you add b and c together what do you get you get something like 30 33 34 of people think that it's either going to get postponed or go wrong and 52 think it's gonna happen fine and like okay so i've accounted for a 95 success rate in my head and this is accounting for something like um a 66 success rate and so that discrepancy if i'm right means the merge is not priced in that's my takeaway that is an interesting takeaway it's interesting that uh 18 percent think it'll be postponed bitcoin bitcoin it's already been like pushed as an update like it's happening it's going to happen at this point you don't even really have c as an option that's just kind of like i don't know i guess if the world there it's a little bit too late for c yeah yet we have almost 20 percent of people again in this twitter poll but i think it's decently representative of crypto twitter sentiment saying that it's not going to happen it's get postponed and it's like we have a date and the software has been updated and we're just waiting for that date to be activated at this point anyway i do think that there's some alpha there for us uh david what are you bullish on this week man oh i am bullshone you know that high value production studio that we were talking about the bitboy studio the big boy studio well as bitboy exits i hope to enter and i'm going to turn into the new bitboy oh i'm kidding so we are thinking about not totally sure on this but splitting the bankless youtube into bankless podcasts which is our long-form interview formats weekly roll-ups monday podcasts live streams the podcast that you know and love but then also short form bank list 20 minute long like a little bit more just like newbie optimized content your boy's got a teleprompter right behind the screen i got scripts uh and so we're trying to make uh trying to expand bank lists into new audiences because there's a lot of people out there with that when they come to youtube they go oh bitboy he's got all the best information he's trying to steal the audience we're trying we're trying to steal the big boy audience and who and instead of feeding them candy and tokens that go to zero we eat them we junk food we feed them the veggies uh and so with some junk food yeah um not high fructose corn syrup but you know strawberries and raspberries yeah organic junk food anyways that is what i'm bullish on ryan there's a banquet productions bankless studio something and that's actually a side from like this uh joe rogan lex friedman type studio i've got behind me which uh it gets finalized and finished tomorrow uh and then we're off to the races all right that becomes bitboy david you were laughing about this before i hit record but let me tell you why i'm bullish on the constitution here's specifically why all right that doesn't sound like it's overly patriotic because you know i'm reasonably patriotic but i'm not a super patriotic person but i'm really into like social protocols and the constitution happens to be a pretty big one and a pretty important one and a pretty good one uh particularly this thing called the bill of rights and you know uh where i got excited about it was when we were recording with jake trevinsky and basically the takeaways all of the ofac sanctions and developer getting arrested and uh like restrictions on privacy that we're feeling right now what's super interesting is 250 years ago the framers of the constitution creating the bill of rights already thought through these things right like we have this protection problem it's a solved problem and it's actually enshrined in the protocol that governs our country it's like sometimes we get overly afraid of like ofac for example it's like what if we do this thing they put me in prison um they're the ones doing the thing that's illegal they're the ones that are doing the thing that is against the constitution that's unlawful of course we have to prove these cases in court over time but like talk about the first amendment in the bill of rights freedom of speech press protest this is code all right we've precedent legal precedent that code is protected as a first amendment right just like speech is uh the fourth amendment no unreasonable search and seizure this is privacy if you live in america you have the constitutional right to privacy uh number five due process that means the government can't come and seize your property without due process without a court saying it's okay without proving that you did something wrong okay digital rights we have property the government can't come and seize your eth in the u.s that is unconstitutional all of these things and i think it's um it's a bit on the legal front it's a little bit back to like uh getting back to the original protocol of the us right this is why actually i think that you know some people are like um oh the us is too far gone it's turned into a surveillance state all of these things i think that may be true over the past like you know 40 to 50 years we've veered into that but if we can have a generation of people and a group of people who take us back to our roots right and kind of like the actual social contract this entire entire country is founded upon then we can resurface and find our digital rights once again it's almost sounds like i'm running for a political platform i'm really not but you kind of protocol crypto is a political movement isn't it and i want to make sure that we protect these things uh and i am into fighting the fight in the u.s because i think this is a decent place to fight the fight for digital freedom and for cryptocurrency uh because it's like baked into the social contract baked into the narrative of the u.s so why not do it here uh and that's what i intend to do more and more of course it's going to be the jake travinski's of the world the coin centers of the world doing it but like we're going to help through our platform in education to continue that fight yeah ryan is uh bullish on the bill of rights yes i am on to lighter matters how do i how do i get exposure to that okay we're going to buy the bill of rights before that we're going to start did we try that did we try it no we tried to buy the constitution all right what are we looking at mean of the week uh mean of the week uh we have a guy uh doing like the prey squat and he's looking at one of those like uh what do you call those the the uh a stack of rocks that are all balanced on each other and we have like vitalik and inflation and on top of that is a recession and on top of that is a putin and a fed pivot bounce on top of that is a stock pump balance on top of that is sbf arthur hayes medium post the east foundation not selling degen spartan bullish tweets jump capital not selling and then the eth merge pump and we are praying that the aligned rocks here allow us to have a bull market these rocks are built like a jenga castle too it does not look good is what this meme is communicating that's right there you go david what are people in tune in store for for the uh the moment of zen if they're watching on youtube all right okay so there's gabriel haynes he's uh the guy that's just like always like rapping and dancing it was a wrap from gabriel and a song from his wife uh and so that is coming up uh in this moment of zen right after we get through ryan's classic disclaimer of course guys crypto is risky gotta tell you none of this was financial advice but we are headed west this isn't for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot i don't care about you big boy no not it i'm not even one euro [Music] [Applause] [Applause] delight you got too much stress you got a sick bench press you could have been a master class but you got your head up your ass you dish now lawsuits like a hot potato your face is looking all red like a red tomato your mouth is full caviar that shows the world the boy that you are
