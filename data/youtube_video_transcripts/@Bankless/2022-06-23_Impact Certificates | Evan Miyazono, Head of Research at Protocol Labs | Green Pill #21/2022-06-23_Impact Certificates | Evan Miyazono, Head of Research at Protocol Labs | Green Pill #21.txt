[Music] coordination what's good i have a great episode today for you with evan miazano who is the head of research at protocol labs working on the network goods group basically protocol labs and get coin have both independently just kind of started working on similar things over the last couple years protocol apps produces a conference called funding the commons get coin produces a conference called shelling point and they're both convening the people to talk about how we fund public goods how do we fund the commons how do we coordinate in order to create better societal outcomes using web3 and we've just both independently started running these things and doing at scale experiments in how we can do that most of the episode we talked about an idea that evan and i are both really excited about called impact certificates so i think that you as a listener maybe may know about carbon credits which is basically like i took 10 carbon tons of carbon out of the atmosphere and and basically getting financially rewarded for that but imagine a world in which we could generalize carbon credits into any sort of impact say you take 10 people out of poverty say you take uh you fund a eth2 client for a year and you can mint an nft or a verifiable credential proving that you've done that what kind of world would it create in which there was uh demand for impact certificates and people wanted to actually buy those impact certificates for for from you then what we could do is we could create a systemic incentive for the world's actors to work on the commons and to work on impact and then they instantly have a business model because there's demand for the impact certificates that they are generating so there are problems with this idea and we discussed soberly what has to happen with respect to gas costs with legitimacy of the impact certificates creating a market for these impact certificates is no easy task but i think that evan has is one of the most lucid thinkers for us to go into these topics of impact certificates and how they could build towards a world in which the value created by people who are creating impact approaches their ability to create to capture value to put food on the table to pay their mortgage and it's just such an interesting design space to start with such a small experiment with impact certificates and think about what the world would look like if it was maximally successful and that's why i really enjoy this episode with evan from protocol lab so coordination i think you're going to like the episode too it's one of those kind of mind-expanding episodes and evan is just such a good thinker and speaker on this subject so without further ado i give you evan miyazano from protocol labs enjoy opolis is a member-owned

the front lines of refi from industry experts hey evan what's up hey kevin thanks for having me yeah glad to have you so tell us about funding the commons love to uh funding the commons is a conference that we've been putting on with protocol labs and been putting on to bring together people with resources who want to have more nice things generally um in the not in the like fancy things but in the like this is why we can't have nice things maybe the reason we can't have nice things is actually just uh we lack the tools for coordination and the mechanisms to express or measure progress in the ways that we actually want and so the thought is can we bring together people with resources who want to fund those uh those types of things can we bring together mechanism designers economists uh sociologists or anthropologists who understand the network uh complexity of human interactions and then some number of doers ranging from like designers and engineers to uh operations people uh to communicators generally to try and take those three groups focus them on scoped problems and directions concrete paths that you could take starting from ideas and ending with deliverable products that can help humanity coordinate better uh to create more public goods and commons what i think is so fun about this at least from my perspective is that git coin's been running an event about funding the commons called shelling point and y'all are running this event called funding the commons which is a shelling point for funding the commons so we both kind of independently arrived at convening the people and talking about regen coordination in order to make sure the commons are well supported so it's just it's just fun to me that we arrived at that at that same place together yeah i like i feel like shelling point is very complimentary where it does a lot of the memetic engineering and propagation uh the like forming storming and norming within the greenfield community if you will and then uh funding the commons is trying to take a small group that already have a fair amount of context and get them to start performing on that fourth step nice so we're kind of building a funnel together and optimizing for different parts of the funnel it seems like um what would you say the world is that y'all are trying to create or trying to create a selling point towards an attractor towards yeah i think it's very much the uh very strong overlap with the green-pilled ideology uh the idea that a lot of the positive externalities in the world these days uh could become incentivized or promoted in some way through new mechanisms or better tooling that there's some amount of philosophy around decentralization user empowerment i was drawn to protocol labs because they like the role was roughly pitched as we're going to embed human rights into digital infrastructure and save the internet and something about that strongly resonated when i joined protocol labs in 2017 and it's since then turned into can we take the learnings that we have from the crypto community around the value limitations but also powers of things like decentralization and apply those to larger more complex systems outside of simply cyberspace and use those things like the the recently discovered power of memes to control to influence everything from uh culture to the stock market and see if we can engineer those interactions to drive outcomes that are more positive more representative um and come with hopefully less existential risk right okay so reducing existential risk supporting public goods helping humanity coordinate um i guess i'm i'm sort of curious about this experiment at funding the commons that y'all have done with impact certificates so you're going to be presenting impact certificates to every speaker at funding the commons on friday can you tell me why you're doing that and what the potential is for impact certificates in your minds absolutely uh i become very enthusiastic about this idea because i think that while there's a lot of incentive mechanisms you can build that are like do this thing and you'll get money for it uh kind of care like financial care type incentive mechanisms that social incentives tend to be some of the more interesting ones and for those of you who don't know what an impact certificate is i would give you the example of uh like rookie baseball cards people who collect baseball cards will love having the earliest card for their favorite player from well before they are famous i guess i imagine you probably have similar things with uh like tour shirts from bands or like early albums yeah yeah like something that proves that you were a fan of this thing before everyone knew it was big before uh it became a real thing and the thought with impact certificate is why don't we have something like this for unprofitable impact for like uh i guess there are there's some of this for funding science but you could imagine that uh like whoever created some non-profit to go on and capture some number of uh of some number of tons of co2 or provide uh accommodations to some number of the unhoused uh becomes the kind of thing where like these are things that these are efforts that are hugely impactful but no one can really talk about or show or demonstrate support in a like reasonable way uh culturally and also kind of technologically and so the impact certificates project is trying to address this nice so i kind of think of most of our listeners are probably familiar with carbon credits which is basically uh a a proof that you've taken x number of tons out of carbon out of the atmosphere impact certificates are just kind of like carbon credits but but but generalized towards any sort of impact uh like and that can be impact that's like spiritual capital social capital intellectual capital many different sort of vectors of impact so a generalized carbon credit or like a baseball card for impact is kind of how i think about them yeah absolutely and like so part of the um part of the work that has to be done is to find a thing to do with these there's general there's definitely a a concern that as soon as you have something that people might be trying to buy and sell then you might be instantly financializing these things and over financialization has led to many problems with society generally and so we're not leaning too far like dangerously far into that we're wary of that potential risk but the thing that we want to have is a real use case like if you if someone you know collects a thing and you show an interest in that thing they will love the opportunity to share that with you and so the hope that we through the hope of this experiment is that we can turn conferences especially conferences like funding the commons or shelling point into places where you can talk about and present the impact that you have supported in the form of presenting these impact certificates and uh so the experiment itself is that we told all the speakers if you describe an impact certificate to us that we can mint for you or you bring one to us we will talk about it when we introduce you or you can talk about it for the first minute or two of your talk and so the idea is to give people uh a nice spotlight for something that may be unrelated to their talk but that they want more attention to be brought to because all of these projects are things that they care about because they spent time or money to support them and the idea is it's very aligned with the conference generally to support more of these um unprofitable but impactful things got it so it sounds like there's this big idea of what if we could prove impact using cryptography and blockchains impact certificates that show like as an nft and the impact that you've had and they could be used for bragging rights or maybe have other utility in a decentralized society type of world we just had glenn and pujo on the podcast to talk about decentralized society check out that episode if if if you want to know what that means but basically the the tangible small experiment is that at funding the commons you're presenting impact certificates to every speaker and sort of creating social norms in that space around impact certificates and so you know what kind of outcomes are you looking for for from that experiment yeah i would say that uh there's kind of two halves one part is the the tooling side where we want to make it very easy to have create generate um these impact certificates impact certificates have certificates of impact the like general idea has been around for a few decades but there's been a renewed interest because of all of the potential that crypto brings around uh security uh the idea is that you could make these with non-fungible tokens becomes pretty intuitive and the idea that you would also potentially link some of these to your identity in a sold-out token d-soc kind of way makes a ton of sense and so trying to seed in a small user community so that we can support people building the tooling for this and then the other side is trying to build the culture and the like memetic value and i think that there's definitely a good chance that because the uh the green pill uh movement and the general uh the general alignment within the community of trying to create more public goods and commons is uh really valuable strongly aligns with the idea that we could create a culture where this is just the norm um and once once we've created a cultural norm then to be a part of these cultural to be a part of this culture then suddenly you have all of these new affordances to support public goods or comments got it so it seems like you know impact certificates are possibly really powerful for for social reasons and from a reputation reason uh can you say more about other ways in which you think impact impact certificates could really be a powerful primitive yeah absolutely so uh there is definitely a cultural and memetic value of can we create a can we create a tone can we create norms around the fact that when you're participating in regenerative cryptoeconomics you're going to be supporting all sorts of the infrastructure you rely on um doing lots of general uh like econ like financial but also like labor paying it forward uh either to smaller teams that are younger that are doing things that you have done or teams that you rely on that build infrastructure to the extent that we in crypto don't have the equivalent of taxes to pay for infrastructure we kind of have to all come together and support ourselves the idea would be that we could we could build something culturally that's much closer to uh my mind jumps to the example of emma i'm pretty sure this is the case but i'll caveat that uh it'll be worth checking fact checking this before this this goes out possibly um my understanding is that in ancient athens uh paying taxes was something that people were very proud to do it was considered a privilege very few people would actually like only the richest members of society would pay taxes to support the government and the the city-state and doing so became a like mark of prestige that people would make sure they did and the idea that you could jump from that to where we are now seems absurd um yeah so different culturally so so maybe we kind of have a world in which you create positive impact for the world either by building or by funding and you've got an impact certificate that you can kind of display as a trophy case and you know it just it just seems to me like we just got through this bull market where nfts were all the rage and you know the whole meme is overpriced jpegs and what if they what if these overpriced jpegs had cool art but also a meaningful impact on the world what would the market slash memetic shelling points around those nfts nfts look like and that ancient athens example is is one example of the prestige that that maybe they could create yeah and i i think that usually when people look out at the world the scope of change that is imaginable seems too narrow and if you imagine that we could convert ourselves we could this is the wild west we're building our way into a new form of society if not civilization and we can there's very much a sense in which the sky's the sky isn't even the limit about the kinds of shifts that we can engineer around what's valued what's not i like to think of the weird example of like if you imagine someone trying to explain a supermarket or a department store to someone who exists in a partner economy i think the the leap in the amount of organization coordination information flow that would be needed right to explain what it means to have like put a price on everything just starts becoming absurd but i think that we can make that kind of a jump from here where we talk about having signaling and communication and information flows and to some extent also like valuation and value flows toward things that are impactful but not currently priced one of the things i love about what you just said about you know trying to describe a supermarket to someone who lives in a barter economy is that it's kind of like a hindsight 2020 thing where like we live in the world with the supermarket with the more complexity and so therefore we can kind of think about that mental gap that you need between a supermarket and a barter economy but you know but then when you take that and you flip it and you look forward and you say hey imagine there's a world in which every positive impact in the world that you had was issued as an impact nft and these impact nfts were really valued either by investors or by people memetically like on your tinder profile you show your impact nfts or something like that um and what that does is it creates us a shelling point for funding the commons for supporting coordination for supporting public goods like to me that feels so far-fetched that it would systemically change the behavior of many agents people in the system that it feels as far for me as a barter economy to supermarket um but it definitely feels plausible when you think about the primitives that are available in crypto so what do you have is there anything to add there about sort of the difference between looking backwards and looking forward as as as we try to engineer this new world i totally agree uh there's like definitely a huge amount of fog looking forward and i think that there is like this is part of why i think uh pulling in experts from like into funding comments is really valuable we have uh i'm really excited to have uh a someone with a background in labor organization because like this if you think about what dows do a lot of it could be viewed as exactly the same problem as like forming unions um and the question becomes what lessons can be learned carried brought over from topics like that and as we bring in all of these different fields together i think we're building a more complete picture about what daos could or should do um in terms of scoping the problem space and by bringing together enough experts you can kind of see a little bit farther into the future i think um by claim and then other than that it's just lots of prototyping experiments and trying to see right pull things at the wall see what sticks nice i like that um yeah y'all bring in the experts and the people who are academically credentialed and i think that i'll be the guy who takes it from that makes it into a meme that fits in 280 characters so it's been a nice combination of things but i also think that one of the things that's really exciting to me about impact certificates is that any of us could build them into their platform so as a modular money lego you could put an impact certificates in your open c and show them off you could put them into your uh nft thing that you have on your wall and show them off to visitors to your house but with git coin grants 2.0 being a modular open source protocol we're really excited to connect impact certificates to get coin grants and you could maybe even sort by which grants have had the most impact in the world so yeah modularity i think is like a key feature um for these impact certificates especially in a dial-based world as you said um what do you think about financializing impact certificates so say uh someone who has a lot of social clout in the web3 space tweeted that they bought an impact certificate that was let's say it was an impact certificate for removing 10 tons of carbon out of the atmosphere um or that they brought 10 people out of poverty or they funded let's say prismatic labs which is an eth2 client for a year and they have an impact certificate for that like what do you think about a world in which we've engineered enough demand for impact certificates that anyone who's creating impact now has a business model because they're creating impact um what do you think there are dangers in financializing impact certificates or do you think that that's a feature and that you know it's just like a moral right for people who are creating impact to get paid and therefore we should financialize them i think that over financializing things is definitely a danger i really enjoyed the book um what money can't buy the moral limits of markets which highlights a few instances in which uh financializing a good led to a perversion of that good or like non-rational behavior uh in like a homo economical sense like not not purely rational because behavioral economic like behavioral economics is needed to explain or understand why people behave in this seemingly unrational way because the economics of like making or i guess economics is largely about how humans make decisions and sometimes people make decisions based on things like morals um instead of pure rationality and when that happens you can sometimes have weird uh emergent effects from financializing the things i do think that there's something very valuable about having uh signaling around things like this one thing that i particularly like about impact certificates is that if you uh if you look at philanthropy now there's some significant incentive to be to have the amount you donated be the thing that measures how much impact you've had and i think it's separating the cost from the impact itself and trying to have some mechanisms to value the impact or at least make impact more comparable becomes really interesting because suddenly the influencer who's tweeting about buying an impact certificate for 10 tons of carbon uh the first question that i think people might start asking is how much did that impact certificate cost because you can offset 10 tons probably surprisingly cheaply with current uh current carbon credits and so uh like i think some of the things that people will be presenting most most excitedly are look i managed to have all of this impact for this small amount of money because it unblocked this person who was able to do this who like worked with this pool to unlock these resources to make this whole thing happen and i just like managed to tap the domino and i could be tapping dominoes all day amazing yeah i mean i i think for me this kind of gets into effective altruism territory and for the listeners who aren't aware of that it's basically a movement that says that hey most actually charitable giving is about making the giver feel good about themself not actually about creating impact in the world what if we deeply audited different organizations in the world to figure out which ones are having the most impact and channel the most dollars to the places where they're the most effective effective altruism and so impact certificates kind of bring cryptographic verifiability and decentralize uh governance in order to figure out what's effective and what's not and so as long as you have a legitimate piece of governance that's saying yes this impact certificate actually did have this amount of impact then you can kind of we can kind of create verifiable uh effective altruism and and i think that we can optimize for efficacy instead of just cost uh and is any push back on that is it did i get that mostly right i think that sounds right there's actually a lot of documentation about impact certificates or certificates of impact on the ea forums etc and so many of the resources i draw from or point people to are there i think the thinking is definitely strongly aligned um one thing that i [Music] emphasize to distinguish funding the commons generally and some of my personal philosophy from a lot of the effective altruism perspective is that i think that there are various metrics that you might want to use to to evaluate different paths um and we try to be more agnostic about what those value mechanisms mechanisms might be with the idea being that people are going to bring their own time their own money to these mechanisms and if they're going to be contributing those things then they should be the ones to to be able to apply their own value judgment metrics etc to those we can make it easier and better to measure but uh we try to be less opinionated generally um than i think effective altruism as a movement should be and is yeah got it okay so there's sort of like a decentralization of value systems that is enabled by the decentralization tech but we should still learn from what the effective altruism community has pioneered with impact certificates we shouldn't reinvent the wheel here yeah and huge synergy we've made grants to people in the ea community to pursue some of these ideas i see us as collaborators and i see them as potential as collaborators and potential users for a lot of things we're making yeah um one thing i just want to address real quick uh is so this idea of nfts is impact certificates it kind of demands a question about about gas fees on blockchains and i just want to say that i think that this model is maybe not viable in a world in which you take 10 tons of carbon out of the atmosphere and that's worth like let's call it five dollars um on an l1 but since ethereum's got a roll-up centric scaling strategy it'd be pretty plausible to mince that on optimism or arbitrary or polygon and have impact certificates cluster on these roll-up chains and therefore the economics kind of change on there so this is a criticism i've heard of verifiable effective altruism and impact certificates before and i just want to say on l2's i think the economics totally work and um verifiable things you can always stick it on file coin yeah that's that's true we do have a lot of a lot of storage space that's yeah beautiful and you probably would do the data on ipfs anyway so yeah yeah you probably are um oh sorry go ahead i was gonna just add some listeners might not actually be aware that filecoin and ipfs are uh products of protocol labs so i've collaborated on some things i i made all of the figures for the initial file going white paper in fact um beautiful yeah i actually made the mistake of when i first wrote the git coin protocol in 2017 storing json directly on the blockchain and quickly learned the primitive of storing an ipfs afterwards uh so lots of technological innovation at protocol labs that we haven't gotten into because i think we're focused on funding the commons and impact certificates but yes check out ipfs and filecoin for storing these things do you think that nfts are the right primitive for impact certificates or should we be looking more at like verifiable credentials or like the ids for for this technology i think that those two dids and verifiable credentials solve a problem that is necessary not sufficient and complementary to impact certificates and and the nfts like the potential for nfts to address those there's some interesting pieces around how like when you do a thing you receive some value from doing it potentially and you also receive some like social credibility and i actually um really enjoyed the time i spent helping out with source cred stuff um because they had this distinction between your cred which was your reputation score and your grain which was roughly uh your proof of contribution wasn't like the way i liked to think about it where you're uh like that is fungible you either contributed time or you contributed money by buying the grain from someone right contributed time and i think there's something really valuable to having the fact that reputation is really unsellable like if you have worked as the maintainer for a project for ages then like that reputation will stay with you forever and that matches really well onto the infrastructure of dids or svts or things like that but it makes sense for some of these impact things to uh be transferable i also like the idea that maybe this is like this particular thing is this nft impact certificate is cryptographically unprovably yours until you burn it at which point you make it no longer transferable there are interesting ideas like that that could be strongly motivated by like regulatory reasons or user reasons i don't think that we have enough progress with experiments to say exactly how we want it to work but we're working on some like theoretical groundwork uh there's a talk on hyper certificates from the from david at the march funding the commons that kind of break starts into some of the theoretical framing of how we're thinking about this and uh i think that there are nft primitives that could be sufficient got it so um sounds like you really enjoyed your work on the source cred project which basically is a plug-in for github discord uh several other places that allows you to see who's got the social capital and has created impact within a community and they what they did that was innovative was they decoupled the financialized resources which is things that you can sell to pay your mortgage from the reputational resources which are soulbound to you in vitalik's parlance and so decoupling those things is maybe one way to sort of think about when verifiable credentials are worth file versus nfts um and so that's that's did i sort of capture that yeah that's a really good summary and i'll say that source code did a lot of interesting things um i really like the fact that they managed to generate those those reputation and proof of support amounts highly algorithmically but with community input when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your default trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits [Music] set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] so i i guess i'm asked i'm wondering next if you could tell me about this idea of hyper certificates it sounds like it's like supercharging impact certificates in some meaningful way can you tell me what that is uh the overarching idea and i'll we'll also uh link the talk from in the comments about this um but the general idea is to provide the right layer of abstraction so that you can talk about uh impact in a very rigorous but still most like fairly user-friendly way if you imagine how one might trade or like represent their contributions to an effort previously then uh you probably want to be able to specify what the name of the project was or what the outputs were who was working on it what time period they're working on it and additional formalities so that you could then take that and either lump it with other efforts or proceed to split it into smaller efforts and so you should kind of expect some amount of high dimensional fractal detail on uh people's time and how they spend it and you're really just representing some sub-block of all of human activity it's a very small sub-block um but the idea is that with impact certificates you probably want these to be able to merge scalably so you can describe uh whatever level you can succinctly describe whatever level of impact you're thinking of right okay so it seems like kind of hyper certificates as a as a data layer for collective decision mechanisms is maybe one thing that i heard there but uh yeah they seem like they could be really powerful um what is it like this is kind of like what is the what does the world look like in which your maximally successful or like impact certificates are maximally successful look like you know take us take us from barter to supermarket on this one like what is what it take us into the future of if it's maximally successful what it looks like i wish i could the best i can do is like point in the general direction and say i think it's going to be like this um that's good enough it's going to be it's going to be a lot of experiments that will get us there but i think i hope that we have uh enough progress in adoption and like the short term maximally successful is a lot right has a lot of people at the beginning of conferences having this be a standard thing that people do and there's a lot more impact certificates out there being um being supported being created being purchased uh every impact to get purchased is some number of dollars going towards something impactful um right i think it would be worth definitely when uh the technological backend is developed have some amount of money with every subsequent trade of an impact certificate go to the original person who minted it um right and i think that the like if you if you just think about the number of uh like the amount of value that went to artists with uh the digital art nft movement imagining that we could do that in an analogous way do something analogous to what nfts did for art for the general category of philanthropic or non-profit ventures um just imagining the amount of scale that we could have there seems incredible well you know i always think of like the internet of money has the ability to change everything in society that relies on money because uh now we can send value across a computer network um and the analogy for me is that the internet of information changed everything in society that relied on information because we could uh we we could um now send information across the commuter network and that changed entertainment media politics we didn't even have social media god bless you for the people who are watching the video i haven't just sneezed so that's why i had to say god bless you um but but you know the analogy for me here is that is that okay so the internet of money you know looking at this this the way the internet changed everything in society that relies on information the internet of money could change everything in society that relies on value transfer and right now the hot categories are like capital formation which is icos decentralized finance which is d5 and then like nfts which is changing how art is funded and there's this whole like 10 trillion dollar category around like how governments spend money in ngos that no one is really talking about right now and just the scale of the impact where uh impact certificates and impact dows could disrupt ngos and how impact is created i think that is not really an explored category of this technology yet so it's it seems like you think that there's a lot of scale there like as much scale as how nfts change to art can be funded can happen for ngos and how impact happens with with this technology is that right yeah absolutely and i think that there's something really interesting and fundamental about how uh like the dow is like dows are roughly the like minimum abstraction of both corporate governance and like nation-state governance in such an interesting way because you can kind of fill in that spectrum however you want and like it there they addressed the fundamental problem of there is there's a group of people who want to do a thing and they want to do a thing together how do you figure out what everyone wants and turn those into a set of priorities and share resources and allocate them against that thing corporations do this uh governments do this dows do this but i think dows do it in an interesting in an interestingly general kind of way yeah so how we coordinate is the meme that i land on um at the end of the day there is the question of like what do like how easy is it for people to make a society that looks like what they want there's also the like the slightly tangible question of the society that they think they want which may or may not like the changes they think they want may or may not lead to the society they actually want trying to close that gap is very interesting and valuable but there's also something really compelling around just making it easier for people to understand uh how to make informed decisions about how to illicit provide and aggregate preferences i think that a lot of the i wouldn't be surprised if things from funding the commons or impact certificates generally and pricing thereof were used for uh like a more like decentralized city type governance uh corporate governance things like that right yeah so i mean i think there's like an expression of preferences for what the world wants and that's like the demand side and then the more supply side of those impact certificates could actually be the fulfillment of that expression um and you're putting it in a market-based term yeah um i actually have something in my notes from our one of our previous conversations about the main challenges for impact certificates and i was just going gonna rattle through them real quick so we think that value in secondary markets enabling a creation of liquid market with by pressure for impact certificates is like a challenge to overcome uh assessing impact so using governance to create credible neutrality of impact certificates which ones are actually legit and which ones aren't is the second category and then assigning credit shares to contributors for people who created the the impact um so in a world in which those challenges are solved it seems like we can realize the potential of what impact certificates could do for the world is my interpretation of that any push back there or anything to say about that i think that that sounds roughly right i i think that having sufficient uh like locked demand like is is something that we need to uh generate and i think that presenting impact certificates at conference kind of kind of addresses that or may address that and so the hope is to find out the idea being that like most baseball cards aren't being held by people currently trying to auction them there are people who want to buy them for reasons other than just reselling them and that creates a like that's that ends up driving a lot of the value that exists in them and so i think we need to see that in impact certificate that'll be very valuable we also do need enough demand that there is the uh value in secondary markets and liquidity that you mentioned and then um i think that there are interesting potential hacks for credible credible neutrality of impact certificates where like maybe you could have it come with a like have an impact certificate come with a formal legal agreement that says i transfer none of my like naming rights intellectual property rights etc only bragging rights this is what bragging rights means i haven't looked into this legally yet um but i think that it seems like the kind of thing it would be very reasonable to say like an impact certificate is this and i promise to uh like the i promise to consult the current holder of this before minting another impact certificate and if it comes with that then you at least have the legal enforceability of the like the nation state government government to governance to enforce the neutrality slash like uniqueness of that impact so maybe we'll have weird hacky solutions like that right so sort of decoupling the reputational and like ownership of an impact certificate from the bragging rights allows us to create a liquid market without getting too much into hyper financialization and the the downfalls of that is is sort of how i interpret that yeah like there's less need for uh like a a single trusted mentor of impact certificates if some of them come with legal agreements um right so in a world in which we solve for these challenges of impact certificates there's value in secondary markets we've assessed it assessed impact there's credit shares assigned to contributors um and you know like do we get to a place in which we've kind of aligned value captured which is what business models are based off of how much money can i can i get into my bank account do we align value capture with value created for the world so basically anyone who's creating impact and creating value for the world now has a business model do those two things kind of collapse if in a world in which we're maximally successful with impact certificates i think they that is absolutely the hope uh the question of whether or not they do is i think still open but i think that there's uh i have been swayed by some of the modern the arguments of modern monetary theory which claimed that the purpose of minting currency as a sovereign as a sovereign currency issuer as a sovereign currency issuer which in classical mmt is like the us government and in like crypto player mmt is like the ethereum community um i think that when you when you're issuing a token you are trying to direct attention toward things that you as the community of currency issuers care about and how we get to a point where you can effectively elicit and aggregate the preferences of what those people care about and allocate new research resources towards that feels like the best possible outcome for creators of a currency or for members of like citizens of a society be it a decentralized society or a centralized one or hopefully yeah it seems like a beautiful outcome for me to think that i could pay my mortgage put food on the table for my kids by just focusing on creating a positive impact whether that's in my local community picking up trash volunteering uh or at a systemic level taking carbon out of the atmosphere or supporting our digital open source software there's just so many systemic network goods public goods regen causes that people could work on and the fact that they could earn a living doing it i think to me seems like that just seems like the chef's kiss to me that seems like such a thing to shoot for absolutely it reminds me of the uh the story where i think toyota donated time to a food bank or a soup kitchen type thing um yeah and managed to more than double i think the outcome with the output like number of people fed from that soup kitchen and like there's definitely it feels like there's definitely impact like that that could be made and simply building mechanisms to direct attention toward those opportunities and then celebrate and reward those opportunities for having been uh pursued and uh captured right accessibility yeah impactful yeah beautiful in an attention economy i think the direction of attention via financial primitives or maybe social primitives is is kind of like the biggest lift that we have because we all only have 24 hours of attention or i guess depending on how much you sleep less than that so in an attention economy i think that that's that's kind of the resource that we're directing towards the these impact causes um and and that could be really systemically valuable creating a world in which everyone's creating impact and getting paid getting coins for doing it absolutely um well i know that we're five minutes over on recording already uh so i suppose we should rap what is there anything i didn't ask you that you want to say evan um i think i wanted to try and plug the term network goods if you'll let me the idea is that in economics you'll typically have the distinction between things that are either rivalrous or non-rivalrous and excludable or non-excludable uh you'll typically hear things like the tragedy of the commons where uh right past grazing pastureland as a commons and people come graze on it and yeah like everyone wants to take it from everyone else uh eleanor ostrom noaa prize and economics for showing that like there are some conditions in which this does not actually become a failure mode like there is such a thing as shared pastoral and ostrom's law states that anything that works in practice can work in theory and um with a lot of these digital goods the gap between something that is excludable or non-excludable or uh rivals or non-rivalrous tends to be a little more a little blurry um right there's also an interesting category of things that are anti-rivalrous where uh working a project can bring a net value back to it yeah yeah yeah i mean like bitcoin bitcoin cash version is like a perfect example of anti-rivalries you can just like see the number go up after yeah um anyway so uh we've been using the term network goods to plug this and my team is the network goods team at protocol labs now formerly pl research and we're the ones putting on the funding the commons conference so if you if you stop by and you get a fun shirt with a pipi slogan on it it will also include the network goods logo nice well that seems like a good place to get into call to action so if you're in new york stop by the funding the commons conference on june 24th uh how do people find you online any other sort of call to actions for people evan uh emiazona on twitter and if you have an interesting idea from this definitely send an email to commons protocol.ai and if you missed this funding the commons we are doing them roughly quarterly i think we're doing the next one end of september and you'll be able to check fundingthecommons.io to find to get updates beautiful and i should also say that you and i are in the middle of an rfp process in which we are talking to several people in the git coin and protocol labs community the wider web 3 community in order to build impact certificates so trying to figure out what the architecture of this stuff is make it easy to mince them make them credible and actually put this into practice so we'll have a link in the show notes to the rfp for that as well that people can check out if they're serious about building this infrastructure um evan thanks so much for being on the green pill podcast appreciate it and so happy to be working with you and the protocol labs team on this stuff thanks for having me kevin i'm super enthusiastic about it too [Music] you
