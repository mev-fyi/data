it is very important to me to be flexible because of this space and how new it is and you you just never know what's around the corner in this nft world because of how the technology is growing and changing [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today on the show i have carlini better known as carlini8 online carlini is the founder of penelope's country club the nft project brand which of course is a big part of what we talk about today on this episode but i'll just say this carlini has been in this space since very early days he was very involved during cryptokitty era he co-founded nft boxes with pranksy like he's in and we talked for two hours so to try and even summarize or tease what we get into in here i would just do it inadequately what i'll say is carlini is a fountain of information he's funny he has strong feelings and opinions on things for example he thinks board api club messed up the launch of ape token and you can hear all about that along with tons of other nuggets just about how the nft space runs should run isn't running he's uh he's a joy to talk to a joy to listen to and i think y'all are going to enjoy this conversation so i'm going to hand it over to our sponsors to hear a word from them without them this show of course would not be possible and then you're going to get into my conversation

i'm carly riley and today on the show i have carlini carlini8 as he's better known online but carly carlini we're gonna have fun with that in some way here carlini i'm sure of it um carlini is a super nft og we will talk about his background here in a bit and he is the co-founder of penelope's country club which we will also be talking quite a bit about i'm really excited to dive into what you've done with with penelope's i think you've done a lot that's innovative you've really been a model of you know bringing a project like like slow growth and also kind of bringing up a project back after some i think some price drops and all the rest of it so uh really excited to dig into your story and how you do what you do thanks for having me on yeah it's gonna be gonna be great hi everyone uh happy to be here uh excited to see where this goes because you know we had a chat earlier just see what's what and just loads of things to talk about really isn't there we you got lots of feelings and opinions so i feel like this could go a lot of different directions we get you on the right kind of a rant and we're we're off in in a totally new direction that's the goal here by the way we're just going to try and set off carlini um okay i want to actually start with nft boxes i don't folks may or may not know you uh were partnered with pranksy you and pranksy go back way back uh i think you were the one who actually initially got prankexy into nfts is that true uh yeah back in december 2017 with cryptokitties so i knew him pre-nfts wow okay and so you two sort of entered the nft space in some ways together and launched nft boxes which is a really cool program my conception of it is it's essentially birchbox or barkbox or like one of those uh sorts of services but digitally and for nfts is that a fair description of nft boxes yeah so it was a curated art box of nfts curated by pranksy that would be sent out monthly we wanted it to be subscription based uh so it would just be like those products but it was a bit bit trickier uh with nfts at the time i think uh it was actually it's been done since um and i think nft boxes this year is going to be a subscription uh service but yeah it was it ended up being buy a box and get the 10 curated pieces about roughly 10 each month inside it so you had to actually manually up to this point you've had to essentially manually buy the box each month and then you could get the nfts as opposed to being essentially auto-subscribed is that what you're describing yeah so the there'd be a monthly sale uh except december which was if you had collected all of the others up to that point december was a free airdrop to everyone so kind of you could say a subscription but not really at that point but will be this year was the hold up to being able to make it a subscription or to making it a subscription out the gate connected to like technical capabilities and smart contracts or it was something else it was tech plus meta like just at the time it was harder to get people to commit when i was when i was talking to people and doing some sort of investigation into what would be likely to sell and and all of that it was tricky to fit into the model as well because each month would the the sale would happen and the funds would be automatically split between uh the company for to then pay taxes and salary and things like that and then between the artists as well there'd be a pre-arranged percentage that they would get because obviously we couldn't be sure we would sell out so it would say this is the most amount uh this is completely maxed mint this is the price and you'd get this percent and they'll either agree to it or not um [Music] and obviously if they did they're in the box and we click the button and the if would automatically go to them so that bit did work and a subscription service could kind of be based around that but it was just tricky from a from a more prolonged approach how does that if then get split to the next artist and the next artist so the the sales were just easier at the time so the the sale prices for these boxes it sounds like fluctuated a little bit or you're saying it wasn't even that it was just like what percentage they would get uh they had to yeah it was sort of hardcoded each time and so that was so they had to fluctuate based on the artists uh the arts the artists were fixed the issue was gas so we started kind of at the at the beginning of the nft bull run i guess uh i'd i'd say it really started the end of 2020 but at the start of 2021 january that was our first sale you know we'd we'd planned i think for fifth we would we'd be sending out a 50 guy um and then it shot it just sat over 100 for so long in february i think it was and we just had to adapt our prices because otherwise we were sending out i think at one point there was 700 boxes so and it might have been 11 items in that box who are sending out 7 700 nfts and minting them which is pretty much the whole gas cost of a profile picture project now which we had to send out and that had that had to be baked into the price that we uh put the boxes at so as that went up we had to adjust and it was pretty stressful to be honest because you can never really plan eve's gas at all um and we were trying to have this period where there would be like a fun sort of reveal and we we hadn't fully because the the project was was quick to get going it was only december when we really were like right this is happening and the end of january was the first sale and in my head lots of things were happening that we just didn't have time to plan so there were going to be like artist spotlights you know articles or maybe a spaces spaces wasn't a thing at the time i think it was going to be a discord uh chat in the nf2 boxes chat about the artist that was coming in and they'd give you info and then maybe at that point they'd reveal their piece so there'd be like this fun week or two where all this information would be coming in and that gave the possibility of gas to fly and around the time it did uh of obviously because all of those high gas times that we saw last year if it was towards the end of the month pranks he was trying to send a box out of one of those months and it just got just got tricky so it's worth noting that that you're not formally working with uh nft boxes anymore you're really focusing on penelope's country club which of course we're going to talk all about so i say that to say i don't know if you can answer this question but what has shifted i mean gas has been lower and been a little bit stabler but i don't know that anybody feels like they want to count on that in a business decision what what changes have been made that uh will allow the subscription model to potentially work today uh well i think just from a from the space perspective people do think about it a little differently now um we're not in a i guess a time period that i call max mint like if if you there were no white lists sort of in this period of time where i was working at nft boxes and if you just minted anything you profited basically so people were just minting the max that they could and they were trying to send in multiple transactions that's what was sending the gas sky high for short periods of time but the culture just wasn't around again there were people that appreciated the art there were a lot of people but that percentage of people within the community back then was quite low so people expected gamification from nft boxes and uh and sort of incentives to hold the art and that that's the part where myself and pranks he kind of had a bit of a disagreement because i wanted to my role in in the company was the community and kind of getting the business to work so it's like getting the website getting the devs and and organizing that and pranksy's side was the artists um organizing them and promotion so when i'm you know talking to the community every day and pranks he's talking to the artists every day i'm coming from right so the community want this and pranks is saying but it's the art that matters you know we're not appreciating it as art and we just had a bit of a disagreement we both saw each other's side but you know i wanted to deliver for the community he wanted to deliver for the artist he didn't want the artist to see their work gamified after the point which you know i completely understand um um that just sort of led to us be like look we've we have different views on how this uh works we're we're 50 50 and i just said look do you want to buy my shares uh so i i do no longer work there uh i moved on to penelope's but i feel the the views of the people have changed sort of heard views like more more people do appreciate the art as art and a higher percentage because obviously the space is much bigger than uh when i was working there but it is a higher percentage that really do truly appreciate art for art in the nft space i'm not saying it's a huge amount so you know people are gonna scoff at me and be like nah everyone's here for profit most up i i agree most people are here for profit but the people who truly are here for the art has grown and it is growing and this is their segment and that is what nft boxes is for and because there's more of these people it makes a subscription service more viable so during um sort of the time of nft boxes the red lion eye gazette has a subscription service and it's worked it's worked for quite a long time at this point so i i don't fully know i am on good terms with pranksy i'm not you know it's not like oh we you know we broke up and then we never spoke again we still speak you know pretty much every day so but i just don't know i'm not like hey tell me the intricate details of the contract so i don't know if it's based on the gazette or not but i do know it's it's now possible and i have been told it's going to be done this year part of my fascination with it and the reason i'm pushing on it is because i i really am curious in the the ways that the crypto world can start to more closely mirror what we do in our everyday lives right and the escrow payments or you know things like this like uh like um subscription models because i think we've had very just primitive forms of payment up to this point you know it's transactions i mean in some ways it's more advanced because you can do micropayments and all these things of course but um but i think that it's going to be fascinating to see how these these models start to evolve and i'm excited by that for escrow we have just seen the uh crypto twitter account kobe uh crypto kobe he just took a 22 million [Music] usdt i think it was maybe usdc bet that he's the escrow of between two different people um i don't know quite how i i don't think that's in any way trustless i think they're basically trusting this this huge this huge account that you know everyone trusts he's not going to ride because because of how rich he is basically yeah yes and and has a high profile so high reputational damage to uh for for little benefit it would seem yeah well and i think about like thinking about the metaverse thinking about being able to rent things out like again mirroring the economic system we have here as fully and even coming up with more advanced things than we can we can do in the irl world call it uh it's just an a really interesting area of expert exploration in my opinion as we continue to see the space evolve uh i want to jump to penelope's of course so this is what you you have been really focused on since leaving nft boxes what was the initial inspiration goal premise let's say for penelope's tell folks a little bit about it uh well it's hard it's hard to say without the corny meme because it was community you know i've just said i was working on nft boxes and my pull was the community and prank sees was the artists and that was our disagreement effectively so when i wanted to do more for the community when i then started something new i then was able to focus on the community and you know i'm not just talking the talk because we have at this point walked the walk with we had an original sale of 800 ethereum 200 of that was sent into a community wallet for the community to decide how to spend at the time the the most anyone had done that was 20 ethereum and when we'd planned it no one had done it to my knowledge so that was a bit annoying because i thought we were going to be the first and it was luckily there was it was like 5 8 10 8 and 20 for the free at the time so we really blew that out the water and then we had the creation of the kitty vault which is a community-owned wallet which a huge amount of our sale went into that can all be seen on chain as well what what really annoyed me at the time was nft projects were just minting out and then splitting all the effort between the founders that isn't how companies work and nft projects are effectively companies you don't just go oh here's all your money congrats now go build it for the next five years because that's just that doesn't work how are you going to fund anything within the company how do you how do you do anything for the community that isn't just you working on it because you have been paid but now you have to somehow work out putting money back in that it's just a tax nightmare i genuinely just think people had no real world experience of running a company or a business or even little little information on nfts really can you orient us what when did you launch penelope's country club um so we effectively started working on it towards the end of march early april um and at that point we were like right what do we do is that that's 20 21 2021 yes last year so march april of last year that's interesting to me because i one thing i want to ask you about is it it does feel like there there was a lot of inspiration taken from board apes which which came after that so we at that point we were what do we do so i had i had the community manager from nft boxes who i'd hired part-time to uh to basically help me out to do the community role and i wanted he wanted to be full-time uh covid was you know still pretty pretty rampant and the job security aspect was really like sort of playing on his mind it's like right i've got this i've got this job i really enjoy it but it's it's month to month it's it's part-time it's not a proper job i'm not getting a pension i don't have holiday you know all of that sort of stuff um and my goal was to bring in someone else that i'd sourced who had had done that sort of work sorting all that sort of stuff out for nine and a half years at a local college uh so i pulled him out of this job just before he got to the 10-year mark and then i was like oh right guys we can't actually we can't do this at nft boxes don't worry i know i've made you both quit your jobs we're going to do something uh i was you know i was financially fine i was per i was personally set uh to my own level so i've been i've been in the sort of fire space financial independence retire early for maybe five six years it's really interested me from my old jobs and even before that so i always had this number that i was targeting and i'd i'd hit that and i kind of you know like relief had gone over me and i was happy and i was at peace but i still had the building bug from nft boxes i really enjoyed it i didn't like how it had ended and you know i'd sold my share of the business and i still wanted to build and i had these two guys that i'd taken out of their jobs four nft boxes that i felt responsible for so i said look i'll give you a guaranteed year's salary at what we were originally going to do and we'll figure out something so the end of march early april is when we'd started trying to figure out what we were going to do and we were originally going to try integrating nfts with streamers maybe twitch and youtube as a sort of uh so the idea was along the lines of on twitch you get sub badges if you've been there three months six months a year two years three years and somehow make those nfts and reward these people because they're effectively collectibles but no one's getting these collectibles you get uh you get sort of this the status in a in a twitch chat when you've got that two year or three year badge but you can't you don't have it anywhere else so the we were trying to figure this out and then someone asked me how do we make money from this and i said i don't know i just want to do something cool in nfts and he said well i've just quit my job of great stability like i i'm thankful that we've got it for a year but i don't want to i don't have a career that dies in a year and i was like a good point like all right valid valid like yeah i am kind of playing with your life here a bit so we then sat down again and were like right the meta right at this point it was after board apes and you know sort of these these profile picture projects were popping up and we're like right we can do a profile picture project but we can do it right we can bring in those community vibes while showing others how to do it which i i am quite proud of because the the big community wallets did up in other projects after we did ours and kitty volt type project i hadn't seen another kitty vault that wasn't a formal like flamingo dao type of thing and they then just after we minted they came quite uh common and those sort of things as long as they're done properly when you get rugged because you know we all know that so many projects have from last year wrecked i i did a tweet a couple of weeks ago where i literally went back to the day we minted and i looked at one of these lists i think it was metaverse hq's list that was here are all the mints of the day and i went through them they were all dead except there were i think there were two art block mints on that day but i you don't really count them in sort of this because you know that's an artist coming onto a a platform to to mint their work whereas all the other projects were practically dead you know no no tweets this year for the majority of them whereas if you had this kitty vault back in your nft and it was done trustlessly at least you always have that value there so it did help and all of the the rugs with this kitty volt style method have always ended up with a community team taking over because there is something of value to take over uh there is something to command that is worth people's effort i always are you thinking pudgy penguins feels like the the obvious one that comes to mind of the community stepping in i honestly don't know what's happened there i've i've asked like three times if they've been sold i don't know i thought they were going to hand it over to the community but you're right that i actually don't actually know if that that's what they said yeah i remember like the the the big whale who uh 9x9x9x yeah yeah he'd been offered to he was going to take over it and then they said yeah yeah we'll sell it to you for 888 and he was like what on earth are you saying i will save this project why am i going to buy this you're failing but let me be clear you have nothing in the treasury correct and they were like correct [Laughter] what so like i'm doing you a favor let's be let's because they were another one who had just sent that ethereum out to themselves and i called them out on twitter and one of them had replied and said that is what our accountant advised and i said there is absolutely no way that is what your accountant advised never ever will they say that do you think people are getting savvier you're talking about back when you launched it was really unusual for you to put as much money as you did into the community treasury folks could really just get away with project founders could get away with just launching this thing taking the money and and running if they wanted and then it's funny because i hear this other balance of the equation i hear founders talking about the stress they feel like they're under to constantly produce more utility and more goods and nothing's ever enough which almost feels like the counter to that which is people say almost like wanting you to put all of the money into just building the project back up what do you think about that balance and do you think people are getting savvier about not buying into projects that the founders are just gonna run away with it or no kevin like [Laughter] so no we have not gotten stuff here yeah in a way it's funny we are getting savvy people are asking more questions but fomo still exists people people are remembering the good old days of max mint and they still want that so they're hoping you know they're hoping pixelmon leads to that quick flip um people are savvier yes just to just to answer the question but there are more people so more people are chasing what they're hearing happened last year or even january and february and they're just new people are coming in and pushing these projects that should never mental like we had a we had a small period of time a couple of weeks where for some reason everyone felt they could put their mint price over oney for absolutely no reason like they had no it was dutch auctions it was like dutch auctions starting at four like i feel like that dovetailed with each other this is this is gonna set me off on a different rant that we hadn't talked about before i i don't care that was the goal this episode i don't consider it a dutch auction if you are completely rugging your best community members when you launch a dutch auction those that believe in you the most are the ones who meant early they don't want to miss out they believe in you they're your best community members and you're completely rugging them normal dutch auctions when they're done generally in the real world they're used for one item so you know it just goes down and eventually the price is found for this one item in the crypto world when it's used for tokens the sale slowly goes down and you bid at certain prices and then it wherever it ends everyone pays that same price so if you paid one if at the start and it ends at 0.1 you get refunded 0.9 because why should you pay more just because you believed in the project more it's ridiculous and it needs to die and we need to stop allowing that to be a thing because it is so much better to refund everyone to the price point a dutch auction that goes down i do not care if this dutch auction starts a 1000 ethereum in a way that's better because you're truly finding a price point if you have it you're supposed to start them high right they're supposed to start high and come down but the fomo gets people in if you know that you will be refunded then the fomo isn't really there it's there in a different way you're there securely in the fact knowing that if everyone has bought at that price it is truly its its proper value we we saw with the the 888 um bt orbs uh done by i completely forget their name the ones who did who do vox um some people bought that at the ridiculous it wasn't many but there were people who bought that at like naught point uh sorry 8.8 or something like that and it ended it ended up sub one and these people weren't refunded they even paused them in during that mint yet the people who bought really high i think they were like 26 or 27 they were the people who wanted bt's work the most yet they are punished for that and it's it just does not seem in any way community oriented to me and therefore it is in no way web free you're making a very compelling case zenika and i actually spoke about this i guess a couple weeks ago i think now that i'm hearing you say this based off of tweets you made in response to a project that was doing a dutch auction uh it was in response to frenzies i oh yeah did you comment on friends oh i i about five times i was really trying to get through with that because i was i was i've had enough i've i've literally tweeted you've seen your moment i've got tweets from me bits mint i've that far back i've been suggesting it but it was every now and then it was just a tweet and i was like i'm done now let's just this is this is my breaking point i've had enough of these i'm just literally like five tweets uh the the founder put out i was like please change to this i went to the discord i tried to discuss it there and i was just like please change this let's change the meta and this is the way to get it done let me ask you this what you think about this idea because i feel like dutch auctions are in part a price discovery tool or they they could be seen that way what if you took you know i imagine the reason projects don't want to do this is because they don't actually want to sell it for the cheapest price like is there a way to take the average price of the cheapest and the the highest and anybody who paid more than that will go down anybody who paid less than that is given the option to pay at the average price something so that it it functions in that price discovery way i think what would actually happen though is because people feel safer they're more likely to bid higher i don't think what you're going to end up with is your fans bid high up knowing that it's going to go lower and then everyone will wait for it to go lower and then they fomon at the end i don't think that's how it works because it doesn't that's not how it works in the coin world you get a more fair price and who's gonna pay more like when when you offer the option for these lower to go to the average i just i just don't think that's i can't think of a way that actually works i can't think of a way this and on wallet goes oh yes i'd uh i'd love to pay up thank you very much for the opportunity well if they knew in advance that this was a risk they were running by i feel like i feel like you'd have to take the eve uh at mint and then refund them a certain amount i think it's the i think the lowest amount is the only or they could all go into escrow and then but that's kind of what we'll approve the higher that's kind of what does happen with the higher payments right the first people who meant it goes to the team and then or it will go into a contract and at the end of the sale the contract automatically works it out because there has been projects that have done this and you have to go and claim your ethereum and while a small bug bear compared to this you know this whole rant on dutch auctions there is absolutely no reason to make people go and click the gas is minimal you've just raised hundreds of aetherium for god's sake send send it back automatically there's don't make it harder for everyone uh that's that's unnecessary but if if the gas is a large percentage of your sale then i don't think you should be using a dutch auction anyway like there's a there's a time and a place for what i consider a correct dutch auction and it wouldn't be if your mint is 0.02 or anything like that last question on this before i do get us off it what is the time in the place for a dutch auction in your view uh it will be it's kind of arrogance on the team i guess it's when you know that you're going to sell out um and you you know that it is the best way to avoid a gas war and the best way for price discovery the issue with price discovery is if you've actually found true price discovery then the current crop of nft buyers aren't too happy because there isn't some kind of ev plus buy there for them because the value is already there so they're not going to be able to flip in a day unless there's some sort of real mechanic and they're just the gen d gen in that oh as in it wasn't it you're you're kind of guaranteed it wasn't underpriced yeah if you're finding its true value so there's not a flip opportunity yeah yeah yeah that's interesting well i'm glad we had this tangent because i think this gives folks a good sense of your brain and how deeply you think about things and how deeply community oriented you are so this leads me to our mutual friend kai turner i was talking about the fact that you and i would be speaking and i was asking if he had anything he felt like i really needed to talk to you about and he said this which i loved about penelope's your project we need to make the penelope's case study required reading they've done so many amazing community things carlini's applying the best of what he's observed in communities like cryptokitties to bring the absolute best practices also the floor tanked after mint and he brought it back through sheer commitment to the project and he has no plan to stop anytime soon so now the floor is up and it's a great study of how commitment and delivery can bring the floor price back lots in there maybe let's start with is that how you experienced things in terms of floor price kind of crashing and then uh perseverance to bring it back up was that the experience for you living through it and then if yes we'd love to know about how you thought about that i think it's something that's probably relatable to a lot of projects who see their floor prices go down and maybe they start to panic and they would love to know what it takes to to rebuild oh god i okay a lot of eve for that don't know that was very nice uh well i guess i never really felt like the floor tanked in my view because i wasn't i wasn't watching it in the same way i would had i invested i i can't come all high horse and be like oh i'd never flip nft flipping is fun i have done it for a very long time um and while it isn't you know in any way like a a professional job that i was doing it it was just you you pick up these trends and you can see how projects sort of mitigate these things i have to jump in here and ask because this is not what this podcast is about but of course my my brain kind of sparked when you talked about the i think it's like it sounds like an early retirement thing was that made possible through crypto and nft specifically or did you have like a whole plan around how you were going to get to early retirement starting pre-crypto and nfts oh yeah i was i was going to get there so i like my my number was very large for a normal life i guess so the plan was to retire myself and my wife and have our kids all well looked after and a nice house and you know all of that and i had this number and before nfts i was a professional gambler in something called matched betting kind of so i started in match betting where you the casinos like to call it bonus abusing so they would offer sign up bonuses they would effectively the casinos are enticing people in so they get addicted and lose all their money whereas i was only playing the the bit that they try to entice me in which they make sure is profitable for you so that you're more likely to win you're more likely to get hooked in but i then stopped and moved on to a different offer and it was just basically doing these offers on an industrial scale and i was i was doing well you know i was i was well on my way to uh financial independence but it was a couple of years like the the time frame was quick in any sort of normal case study but in jay you know jpeg's very much shorter than that quite quickly come the end of 2020. okay that's a whole other thread that i actually have a lot of questions about but i i interrupted your your frame of thought and i'm sure that's probably annoying to the listener but because you mentioned nft flipping i i i wanted to get that question in there so nothing wrong with nft flipping but what i'm hearing from you which i'm not actually surprised i thought this might be the answer like you weren't tracking the price fluctuations on that day-to-day level you had this long-term orientation so for you it wasn't like oh my god the price is tanked because you were just like we're gonna keep we're doing our thing is it up is it down i don't know like i'm just building is is that what i'm hearing i i didn't care for me i cared for the community and i guess their mental health because i know i know what it's like to buy into something and watch the floor dip and i also have experienced through others what it's like to go all in you know while i didn't expect anyone to have gone all in on penelope's i did have a look at a couple of wallets and you know they'd obviously you know you never really know if that is one individual's worth in crypto or if they've got multiple wallets but quite a lot of people had gone a fairly high percentage in so what was important to me at that time was messaging i wanted to try and keep this community that we had as calm as possible i didn't want them to just dump lose money and move on because i knew i could get us pass back past mint and and over and we did and that was right and i what i wanted to ensure was that people knew that we were building we're not one of the ones where you know if three hours after the mint we're not at one eve there is still a there is still a future here stick around we're going to keep building and that was easy enough that's easy enough to do now you know i can just point to what we've done for uh for penelope so far but i had to point to uh nft boxes i had to point to effectively my nft degeneracy and be like look my wallet is 1300 days old it's got 15 000 transactions i know nfts i'm going to keep building please stay calm and don't lose money here and you know people i'm sure plenty of people did lose money i'm sure they dumped got out and just moved on and probably went on to have the jpeg summer of their lives but to the the others that stuck around you know from that time they're all up because we're we're multiples above mint at this point so it what i try to do is take that negative of people always wanting deliver deliver deliver when this when that what's the floor price and just take the reward that now i can look back and know that those minters were rewarded for trusting me sure they weren't all in and i'm sure they've done plenty of other stuff because we don't demand you know all of your time you can go and do plenty of other stuff in in nfts just trust that we will continue working ourselves and we won't be doing other stuff we i am not building on anything else that's another bug bearer of mine when a founder says they're all into their project and then suddenly they're launching something completely different with someone else a few weeks later like so you're not that dedicated either but i won't go on that run here so are you like i'm in this for life i asked this question a lot are you like i'm doing this for the rest of my life has this like ruined your retirement plans or are you like hey we're in this until it's big enough that we hire a ceo well we we are already nine full-time people um so i would already like to think that penelope's doesn't need me that's not me saying i'm leaving i'm just structuring it in a way let's start that rumor carlini leaves bernalillo bees rug structuring it in a way that if i get hit by a bus or if a plane lands on my house there is still a penelope's there there is still a team that will build there is still a team that will have you know the kitty vault backing to keep going uh they will have the funds to keep building so that is always in the mind it is we are planning for the long term and we're now trying like right now our current plans are how do we get our current salaries for a for a runway in the bank which is not a big salary in this space i'll add we are we are very much working on love of nft first and salary second but how can we get that in a bank squared away just sitting there for a year or two so that's secure so we can say look for the next two years or maybe a year depending on how pricings go and all of that there'll be at least 10 people working on penelope's or we have got the budget for 10 people then you know collabs and progress and website 2.0 and all the things on our rope map we priced that in as well so it's all about we are really planning for the long term and this is why i said earlier it really annoyed me when influencers minted and then split each between them because how do you how do you then plan like this there is you can just leave at any point because there is no company there is no you know pudgy penguins they didn't even have an empty vault there was no vault the vault hadn't been created to put anything in and it was it is just purely about the long game and making sure that you know even if something does happen to me there is a company there and now let's let's not start that room i have no plans to leave i am thinking about this uh project all the time i do not want to go and do anything else um i already you know i work from home i have i i spend every morning with with my kids i look after them you know this is this is all within the plan i'm already living a good life and working on something that i enjoy so i the plan is to build this to be huge to the point where my influence is minimal but i still want to be there obviously you mentioned to me my conversation with zenika i think my very first one in which zenika said he was not a fan of road maps because it didn't allow flexibility for projects or i think it was something along those lines when you had this moment where the floor price was down and you were reassuring your community so you had that messaging that you put out there and then i imagine you got to work building on your roadmap because you do actually actually have a roadmap what is your take on roadmaps you had sort of a distinct one around like well most most things that people call road maps aren't really road maps uh what what is your take on on the road map situation and what was your road map call it part one for penelope's yeah so i i enjoy road maps because it's not it's not the road map that matters what you can do is look at a road map and it will tell you about the team you can pluck information out of what they've provided there you're almost getting an insight into their mind just from their roadmap itself and our roadmap kind of took us a shot at other roadmaps because we had zero percent of mint we will uh boost discord because it was absolutely insane that there were projects at the time that were like a 20 min will boost our discord to be nitro whatever it was like what on earth how is that a thing and the the issue is like i said before you really do have to follow meta if you don't want to do the shady stuff you know if you don't want to buy hundreds of bots for your discord or your twitter or engagement farming or literally pay people to be in your discord to spam when dropped or so excited you know if you want to avoid all of that your best chance of minting out is to follow the matter and the meta right then was zero percent this was 10 there's 20 percent there's 30 percent there's blood of blood what does the meta mean in that context so right now i'd say we're in well i'm hoping we're kind of at the end of the whitelist meta where if you're not like epoch like era yeah yeah so it's just from um of get games basically there would be certain characters that have certain strengths and the matter is to use those strong ones and then the devs change uh how strong they are to to keep the game fresh and then a new meta comes because different heroes are strong or so my my game of choice i guess would be age of empires 2 and certain civilizations that you play as would be strong on certain maps and the devs would change that to try and keep it fresh and change that matter because otherwise everyone's playing as the same civilization so i guess it's just a term there for the most commonly done thing like everyone everyone had the road map saying effectively nothingness and like like you said seneca [Music] main issue with road maps was uh rigidness like you can't you can't deviate from your road map but we did so the best two things we did on roadmap 1.0 were our we did slash are still doing eight airdrops one a month um we took the snapshot for number seven today actually um so we've got one more next month and then we've uh delivered on all of those and that wasn't on the road map but when you're i feel like when you're a full full-time team you do have much more time to work on than the majority of these roadmaps offer and it is very important to me to be flexible because of this space and how new it is and you you just never know what's around the corner in this nft world because of how the technology is growing and changing something absolutely insane could come out tomorrow and we have to pivot or we don't have to but we think it is in the best interest of the business to pivot and we can still do that like i am still constantly thinking about where we can go and and things like that so i do see tokens uh being huge uh a nft yielding token and we we promised token it's it's on roadmap 2.0 but we've been tweeting about it talking about in our spaces it's on our youtube channel for uh for a very long time to the point i've already registered additional businesses about that that was completed about two months ago purely to launch these tokens and i was in talks with lawyers maybe five months ago so it has been in the works for a long time despite not being on our original road map because i feel you do have the flexibility unless you know unless your road map is ridiculously specific or you're going for [Music] you know if you're building an exact game that does an exact thing it might be quite hard to move from a road map but i feel like projects like that really do need a road map for people to know where they're going it's just it's just more information obviously a roadmap doesn't mean the team is going to deliver this it means the team is hopefully going to try and deliver this and it it gives you a little bit of insight into i guess their thinking so i just like to be able to look at a pre-mint road map maybe have a look at a couple of others coming out around the same time right if they just copy pasted because if they've copy pasted that's a negative straight off the bat or if they are they actually thinking about this is is anything on here interesting that's a good tip are you still like an nft flipper like are you still de-genning while you build penelope's not really i generally i just mint into friends stuff or stuff that friends are really really excited by because generally you know my my closest nft friends i guess if i call them call them that they've been through i guess the horrors of the nft market of 2018 and 19 and the beginning of 20 and we've all been through that together and we've all kind of experienced it in the same way such that i know that if they're excited about it it probably isn't just because they're going to make money they it's because there's something there so i minted doodles for example because that was by my friend poopy i meant to chain faces arenax that was my my friend nate alex who actually know uh how do we delete that from the podcast my enemy nate alex yeah i think that was was that your requirement to coming on the show that you could uh mercilessly mock nate i think that was uh yeah do you i can't believe you were you put out like a bit of a teaser content from poopy going we've hired and you blanked out the name and you you just have your face like oh my god face and yeah i i feel like that's unacceptable that's an unacceptable reaction to the announcement being made alex in your view i knew he'd joined already because you know one friend joining another friend and i'd commented something under that post like if this is a hollow cat i'm gonna be fuming okay i want to talk about the kitty vault because i think this is really interesting and you mentioned you have these eight air drops so i'm gonna give a high level here of my understanding of what you're doing with kitty ball and then would like we'll let you really expand on it you have eight airdrops total going to your holders and many of them are tied to physicals like a 3d physical of of your penelope or merchandise and so you have this system in place from my understanding which is that with each of your airdrops you have options you can keep the airdropped nft you can burn the airdrop nft token or the nft for to redeem for the physical associated with it or you're building out this plan it's not i don't think fully operational yet where you'll be able to burn your air dropped nft for tokens that represent a piece a fraction of this kitty vault and the kitty vault has about a thousand eth worth of nfts in it ranging from board apes to kongs doodles it might be in there you know a whole bunch of um blue chip and other nfts that are worth about a thousand eth and you can have a fraction of this vault if you burn your airdrop and choose to go that route did i summarize that correctly yes uh that was pretty good um how much are your services to replace me and explain this way better than me [Laughter] no no i mean we had a long talk about it the other day and it's it's stayed with me not only because i was interviewing you but because i think that's really interesting so uh le let me ask first of all is this was this a part of the original plan was it something that's evolved since is it modeled off of anything else how did this come to be it was fairly uh maybe it was during mint that this sort of plan came into place so very early yeah so we'd already we'd already opened up minting and minting took about a month uh because i was anonymous at the time and i'd a few people knew it was me but you know not many because i didn't feel it was right for people to think i was working on nft boxes when in reality i was selling my half and i thought it would not only look bad on penelope's but i thought it looked bad on pranksy and nft boxes as well if i mean i've just said a couple of minutes ago i hate it when people are working on something and then they launch something else and i guess what i have here is proof that i do hate it because i didn't i didn't use the advantage that it was me i didn't use my years in nfts to sell a project until i was officially out of the other one and we were thinking how can we do any uh airdrops nft air drops properly or i guess i use properly how i think they should be done because what i didn't like about the board apes kennel club drop was you were rewarded for having your ape at a at a snapshot an exact point in time and after that they were just two separate entities until very recently so months and months there was there was just no use of the dog at all now that sounds kind of harsh because obviously they are building out the dog law and uh the the board apes roadmap 2.0 has the dogs quite heavily involved i believe they're two parts of it looks like they're going to save save the clubhouse or something like that but i would question the viewers and say what if it wasn't board apes if it was just you know if it wasn't the most successful nft project ever if it was anyone else how's that airdrop doing not well so i'm thinking from my point of view where i'm putting out an nft and i'm not the most uh successful nft project ever i want to make sure straight out of the gate that airdrop has a use and isn't just well done you can go and sell it because for the majority of air drops well done you can go and sell it doesn't work out well and we now have hundreds of examples of that not going well so you know i'm kind of vindicated there because i was like well this airdrops are just pointless most of the time and now we have lots of proof of that so i wanted to make sure that ownership of this kitty vault we were building uh was somehow tied to these airdrops so they're they're inside these airdrops you have to destroy them to get that or you can claim this physical so the the goal was always to try and take this this airdrop back from people in multiple ways so we're we're pulling we're really tugging at that nft and making people choose and if they don't want to choose they don't have to they can just hold that's fine they can hold they can collect of course they can sell but there are also other things that we're we're doing to make sure that there is utility there and there is underlying value via the kitty fall and that a thousand eth worth of nfts that are in the kitty vault were those yours how did you accumulate those did you use proceeds from the initial sale to to buy them and leverage your talent at picking good projects how did that work uh we did just we did just use a sale i didn't put it it wasn't like um the whale token where whale shark had all these nfts and then put them into a collection and fractionalized it like i said we we have on chain that we are all about the community and you can go and look and see that these nfts were bought from the we we have several different company wallets that do different things and we have sub-domain them so you can kind of see what they are some of them are just sub-domains that we didn't want other people to take so at the end of every youtube video uh creative director kate says mini meow because at the time when we started that we were teasing our first um companion which was a kitten and it was like it's not a meow it's a mini meow because kittens are small and that kind of became a bit of a meme within the community so we minted that one on one of the community wallets just to make sure that uh no one else stole it from us and did whatever with it so what we were then what we then did is took the majority of our sale and shoveled it into the kittyville and while i picked quite a lot of the nfts the community did as well we voted on what they what they wanted to do with certain uh portions of if and it was all segmented in different ways but the it wasn't really any you know if i'm honest it wasn't really any special picking because you know last year everything went up it was like i did have a bit of fomo because during our mint visa announced uh they bought a punk buying the punk and at that point i instantly took money out of the contract and bought a punk i think i bought two and i actually flipped one as the company uh in in two hours flipped it for however much profit obviously i wish i kept it um but of course you know hindsight's 20 20. well as xenica says infinite regret this space is just a space of infinite regret because you will never time the market perfectly there is there is absolutely no one who has done 100 and the problem with this base is the winners are always in your face and you're always reminded of like board apes for example i was told over and over again to mint them because you know my friends pranksy and jimmy both minted huge amounts and just to make it worse pranks he minted in two segments so it's like guys i'm minting this i'm going to mint 200. uh you know what's what's special there he was like i don't know i've just mentioned it i'll leave it next day i'm minting a thousand more why what's special about this project like there was there was just nothing that made me want to go upstairs and mint obviously you know i i was told many many times get a mint i was told many many times by and uh you know there's no matter how successful someone is in this space there's gonna be at least it's not even that one that got away it's that 10 that got away not selling at the top and then buying in lower and you know it's it's more about dealing with mentally how can you cope with those regrets and i probably have a bit of a head start given my uh gambling background and how i came into the space i i dealt with big losses when they should have been big wins back then and now the big wins and big losses are way bigger but it's it's just a percentage at the end of the day of of numbers do you think there's a certain element of like temperament you're temperamentally well-suited to the high-risk high-reward lifestyle or do do you actually think it's something you've learned i think i'm quite well suited to high-risk high reward while also being an absolute fomo dragon like i i just i absolutely i love the phrase for my dragon like i guess you know i i fomo you know as well as the rest of them but what i what i do have is is in my mind i'm like right i am making this decision based on the information i have now and i have accepted that information can change variable change things will change in front of me but i didn't have that information the time i made the decision i made the best decision i could at the time it was wrong i know it was wrong because i'm looking back back at it in this space you never look back at your winners you're never like oh that was great you're just like oh but it could have been this and it's people just have to figure out how a they best deal with it and b how can they make that better for them you no one can change themselves to deal with it in the perfect way no one can look at someone who's really good and go right i want to be able to mentally accept it like them you just can't you have to realize where you are now and try and improve that but know where your personal limits are coming back to the kitty vault yes have you worked out the tokenomics such that you understand the burn rate for getting a fractional piece of the kitty vault and therefore can tell us um whether or not penelope's is undervalued right now based on the fact that it'll get these air drops and those will be burned for uh kitty vault steaks uh it's well i don't really want to say this out loud on a podcast to a such a huge subscriber base uh no it's not it's it's not undervalued based on that and this is i guess this is you know this is a whole other rant with nfts is when you add some form of utility and i wouldn't say you know the kitty vault is utility in a way it's sort of an underlying backing collection of assets that backs your nft but in this space when you add utility to an nft everyone values it on that utility they i remember there was a there was a game called ember sword i think that i was looking to mint uh a while ago i was looking to mend some land in this game and i was watching a youtube video where they were working out if the game hits this amount of daily active users this is the amount of revenue your land will make so i wouldn't pay anything more than x whereas if there was absolutely no utility this calculation wouldn't happen and people pay 10 times x because there's just no ceiling you add what people want and it adds a ceiling and that's not really a penelope rant because i i don't see the kitty vault as utility as such i see it more like the gold standard backing the dollar back in the day no one would ever actually want to use that gold they just knew it was there and that protected the dollar itself so what i do see happening is as the kitty vault goes up in value which it should do it does have some very good nfts in it and i do i do ask you if you go and look at it do sort it by most last paid because we do get lots of stuff sent to it and there have been generally it's a long-term value play so if something is really lowly priced and i can get lots of it for 0.18 it just seems worth doing because it's you know it's a moonshot why not whereas if you search it by highest last page you then see the board apes you see the crypto point you see the genesis kongs you see the um founder other stars they're all at the top because we paid more for those nfts so the share you would get i probably shouldn't say share the fractional representation you would get of the kitty vault isn't like if it if if that was worth more than the nft was then i would just be buying it because you know i'd be like well this is this is silly or you know i put it in discord and i'm sure someone would buy it because when you when you have a reasonable argument and go look guys this is actually worth this and it's under value because of this people don't mind buying in because they can accept that it's not fomo it's you know facts and figures right now it is working as intended the nft is worth more than that share because it should be because if you think of those uh bar graphs where they where they have different uh things on the y-axis and they sort of stack up if you think the underlying value of the kidney vault is a large portion of one of our air drops in one color and then you have a little little bit on top that is just the fact it is an nft it is a collectible it does have this other utility on top as well so it should always be worth more than the fraction of the kitty full it functions as a really interesting floor for the project you know at any given moment in time which is sort of the gold standard backing analogy that you're giving which i think is really interesting and i i again haven't seen i haven't really seen and so i like it as a just a new and innovative concept um in theory we can never go to zero because for us to go to zero all nfts have to go to zero well not i guess our nfts but when you when you now have a five billion dollar valuation yuga labs and you have their i guess technically their punks their mee bits their apes and their mutants and a dog it's gonna be quite tricky for us to go to zero i think at this point would the is it the community of token holders ultimately the folks who own the fractions of the kitty balls they will ultimately determine if something gets sold and paid out to the token holders how does that exit strategy for the kitty vault function not that they're in theory probably not that there is an exit in sight but uh conceptually speaking so the kitty vault will be on fractional 2.0 and the reason it isn't on fractional 1.0 was kind of demonstrated this week with the ape token drop we are seeing a lot of uh a lot of apes within fractional wallets get sold right now because if they sell they can claim their ape and in the in the vault they can't now fractional 2.0 volt system is apparently going to solve this sort of thing along with um for instance our genesis kong guilds banana and if it's in a vault it use banana to that address so you can't claim that banana and it's always gone so you've got this token yield you've got this nft yielding a token that you never have access to if you've fractionalized it and again this is something that 2.0 is aiming to solve so this will be on fractional so there will be a buyout price for the collection that the community will sell yes so the community who it will be a bit tricky because we've kept back 10 000 ourselves precisely for that reason because the tokens themselves will be held in a contract waiting for people to burn their nfts so just thinking ahead i don't think there'll be many community tokens in circulation early doors i think it will take a while for these nfts to be i've said bern we've we've tried to change that rebranding to uh redeem just because i don't want people to randomly send it to oxo dead not get their token because they haven't sent it to a contract that sorts that out for them so what will what we're currently planning to do when this goes live is we'll have our 10 000 uh 10 000 tokens which is 10 of the 100 000 there are and we will have a snapshot vote on what they want to set the vault price at and we will then just for unfortunately it has it is in a trust way it's not trustless they have to trust that we will then set the price at the same way i mean in theory if they didn't want to trust us they could all burn all of their air drops and their penelope's get more tokens than us and then vote on it um i cannot see a world at all where that happens but you know it's it's an option uh we would then set the price and i imagine it would be much higher than we have a weekly kitty vault report that comes out and says the floor price it's it's really hard to value a collection that big and generally what we're seeing which uh i know you're quite involved in the me bits down is generally the price of these tokens track under the true value of the vault um so i do imagine that we'll put it quite a bit higher than our kitty vault report because the goal isn't for it to sell the goal is not for this to sell but if it does people have asked like what happens if it does and the the answer is if you want to burn your nft to claim this ethereum which is effectively just selling your nft really you you get rid of the nft you get the ethereum back but then no one else can ever have the nft you can then get rid of that share and we'll probably give a time period for everyone to that wants to or maybe they want to think about it they can have a week or two to claim that if and then we go shopping as a community we just go again and in a way we would then have less shares to split it between because some people have claimed that if and they've effectively cashed out instead of there been a hundred thousand maybe five thousand have been used and now there's 95 000 shares of the kitty vault and we just go and buy what we consider undervalued projects again like in my head if we get bought out it's a good thing because they have overpaid and we can then go and get value again i think emotionally people might be you know getting attached to our vault at this time because you know we've had that punk a long time we've had those two genesis kongs people have started naming things within the kitty vault so i'm sure you know there'd be some tie that is that takes the hit but then we can go and get a much higher valuation and i i just don't i just don't see people massively over bidding on us on our vault because that you've got to do it in one go right so let's say nft is double in six months that's two thousand ethereum plus two percent of our revenue goes directly into it you know you're looking at looking at a big old big old vault that someone has to be able to bid on everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy five hundred dollars of mvi on the dharma app you can receive fifty dollars worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes that players can collect as pets players aim to

created a subdomain for penelope's country club it's pcc so for example your ens name now is carlini is it carlini8n carlini8 callini8 i if anyone if anyone listening can get me carlini on twitter do you have me all right here first carlini8.pcc.ea would be your [Music] uh ens name now dot pcc sub domain this is awesome i want you to talk about it but again i'm going to give my sort of high level overview here which is on the surface this is a brilliant marketing social signaling play because you now have all these people on twitter who have their names not just set to carly.eth for example or whatever their name is but to carly.pcc.eth signaling that i'm a part of your community and it's just another form of making your profile picture something so i think that's really cool i haven't seen other projects doing it but would love to hear from you why you think this is awesome why you chose to do it what you think the potential is for ens subdomains in the broader nft culture well for most of these issues any any kind of branding play whenever i whenever i try to think about how big it will be i always just think if board apes did it how crazy would people go so if if bored that's a good limit if board apes offered you the ability to link an ens sub domain bayc.ef which they own they have it they can do this uh if you if you're listening guys uh the top level of our contract says this will work for all erc721s feel free to use you know go ahead if you could you make a sub domain that is your brand then your favorite community and then eve your favorite chain presumably because it's you know it's the best one um then you're saying a lot in your username it's also your wallet you know so people can use that to to go and see straight away what you've got and i think you know how right now people are always like they have their vault you know it's called their name and vault i think long term what we'll see is people will have their curated nft collections in their ens branded sub domain because they won't use that like a hot wallet i think that will be where they're like this is the stuff i'm proud of because you know let's say twitter hexagon subdomains or just domains in general what if you could just click it and it takes you straight to a gallery where you can walk around those nfts or it takes you straight to the wallet itself and you can just browse this person's collection in a way what you're saying there is this is me this is what i want you to see about me when i'm telling you who i am so i am carlini8 go look at actually don't go look at my wallets i have not curated that and there are far too many metabots in there um then i'm telling you the community that i spend you know the first discord i open in the day and that is obviously going to be penelope's i'll be bearish on absolutely anyone who runs a project who isn't their own project and then it's the utility of the wallet tied in and you know just as a personal thing in october and february i have run giveaways every day i gave away one penelope for you know certain mostly it was retweeting a tweet sometimes it was coming into discord or making a meme and in october we didn't have it and i had to oh congrats you've won send a dm you know what's your wallet then get the old classic someone changing their name and profile pictures to them oh yeah i won you know trying to scam but in february about half of the retweets were from my community that they had.pcc.eve and i could just send it straight away i didn't have to ask them i could just send it because it was active and if it failed i could be like hey what's up what are you why are you laughing at pcc.eve just go register we give them away for free it's just gas and it's less gas than a normal domain uh you don't have to pay to keep it longer we register it as long as dot pcc.ef is registered and we have absolutely no no plans in letting that lapse you know we we really believe it is the future we'll keep that going you don't have to pay more you're effectively not paying maintenance we will pay the maintenance because you're repping us right you're showing everyone that you like our brand and it just turns your username into a profile picture so if profile pictures are such a big thing why can username projects not be such a big you know just to kind of play on that i love the idea of now you can click your carly.pcc.eth username come to my gallery see my nfts that interactivity there that's a that's a very cool concept that i think is inevitable i don't know if people understand ens domains entirely a they are nfts so if you have an ems domain you probably realize that because you've probably seen it in your open c wallet at some point but they're also really just pointers to things in many ways and so if my understanding is correct penelope said something interesting where maybe this wasn't universal you can correct me but the dot pcc.eath points to a specific cat it's not the you won't see the the nft itself in your openc wallet it's actually tied to one of your existing penelope nfts am i correct on that yes so it also acts kind of a proof of ownership so you can only have dot pc and active.pcc.ef if you own a real penelope which if twitter did do this hexagon thing you wouldn't be able to just mint any old you know you see some of these hexagon apes and when you actually find it they've just they've just minted an ape in a different contract and then said yeah it's an nft and twitter's gone yep that's an nft we'll show it and that would that actually happened quite a lot in there was someone going around doodle twitter accounts trying to find them and if they couldn't find the username matching the doodle they went they then went looking for the nft that had been verified on twitter whereas with subdomains pcc.ef if that was verified they cannot you cannot fake that they they might try you know if we had an i in our name they might try or if we had an l they might try capital i you know that sort of thing but then again that is really limited in how you can fake it so i do think it is a big way for twitter to improve and now that i've given twitter that great idea i'm sure they're frantically trying to contact me to uh to to claim it it it just takes that proof of ownership to the next level without them having to whitelist nfts instead of letting any nft be used speaking of your opinions your id speaking of ideas of yours opinions of yours one of the the rant topics that you went off on a little bit when we we spoke earlier that i loved was about how to do erc20 tokens right within the context of an erc 721 project and some criticisms you have of the way that board apes did it i think specifically you told me that board apes did it wrong but they can afford to do it wrong however if somebody else tries to copy their their process they're screwed so can you elaborate as to what you felt board apes got wrong in the ape token drop yeah so i do think they did it wrong and you know that's obviously really hard to say when you're looking at a token where there are going to be two billion of them and they're currently sitting at roughly 15 dollars a piece which i will just put in here i learnt of ape token releasing on a wednesday during a penelope spaces which i predicted it would be 15 and i even have a tweet uh i put a poll up saying i think it'll be 15 do you think it'll be less more or the same and wow i'm definitely not deleting that because you know that's i'll retweet that now you know uh so i did expect that this would work for them but i think it works because they are them the the other thing is they also know they are them this isn't news they know their position in the world so they could do this i think anyone that copies this will tank their project because you cannot launch without utility with a yielding token and i think nfts should yield because like i said before i didn't like that the dog was split from your ape instantly and again that worked out because board apes aboard apes uh all board apes became board apes and they kind of did it they did this nft air drop successfully first you know there are these silly nft archaeologists who are trying to tell you should buy up doggos or whatever it is because they did something similar 10 days before which is obviously complete nonsense and a rant i'll leave for another day um but any old project unless you are literally the 5 billion valuation leader who can have the amazing execution to be on every major exchange at the same time and have them all tweeting at your launch if you don't have utility your token is just going to tank because why are people buying it and we see this all the time it's it's not new projects are launching without utility and my main worry is that everyone has always copied board apes for the past year uh half a year sorry for the last six months people have copied board apes and they're going to do it now and tank what potentially could be a good project and they'll be they'll be stuck with this token once you launch a token it's there you can't get rid of it you can't just sorry guys we hyped you up about this token and now we're not going to use it why why do you think they launched now before the the play to earn game was ready or before it had immediate utility they're obviously savvy they obviously get the market well was it just because they wanted to back to back it with the punk me bit long purchase and that had to be at a certain time what do you think was behind the timing well they did buy a lot of social equity by buying punks instantly buying buying punk and me pit ip and then giving giving them the rights that punks and me bits had been yearning for for so long is probably you know the chattest move in nft history like it's just so baller it's unbelievable we can see it coming for you know the first few months i'm sure people joked about it but and i'm sure people have tweets they can retweet or you know text to their mum that they sent these are going to buy punks or whatever but i don't think anyone truly believed it and then obviously they kept growing and growing and punks aren't apes apes are a company that have proven they will continuously build whereas punks are a relic they're an nft relic where effectively in their sale tweet lava labs said we never wanted this you know they see themselves as artists and suddenly projects are coming out and building and they don't want to build i i remember i was absolutely fuming in 2019 because i was a i was a big crypto kitty player and and cryptokitties were doing so much their website was insane for the time for an nft project it's still insane now it's it's broken in parts because it's effectively been abandoned for a long time but the website is still it has crazy utility built in and they were doing so much they were running fancy contests um they were they were paying community members to try and build games which ultimately didn't work out but they were trying and they got a lot of hate whereas lava labs in 2019 updated a filter on their site so you could look at the all crypto punks better and everyone went wild oh well done oh that's great oh you're the best and i was like they've they've slightly changed their website like it wasn't even lots they slightly upgraded their website and got huge praise cryptokitties that you know i was having fun playing in had done all this stuff and just got a lot of hate partly from me you know i'm not going to pretend i was all nice and icy i was you know shouting like the rest of them but i guess my point is they never did anything buildy they lava labs i don't actually know if it's true it's just like i guess but in my head they inspired nifty gateway because they sold a physical print at a gallery of a crypto punk to the winklevoss twins who then [Music] i'm pretty sure they own gemini who run nifty gateway so yeah you know i am not in the position to talk to them maybe if you ever do you could ask them if they were inspired by lava labs in any way but in my head they are and that that is a way that they inspired the space but they never wanted to build on punks um and then got a lot of hate for like doing me bits and then doing nothing after it or giving t-pose and nothing but i think the timing of the ape drop it's it's probably something [Music] that i i couldn't guess something internal that i couldn't guess or you know they have been known it mutants it ape we've just we finally i can imagine because you know we know of kai's issues dealing with lava labs it took them so long to engage a man who was trying his best to only add value to me bits me bit style did more for me bits than lava labs from my point of view like i don't know if internally kyle think differently or if you think differently or if he wouldn't ever voice that but you know actually think thinking but they just would not help him this man is or this whole community is working so hard on moebits and they wouldn't engage for so long but then all of a sudden they're selling to yuga who maybe were having to deal with that sort of slowness and lack of engagement it finally went through they wanted the token to have launched maybe because they had said q1 like they had said it and we were getting to the point where people are thinking oh maybe this isn't going to happen when in reality maybe they were just waiting for slow lava labs to have got this sale through sorry lava labs if this is completely wrong and you were really quick but that's just my sort of perception from the outside that sale goes through and they're like bob it was a powerful one to punch that announcement it was it was epic the ape metaverse video with the punks and the me but like i mean damn i mean you can tell it was late as well because the leaked deck had didn't have the punk and the me but because it wasn't theirs they couldn't use it so they had clearly planned it without it and then bam they get it change it and it's just all go it must have been exciting in their offices that when that went through so circling back to your issues with oh yes the drop i think there are there are two really which is one this point that gets back to the the kennel club frustration and i thought this was an interesting point which is they airdropped the tokens whatever you were entitled to as an ape holder your ten thousand tokens whatever it was you you got that all at once and so that automatically almost makes it a distinct entity it makes ape and it makes ape the coin and your board ape sort of distinct entities not entirely of course they're deeply interconnected but you're trying to drive value for both the apecoin and the board ape as opposed to if your board ape yielded tokens over time by adding value to either one you're inherently well i guess if by adding value to the ape token you're then inherently adding value to the board ape because it's yielding that eight token over time much like the kennel the the dog was sort of so independent and didn't have utility from day one that's sort of argument one you were making about why you didn't like the the the way the token drop was structured is that correct yes and i know the argument will be but the dow is voting to stake and the time period is quite short and just today so between our two chats apes apes are now all kind of trying to figure out what the proposal actually is because it see there's a bit of confusion over how it works and even just while we've been talking there's a twitter spaces and they're a couple of high high profile apes you know tagging the founders and trying to figure out what does this actually mean so it's it's not as simple as if their nfts just yielded the token um and i i just think it is it is the way your nft should yield long term the token because then when you add value to the token you are adding value to your nft i don't i don't know if maybe this is the way they can do it legally because i know i can do it legally my way but i'm in the uk and have followed different procedures whereas i know they're in the us which you know it gets it gets much trickier so i'm wondering if that's the reason why that they can't yield the nft directly but they can stake if a dow has voted for it maybe that would make sense because they could also have a contract set up that the dao would have a contract where it's basically like an algorithm enacting it not an entity you know so it's like it's not yuga that is is yielding this token via the staking it's this algorithm over here it gives them a layer of separation from the action itself which uh gives them a layer of protection over you know the sec coming after them in some capacity um so that's a good thought actually that might be it and your second critique which we was sort of wrapped up in that first one is that they didn't launch with utility immediately and we've sort of digested that and discussed that problem yeah so my main worry is that it's not the board apes have done this is that people will copy board apes and they're going to tank their project effectively in my view okay the last topic that i absolutely wanted to get to with you and then again there may be other little things that that pop up as we're talking about this is your announcement i think as part of penelope's roadmap 2.0 that you all or you know penelope's had purchased land in nft worlds and is building i think it was like four games but is building in nft worlds i would love for you to say more about that and also why you you chose to buy land in nft worlds with many metaverses to choose from why have you chosen to fly with nft worlds yeah so having sort of been here through the length of these uh other metaverses so it's it is a bit weird to have been here this long and i saw you know the decentraland original sale uh i think it was 15 million way back then that they raised which was a large amount for an nft project but then like loads um there's you know sandbox is another big player um and then voxels which was kind of a a spin-off of i don't want to say spin off a decentralized but he worked there and then he was like oh this is going to work i'm going to do it right and then when to do it um and then there are more recent ones and i've ended up picking nft worlds which is one of the the newer ones why why have i done that when all the others have been building so long and it's that while it's the newest one it actually has the most tested game in history backing it so minecraft is the most played game in history probably almost certainly most bought game in history is somehow just survives everything you know some people stop playing and then suddenly for some reason kids are now playing this really old game great great game and you know you can be really creative in it so there's just so many ways to play within minecraft but when you can take that base underlying tech add it to um effectively web free and package that up what you've got is sort of a quick fire way to have an incredibly tested the most battle tested piece of software in the gaming world effectively to then allow people to build in and it also comes with builders that have worked on it for longer than nfts have been around so we've partnered with entity builds who are building um on our world for us and they have held microsoft contracts to effectively build the games that microsoft have made around uh minecraft so since uh notch sold it to mine microsoft and microsoft have now actually owned it longer than [Music] mojang ever did and what you end up with is a team that are familiar with what they're doing already they don't have to learn all of these um different intricacies just to to make make a world or to make a game and i i did find this a bit tricky for um so your friends at iyk when we were planning out this this hoodie that we've got which was our first airdrop which has an nft in it and it in my opinion solves uh in real life fashion and metaverse fashion linking together um when we were trying to get the design in [Music] uh say decentraland for that it was tricky there were there were hoops to jump for jump through people to talk to whereas it's easier in an already battle-hardened process and the things they can build and release just seem insanely good uh decentraland don't have anything close to being able to play those types of games yet uh and i'm sure they're coming but there's a founder who's you know wanting to deliver when game win game one game you know that's the the pressure the community put on you i can't wait on a different project to to get there sandbox don't let you or at least at the time don't let you build as a person i guess you have to kind of go through them and there's just more red tape to be able to do that so other projects are able to but you know like snoop dogg for some reason has more say than me and what can happen i don't know why that is we talked about snoop dogg's uh sandbox i don't know activation land last week because i started playing around in it and my boyfriend commented that he was like are you like are you watching porn like he was like what's the porn music coming out of your computer and it was me in this new dog metaphor so in the sandbox so uh there's a plug for him yeah for some reason he had more sway than me and he could get that built um not sure why i don't know who even knows who he is you know uh so there was there was just kind of red tape there blocking that and just these incredible builds that entity builds had had and i'd i'd reached out to them and it was actually quite tricky to to get in touch we kept missing each other and i i really did persevere because i just thought this is the best option for us and just the way that it's already got the world token integrated so we'll be able to have a have a stash of world token and we're going to have four different games with varies various different as i guess levels or arenas within it and we can reward people for doing certain things so one of the games is going to be a golf game whoever you know whoever scores the lowest that week or even that day we could reward with token uh whoever kills the most zombies in the zombie defense game we could reward with token we could have esports leagues set up based on high schools within our game so just the ability of using that token within these games just adds another level of i guess exposure to people because people will people go to worlds where they could potentially earn money like if they if they're good at zombie games they're going to go and try and win our zombie game what how do you think about the balance between using worlds token the world token as a reward and the erc20 token that is going to be yielded by a penelope and by your own nft so there there's a sort of short term long term play there so short term we will be using world because it's already easily integrated there is a community built around the world token that we can tap into by using it and people will know what it is like if you're just scrolling through worlds to go and play and you see that this one yields world and this other one yields penelope token but you you don't know natively what penelope token is worth so it's a it's another form of advertising i guess to be able to use world token at the start and maybe as we're more sort of established in the world token the world nft world world or ecosystem we could add our token as well but in reality that will require some kind of talk with nft worlds because i don't want to annoy i don't want to come in and just be like ah screw your token we're going to use ours i want to have a conversation and be like so what do you actually want to see from your worlds would you have an issue of us using our token which obviously i haven't had yet because we don't even have our games ready or our token so at this point it's yeah it's it's not needed yet but that that will be a conversation that had and maybe maybe would have some sort of converter instead where your penelope automatically goes into world which you then can convert back and forth what is your planned utility knowing that you feel it's very important to have utility out the gate for a token for the penelope token when it's when it's released as it won't be a reward within your gaming ecosystem at least initially so that's what do i what what do i leak from roadmap 2.0 uh so we [Music] is this alpha are we about to get alpha or is this problem i think it's technically alpha i honestly i don't know what i talk about half the time i might have linked everything uh in spaces uh can you tell i i talk when i'm talking about nfts whereas talk to me about anything else and i just won't say a word like in in the real world i'm quiet but nfts just can't stop um we we have our tier two our tier two which is effectively so penelope's tier one an unknown tier two and then there are two tier threes which are your kitten and next month's airdrop tier 2 is effectively our meebit mutant that kind of level now i said before flexibility is is key um and that we're going to be raising uh money to try and ensure that we have that salary banks for at least a year maybe two so what we have planned is we're going to sell before token is released probably in may we're going to sell an nft which yields token and it's going to be priced up that if you want token it will be better than buying a penelope by quite a bit but you will know that you're funding the teams you you could i might even somehow try and get a little sort of presentation on how we've spent our reef you can see on chain we have a history of by that time you know 10 11 months of spending our if responsibly for penelope's you will know that by buying this cheaper nft that yields token which will have a bit of a degen play so you might be able to get quite a rare nft that yields quite a lot of token it will all be priced up to make it worth going for without devaluing penelope's it's quite a tricky balance to balance to make and you'll be funding us securing that year or two of runway while also then effectively adding extras to roadmap 2.0 that's where all of our funding will go after we've secured everything and also it funds the entity built because so far that's i've told them yes i'll pay and i've paid a third of it so far and it is it is it is expensive uh they they have asked me not to say and i completely respect that um it it it will very much be worth it it's it's incredible the games that they're able to build in these worlds but our token out of the gate you will be able to mint tier twos so the the second tier of our of our club you'll be able to min there is a do i there is a bit of a twist but do i say there are okay there are six different tier twos within it i'm moving closer listening closely and within those six different tier twos there will be then different rarities there are almost six collections within this one collection of tier twos and the thing you will be buying is almost like a mutant serum based on i don't know if you've seen the sup duck snack shop i don't think i have actually so they they have vault their token and they sold snacks that could do certain different things in their in their vault shop and i love that idea and we will be selling different items that you will use on a penelope a kitten or a different the other companion and there'll be two different items for each one and that will then create your other thing i've leaked a lot of planned there that's awesome yeah well so now of course they have to ask one token well now i've got to be that if the if the plan for the sale is may the working plan for token is june wow that's awesome it also reminds me of something that i i've loved which is the cool cats plan for cool pets where you feed it you can buy things and feed it different things and it that'll affect whether it becomes fire earth rain or you know it's elemental peace is that similar as well to what you're describing it's is that a longer term feeding i i i'm more asking because i'm not entirely sure what it was i don't think so it is ongoing it's not like a one-time feeding okay so as would be mutant serum style you you give the serum it makes it but you actually get it in a subduct style way and you yield the token in a cyber kong style way uh so i you know i have said from the start if i think an idea is good i will see how we can take it and i love the shop i love the token yielding i love the using that item you get from the shop to create something and then we've added that within the collection there'll be six and just try and add a little bit on top of the stuff that i've taken from elsewhere i guess well thank you so much for sharing all this i i love getting a glimpse into how your brain works you obviously there's a there's a lot that your brain does right and like figures out right if that's not a weird thing to say just based on how you discovered the space so early and and your success in it and uh i've just been so grateful to get to learn more about penelope's both through obviously this conversation directly but even in doing some research leading up to this conversation i have to ask as like a final question i know this feels like it almost like runs i don't know if it runs counter to what we've been saying but like where would you like penelope's to be in five years do you have like a we want to be supreme we want to be disney i know the answer is is no because we've just spent this time talking about how you stay flexible but still have road maps but what is the where would you like it to be in five years well as as an nft guy i would much rather be bored apes than disney because to me that's more important um like there's just i want to be able to pivot so the the possibility of saying in five years we'll be here just isn't there because here in my opinion doesn't exist so maybe five years is is too long but in say a year i'd want a stronger brand um i really would want more people using uh pcc.ef i'd also love for other collections to be using dot whatever dodie um i would love for the gaming elements who you know have completely taken off and people to be playing the game we are we are just trying to go down every road that i think is great so i do see plenty of things that other nft projects do that i just think why would we go down that road they're going down that road that's great that's their focus but that not only doesn't interest me but i don't really see how it works or the value that i could add to that whereas with branding we're kind of going down the innovation route and we do have something that is really cool coming soon tm it's not really cool pump people's bags you know penelope's to the moon but it just technologically it is incredibly cool for nfts and i can see others running with it as well just like the subdomains um i'm gonna i'm gonna keep that one in the look because i've already i've already given away too much too much which of course i love and i'm so grateful to you for sharing you're sharing lots um really exciting i i will be tracking penelope's closely i love everything you've had to say here and thank you so much for hopping on and being so generous with your time we're like i think this is definitely the longest podcast i've i've recorded to date and uh it's because you just have so much to to share so thank you thank you thank you no thanks thanks for having me on any opportunity to talk about nfts i i just love it i can't stop true dj that's how you retire early folks be this do not copy me trade me you're screwed from now on i think okay well i i still need to pick your brain about this uh how i too can take advantage of i don't know trying to be turned me into a gambling addict and if i can resist it i can't that's meant just hop around and make a bunch of money that's yeah that's what i took away from what you said uh awesome thank you so much [Music] we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto
