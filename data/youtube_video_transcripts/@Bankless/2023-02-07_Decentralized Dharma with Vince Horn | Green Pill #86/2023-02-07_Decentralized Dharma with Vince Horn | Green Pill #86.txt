foreign [Music] ation on the Pod today we have Vince horn who is a Buddhist geek the host of the Buddhist Geeks podcast which is all about figuring out how Buddhism and the Dharma is going to evolve in the digital age so I've been a long time listener of the Buddhist Geeks podcast about nine to 12 months ago I was on the Buddhist Geeks podcast and we talked about the um the sort of parallels with financial sovereignty that can come out of the blockchain space and psychological sovereignty that kind of comes out of Buddhist practice and what are the intersection of those two things and Vince and I launched this thing called Sangha Dao which is basically just a Discord Channel where people are interested in the Dharma and people are interested in web3 could come together and figure out what the intersection of that was and the Hope was that multiple songadals were going to come out of that movement now we might have just had our bill Market lenses on uh it might have been naive to think that that was going to happen but uh Tsonga Dao kind of piddled out uh the activity there did not continue but I'm really happy to see that uh there was uh dozens maybe about a hundred people who are interested in the intersection of these things and what can these practices learn from each other and I'm really excited to see that Vince continues to go down the web 3 Rabbit Hole even after all the stuff that's happened over the last year Vince sees an opportunity to decentralize the Dharma with the work that he's doing with inner being up and inner being protocol so we talk a lot about that on this episode we actually do a social meditation halfway through the episode so you can see what the inner being protocol is and um or at least one of the interbeing protocols there's there's multiple of them and I think this is a special unique episode Vince cares about decentralization and he cares about Dharma and he's a Pioneer in the digital Dharma space and so that's why this is a really fun episode for me um we we talk halfway through the episode about what are the parallels be being between decentralizing context in a Dao and decentralizing the Dharma um which is basically how how do you augment how present you are and how to teach something that's that's that high context and how and and that important to someone else in your Sangha and what are the parallels between that and a dow where you're trying to decentralize power in context from from yourself to other people that are in in the Dow um and you know there's ways in which that those parallels break down but uh what is a full node when it comes to Dharma transmission and it was a full node when it comes to a dow and we just barely scratched the surface of the things that those two practices have to learn from each other in this episode so Vince is a special unique thinker that is pushing forward digital Dharma and I think that you're really going to enjoy this episode about decentralizing Dharma and

will just be a continuation of me trying to pull you down the web 3 culture Rabbit Hole events um and vice versa on the Buddhist Rabbit Hole so that's fine yeah exactly so um you and I did a podcast together maybe nine months ago uh on the Buddhist Geeks podcast which in which we talked about something called uh Sangha Dao um Sango being your community of Buddhist practitioners and then Dao being a web 3 provocation of that and uh yeah we started a Discord and we tried to to put something together actually creating a Dao uh uh a song Adele and um and it didn't really it didn't really turn into a dial on its own although it kind of created a cultural intersection between people who are into Buddhism and people are into web three so um yeah what is the last nine or 12 months of of exploring that been like for you it's been really interesting on a couple levels I mean one is just meeting people who are interested in that intersection because it is a relatively small emerging uh intersection space um and there has been some practical stuff that's come out of that like we've we held a series and I want to hear mentioned uh ants Cabral who's been an important part of this he brought sort of um his his sort of decentralized organizing skills and a really nice format that he called the community Greenhouse uh to Sangha Dao and we held a number of those in which people who were actually working on projects whether at the very early ideation phase or actually have built something could come and share and talk about the project uh at that intersection of Dharma and Dao uh web3 and Buddhism and um and it was cool to just basically discover that in fact there aren't that many projects in the space but there are some and there are some people who are working at that sort of the edge and uh of the of those two coming together so that was quite cool and then for me on a personal level being a Serial entrepreneur it's been helpful to Think Through kind of how if at all to use web 3 tech for the projects that I'm working on it's been a nice space to kind of explore that as a participant so um so yeah I'd say there's not a whole lot that's come out of Sangha Dao in terms of formal organization or anything like that but there's been some cool connections and and a space at least where you know we can talk about these things or start too right yeah um I think that you know I when we when we did that podcast and maybe we'll link to that podcast in the show notes so that people can go back in time and check it out but I think that the a priori sort of analysis was that um uh the Buddhist path can can create a psychological sovereignty for you um and and the uh web3 can create some amount of financial sovereignty uh for you if you use it responsibly probably if you use it responsibly in both camps and so what is what is the sort of alignment of those two communities and then we created this meme of Sangha dial there was a really active Discord for like three or six months then I think people kind of moved on with their other projects and so it wasn't a dial so much as a generator of uh a social or like an intersection of two different social groups and and it sounds like some of your projects have been influenced by that so it wasn't totally for naught but it was sort of a emergent uh an emergent sort of group that came together there I gotta stop calling things dials that aren't actually Dallas they're like generators of of maybe future dolls but um yeah anything to say there's a word that needs to be invented there I guess yeah um convocation or something like that but um yeah I guess could you tell us what you're what are you working on now um and and is there any web3 influence with it yes yes and yes um so yeah so now the main thing I've been working on the last several months is uh it's a multiplayer meditation app uh called interbeing and uh we're building it on the zoom platform because that's where communities already are hanging out virtually and um Our intention is to take this past 12 years of training in and doing and then creating um interpersonal meditation practices practices that are actually designed to be done out loud with other people rather than silently by yourself and to essentially figure out how to scale that up in a way that's trauma informed and effective uh to a larger audience um because the main problem right now with meditation apps is that they're all like glorified iPods they just just you know play basically various versions of guided broadcast meditations which is cool and important and I've done that I've recorded lots of meditations and had them on apps and stuff and I don't think that's going away but it's kind of interesting to me that we have yet in the meditation space to realize that the paradigmatic power the shift from the sort of individual one-to-many broadcast model you know the 21st century like TV and you know radio and newspapers to like the internet age and the peer-to-peer uh model like meditation has not in in in mainstream meditation has not made that leap yet um and so essentially that's what I'm working on is how to do that and there is a web three aspect to this although we're starting just with a sort of standard web 2 kind of approach Our intention is to link back to web 3 or to help uh create in a sense a kind of meta game uh or ecosystem around which these practices could have another level of meaning and right now I'm thinking of this mostly as a massively multiplayer meditation online role-playing game or mmm orpg uh dot XYZ I've actually got the domain so it's this that's the web three domain that's it that's it so um so yeah there's an idea of how to take some of these inherently relational practice services and build a kind of role-playing game you know underneath it or on top of it to help incentivize the actual behavior of doing the practices yeah I love that um mmm orpg just is provocative especially knowing that one of those M's is meditation and I totally see the analog um with uh multiplayer meditation being a huge opportunity I mean you know figma took design and made it multiplayer I know that a bunch of people are working on ticking coding and making it multiplayer and just taking meditation and making it multiplayer feels like a totally obvious leap when I put it in that context and I'm curious you know does that facilitate faster learning or faster decentralization of the Dharma to be able to do it many to many instead of just one to many in the broadcast model what kind of weird stuff have you seen since starting to play with multiplayer meditation yeah absolutely that's that's actually what's most exciting about it is it is a pedagogical uh leap it's a Quantum Leap in terms of learning um because you're not just being given this sort of instructions and then going off on your own and trying to kind of grind through them and figure them out without much feedback in those practices which I think maybe we'll do a little bit together here to demonstrate at some point um so it's not just theoretical uh in those practices you actually hear each other practicing so it takes what in meditation it's normally a black your experience is a black box like you don't really know what the hell's going on unless you've developed your Ultra psychic powers you don't know what's going on in another person's experience unless they say so and usually when they do say so it's it's it's being filtered through lots of interpretive abstractions of stories that the people are making up about it but in these techniques that we do the techniques are usually very simple there's not a whole lot of space for story and so you actually just hear at a very simple level like what's happening for someone right now as an example and so that's very powerful to be able to um kind of immediately get that instantaneous feedback and modeling and then the other thing it does is it cuts down mind wandering by a huge Factor because because there's a peer pressure in these practices like you know when it's your turn or when it's time to go you can't be like off on a 10 minute fantasy you know you just like you have maybe your favorite way to spend my favorite way to spend time on the meditation mat because I'm a spectator I don't have that Loop that's like Hey Kevin focus on your breath again but if I was in a social group then maybe that that would kind of be there that's right the peer pressure can kind of override the you know the tendency to just want to like hang out and think about things yeah uh should we do one instead of just talking about them should we yeah should we do one okay yeah let's let's do let's demonstrate it cool uh yeah take us away okay okay cool well um I think the easiest practice to demonstrate and here the intention is not just for people who are listening to just just watch this or observe it intellectually but but actually there's a deeper invitation if you'd like which is to witness the practice and to uh witness with presence like to actually be present and hear Kevin and I go back and forth as we share our experience aloud uh and to see how that impacts you actually to see the effect of doing that um the easiest practice I think to start is one that you've done before Kevin it's called there is noting um I think we did this together uh in in England not so long ago uh and that was quite fun the basic idea here is very simple if you want to know what's happening in your experience you have to stop and check so you have to say okay what's going on right now and then one way of phrasing it framing it when you when you sort of check in with your own sensory experience and you see okay what's happening right now is you could just say there is and then use a word or two to describe whatever there is whatever it is that you're noticing is it like there is seeing where there is a little tightness in my chest right now so there is tightness there's anticipating and so forth and I'm just doing that verbally out loud to demonstrate it but in the social part we'll actually take turns kind of like Ping Pong going back and forth uh noting one at a time what whatever it is that we're noticing okay all right well I think I've got the idea I'm probably just zooming out this is great my camera is uh is bugging out I'm gonna switch to my own fancy camera um uh okay so we should we do a uh maybe a minute of of noting meditation yeah let's do a minute that's a nice amount to demo sort of minimum sufficient of time yeah to get it okay great I'll ring a bell at the end how about that that sounds great you want to see us off too okay I'll tease off by saying there is starting there is audio there is breathing there is hearing there is tooth aching there is grogginess they're suggesting posture there is slowing down there is trusting there is adjusting there is exhaling there is presence there's movement there is notifications foreign but now I'm present about it at least as I'm chasing that that dopamine yes now you're aware of how how painful it is well it's it's different uh so that's the first time I think that we've done the meditation together over digital right which is just a totally different level of presence than like you know I think last time we were we were physically in each other's presence which kind of creates a different Dynamic to it but um you know what should the listener be be noting about the noting experience to ask a meta question I think I think one thing to note here is that in this practice any words you use are okay the purpose of the notes we call them notes or labels in this technique are not to actually um it's not it's not about trying to find the right word rather it's trying to keep the noticing function of the Mind the the part of the mind and attention that is constantly noticing how things are this metacognitive capacity it's trying to link that and bind that to our sensory experience to actually see what is it that you're sensing because there's noticing and sensing and those two are different functions and oftentimes we're so lost in our conceptualizations about things that we're noticing that we we lose touch with like feeling our feet on the ground like these very basic experiences that if you lose it's it's much harder to stay resilient and stay grounded and stay centered and stay like healthy because we've lost touch with this basic kind of information that the body is sending us mm-hmm so it kind of reminds me of a mention I I'm I'm sort of on the shallow end of the meditation pool but I do know that after I've done a retreat or I'm feeling really centered that I have this sort of sensing experience and then um either I react immediately or when I'm in my more present moments there's sort of like a tagging or a pattern matching uh mental process that happens before I respond to things and it almost feels like what I'm doing with inner being protocol meditation that we just did is is like it's almost like the noting is it's like building the muscle of tagging and pattern matching um my sensory experience and doing it with you allow like you're I feel like I'm like a level two like meditator and you're like a level 99 meditator like there's almost like an amount of social transference like like I'm syncing your presence your ability to note with mine and and I don't know that's what I think is is cool about it but again I'm just a novice is that how it's supposed to work yeah that's right actually that's really interesting observation too because um on the other side for me it means working with someone who's fairly new to their mind like I feel I feel kind of a tugged down to where they are they might feel pulled up and uh but actually that's good because um at least in my tradition we talk about two things we talk about wisdom or Transcendence Transcendent wisdom and then compassion you know and that there's both of those movements are important to like transcend to let go of to become like bigger and wider and we're free but then like how free can you really be if if you're the only one and if you're the only one experiencing that Transcendent Freedom it's not that great it's not that robust uh and so it's great to actually meet people where they are and to work with them where they are uh and of course I'm doing the same thing with myself all the time too it's not like I am a level 99 meditator it doesn't feel that way level you know whatever level it is the higher you go the more the latter sways I love what you said about like meditation or Enlightenment and presence being much sweeter when you have someone to share it with I think that there's something profound there like you know maybe it's just because I've been watching The Last of Us this new show on HBO but like you know these people that are like you know fully healthy and living in this world where everything around them has died um and all they are is is wishing for a community like people that they can commune with and and I imagine that maybe I'm just projecting that on top of uh what you just said there but the idea of um being enlightened or feeling present or or like having someone to share that with is it is better is like I just think that that's kind of like a profound um statement and the fact that you know you're working on live meditation protocols so that people can share those and bootstrap those things kind of like um it's an interesting investment like a high leverage point for creating that world that you want to see we're working on multiplayer meditation I think as well we'll end this Meandering observation yeah no thank you for saying that I appreciate your support and all this um Kevin and um yeah and you know to take the word Enlightenment which is also quite you know problematic in a lot of ways because we can just project all of our fantasies onto that word uh yeah like for me in doing these practices what I think Enlightenment actually looks like is being attentive to your experience and to others simultaneously that's all it is it's just the ability to hold your experience in mind and the experience of others without completely collapsing in on yourself like losing everyone else into yourself or losing yourself into others and I've noticed people tend to have one of those two tenancies and so this practice is about learning how to actually maintain a balanced attention I call it introspection where you're both aware of your own feelings and thoughts and Sensations and others around you and this is just hyper functional thing to do like when you when you're able to do that you become a better person and more effective and so it's actually really functional and really useful uh and doesn't we don't have to get into the mystical dimension of this which by the way is pretty profound because then you realize you're not who you thought you were you're like you're something which is sort of more like networked rather than like an individual and I think that's quite beautiful to realize yeah um well it's it's it'd be nice to realize that I'm a networked individual in a presence-based mindful way instead of when I'm just scrolling Twitter and Blasting myself with everyone else's thoughts uh a more mindful networked individual yeah good point yeah um so are are we still talking about this uh I know a name that you were toying with for a little while was inner being protocol is is that still a name that you're using yeah so the the app that I mentioned earlier is called interbeing um and people can find it at interbeing.us uh or at least our landing page there and the inner being protocol is our other set of basic schematics that describe different sort of uh to use Daniel schmachtenberger's term they're like generator functions for these practices so they describe kind of what are the kind of key elements that need to be defined uh when you do a set of practices and then within that then one could generate all kinds of different practices as we have uh in our community um um so there's an app called inner being in which you can experience it but then the sort of web 3 pill in you or is is thinking about how do we abstract the actual practices into like credibly neutral protocols that no one owns and then yeah so so there's a consumer facing experience and there's a there's a protocol Center experience there yes and and our you know my my current founder and I were a co-founder we're talking about how to make that into an actual like role-playing game like very simple and maybe you know crypto kitties meets you know headspace kind of thing where it's like yeah you have a basic character you know that's like a soul-bound nft you know um so that any practice you're doing using these protocols could be logged on a kind of you know immutable Ledger and you could more than that you could see the different qualities that you're developing because they're different protocols like the one we just did is called the social noting protocol and it's really mindfulness Centric it's about developing that capacity to just notice what you're sensing in real time but there are other protocols like the social meta protocol meta is a word that means friendliness or loving kindness and in that protocol it's more about uh cultivating and generating um positive mind States uh and inclining toward well wishing and that's a different capacity and so you could see that maybe reflected like on a contemplative character sheet right it's like how much mindfulness have you done versus heartfulness versus inquiry versus you know just constant Focus meditation and so I'm seeing you know there's there's a potential there to kind of map those things on to a role-playing game schematic uh and I'm excited about that Prospect because I think it just Taps into our natural kind of inclination as humans to want to see some external representation of our internal growth yeah yeah it's like uh vitalik and Glenn have this idea of dsoc which is like you gain all these different Badges and this reputation graph that that um is intersubjective from people giving each other these little nfts and inner being protocols like a little Buddhist Niche uh a mindful niche of yeah of of decentralized society but I think that there's other like there's maybe something else about it being a protocol in that if it's open source it's not owned by anyone which is like the typical way that the Dharma has been transmitted is from teacher to student over years like there's a power imbalance there that you know just Google just Google like you know meditation teacher student power imbalance and you'll see some of the things that can go wrong with that but like you're sort of freeing that like this comes back to the sovereignty thing is like the fact that it's a protocol means that it can be transmitted peer-to-peer um you know in kind of a profound uh with a profound neutrality uh to it so I think that that that is that is that is pretty provocative as well I think that's the most exciting part of this um from my point of view but I'm I'm sort of super nerdy in that I'm I am a Dharma lineage holder like I actually I'm part of this sort of formal transmission thing and I'm really interested in figuring out how to decentralize some of these linear some of the functions of lineage so that it can actually open up to more creative collaboration around these things versus just have a few people at the top who are allowed to innovate and everyone else is just sort of a receptacle for their Innovation so you're you can speak both both the hierarchical Dharma uh and the networked Dharma uh languages and you're looking to translate the latter into the former I hope that's not preservative for me to call it hierarchical Dharma but it literally is no that's accurate yeah but it's trans like lineage like I can see why if you if you had been uh transmitted the Dharma by a teacher and you really wanted to do right by them you would want to pass it down to someone that you could trust would hold that lineage and that knowledge in that context forward and so um but but by making it many to many instead of one to many in in a way you're kind of creating even more possibility for that to be to be passed down and I think that there's a lot of excitement in that too even if it's probably way harder than just finding a student and investing in them it is way harder and and the other thing is it's like it's passing down some parts of what I've learned from my Dharma practice and communities but it's obviously not all of it it's like it's a it's a sliver of the meditation training that I think is really exciting and Innovative um but like around training and ethics for instance yeah like there's another really nothing like about this that is inherently going to help people become more ethical maybe a little bit if you're more present you might actually be more kind of attuned to these concerns so maybe there's a slight net Improvement but it's not directly focused on that so in that sense it's an unbundling of the Dharma uh training and focus specifically on on the meditation part of that mm-hmm yeah well it do you think it's gonna be unbuggled into a suite of inter being protocols or yes yeah um I feel like there's a relationship probably between the inner being protocols and like the ooda loop observe Orient uh decide act Loop that people just go through in their lives also so it's not like this just like this transmission like in The Matrix where all of a sudden Neo is like I know Kung Fu is it's not like that with the protocol but there's like a a sort of like relationship between your experience and your life and your practice and and the transmission there um that's probably not that's probably too reductionists but that's that's at least part of it yeah agreed yeah so um uh uh I have a a strange take that I wanted to share with you um and it's it's what I dm'd you on Friday on Twitter which is like um basically I'm wondering what the differences and the similarities between peer-to-peer transmission of um we're all about peer-to-peer Transmission in the in the blockchain space tonight uh people who are watching on video will see behind me I've got a ethereum node right here that's just validating blocks on the world financial system out of my house in Colorado which I think is something profound about that like I'm not on Wall Street I'm I'm just some guy and I have a 900 computer that synced the state of the ethereum blockchain um in order to have that context of validating the um The decentralized Ledger that is ethereum and I'm wondering what the you know and we have a protocol for that there's a consensus protocol for that and I'm wondering what the analogs are between Dharma transmission which is the transfer of knowledge of the practices of Enlightenment from period person to person um and and transferring that context so that people can live their life with presence and perspective what's the analog between that and two nodes that are syncing the world financial system so that then they can validate Humanity's Financial transactions day to day and then um because it's kind of a stretch to talk about like blockchain nodes peer-to-peer transmitting it versus people transmitting knowledge to each other I think the blend between between the two is like my experience with Bitcoin and decentralizing Power in a dow from one person to many like there's all these things that are bundled inside of power like context and behavior and relationships um and allowing people to to Steward a dow by decentralizing that power and I see this analog uh between between decentralizing the Dharma decentralizing like State on a blockchain node and decentralizing Power in a Dao and I'm and I'm wondering like am I just crazy for C like for for seeing this and and what is the um you know how do you become like a full node with uh with respect to transmitting Dharma from one another and um and what do we hit what can we learn about about decentralization of uh of power in a Dao from from Dharma transmission so I know I know this is I guess I guess I'll stick the landing on this by just saying um do you see any analogs between these between these things and if so what do people have to learn from Dharma transmission um you know since I think that's probably the language that you're most familiar with yeah yeah yeah okay this is um it's a really interesting and also a very complex question um I guess in a lot of ways because well it's complex because there are many different um Traditions within Buddhism so I'm gonna kind of oversimplify uh and squash a lot of differences in order to make a cogent point I'll just interject that like there's many different types of dowels also in my main experiences with Bitcoin uh so maybe we can Center on just what you know the lineage that you know best and I'll also talk about the Dow that I know best and and we can that'll be careful grounds great so I'm most familiar with the early Buddhist tradition uh or the uh sometimes called the theravada school the path of the elders and the Zen tradition which I think you're also somewhat familiar with too yeah but I know a little bit Yeah but still you know enough to be dangerous so um uh so you know even Within These two that I'm familiar with there's a bit of difference because one is a little bit more strictly top down the Zen tradition is very well known for its kind of hierarchicalness where the early Buddhist tradition is a little more hierarchical in that uh even the way that the teacher is framed is not as a teacher or a guru but rather as a spiritual friend uh and so there is that kind of like uh being at the same level now in practice it's not always like that there is a vertical relationship or a one up one down power Dynamic and in in the Buddhist tradition that serves a really important learning function which is that with that Dynamic yes we can focus on all the ways that can go wrong but but if we leave out all the ways it can go right I think that's missing an important piece of the puzzle which is you know if you can if you're skilled guide or teacher and you're working with someone and you see there's something they're missing and they look to you as as an authority on some things maybe not everything right but they see like you've got skill and you earn and you've earn their trust and you they've you've given them advice and they've tried it and it's worked in the past then you can serve as a kind of catalyst in that role of teacher in their spiritual growth and development and and without which people can spend a long time just kind of spinning in circles because they're not getting feedback and don't know that they're doing something off so I would imagine there's corollaries in Dows as well where without good mentorship or leadership you know people may not know that they're spinning in circles or may not have like a Clear Vision to all kind of a line around like a common heuristic that people can get on board with um and one of the functions of a leader or you know traditional business a CEO and I think also spiritual teacher is to hold the vision of what's possible here and to help people align to that vision and to give them those resources they need to succeed um and so without that function that sort of that sort of uh leadership function I've noticed you know things don't really move there's no traction and it's learning isn't really that easy or um it's much harder so I I'd start there see what you did so I mean I think the the what I heard from you is that there's sort of a peer-to-peer relationship um but there's like an information asymmetry where the master knows more than the student in the Dharma um right uh world and you know we would never use the word like master and student in in the dial space but maybe like the OG who has the context the archive node uh versus the person who's being spun up to be the full node of of governance um right even those are like overly technical language but um there's almost like a feedback loop of um interacting with your context that the mentor in both in both worlds can can sort of say like hey without like it can can can not not have a corrective function but like a mentorship type function of like hey with this context which you may be missing you may have reacted to this somewhat differently and it's it's the transmission of that context and how it can be applied in the world that I think over time allows you to sync up to being a full node of of understanding how to interact within the Dow or in your case understand how to act interact with presidents in the world which is the transmission of the Dharma those are the analogs that I sort of draw yeah yeah that's cool and and then in the Dharma context is obviously a lot more restrictive and a lot less open because you know at least in traditional context you know say in the traditional Zen approach before someone would would become a full node and likely only a few people within a large community would would achieve this um you're looking at Decades of training uh with a single teacher so that's like a really super high bar and it obviously is not decentralizing in its movement it's more about preserving or maintaining something through time uh as a strategy versus like kind of Distributing it every aware although there's an interesting example here in modern times this is a little nerdy but I'll just share this and um there's a book called the birth of insight by Eric Braun where he he describes from a scholarly perspective what was happening in Burma uh a country in Southeast Asia whilst the British were colonizing it and part of the impact of British colonization on Burmese Buddhism at the time was that it went from being hyper centralized the knowledge of the texts and the practices in the monastic Community to being something that suddenly they thought might actually be threatened and so very quickly all of these meditation practices started being taught broadly and widely to to the non-monastics and they started teaching texts and stuff and this led to in large part the modern meditation movement so it's actually when that centralized control thing is threatened then we have examples in history in Buddhism where it becomes more decentralized yeah well it was probably multiple analogs uh with what's going on in Dallas um you know the analog that popped to mind for me was just talking about how it takes decades to transmit experience of the Dharma and the the thing that that popped up for me is that so my my anyone who's watching a video can see my eighth node behind me validating blocks um this is actually my fifth eighth note that I've spun up the first two or three um I didn't spec correctly uh so I put in hard drives that were too low in memory that was too slow and because of that it would take Meeks which is a lot of blockchain time um to sync the node and then it couldn't even stay synced with the current transactions because it was writing too much and it was thrashing there's a there's a spec called iops which is input output operations which it didn't have enough of and therefore it couldn't sync um and it it uh it was falling behind and so you know what came to mind for me with with respect to talking about um transferring the Dharma is like is there a way to just like increase the iops on our minds so that we can be more receptive to the Dharma or uh with it within decentralization is there a way to increase the iops of everyone so that they can more quickly uh sync to each other the contacts that they needed in order to be successful uh in in the Dao and and if if everyone gets iops were just super high then what would that world look like in in which we could be transmitting this knowledge to each other and and how much more quickly could we decentralize and maybe that's what inner being protocol is or um you know I don't want to put words in your mouth but but how how could we create an environment in which in which we're all kind of catching the Dharma from each other uh or catching context within a decentralized movement together and in iops is I guess the technical term for that learning velocity that you could have yeah yeah that's interesting I like that um I mean it brings up for me some I mean something that is attention too in the question where for me it does feel like there is something of an inverse relationship between depth and breadth um such that the more breadth you have and the more distributed and decentralized you are also just because a lot of these are organic processes of learning they actually do take time we're not by we're not digital systems um then you know essentially there's a dilution of the depth function by decentralizing organic analog learning um but it's also which is beautiful it opens up access and uh it brings more people into the fold so you don't have to have spent 40 years in a monastery in order to like contribute something or say something useful or build something um and that probably has a net benefit for the Collective and the same token if every like the yoga yoga vacation of yoga is a good example of this and it's happening in the meditation world now too which is like when everyone's doing it how do you know who actually knows this [ __ ] deeply you know how do you know who really gets this stuff Beyond just the first order of conceptualization and they actually are like a living walking breathing embodiment of this stuff um like you know just being around these kind of people is like psychoactive you know and you're like holy [ __ ] like this is what's possible if I really were to take like dedicate my life to this thing um you know I'd use you as one of the examples in the in the Dow space here I know that'll make you uncomfortable but you know there's very few examples right of people that have really been living and walking the stuff from the beginning so um anyway I think that's attention that arises for me and I feel like it's like how do we how do I you know when thinking about projects I'm doing like inner being or this MMORPGs like how to how to balance that like for example uh I think one of the natural developmental things of doing multiplayer meditation is at some point you'd start to naturally want to create your own techniques like you get enough of doing the practice with different things you start to get a sense for what it's about and you want to generate some techniques but like you I don't think it's really wise to have a zero like a Zero Bar of Entry to that like anyone can just right off the bat because it took me 12 years to really understand the practices well enough having done them for thousands of hours on top of tens of thousands of hours of solo meditation beforehand before I felt like I really understood the grammar the underlying syntax of these things now I think because one person understands it more people can understand it quicker but I still think there's got to be a little bit of an on-ramp you know where people are actually having to do the grinding that's necessary for the actual deep understanding to emerge so I you know maybe this is I'm answering my own question here but you know having some kind of uh prerequisites but that you have to hit certain kind of achievements that are objectively you know intersubjectively and objectively obvious like everyone can see okay he put 50 hours of practice into this thing so that must mean he knows at least enough about it to like come up with some new versions or whatever yeah and then is that gatekeeping in a new way but it's like responsible gatekeeping it is it is still gatekeeping it's pushing it up it's like pushing it up though like to another level where it's it's uh but I I don't know of any other way to do things uh if humans are still the one driving it I think the fact that like you're gonna have this inner being protocol that anyone can sort of fork uh uh and submit a stream of PR for their own inner being protocols like at least the ground for that happening is out in the open and decentralized as opposed to within a like a asanga in in which there it might be gate keep kept even even but um yes yeah but you know it kind of reminds me of there's an analog in the dial space David Hoffman from bankless always talks about how we're speed running the history of Finance here so like there's a there's a legacy Financial system that's 120 years old and there's been a lot of lessons that were learned from like the 1920s and the implementation of Securities Law and the digitization digitization of the financial system after World War II and like you know into everything that's happened since then and so like crypto is kind of like speedrunning the history of of Finance because it's permissionless we're learning all the same lessons but just like faster because it's happening digital and networks now and the analog that I'm sort of seeing here with inner being protocol is that you'll probably have a loop between like a priority knowledge and empirical knowledge in which people are speed running and learning some of the history of of the lineages and maybe you know what took 12 you 12 years to to find like someone will submit a like fork and interbeing protocol and they'll [ __ ] it up and they'll submit a PR back but they'll learn it in like hopefully months not years and because it's networked it'll just like it'll just happen faster is the analog for me that comes back there but is that even responsible like the thing the thing that's Pro the problem with speedrunning history of Finance is that there's going to be people who are going to come and they're gonna get like pump and dumped and like dumped on and so like there's a negative externality to that speedrunning of evolution and I guess like the psychoactive uh version of that interview being protocol is like if you go off the beaten course in meditation are you gonna are you gonna mess up your brain by by doing that by being a part of that speedrunning so even having guard rails around that I think is is important too yes I agree and yeah you can mess yourself up both meditation especially if the dose is high enough and that wasn't really widely acknowledged when mindfulness was starting to become popular because okay you know it's like a Panacea but no actually it's not there's well-known challenges and difficulties that arise from serious meditation practice um and there's some unknown and unforeseen potential ones when we're changing the form of it to be more peer-to-peer uh instead of this more top-down kind of approach like there's there's probably a lot of failure modes in that that are also we have to kind of consider I like around reputation and like who's a safe person to like be meditating with uh so that you're not gonna feel like you know someone is just like you know sitting there fantasizing about having sex with you and noting stuff that's inappropriate for instance if if that's not what you're there to do yeah that'll be that'll be an app I'm sure someone will make that but you know uh but you know well um I'm excited about the work that you're doing with inner being protocol I think that um you know I first started following you 12 years ago and and um Buddhist Geeks I think the original statement mission statement was like discovering the emerging face of Buddhism um and I think it's maybe since evolved then but you've always been sort of pressing into the New Frontier of the digital with Buddhist practice which is uh sort of a heretical thing to do uh I think in in many different ways and so I respect that you're such a Pioneer here Vince and can't wait to see what's next remind me what the the Buddhist Geeks latest mission statement was it was evolving Dharma as the purpose of those Geeks yeah okay evolving Dharma um yeah and so um interviewing app and intervening Pro intervening protocol and multiplayer uh meditation is is sort of the results yeah that's right it's it's a it's an actual outcome of that purpose yeah yeah um and I think that you know it I hope to continue the conversation with you I think that there's a lot of parallels between um decentralization of of financial power in the web three space and decentralizing Dharma and and that psychological sovereignty so um can't wait to see what's next and uh now that we've done this episode everyone who DMS me every other week and says what's the latest with songardao I can point them at this episode now something great has evolved out of out of that shelling point that we set set up together yeah great and uh Kevin I don't know if we have time for one for for me to share one last thing here yeah let's do like five more minutes yeah yeah so there's there's one idea that came up when we were talking um about this that I think I want to mention as well I'm sharing it on your screen so you can see it um but it's a basic it's a very simple model that one of my early mentors uh philosopher named Ken Wilbur Who developed what he called integral meta Theory uh it it sort of describes these four dimension of what's emerging or what's happening right now and I think this is a really interesting schema to to apply to this conversation as well uh in terms of how things evolve and how they develop um and I just want to describe it verbally for those that can't see you've got a basic two by two grid and the upper half of the two by two grid describes the individual and the lower half describes the collective then on the left hand side of the grid the two two boxes to the left that describes the interior and the ones to the right the right hand side describes the exterior so you end up having the individual and collect the interior and the exterior of the individual and Collective that gives you these four grids and in very simple terms the upper left the inside of the individual describes subjective first person experience or consciousness the lower left describes intersubjective experience or culture the upper right the exterior of the individual describes like things that are actually observable objectively like bodies and data observable Behavior and the lower right the exterior of the collective describes things that are inter-objective like organizing rules principle laws institutions blockchains things like that networks and so for me I've I've often held this as a really helpful meta schema for understanding how these things work because you know what you're describing that with the world you're in is is it's mostly understood in terms of the exteriors and even more specifically in terms of the inter-objective the lower right quadrant like that's a big part of web 3 is is kind of the obsession with building better networked mechanisms for coordination right um whereas like spiritual experience is all about the the inside experience like the interior of Consciousness and transforming that but what can points out here is that these don't describe different things they describe different dimensions of the same thing so if something actually is going to evolve it has to evolve in all all of these quadrants at once there has to be a correlating Consciousness that goes along with what's happening in the body what's going on with the networks or environment once embedded in what's going on with the culture that you're participating in and I think this is a really helpful model to understand maybe the evolution of Dao's and web 3 too because you know what is what's the real challenge well the challenge is building cultures and building like and building environments where people can kind of get it like they have a realization of why this is important um and not just like about using immutable ledgers it's also about the interior Consciousness change that would enable people to use those things um for for good um and so I just wanted to mention that because I think it's a really helpful model for for understanding um lots of things so you know I think that's maybe another way of answering our question that we started off that original episode with which is how does um how does the work that you're doing which is more Centric in the Dharma space in the work that I'm doing which is a more Centric in technology space like yeah I literally asked what are the iops of of humans when you're decentralizing to them uh is is crossing the boundaries between interceptive and inter-objective um and because we're all networked individuals there's a change of self and a change of system that happens in Tangent when we lean into adjusting our culture and our awareness uh and our institutions all all at the same time is is kind of what I gather back from that yes absolutely like when when you can have things stick in all those levels then you have an enduring structure that emerges that's the basic thesis yeah and I wonder if you know we don't have time to like fully unpack this but you know we there's been a lot of uh sort of conniption about how social media can be toxic and just like the arguing that and we're just on Twitter and um and and I'm wondering if if the if things like that are sort of the result of of like giving us access but not the like teaching people the inner subjective shared values in order to use these systems um that and and so by leaning more into into building the inner subjective and the inner objective and um and all of these things together if we're gonna like what what would a networked Sango look like and how would it differ from the tire fire of arguments I get in on Twitter uh is like what gets really exciting because like us the song that just means like people who come together to to practice together a community of practice and and it's very regenerative culture-wise in my experience yeah having been there like what would a what would it look like to be plugging into my digital Sangha is is kind of how I feel when I get connected to you and the Buddhist Geeks and and the people that are around you then so um I think it could be profound for Humanity if we can figure out how to carve out those little regenerative cultures um together yeah likewise I agree well uh is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say I think we got a few more minutes left I covered it man and I covered it thank you yeah all right well um let's uh let's schedule 12 months out uh I want to hear how I enter uh being protocol is developing uh from here and can't wait to see what you do Vince I think it's so unique and so important for the world and um you're uniquely positioned to do it so um thank you keep up the great work likewise thanks Kevin foreign [Music]
